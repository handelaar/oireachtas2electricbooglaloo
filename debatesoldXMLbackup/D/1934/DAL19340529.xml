      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether he has considered the report of his inspector on the recent inquiry into the discharge of their duties by the Laoighis County Council and whether it is his intention to dissolve the Council.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it a fact that the demand made on behalf of the local ratepayers for this sworn inquiry was for the purpose of investigating certain allegations made against the administration of the board of health and that this inquiry commenced on 10/1/34, was subsequently adjourned on two occasions and concluded nearly three weeks ago?  Has the Minister received any report from his inspector dealing with the serious allegations made against this body or has he even asked for an interim report on the policy issue as to whether a case has been made for the abolition of this board?</P>

      <P>I cannot forecast a decision.  All I can say is that I closely followed the evidence as it was published in the newspapers, and, judging from that, it appears probable that the Council will be dissolved and that the elections will not be held.  I do not, however, want to make any decision in advance.  I have not yet got the report.  I have read only the proceedings as published and I do know that, as Deputy Davin says, the inquiry has been very prolonged.  It was delayed on account of the serious illness of one of the officials chiefly concerned.  The inspector and the auditors responsible were very much delayed in their work by the illness of that official.  Not having the report, but, judging from what I have read, I believe the situation of the Council is such that serious action will have to be taken.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I respectfully suggest to the Minister that he should ask for the production of an interim report dealing with the board of health and would he bear in mind, when considering the matter, whether it is permissible or possible for members of a board of health appointed by a county council, who are found to have acted illegally, in a corrupt manner or contrary to the regulations, to act or remain as members of the parent body?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice whether his attention has been drawn to the statement made before the Naas District Court on Wednesday, 23rd of May, by a Chief <Col N="1883" /> Superintendent of the Gárda Síochána to the effect that police orders were that if arms were produced by the police they were to use them and use them with deadly effect; and if he will state whether the orders referred to are in the nature of general orders to the police in the whole of the Free State; or whether they referred only to the police on duty in Naas on the 13th April; what the terms of the orders are; by whom and under what statutory authority were they issued; to whom were they issued; and what purpose they were intended to serve; and if he will state how many Gárda were on duty at Naas on the 13th April, and the total number and the nature of the arms and the total amount of ammunition in their possession.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Ruttledge)</NameTxt>
      <P>No instructions or orders as to the use of firearms were issued on the occasion in question.  The statement made by the Chief Superintendent was apparently based on his interpretation of a memorandum on the use of firearms by police officers, issued by General O'Duffy in November, 1932, when he was Commissioner of the Gárda Síochána.</P>
      <P>No useful purpose would be served by the giving of the information asked for in the last part of the question.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that in reputable newspapers the report of the Chief Superintendent's evidence states that he used those words, and will the Minister consider whether or not it is a proper interpretation of the instructions?  Will he tell the House what exactly the instructions are, so that the House and the country may be fully aware as to the position in which meetings of this particular kind stand with regard to the police and the use of firearms?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>The furthest I am prepared to go in answer to that question is to say that certain instructions were contained in a memorandum issued by General O'Duffy in 1932, as to when and in what circumstances firearms might or could be used.  The evidence given by the Chief Superintendent was based on his interpretation of that memorandum and the instructions contained in it.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond (for Mr. Anthony)</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that at the end of May a considerable number of unemployed men in Cork have been denied the benefit of the Unemployment Assistance Act, 1933, although having obtained qualification certificates; and if he is further aware that the Superintendent Assistance Officer reporting on the situation with regard to the able-bodied unemployed not in receipt of relief under the new Act has stated that payment of only half assistance in these cases was not sufficient to meet their needs, and if he will state what steps he proposes to take to secure to these unemployed men the benefits of the Unemployment Assistance Act, 1933.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No unemployed man in Cork or elsewhere who is the holder of a qualification certificate has been denied the benefit of the Unemployment Assistance Act if he was able to satisfy the statutory conditions for the receipt of unemployment assistance, and was free from the statutory disqualifications.  These statutory conditions and disqualifications are laid down in Sections 15 and 16 of the Act. Any person whose claim to assistance is disallowed has the right to appeal to the Court of Referees and ultimately to the Umpire to review his case.</P>
      <P>With regard to the second part of the question, I have received no report from the Superintendent Assistance Officer.  I presume that the Cork Board of Public Assistance is in possession of the requisite information and will, in discharge of its responsibility, take whatever action is considered necessary in the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond (for Mr. Anthony)</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that a number <Col N="1887" /> of able-bodied unemployed men in Cork City who applied for certificates under the Unemployment Assistance Act, 1933, as early as last March had not up to the 22nd May received certificates entitling them to assistance under the Act, whilst numbers of applications received a month later have been dealt with and certificates issued; and if he will take steps to ensure that all future applications for certificates will be dealt with in rotation, and if he will state when it is expected that the arrears in connection with applications for qualification certificates will be cleared up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The determination of the question whether or not applicants for qualification certificates fulfil the statutory conditions for the receipt of such certificates involves full examination of all the relevant circumstances of the applicants.  In the case of applicants who possess means within the meaning of Section 13 of the Act the investigation and calculation of the yearly value of such means necessarily take considerable time, but there has been no avoidable delay.  Statutory requirements must, however, be complied with in every case.  Where applicants have no means, the delay necessarily incidental to investigation does not occur and hence it may happen, as the Deputy suggests, that qualification certificates may not be issued in the order of the date of the receipt of the applications, but subject to this circumstance applications are and will continue to be finally dealt with in the order of their date.  The work of dealing with the large number of such applications received is proceeding as rapidly as possible.</P>

      <P>I should like to know from the Minister when the slate quarries in this country will be able to produce sufficient slates to meet the demand.  I do not see that there has been any great improvement in the production of slates here.  There seems to be plenty of room for improvement in the matter of production and, as far as I can see, there has not been any great improvement judging from the number of roofs that we see covered with cement tiles.  I do not know what the value of these tiles may be for roofing purposes as they have not been tested over a sufficiently long period, but I do say that you would have much better and much cheaper houses if slates were allowed to be imported until we are in a position to produce a sufficient quantity to meet <Col N="1892" /> the demand.  Irish industry is not helped very much by the making of concrete tiles.  In the first place, the machines for the making of the tiles are imported and, in the second place, the cement used is either British or Belgian.  The only Irish article used is sand and the work is done by juvenile labour, which the Labour Party talked so much about a few days ago.  In addition to that, the weight of the roofs is very much increased by the use of cement tiles.  A tiled roof is about two and a half times the weight of an ordinary slate roof.  Then the framework has to be provided to carry that extra weight and the timber for that is also imported.  The only benefit derived is from the use of the Irish sand required and the employment of juvenile labour.  Everything else is imported.  The people who erect the houses have to bear the extra cost.  I believe myself that the cement tile roofs are not nearly as good as the slate roofs.  I would, therefore, ask the Minister to take serious notice of the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also another grievance down the country in connection with this matter.  A large number of houses are being built with the aid of Government grants from the Local Government Department, the Gaeltacht Housing Department, the Land Commission and the Board of Works.  In several districts the building of these houses has been held up for want of Irish slates.  Many of them have been lying for months and months without roofs. In some of them the framework has had to be renewed because it was left so long without being covered.  It is most unfair that that condition of things should be allowed to continue. Many poor people who are building houses under these grants and who have spent a fair amount of money on them cannot get the final certificate until the houses are complete.  No one is responsible for that except the Government, as the building work is held up owing to the fact that Irish slates must be used and cannot be procured. Then you have the other side of it.  If you are a supporter of the Fianna Fáil policy you will get a permit to import British slates, but if <Col N="1893" /> you are not a supporter you will not get it.  I know that for a fact.</P>
    <P>There is also another matter to which I should like to call attention.  A large amount of money is being provided here for mineral exploration.  I should like the Minister to inquire into the possibility of reviving an old industry in County Galway which existed up to 20 years ago, namely, the brick industry. When the industry was in existence the bricks were made by hand.  In some buildings erected 50 or 60 years ago with these hand-made bricks the bricks are as good to-day as the day they were put into the buildings.  I learn that there is plenty of clay in the district for the making of the bricks. Fianna Fáil Deputies from the county know that there are quite a number of very small landholders in that district. The average valuation would not be more than £3 or £4.  There is also good clay in the district for the making of the bricks.  I should like if the Minister would inquire into the matter, as bricks were made in that district up to 20 years ago.</P>
    <P>I should also like to know from the Minister what help is being given to the marble quarries in Connemara.  We know that years ago big orders were received by these quarries for marble for building purposes.  Some of them were carried out and some more were not carried out because the capital was not sufficient.  I should like if the Minister would see what can be done to develop those quarries.  There is plenty of marble there which is apparently very valuable.  Marble from these quarries has been used in the building of churches and other large buildings. If the Minister could give some help to develop these quarries it would certainly give great employment in the area as there is plenty of marble there. I should also like to refer to the question of the labour exchanges.</P>

      <P>Dealing with the matter of employment in the beet factories, the President, when he was in Tuam some months ago when the first sod was turned for the beet factory there, stated that an Irish colony would be set up in connection with the factory.  He stated that provision would be made for the employment of a hundred Irish speakers in connection with the factory and that proper housing accommodation would be provided for them.  He said that by having Irish speakers employed there the language would go forward.  There has not been a word since about Irish speakers or the Irish language in connection with the beet factory in Tuam.  The work there has been proceeding since last January and there has not been even an open shed erected for the accommodation of Irish speakers.</P>
      <P>I should like to know whether the President intends to keep his promise or whether that other organisation, the Gaelic League, will be content to sit down and look on at things like that. For the benefit of the Labour Party I might also say that there are 300 men now working there under conditions which should call for inquiry.  We had Deputy Norton complaining recently of the conditions under which juvenile labour is carried on in factories here. The Deputy has a Labour representative down near the Tuam factory and it would be no harm if he paid a visit there to see the conditions under which the labourers work.  Ever since last January these men have no means provided for preparing their meals.  They are asked to work there eight or nine hours a day and they have to provide their own lunch.  After cycling ten or 12 miles to work, the only accommodation provided for them is to sit down on the roadside to eat their lunch.  On the other hand, if we take the case of the men who came from Belgium, first-class provision has been made for them.</P>

I should also like to know how the appointments of gangers and engineers are made and what Board works the scheme.  I have had several complaints, from the district of Ballymoe, in County Galway, as to the manner in which labour is being dealt with.  I have had four or five communications <Col N="1896" /> recently stating that people who belonged to the Fine Gael or Blue Shirt movement, as it is called, will not get employment there.</P>

      <P>What Department deals with it?  Is it Deputy Norton? Whoever is responsible, my complaint is that people who are members of the Fine Gael organisation or of the League of Youth in Ballymoe district are not given employment on the bogs that are being opened up and used by the Government there.  If it is known that a man belongs to Fine Gael he is told to go home.  I can give the names of men with four and five in family, who were sent home because they were members of Fine Gael or the League of Youth.  I shall just refer to one case with particulars of which I have been supplied.  This is the case of a man, a Blueshirt, with a wife and four children, the eldest of whom is seven years old.  He resides in Farm, Ballymoe.  This man was working on relief work on a bog road through his own land.  He had been working for two days on the scheme when he was taken by the ganger, Quinn, to a man in the district, Ryan, a prominent Fianna Fáil leader, who brought him before Mr. Quinn, N.T., Ballymoe. The national teacher asked him if he was a Blueshirt, and on being informed that he was, the national teacher told him that he could not get any further work until he wrote and signed a letter denouncing the League of Youth and stating that he would cease to be a member of the League of Youth and would join the turf scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1897" /> Has the Minister sufficient information as to who is entitled to employment down there?  I should like to know if the Minister agrees that it is the duty of a school teacher to act as a ganger on a scheme like that.  While things like that are happening, we have the Attorney-General telling us to moderate our language when we attend meetings.  Here we have an instance where the school teacher, who should have something more important to do than worrying about the turf scheme, is responsible for a condition of affairs in which members of Fine Gael are refused work.  I hope the Minister will look into these matters and consider the position under which gangers are appointed.  I should like to know whether the men who appoint gangers appoint them because their sole qualification is that they are Fianna Fáil leaders in the district.  I should like the Minister to be clear on the matter and to state once and for all that if a man is a member of the Fine Gael or Blue Shirt organisation he will not get work on the various public works in the country.  It would be more honest to state the position quite plainly.  We shall then know where we are and what to do.  The position at present is that the Minister gets up in this House and states that everybody in need of employment will get it but, here, you have gentlemen going around the country who refuse employment to anybody connected with the Opposition Party.  I have given only one instance of it, but we have the same thing happening in several places.</P>

      <P>I appreciate Deputy Brodrick's sense of righteousness in this matter of employment.  I appreciate it at its true value, but I am sorry that it was dormant for about ten years.  I am also sorry that the state of affairs which he has outlined is not true.  It should be true, if the balance is to be corrected, because for ten years in the part of County Galway which I know, a man who was not a rabid supporter of Cumann na nGaedheal had not a chance of getting the meanest manual labour under the Cumann na nGaedheal régime.  I could cite a note out of this year's appropriation accounts in the report from the Comptroller and Auditor-General, regarding a glaring instance of jobbery. They always picked out the factotum of Cumann na nGaedheal in a particular area, and they placed every conceivable job under his control.  Down to the very meanest job they made sure that the man who got it would be a man of the right colour.  That was notorious in Connemara.  Deputy Brodrick has cited an instance, but I could come along and cite instances where, even since Fianna Fáil came into power, a member of Cumann na nGaedheal got a preference in an appointment as ganger to which he was not entitled. Such appointments have now to go through the ordinary channel, and the men have to be registered in the exchanges.  As far as my acquaintance with the routine goes, a case has to be made.  I gave a recommendation and it was sent from the labour exchange to the county surveyor, who is the official who has most to do with the appointments.  Deputy Brodrick has as much influence in the matter as any member of the Fianna Fáil Party.  A good deal of what the Deputy has said is &ldquo;all moonshine.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Rice</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other Deputies on this side of the House, I looked forward with considerable interest to hearing the statement of the Minister last week, because I thought he would have given us some little assistance to understand what the present industrial position is in this country.  We know pretty well what it is, but we wanted to hear what the Minister had to say <Col N="1899" /> about it.  In his opening remarks he told us that there was an increase in the Estimate under two headings that he specified; increased Government employment in certain Departments, by reason of Government policy, and increased expenditure owing to the administration of the Unemployment Assistance Act.  These are the two main lines in which he pointed out increased expenditure, so that apparently the principal industry the Minister has set up since he took up office has been the creation of new Government jobs.  One had hoped that some explanation might be forthcoming as to what is being done to counteract the position shown in the last issue of Trades Statistics from the Minister's Department.  The last issue appeared recently, for the month of March last. We find from that, to take a general figure, which points a moral to all, that the fall in the total trade of this country in two years, since this Government took office, has been from £85,000,000 to £56,000,000.  I observe that the Minister is taking an interest in this matter, so I will refer him to the actual figures.  The total trade for the year 1931 was £85,737,608, and for 1933, £56,533,257.  That represents a fall in actual trade during that period of more than one-third of the total trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After being told by the Minister's Party, and by his supporters on many occasions recently, that the main cause of the fall in our agricultural exports was due to the fact that the British people were too poor to buy them, we see by statistics published in to-day's newspaper that there is a constant and steady decrease in unemployment in Great Britain.  I had hoped that the Minister would have given some particulars as to the employment he had created.  Everybody, even the children in the streets, knows the actual figures as to the number of people who were to be put into new employment by reason of the policy of that Party when they got into office&mdash;84,601.  The Minister told us in his statement last week that, owing to the new policy of the Government and the efforts they have made to create employment, 20,000 <Col N="1900" /> people have been put into employment during that period&mdash;not 84,000.  But he conveniently omitted to tell us how many people had been put out of employment during the same period.  As we know, he found about 30,000 odd people unemployed when he came into office, and he told us, in that plausible manner at which he is so good, a year afterwards, that these figures were all wrong, because the people knew that they had no chance of getting employment from the previous Government and had not taken the trouble to register. Apparently, they took the trouble to register when the new sun dawned, because the unemployment figures increased, and in the second year of a Fianna Fáil Government they had more than doubled what they were when they took office, so that that slackness on the part of people looking for work was evidently cured after two years.  At the end of second year of this Government we find the figure averaging about 100,000 unemployed.</P>
    <P>Of course, that is taking no account at all of the enormous number of people in agricultural pursuits who have been put out of employment by the policy of this Government during that period.  If 20,000 people were put into new employment, we have an increase of 70,000 who have gone out, an increase which no one can estimate, of people who do not register for employment, of numbers of people on the land who have been put out of employment. We have no account either of the diminution in wages received by the working people on the land during that period.  I am referring to people who have not yet lost their employment on the land, but whose wages have been reduced, owing to conditions brought about by the Minister and his Government. I am glad to see that the Labour Deputies are amused.  It was pointed out by Deputy Belton last week that the Labour Party in this House does not represent the industrial workers of this country at all.  Not a single one of them represents an industrial constituency.</P>

      <P>Deputy Norton, the Leader of the Labour Party, last week, at all events, while he is prepared to act the part of Sancho Panza to the President in political diatribes, is not prepared to mount his humble animal and to follow the Minister for Industry and Commerce, because he indulged in what might be called a bitter attack on the policy of the Minister.  I have not got a copy of the Official Debates yet, but I have an accurate report of some things the Deputy said.  He told us last week that at present almost anything anywhere could be a factory. A factory could be started, he said, in a kitchen, 15 feet under ground; it could be in a loft; it could be in a back-yard.  It did not matter whether the rain came in from four sides, whether there was no ventilation at all <Col N="1902" /> or no heat&mdash;under the present Act anything could be a factory.  He went on to say that if they were going to have 300 or 400 factories, and more, then at this stage he thought an effort should be made to introduce factory and workshop legislation before vested interests were established.  The Deputy was referring to the furniture trade at the time.  He said that many old firms in the city were employing mostly male adult labour at trade union rates, and these old firms were being undermined in the open market by certain people that came from places like Whitechapel, started in back lanes with a few young people, sticking together pieces of wood, daubing them over with something they called varnish, and that was what they then put on the market in competition with the old firms.</P>
      <P>He emphasised that in the furniture industry a collection of sweat shops have grown up, employing young children at low wages.  The Minister interrupted him and said that that was done with the connivance of the trade unions.  Deputy Norton denied that, and I think the House will accept Deputy Norton's denial of that statement. Something like 20,000 people&mdash; a rough estimate, as the Minister was careful to tell us, was made&mdash;have been put into new employment since the Fianna Fáil Government came into office.  Does that number, I wonder, comprise all the children who are being sweated in the under-ground factories? Probably it does.  There are Deputies on this side of the House who have been visited by unfortunate people who are getting 6/- or 7/- a week in these factories, but who make it a point that it is not to be mentioned in the House, that they are not to be identified, because they will be thrown out of that miserable employment if they are known to have been complaining. These are the new industrial conditions that the Minister has produced for us.</P>

      <P>If these evils had been in existence they would have been very quickly dealt with.

Last week Deputy Norton said&mdash;and let the Minister contradict it if he is able&mdash;that he brought these facts under the Minister's notice a considerable time ago, but nothing has been done to remedy these evil conditions.  The people who complain to us make it a condition that their cases will not be mentioned, because if they were mentioned they would probably lose even that wretched employment.  We have foreign employers coming here and sweating the children of this State.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister say there is no foundation for the statement made here last week by Deputy Norton?  Is that the attitude of the Minister?  I read certain information out to him a minute ago about under-ground factories, miserable wages and working hours from 48 to 60 per week for people getting only a few shillings. Does the Minister say that Deputy Norton invented these things?</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Rice Mr. Rice">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Rice Mr. Rice">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rice</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister appears to be very innocent about them.  Perhaps if the Minister would speed up the work of producing the industrial directory that he promised long ago, he would <Col N="1905" /> find out very easily where these places exist.  Deputy Mulcahy pointed out last week that for 15 months the Minister has been promising an industrial directory, but we have not got it yet.  I do not think we are likely to get it either.  If ever we do get it, it will probably not contain the part of Hamlet; perhaps it will not disclose these ugly and unpleasant facts that were spoken about by Deputy Norton. It is an amazing attitude for a Minister to take up, a Minister who is responsible for trade and industry, for the proper control of factories and for seeing that the laws are observed as to the conditions under which people are employed, to say to us: &ldquo;Give me some particulars as to where these places are.&rdquo;  The Minister knows perfectly well where these places are. He has 11 inspectors going round, and it is quite incredible to me and, I am sure, to every member of the House who does not want to close his eyes to facts, that the Minister is not aware of conditions which the ordinary man in the street in Dublin knows all about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Getting away from these unpleasant subjects, the Minister said last week that his Government were exploring the possibilities of opening trade with other countries and he said the prospects were by no means pessimistic with regard to certain lines of goods. I congratulate the Minister on being able to manufacture a pleasant euphemism.  The prospects, he said, were by no means pessimistic.  I would rather take the word of the President &mdash;and he did not contradict it&mdash;when he told us that the prospects of getting these foreign markets were&mdash;I cannot remember the phrase he used&mdash; not so bright; that they were, in fact, non-existent.  That was the substance of his statement.  Of course, the Minister has spread a smoke cloud around all his activities since he took up office.  He tells us, with a considerable amount of rhodomontade, of the enormous improvement in the conditions of this country.  But the people who live in the country have a very different story to tell.  It is no good telling the House that conditions are improving when you have starting you in the face the figures I have read <Col N="1906" /> out already as to the alarming decline in the trade of the country in the two completed years since the present Government took office.</P>
    <P>We were told by the Minister a considerable time ago, last September, in fact, about the number of industries established.  He said the job of the Government had been completed.  If that is so, one can only say &ldquo;God help this country and its future,&rdquo; because looking at these figures, anybody who has any regard for the future of the country can feel nothing but utter despair as to where the country is heading.  Deputy Davin, last week, complained about a matter raised by Deputy Brodrick here to-day, as to the condition of unemployment in the country, and the system of preference being given to the supporters of one political party.  One would hope, in all decency, that no distinction as regards the expenditure of public money would be made as to persons belonging to different political parties.</P>
    <P>I am perfectly well aware that when the Cumann na nGaedheal Government was in office complaints were made by people in the country, that the supporters of that Government did not get their fair share of the work because there was more patronage given to supporters of Fianna Fáil than to supporters of Cumann na nGaedheal.  The truth of the matter, of course, was that no distinction was made, because they did not adopt the view of people behind the present Minister who state that the picture painted by Deputy Brodrick was as it should be, that is, that no work should be given to anybody except supporters of Fianna Fáil.  The Deputy who said that is an honest Deputy, because he told us plainly what is the policy of the Government.  Deputy Davin complained last week about this unfair preference being given to Fianna Fáil supporters.  Even Labour has to complain of this.  But Labour is in a better position than our people are, because, if there is no Fianna Fáil candidate for the job Labour will get it, but the supporters of the Fine Gael Party are excluded every time.  I should like to know whether <Col N="1907" /> the Minister has made any inquiry about this matter.  Has he received any complaint with regard to the subsidised work at Thurles, to the effect that not a single person who is not a supporter of Fianna Fáil is given any employment on this State subsidised work.</P>

But it is a remarkable fact that employers carrying on this kind of work, even when they are supporters of the Opposition, seem, for some occult reason, only able to employ supporters of Fianna Fáil.</P>

That is another of the industries that is going to set this country on its feet and to put a limit to the state of affairs set out in unemployment statistics.  I hope the Minister, in some of his less busy hours, will take an opportunity of investigating some of the complaints made by Deputy Norton last week.  I hope he will investigate the complaints made that half-grown children were <Col N="1908" /> employed in Dublin at 6/- and 7/- a week and were kept working under insanitary conditions, some for 48 hours per week and some for more.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>We will not bury them yet; they are too useful.  I listened patiently to what has been said in this debate.  I wanted to hear more about Deputy Norton's oration and the Deputy who has just spoken had a good opportunity of telling us more about it.  But Deputy Norton has got great publicity for his speech.  The <i>Irish Times</i> set it out in great detail. I brought that speech with me here to-day for the purpose of producing it. The <i>Irish Times</i> has the best report of Deputy Norton's speech because I looked at the other two papers and compared them.  It is not only the best report but it is set out, I am almost certain, verbatim.  I say that because I was listening to him intently.  He started by complaining that the Minister had not, in his earlier statement, about the working of his Department, mentioned anything about social reform in any shape or form.  He then went on to say that there was a crying need for factory and workships legislation in the Free State; and continued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;At present almost anything anywhere <Col N="1909" /> could be a factory.  A factory could be started in a kitchen fifteen feet underground; it could be in a loft; it could be in a backyard.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I see Deputy Rice is leaving the House.  That always occurs; they clear out after they make their speeches. They will find their speeches in the Official Report, and they can produce them to their constituents, and that is all that troubles them.  They never remain here to hear what is said in reply.  The <i>Irish Times</i> gives Deputy Norton as saying, in regard to the furniture industry:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Everybody knew that the position in the furniture business was a scandal in Dublin.  Many old firms in the city were employing mostly male adult labour, at trade union rates, and these old firms were being undermined in the open market by certain people that came from places like Whitechapel, started in back lanes with a few young people sticking together pieces of wood, daubing them over with something they called varnish, and that was what they then put on the market in competition with old firms.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Mr. Mulcahy: And getting the Irish trade mark.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Mr. Norton said</P>
    <P>&ldquo;that the new organisation&mdash;the Federation of Irish Manufacturers&mdash; between whom and the Minister there was a liaison officer, could without hesitation tell the Minister that in the furniture industry a collection of sweat shops had grown up, employing young children at low wages.  They had no use for any industry which could not pay decent wages to their workers in decent conditions, and many of these places were carried on in a manner that would not be tolerated even in Eastern countries....  The Minister knows that is not true and some of the trades unions in his own constituency will tell him so.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton made that remark because the Minister interrupted with a statement &ldquo;with the connivance of the trade unions&rdquo; and Deputy Norton went on to say that:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Many of them had asked the Minister to investigate the matter, <Col N="1910" /> and his own Department is chock full of complaints about places of that kind.  These places (continued Mr. Norton) were undermining decent rates of wages and were a menace to well-established firms who pay trade union rates.  They knew too that there had been a most cruel and inhuman exploitation of child labour in the City of Dublin.  Well-educated girls who could not get employment in clerical work were forced to go into these new factories, many of them employed at diabolically low wages, for 48 and 50 hours a week for a few shillings&mdash;it was an absolute scandal.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Mr. Lemass: Probably against the law.  Why does not the Deputy supply the necessary information himself.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Mr. Norton: I gave the Minister the necessary information in my motion in this House eighteen months ago.  The Minister knows perfectly well the abuses that obtain. Let him ask one of his eleven inspectors to investigate the conditions, say, in the packing industry.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Mr. Lemass: They have been set up under the Trades Boards Act, and if employees are not properly paid their employers are liable to prosecution.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Mr. Norton: The wages are scandalously low.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Mr. Lemass: They are the rates that the trades unions agreed to.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Mr. Norton: No, nothing of the kind.  The Chairman of the Trades Board (Councillor T. Kelly) who is here behind me agreed to it.  It is the chairman that fixes the rates, not the trade unions because the trades unions only accept the Trades Boards as a desperate remedy for a desperate disease.  The Chairman behind me knows that the trades unions, if they could, would not touch the Trades Board with a forty-foot pole.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I will read no more.  Evidently I am a bad doctor if I cannot help to cure all these terrible diseases.  Naturally, as a representative of the City of Dublin for a long period I was more or less indignant at this statement. I was reminded by Deputy Norton's <Col N="1911" /> reference to Eastern countries&mdash;it is a long time ago, about, I think, the first year of this century&mdash;that in my capacity as a member of the Dublin Corporation I had to direct the City Council's attention to a very serious statement concerning Dublin which was published in the current edition of the <i>Encyclopaedia Britannica.</i>  As that particular work circulates amongst people who count in various countries and in various cities I thought it right to draw the Council's attention to the statement in order that, if possible, some action should be taken to have it rectified.  At any rate, the statement referred to the moral condition of Dublin, and said that the conditions there were so intolerable and so wretched that they could only be equalled in the lesser known cities and towns of Asia.  That was a dreadful statement to make.  Of course, it was not true.  These people never care whether their statements are true or not, but at any rate, the City Council could not be held responsible as the control of public morals was then, and still is, in the hands of the police.  In subsequent editions of that book these statements were taken out.  Here in this Dáil, and only as late as Thursday last, we have had Dublin likened again to Eastern countries.  The first thing I did was to communicate with the sanitary Department of the Dublin Corporation. I wrote on Saturday last to the superintendent of the sanitary staff.  My letter was to the effect that I wanted to know if the staff could ascertain if factories or workshops were established in basements, in kitchens, in stables, in outhouses, in lofts and other places in the city which would escape the attention or the vigilance of the ordinary factory inspectors, if those places were allowed to exist and to employ people under intolerable conditions.  To that I received a reply which I will read. It is from the City Manager.  It is a report made by the responsible officers to the City Manager.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The 28th May.  Are you <Col N="1912" /> satisfied, or would you like to see it? It reads: <i>Re</i> attached communication from Councillor T. Kelly, T.D.:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We, the undersigned, beg to report that it is obligatory on the sanitary inspectors to keep records of the bakeries, factories, workshops, work-places and out-workers' residences on their districts.  Supervision of same is detailed in their duties. Where cleansing is needed, repairs required, the provision of separate, ventilated and sufficient sanitary accommodation or overcrowding has to be regarded, action is taken. Through co-operation with the inspectors of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, and upon their reports, improvements are effected.  Cases have arisen where workers have been summarily dismissed through attempted enforcement of the sanitary regulations governing factories and workshops.  The sanitary staff duly note work-places in what were basement dwellings, but are no longer used for purposes of human habitation.  These apartments are of a character where one or a couple of workers may suitably pursue occupations such as boot repairing, furniture making, etc.  It is a fact that industrial developments are ensuing through recent legislation.  Various types of employment are being created and premises not originally intended for these avocations are being acquired and hurriedly adapted.  These are merely multiplications of workshops, etc., which existed under the former British Government.  It is the practice, even where prosecutions have to be instituted, to ensure that there is a compliance with the law.  Approximately 2,405 of the premises under review have to be kept under regular observation.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is to say that 2,405 factories and workshops are constantly under supervision by the sanitary staff.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The school leaving age is 14 after the end of the school term.  Mr. Kelly's communication has been submitted to the chief inspectors in the Ministry and Industry Department for their consideration.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accidentally met one of the superintendents <Col N="1913" /> to-day and I said to him, in connection with the report that I have read, would it be possible for young girls or young boys to be employed in these basements in connection with boot repairing or furniture making? He said: &ldquo;It is not possible.  Wherever we found that so we had it stopped at once, necessitating as it did the dismissal of any young person right away.&rdquo;  But they have never discovered any young girls being employed in any capacity in basements, workshops or factories which were unfit for their continuance as work places.  Every time they discovered anything of the kind the place had either to be renovated thoroughly or else these young people had to cease working there.  That shows that there has been actual and constant supervision of all these places. All the reports made by the sanitary staff are submitted to inspectors who act under the Minister's direction.</P>
    <P>Now, I come to further complaints regarding the Trade Boards.  I am chairman of seven of them.  These embrace aerated waters, brush and broom workers, linen and cotton embroidery, shirt-making, sugar confectionery and food preserving, tailoring and tobacco Trade Boards.  You will notice that there is no Trade Board in connection with the furniture trade or the packing trade, about which complaints were made by Deputy Norton.  In all these Trade Boards the major question discussed is the question, naturally, of wages.  Trade Boards are composed of equal representatives of employers and employees.  The employees who are on these Trade Boards are representative of the various trades, and are selected and sent there by their trade unions.</P>
    <P>I have never yet found any difficulty or ever heard the smallest possible statement made with regard to any antagonism to these particular members of the Boards. Every case was actually discussed in calmness and peace and all questions at variance or any difficulties that existed were discussed in the right atmosphere.  Only on two occasions has it been necessary for me to use my casting vote in connection with the wages paid and on both these occasions I gave my casting vote against <Col N="1914" /> any reduction in wages.  That was because I do not believe, and I never did believe, that it was a sound economic proposition to reduce wages in any trade.  I agree entirely with Deputy Norton that a trade that does not pay decent living wages is no good to any country.  That was why on the only two occasions on which I had to exercise my casting vote I gave it against reduction of wages.  My vote will always be given, as long as I occupy the position I hold, against any reduction in wages.  In one or two instances a good case was made for a reduction in working expenses, when it was shown that trade was not as good as one would wish it to be.  Nevertheless, it was pointed out that it was not good economy to reduce the workers' wages.  Agreement was reached.</P>
    <P>In the furniture trade there is no Trade Board established and neither has there been any Trade Board established in the case of the packing trade. Deputy Norton referred to both of these on Thursday last.  Here is a Trade Board minute:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In the case of one of the trades, the Board unanimously decided to specifically investigate the alleged exploitation of juvenile workers, and, after some disagreement as to the actual measures necessary, eventually agreed regarding the formal proposals to be made to prevent such exploitation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That note does not apply to Dublin nor to any of the trades connected with Dublin on the Trade Boards.  Unfortunately, it applies to one of the trades that is fairly extensive in one of the northern counties.</P>
    <P>In the case of another Trade Board:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Board unanimously decided, on three successive occasions, to fix the actual rates now in operation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The next note I have is:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The workers in each trade concerned (except one, in which only unorganised home workers are employed) are represented on the Trade Board by representatives nominated for that purpose by trades unions concerned.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>A further note says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Before a minimum rate can be fixed or varied by the Trade Board <Col N="1915" /> concerned, the Board must issue to each employer in the trade a notice indicating the rate which the Board propose to fix or the variation which they propose to make in an existing rate.  Each employer to whom such notice of proposal, which is printed in poster form, issues, is required under penalty to post the notice up in a prominent position in his factory or workshop so that its contents may be ascertainable by his workers.  A period of two months is allowed for lodging objections against the proposals before the Board determines whether the proposed rate shall be fixed or the proposed variation shall be made, and the Board is legally required to consider any objections lodged before arriving at their decision to fix or vary.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>A further note says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;No Trade Board has as yet been established for either the packing trade or the furniture manufacturing trade.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In one trade constant attention is given to the question of juvenile workers. That is especially so in the case of the sugar confectionery and food preserving. In that particular trade very great care is taken that the smallest percentage possible that can be allowed of girl workers is allowed.</P>
    <P>I do not think that I need take up any further the time of the House in dealing with this matter.  I am sorry that Deputy Norton made the case in such strong language, because I humbly submit such language was not justified by the facts.  It is well-known in Dublin that a large number of people are now either actually taking small workshops&mdash;we can call them factory shops&mdash;and many more are looking for sites for these, because of the anxiety to increase industry here, more especially since the Minister's programme has become thoroughly well-known amongst the people, and that we have to become what we were not in the past, an industrial city.</P>
    <P>Dublin up to this was, I might say, the great distributing city for all Ireland.  It was the city from which foreign goods were distributed.  Commercial travellers and representatives <Col N="1916" /> of foreign firms were all over the place. Now, owing to the constructive policy of the present Government, we are beginning to make these goods here and, naturally, the people who are thinking of going into the manufacture of these goods are looking around for any sort of place in the beginning in order to make a start.  That sort of thing is to be allowed, but there are no such conditions existing in this city as one would imagine from the statements and the speeches made by Deputies on the Opposition.  One Deputy on the Opposition was challenged a half a dozen times by the Minister and by Deputy Donnelly to &ldquo;name one place,&rdquo; but his reply was &ldquo;Oh, we have Deputy Norton's statement that he gave the information.&rdquo; But Deputy Norton said he gave that information 18 months ago.  Now, the information he gave was, I suppose, acted upon.  You may take it from me, as a representative of the Dublin Corporation, that we would not allow that state of affairs to exist for five minutes.  You may take it from me that our investigations are exhaustive and that there is not a lane nor alley that has not been examined from time to time.  We in the Dublin Corporation do our job well.</P>
    <P>If there are scandals in connection with workshops it was just as well that the matter was brought up.  We will ask the Minister to make a more exhaustive investigation.  He is just the man for the job.  I believe wholeheartedly in him.  If he does find scandals he will deal with them.  I will say nothing more about the Minister&mdash;he is able to box his own corner&mdash; but I do not like statements being made for which there is no foundation. Perhaps Deputy Norton is not altogether responsible.  It was, no doubt, his enthusiasm for his work, and probably people are telling him things that when investigated will be found to have no substance.  I know the Deputy was only doing what he believed to be his duty.  Nevertheless, he should have moderated his language. I do not believe he should bring me at all into the matter.  He did not actually mention my name. He said &ldquo;he is sitting behind me.&rdquo;<Col N="1917" /> That is all he said.  But, with the usual political propaganda, the newspapers stuck my name into it and then they said &ldquo;we will get Fianna Fáil into it.  We have them.  Here we have reports from Dublin City.&rdquo; Deputy Kelly never said a word that day, he never opened his lips, but his name is in here all right as &ldquo;the man behind me.&rdquo;  I am sorry Deputy Norton is not here to-day.  I would not like to say a word about him because I know he is a man who is anxious to do his job.  If some of these things were true I should like to see them put down.  Deputies here may take it from me that every care and attention will be given in this city to protect child labour from being exploited.  Unfortunately, the impoverished condition of our people compels them to send their children out to work at a very tender age, if they can get work at all.  One of the difficulties of the Minister's job was referred to by Deputy Good the other day.  He asked what was to become of the young people who leave school when they come to 14 years of age. Their employment under sweated conditions is not possible; the Labour Party would denounce that state of affairs.  What is to become of these young people?  Are they to walk the streets and do nothing?  That is all the more reason for enthusiastic support of the Minister's policy for encouraging industry here in every shape and form.  So long as this industry is going to pay a decent wage and the conditions are as they should be, I am sure we all wish this policy success.</P>
    <P>I have occupied the House now for 25 minutes and I think that that is quite long enough.  I hope I have made a case in answer to the statements made in this House.  I know that I shall not get the publicity that Deputy Norton got, but the Minister will get it for his reply.  If I have not said sufficient or if I have left anything out, I am perfectly sure the Minister will supply the deficiency when replying to his critics.  I have done my part in this job anyhow.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>We, on this side of the House, may be forgiven for feeling <Col N="1918" /> a little perplexed at the exchange of compliments that has been taking place on this Vote between the members of the Fianna Fáil Party and the members of the Labour Party. About the time of the merger, which brought into existence the United Ireland Party, it was triumphantly announced by the Labour leaders that they had arranged to resume the constant conferences with the Government which had been such a happy feature of the early days after Fianna Fáil had come into office.  One would naturally have supposed that, if conferences such as these had been going on regularly, matters of complaint like those ventilated in the House a few days ago by Deputy Norton would have been raised, thoroughly examined, and dealt with in private.  One cannot help asking, &ldquo;Why was not that done?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>If the Labour Party is exercising any useful influence at all upon Government policy, ought it not to be in just such directions that it should be exercising it?  Or can it be that it only cares about such matters when they enable its leaders to come and play politics in this House?  It is an unpleasant suspicion, but it is a suspicion that is natural in the circumstances of the case.  Deputy Norton's speech has created a great deal of attention.  If the statements in it were true, it deserved to create a great deal of attention. If the statements in it were true, they were matters which should have been impressed upon the Government long before in these numerous conferences and not merely raised&mdash;I think this was stated by Deputy Norton&mdash;in a speech in this House 18 months ago. They should have been the subject of constant pressure.  If there is substance in what Deputy Norton says, the Labour Party are very much to blame for not having exerted themselves more effectually in private in their conferences with the Government with a view to getting the position rectified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Kelly remarked that the best report of what took place the other day on this Estimate was contained in the <i>Irish Times.</i>  That puts it into my head to observe that it is really very inconvenient, in dealing with an Estimate <Col N="1919" /> such as this Estimate for the Department of Industry and Commerce, that we have not got the official records of the House available to-day to enable us to see what was said on that occasion.  In the first place, it is not possible for everybody to be present throughout such debates.  In the second place, if one is present, it is not possible to remember a long and detailed statement such as was made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce. I cannot help thinking that means should be found to make reports of such importance available.  As Deputy Kelly found out, the debate on this particular Vote was back-paged by the official organ of the Government. The Deputy did not find there as full a description of what occurred as he expected to find, for the reason that the official organ of the Government did not like the attack by Deputy Norton and, consequently, smuggled the whole thing as far out of sight as it decently could.  I was present during the greater part of the Minister's speech and I do not recollect his telling us anything to speak of about the Prices Commission which was set up for the purpose of preventing profiteering.  If he did, I must apologise. I do not recollect hearing him on that subject.  Though I read at least one of the newspaper reports, I certainly did not read anything worth talking about on that subject.  When the Prices Commission was decided upon, I remember Deputy Dillon prophesying that it would have no effect whatever, except to provide a certain number of jobs.  So far as the public can see, it seems as if Deputy Dillon might have been justified in that prophecy.</P>

      <P>At any rate, we have a Prices Commission in existence and a certain number of civil servants have been allocated to it.  The State incurs at all events the expense that men are taken away from other work and are occupied on that work.  If anything has been done to prevent profiteering, if anything has been done to diminish the discrepancy that exists between what the primary producer gets and what the consumer has to pay, I think that it would be interesting for this House to hear more about it than it has heard.  Possibly, the Minister will find time to say something on the subject in his reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I notice that the customary confusion of policy with regard to our relations with foreign countries and the Commonwealth is reflected once again in the Vote for Industry and Commerce.  Although the items to which I refer are very small, they are amusingly significant.  On the one hand, we have increased our subscription to the International Commission for Air Navigation from £40 to £300&mdash; because, presumably, our national dignity demanded that we should not just join in one subscription to the British Commonwealth but, as I understood from the Minister, that we should have the honour and dignity of <Col N="1921" /> contributing separately, and accordingly, that the taxpayers should have to pay that £260 extra&mdash;while, on the other hand, we have an increase in the contribution to the Imperial Economic Committee and to the Imperial Shipping Committee.  So that, we are spending more money on Imperial cooperation at the very same time that we are spending more money in order to have a separate subscription to the International Commission for Air Navigation.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us that he was rather hopeful of achieving something worth while with regard to the expansion of foreign markets.  Naturally, we have heard rumours of that sort so often that we cannot help feeling sceptical about such a statement. Nevertheless, I never believe in decrying something until it is absolutely produced for my inspection. Accordingly, I await with interest further facts from the Minister as to what has been accomplished, or what is being attempted, with regard to expanding the markets for our export trade.  In that connection, I should like to know whether regard is being had to anything except our actual trade interests, or whether political considerations are being allowed to creep in in determining the particular countries with which we should endeavour to establish better trade relations than with others.  I have seen a rumour in the papers, within the last few days, that something particular is contemplated by way of a new trade agreement with Germany.  While I should be very glad to see anything in the way of increasing our trade opportunities with any country, I should like to know whether this agreement with Germany, if it is in fact about to be made, as something that we could not have secured with other Continental countries&mdash;in other words, whether Germany had more to offer us than, say, Belgium, France, or any other country.  If Germany had not more to offer us, and if we are giving advantages to Germany that other Continental countries would have been glad to have, I should like to know why Germany has been selected in preference to, say, France or Belgium.  I am <Col N="1922" /> making no insinuations on the subject, because, quite frankly, I am ignorant of what has been going on or what is being done.  I am merely making inquiries without desiring to make any accusations at all.</P>
    <P>A really adequate debate on the Department of Industry and Commerce would take in almost the whole field of Government policy.  It would take in such very large questions as the desirability of whole-hogging protection, the desirability of aiming at self-sufficiency, the desirability of the economic war&mdash;even the desirability of capitalism.  I do not propose, however, to ask the House to embark on a discussion of that kind, but I think that, perhaps, it is worth while making one or two quite bare remarks about some of these fundamentals on an occasion such as this.  Deputy Kelly seems to think that every right-thinking man must perceive that it is his duty to support the policy of the Minister in causing everything that can be produced in this country to be produced here.  Now, I do not agree with that proposition at all.  I do not propose to go into detail about it, but merely to say that if high protective barriers were really a cure for unemployment and really produced what the Minister for Industry and Commerce calls a storm-proof economic system, there is hardly a country in the entire world that would not have escaped the economic difficulties and the economic storms that, in fact, they have had to-endure during the last three, four or five years.  The factor in the situation that Deputies such as Deputy Kelly will insist on leaving out of account is the buying power of the community, and that aspect of the general Government policy which is reducing the buying power of the community and which makes it even less effective than it would naturally be&mdash;that policy of high and indiscriminating protection which, on the whole, has done so little for the nations of the world.</P>
    <P>I should like Deputy Kelly and other Deputies to realise that when we cast doubts upon a policy of high and indiscriminating protection, it is not because we are merely anxious, at all costs, to find fault with what the Government is <Col N="1923" /> doing.  The Government have not made a new and epoch-making discovery in discovering the policy of high protection.  It is true that it is something that we have not had here in this country since the days of Grattan's Parliament, but we have had it elsewhere, and I suggest that we are perfectly entitled to look at what has happened elsewhere and to draw the appropriate inferences from what has happened elsewhere.  I said already that the debate on the Vote for Industry and Commerce is an occasion where I might also talk about such a subject as Capitalism.  I certainly do not propose to go into a disquisition on Capitalism, but it may be remembered that when the Government first came into office they said that their policy would be to encourage individual enterprise for the purpose of getting industries started all over the country. Apart from their general disastrous policy of bad relations with England, and of the economic war, and of the political unsettlement created by their imitation Republicanism, I think that, on the whole, the Government are justified in claiming that their attitude towards individuals who have saved money and who wished to employ it for the benefit of the community has been encouraging and benevolent.  But, at the same time, it should not be forgotten that they shut their eyes to a great deal of speechmaking, not merely by some allies in the ranks of the Labour Party, but even some of the orations of some of their supporters in the country, and back benchers, which took a line that would be definitely discouraging and alarming to anybody who wanted to take a chance, either from patriotic motives or even from motives of pure gain, and get some industry or other started or enlarged in this country, and I think that the Government should make more attempts than they do from time to time to keep their supporters' minds clearer as to what Government policy really is, and to make it plain that the Government are not aiming, if they are not aiming, at gradually guiding this country away from a policy of individual enterprise into a policy of State <Col N="1924" /> Socialism or something bordering upon Communism.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFlynn" hpid="Mr. J. Flynn Mr. J. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>There are one or two points to which I should like to direct the attention of the Minister.  In regard to the matter of peat development, one important factor which concerns our county or, at least, portions of our county, is the acquiring of turbary.  Large tracts of turbary are still in the possession, in one instance, of the landlord or his agents and, in another, of the Land Commission in these areas.  The co-operative turf societies are doing good work, but they are handicapped by the fact that this turbary is undivided, and I should like the Minister to take steps to expedite the acquiring of the turbary in the areas referred to.  With regard to the societies, there is the important factor of transport.  The societies are up against this problem in relation to the proper development of turf, because they cannot gain access to the different centres, and I would suggest, if it is possible, that the Minister should provide some system whereby loans would be made available to the co-operative societies for the purchase of lorries and other modes of conveyance. It is an urgent matter and it is an admitted fact that if such facilities were made available, the co-operative societies would benefit and the people, as a whole, would benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the points raised in connection with the Prices Commission, the people we represent are frankly disappointed at its working, because no apparent results are to be seen. Perhaps, the matter being so big and the new system being so complicated, results could not be forthcoming at this stage, but we believe a far better system could be inaugurated if one or two men in each county visited the different towns and reported back to the Minister for Industry and Commerce with regard to prices prevailing at the time.  In that way, real work would be done.  Commissions, as a whole, are unwieldy, and their work is more or less on the theoretical side. Down the country the people, and we who represent them, realise that if we come down to facts, to the practical side of things, and if men are appointed <Col N="1925" /> in different areas or counties, who will keep in close touch with matters in the industrial centres, they could submit prices from time to time and, in that way, do real effective work.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce would thus be in a position immediately to rectify the profiteering and the other abuses that are going on all over the country.  I mentioned those few points in the hope that the Minister will bear them in mind.</P>
    <P>There is one other point with regard to the development of quarries.  The system, as it exists, operates against us in that unless the people in the different localities, and particularly the rural areas, provide certain funds whereby borings or testings can be carried out, the Department cannot assist them.  It is a well-known fact that people on their own cannot provide the necessary funds.  I am referring now to a case which occurred down in our district in connection with the opening of a slate quarry.  The inspector who visited the district reported on the area and on the samples of slate, but, naturally, he had no opportunity of giving a favourable report, because no borings were made. The result was that even though his report was not altogether unsatisfactory, it was unsatisfactory from the point of view of recommending the carrying out of further work, and the matter is held over and will not be reconsidered.  I would suggest that if any sums of money are made available to the local people concerned, either for prospecting purposes or for purposes of further tests, the Department should give at least a certain percentage of the expenditure for the carrying out of tests in that particular district. I would ask the Minister to reconsider that matter, because that is the only way, so far as the rural areas are concerned, in which the Minister can assist us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister to state, when replying, if and when he proposes to take cognisance of the findings of the Commission set up to consider the question of ports and harbours.  I think it is generally known by the Minister's Department that the small harbours at the moment <Col N="1926" /> are suffering considerably, and one of the reasons for that is the fact that we are engaged in an economic war. Owing to the fact that a great deal of the coal coming into the country is coming from continental ports, in large steamers, the trade which used to come into the small ports has been diverted to the deep-water harbours, the result, of course, being that the Harbour Commissioners in the various small ports find themselves scarcely able to carry on.  The Minister's attention has been drawn to the Port of Wexford on different occasions within recent months.  We hope that he will do something to help to make the harbour navigable.  In recent months, owing to the fact that the Harbour Commissioners are not able to do what is necessary on account of lack of funds, trade has been diverted and the harbour is closing up, with the result that cattle boats which were a great source of revenue to the Harbour Commissioners had to be diverted to another port.  I think that the Minister has had the report of the Tribunal sufficiently long to enable him to make up his mind to put into effect some of the recommendations made by that body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Speaking of ports brings me to the question of the unemployment of dock labourers.  In consequence of tariffs and in consequence of the economic war dock labourers in small ports have suffered considerably.  One would think that, because of the fact that they are victims in those things, the Minister would have made special provision for dealing with them.  On various occasions within the last 18 months his attention has been drawn to the position and the plight of dock labourers by the trade unions catering for them, but still nothing has been done.  In a great many cases those are only casual workers, and have not been able to accumulate sufficient stamps to enable them to draw unemployment benefit.  The Minister may say that they have the Unemployment Assistance Act, but that is very little use to a man who has been in fairly decent employment, and who has suffered in consequence of actions <Col N="1927" /> which have taken place in this country within recent months.</P>
    <P>Regardless of what Deputy Kelly said, I am going to repeat the complaints made by Deputy Norton in his statement last week.  There is no use in closing our eyes to the fact that there are industries to-day receiving the protection of the Government, backed by the people, in which conditions prevail that certainly should not prevail, to say the least of them.  There is a firm in my own constituency, the firm of Messrs. Pierce.  The Minister asked for names, and I am giving them.  That firm has been afforded protection, and rightly so.  I state here that there is an undue proportion of juvenile labour employed there.  Boys are employed at 7/- or 8/- a week, and they start about the age of 15 years.  After about two years, when they should be getting some wages, they are thrown out on the roadside, with the result that in Wexford to-day some three or four hundred youths between the ages of 18 and 21 are left useless and thrown. on the scrapheap.  That kind of thing should not prevail.  I suggest that the Minister should have an inquiry into things of that kind; that his officers should be more active, and should endeavour to find out what proportion of juvenile labour is employed in those firms.  In a great many cases they are employed to do the work of adults.  I know a particular factory, also started recently, where men are employed at from 12/- to 25/- a week, and I can give particulars of that case to the Minister.  That should be investigated.</P>
    <P>Surely industry founded on a basis of that kind is not good for this or any other country.  One would prefer to see the tariff wall removed, so that dock labourers or somebody might get a decent wage out of the business.  In a great many cases there is no doubt about the complaints of Deputy Norton being absolutely justifiable, and I would ask the Minister to investigate them.  I do not want to say any more.  I merely want to say that I agree with a great many of the complaints that Deputy Norton <Col N="1928" /> has made&mdash;I am familiar with them&mdash; and I suggest that the Minister should investigate them.  I again want to draw his attention to the plight of small harbours, and ask him to put into operation some of the recommendations of the Ports and Harbours Tribunal.  That body made recommendations which, in my opinion, would help to develop those harbours, and to put them on their feet.</P>

      <P>In any case Deputy Donnelly should remember what happened to an industry in his own constituency which was managed by a colleague of the Minister.  Deputy Donnelly, too, in speaking, I think, on that Vote asked me had I read Arthur Griffith's book on, I think, the Report of the first meeting of the National Council of Sinn Féin, where he warned this coutnry against being a one-armed nation.  A one-armed nation or a one-armed man is much better, stronger and more effective than a no-armed <Col N="1929" /> nation or a no-armed man. That is what this country is being brought to, not owing to the policy of the Minister but owing to the manner in which that policy is being carried out.  The Minister came to office here at a time when the only market for the industrial products of this country was the agricultural market in this country, and he took up office at a time when agriculture was depressed the world over.  Notwithstanding that, he pursued a policy of ruthless protection for industries that might have a chance of succeeding in this country, and for industries that had very little chance of succeeding in this country.  His allies, the Labour Party, have had to blow the gaff after two years; they told him here last week that the conditions under which industry was being carried on in this country were revolting.  The last speaker, Deputy Corish, hinted and suggested, if not advocated, that it would be better to remove tariffs if those conditions must prevail.  It is a good job to find that some Deputy or Deputies who have been supporting the manner in which the Minister is carrying out this national policy realises that.  I am not going to confuse the national policy of protection with the inefficiency and ill-considered manner in which the national policy is being carried out.  I support the policy, but I do not support the way in which it is carried out, nor do I consider that the time was opportune to carry it out in the ruthless manner in which the Minister is endeavouring to carry it out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Corish mentioned a factory in Wexford and complained of the juvenile labour employed there.  A Pierce mowing machine at the peak of the war prices cost £24 15s.; to-day it costs £24 10s.  Compare the value of the produce of that mowing machine in agriculture to-day, when the price is £24 10s., with what the product of that machine would be worth during the peak war prices.  These are things that apparently the Minister never considers. But, if he were running his own business he would soon see that his business would go wallop if he had not a profitable market.  He could not balance his own business accounts by <Col N="1930" /> increasing taxation or borrowing.  He would have to get it out of the produce of his own article, and if the market could not buy that article he would have to stop.  The Minister tells us over here that we must shut up, that we must sit down and say nothing and let him go on with his ramp for another year.  The Minister thought it was good politics, perhaps, to quote Arthur Griffith when he set out on this campaign. He thought it good politics to tell the country, to quote one of Deputy Donnelly's most recent remarks, that we are and have been a one-armed nation.  The Minister set out to give us two arms.</P>

Apparently that is all he knows about it.  He says that we are only suffering from the general agricultural depression all over the world.  At a time like that the Minister apparently supports the President and his colleagues in starting the economic war to put another burden on agriculture&mdash;a war that is costing agriculture practically £4,500,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not discussing agriculture or the economic war, but I am pointing out that the purchasing power of the agricultural community is vital to industrial development and <Col N="1931" /> revival in this country.  There is no other market for manufacturing industry but the agriculturists in this country, and the purchasing power of the agricultural community is vital to industrial development.  If that purchasing power is destroyed where will the Minister sell the produce of the industries that he is fostering?  If agriculture is not able to bear the strain of the tariffs that he is imposing on the parts for agricultural machinery what is going to happen? Agriculture will collapse.  When that happens all the superstructure on agriculture that the Minister will have built up will collapse with it.  If the Minister has not seen that before now he is not fit for his job.  On top of that world depression, agriculture that was to buy the products of the industries to be fostered by the Minister was made to bear another load of 30 or 40 per cent. of its value. Perhaps it was with the connivance of the Ministry, or it might have been by accident, that they allowed agriculture to bear that £4,500,000 with a little sop of a bounty thrown in.  That depressed the home price of agricultural produce and then the Minister probably saw that he was going to get cheap food produced by starvation wages or no wages at all to help to build up his industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But the vital thing that he seems to have neglected is the decline in the purchasing power of the agricultural community, with the result that many factories which were booming for a while are now on half-time, because the people are not able to buy the goods as the Government killed the only market which industry in this country could ever hope to have&mdash;at least could hope to have while it is necessary to have a tariff to protect the home market.  If the Minister wants any proofs let him check the price to-day with the price ten or 15 years years ago of the mowing machines turned out by Messrs.  Pierce. Let him take what it cost those engaged in agriculture to buy parts for their machinery.  As a matter of fact, it would be better for a farmer with a mowing machine that is not <Col N="1932" /> Irish-made to scrap the machine than to buy many parts for it.  In addition to that, there is so much annoyance and delay in getting in parts at the ports that it is entirely uneconomic for him to keep the machine.  Why does not the Minister pay some attention to the price of machinery here inside the tariff wall and the price for similar machinery outside the tariff wall?  Hardware merchants in this country cannot afford to stock the parts for foreign machines because of the tariffs they have to pay, and because of the want of credit.  Here their trade is made doubly hard because no provision is made for credit for these merchants within the Free State, since whole hog protection started.  I am not aware of any machinery set up by the Minister to see if we get anything like fair value for our money, from some of those industries.  A job that I had on hands required a lot of spade and shovel work.  I bought about £12 or £15 worth of these implements and I will give the Minister an object lesson in the value of those spades and shovels when put on hard work.  They will bend like the leaves of a book. I am not going to mention the factory at which they were made.</P>
    <P>I notice in the Estimate provision for the Statistics Branch.  The salaries run to £22,516 for the coming year. Last year they amounted to £23,672. I take it that that Branch looks after all statistics of any interest to this country in the matter of trade.  A short time ago I was directed to send a communication to the President.  In that communication I made use of certain figures.  The figures that I gave were quoted by British Ministers in the House of Commons.  I used the figures to show that under the British special duties we had seized from us, for it really was a seizure, sums approximating to £5,000,000.  The President, in reply, said &ldquo;That is all wrong.&rdquo;&ldquo;My information.&rdquo; said the President, &ldquo;is that in the year just closed the product of the British special duty will be far below £4,000,000.&rdquo; If they were far below £4,000,000 and he, as head of the Government of this country, ought to have the best <Col N="1933" /> information in the country&mdash;and if the Statistics Branch of the Department of Industry and Commerce is to perform any function at all it should watch very carefully over any seizure made on the property of this country, or citizens of this country, at any outside country, especially when that property must pass through our ports&mdash;if his information told the President that the produce of the British special duties was far below £4,000,000, then it could not be too far below £4,000,000, so let us take £3,500,000.  It is not doing him any injustice when he says that the produce of the special duties, according to his information, was below £4,000,000. His information, I repeat, should be the best available information in this country, and I do not see that it could come from anywhere else except the Statistics Branch of the Department of Industry and Commerce which, in salaries alone, is costing this country £22,000 a year.  What are the facts revealed by the British Chancellor of the Exchequer?</P>

      <P>Has it nothing to do with the Statistics Branch?  Has the produce of the British special duties nothing to do with our Department of Industry and Commerce and its Statistics Branch?  What are the functions of the Statistics Branch of the Department of Industry and Commerce? If we sent over £20,000,000 worth of stuff to Britain, and if Britain seized £4,500,000 or £5,000,000 of that, is the Department of Industry and Commerce, through its Statistics Branch, able at any moment to say how much Britain, in fact, has seized of that stuff?

    <P>I wanted to show that there was such <Col N="1935" /> a discrepancy between the statistics given by the President, and the statistics given by a British Minister, that the latter statistics exceeded £1,000,000, in our favour, those given by the President.  If the President got his figures from the Statistics Branch of this Department, relating to the amount which the British had seized from us, is it not an extraordinary state of affairs that all the President, according to this Branch, estimated the British had taken was £3,500,000, whereas the British Chancellor of the Exchequer could get up in the House of Commons and say that they had got £4,552,000, £1,000,000 more than the President claimed they had collected. I hope the Minister, when replying, will say how much the British collected, and will say if it is any part of the function of his Department, as a whole, to watch over the amount seized under these special duties.  Can he show returns that will tally with the British returns, or will they tally with the President's statement?

      <P>Very well.  When replying I should like if the Minister informed the House, and the country, if his Department&mdash;and I presume it would be the Statistics Branch&mdash;has any record of the amount collected on our produce by the British through the Special Duties.  These Special Duties were imposed to collect payments that were agreed to in the Ultimate Financial Settlement of March, 1926.  The British state that they have collected £4,552,000.  I should like to know if the Minister's Department has kept books to show, when this economic-trouble is ended, that we can stand over our figures, and if we can tell the British when we meet to settle this trouble, &ldquo;You have collected so much from us.  There are the books.&rdquo;  If that has not been done, why not?  If it has not been done by the Department or by some other Department they should immediately resign in shame for leaving books that should contain such vital figures for this country in the hands of the British, that the Minister and his colleagues are prepared to call the enemy.  If it is a war they are the enemy.  I think it is time we had some comment from some responsible person here, either to contradict or to accept the statement made by the other side that they have collected £4,552,000.  I would besurprised if the Minister's Department has not kept the necessary records.  If so, will their figures tally with those given by Mr. Chamberlain up to the 31st March last?  If the Minister does not answer, or if he says that that is not the business of his Department, then I will only have to raise this matter on the President's Estimate.</P>

Coming to peat, Deputy Kelly, if he has not spoken already on this Estimate, will I am sure have a chance of displaying his special knowledge on this question. There is a great discrepancy in the figures in this year's Estimate compared with last year.  Salaries, wages and allowances for 1934-35 amount to £6,845; Travelling Expenses, £2,000; Incidental Expenses, £150; General Publicity and Organisation Expenses, £20,000, compared with a total of £22,000 last year.  I noticed from reports of some of the week-end orations by the Minister for Defence, that it took 300,000 fat cattle to buy the coal needed by this country, and that we were going to change all that by cutting the throats of the calves and by cutting turf.  These are the economics of the Minister for Defence. Anybody who knows anything about turf knows that that proposal is laughable. Only a man without any knowledge of turf, such as the Minister for Industry and Commerce or the Minister for Defence, would make such silly remarks, in order to try to get political Party capital out of it.  When the Bill dealing with turf was before the House it was claimed that stone turf, in good condition, filled in bags, could be delivered at the nearest railway station for 10/6 a ton.  Now, anybody who knows anything at all about turf knows that good stone turf cannot be delivered at the nearest railway station at 10/6 a ton, or, if it is, then the adult labour producing it does not get 1/6 a day.  Anybody who has had any experience of turf knows that, weight for weight, coal is four times as valuable as turf for heating purposes. That applies even in the case <Col N="1938" /> of the best of turf.  We know that turf is being hawked around Dublin at approximately the price of coal.  The bogs have been there for centuries and they have not been developed.  It took our Executive Council to go down on a Saturday afternoon and make a tour of the bog at Allenwood.</P>

If I said any more I might confuse the Minister and I might give him an opportunity to adopt his usual dodge looking for the weakest and the easiest way out.  I am not going to give him too many choices.  Perhaps he will tell us what method of book-keeping his Department is doing recording the British special duties, and maybe he might tell us how much the British have taken from us.  I would like to know from the Minister if the Statistics Branch, which is costing us £16,500 in salaries and £6,000 by way of bonus, have to keep an account of the goods the British have seized from us by virtue of the special duties, and also if they have worked out a graph or prepared any return indicating by how much the general level of wholesale food prices in the Saorstat has been reduced by virtue of the British tariffs.  Finally, I would like the Minister to comment on the prospects of our trade with Britain, especially those articles produced here and that are in competition with Danish produce.  What hope has he, from the knowledge gleaned from his Department, of the success of our trade in the future, considering that the Dane has 20 per cent. of a money exchange advantage over us in the British market?</P>

      <P>I wish to make a few further remarks on the subject of industrial alcohol.  I have already asked the Minister if this undertaking is to be run as a separate undertaking, as a commercial concern, and if a balance sheet will be published indicating the trading results.  The Minister stated that it would take 1/9 to produce a gallon of industrial alcohol at the factory.  Some doubt has been cast upon that figure, but even taking that figure, some additions would have to be made to it.  I suggest that to the 1/9 that the Minister has stated as the cost per gallon of industrial alcohol at the factory there will be 8d. excise duty, so as to bring it to the same comparison as petrol.  That would total 2/5.  Something, presumably, must be allowed to the merchant who is going to distribute it for the Government.  Whether the Government do it themselves or distribute it through the ordinary channels, I suggest that another 4d. would have to be added to the price, thus bringing the amount to 2/9, as against 1/7 which is the present cost of petrol.  I am afraid even that is not the whole of the story, because when alcohol is used with petrol it requires to be blended.  There would have to be blending machinery installed at certain points and, presumably, the Minister would have to arrange for somebody to be paid for this service.  When that is done I do not know how the petrol can be mixed with alcohol and the constant supply of petrol mixed with alcohol maintained all over the Free State.  It might be quite all right if all the petrol sold in the Free State was mixed with a certain proportion of alcohol because then the carburettors of motor cars could be adjusted.  If there was a considerable admixture of alcohol special engines would have to be installed in our present motor lorries.  That brings one to the question whether the whole game is worth the candle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I notice the Minister has not referred to a mixing of industrial alcohol with petrol.  I wonder if that is what he has in his mind.  I think it is not at all certain that that is his purport, or that is the ultimate object <Col N="1941" /> he has in mind in manufacturing this industrial alcohol.  I think the public ought to be informed at the earliest possible moment what is the position, because people are wondering if the purchase of new cars should be postponed until this question is settled.  Various other distributors, who would have undertaken the sale of this product, are wondering how far the Government are going to fall in with the necessities of the motor industry.  I would suggest to the Minister that at the earliest possible moment he ought to let us know, officially, whether he intends this alcohol to be used for the supply of motor spirit to cars, and in what way he is going to arrange for this, because it will entail a considerable dislocation down through the large industries in this country.  I would ask the Minister specially to deal with that point when he comes to reply in this debate.</P>

      <P>I listened to Deputy Tom Kelly when reading out the onslaught that Deputy Norton made on the conditions of employment in the City of Dublin.  I listened also to remarks from my own side of the House.  I think it only fair, so that there should be no misunderstanding, to point out that these denunciations did not refer to the general businessmen of the Free State.  The majority of our Irish industrialists, during long years of success, have behind them a record of decent wages being paid, and decent conditions being observed, in their agreements made with the respective trade unions.  It would be an absolute scandal to national justice if it was to go out to the world, or to those interested in our position here, that Irish businesses were conducted under the scandalous conditions which have been mentioned here.  It would be untrue, and if there are exceptions to the general rule they are very few.  If demanded, the names of those who are exceptions to the list of excellent employers in this country, should be published in some form or another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Norton comes into this House and plays a kind of Punch and Judy show.  When he goes down to the constituencies <Col N="1942" /> he refers to the general economic conditions of the country, and the great benefits accruing and the building-up that is being done, and he declares: &ldquo;We are fighting with one hand and building up with the other, and that as long as Fianna Fáil cooperates with us we will co-operate with them.&rdquo; I would like if the speech which he made here, in reference to the furniture trade, and which was referred to by Deputy Kelly, were made in his own constituency.  Then this Punch and Judy show would stop, and all the clap-trap and humbug that he uses outside the House would be exposed and the people in the country would understand that Deputy Norton has one speech to make one day, in which everything is prosperous, and another another day, as circumstances demand, in which everything is decaying. I am interested only, in the few words that I wish to address to the House, in the industry of the country as a whole.  I do not want to go outside that.  We have tariffs up to the skies, all round the country, and we are told that we have the highest tariffs existing in the whole world.  I hope that some effort will be made, in 1934, to concentrate upon industry being established in the local towns in the different counties in Ireland. Powers should be sought, and secured, that would give most advantageous terms to enterprising people ready to start factories in our country towns. At the present moment, everything is being done in the interests of centralisation. Attention is given, almost exclusively, to cities like Dublin, Cork, Waterford and, I presume, Limerick. If that is so, it will serve to make these cities more influential in attracting business from the smaller country towns.  Business will not be able to prosper anywhere except in the bigger distributing areas.  In these circumstances as time goes on, enterprising people will feel it more incumbent upon them to drift towards the cities and by degrees our country towns will decay and fall away.  Nothing will be left in them except huckster shops, which cannot give employment, and cannot contribute to the uplifting of those towns, or contribute in any <Col N="1943" /> possible way towards the rates necessary for the upkeep of those towns, whether they be towns governed by commissioners or by other kinds of local authorities.  At the present time there is a tendency to concentrate everything in the City of Dublin and in other large centres of population.  In the counties where we have large numbers of unemployed efforts are being made by local committees with a view to having some little local industry started.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the last Bill was before the House a certain number of points have arisen in connection with Army administration to which, I think, the Minister ought to address himself before the Bill passes through the Dáil.  Quite a number of questions have been raised here recently in connection with men discharged from the Army reserve.  The Minister told us this afternoon, in reply to a question, that from the beginning of this year 61 men of good character had been discharged from the Army reserve for no reason stated except that they were no longer required.  During the same period the Minister has got permission from the House to form a special Volunteer force.  There is no doubt at all about it that from an ordinary Army point of view the best soldier-material that a Minister could have in the country to-day is an Army reserve. The men who are serving their time as ordinary soldiers in the Army to-day <Col N="1944" /> are being trained.  I suggest that only a very small percentage of them can have had such a full experience as the men who, having served their full period in the Army and particularly in past years, have also served for several years in the Reserve.  Therefore, the most experienced, the most highly trained and the most reliable material as soldiers that the Minister could have are the men of the Army reserve.</P>
      <P>The 61 cases studded around the country have happened since the beginning of this year.  These are men who have had long experience in the Army as well as long service in the Reserve.  Their character has been testified to by the Army authorities as being &ldquo;very good,&rdquo; and yet they are simply told that they are no longer required in the Army.  The Minister, when dealing with some supplementary questions put to him on different occasions in connection with this matter, has allowed himself to slip into the expression that &ldquo;they were kicked out.&rdquo;  The Minister, in fact, has, in my opinion, put these men out of the Army for political reasons.  He has received, I submit, suggestions from the local Fianna Fáil club that they are not of the same political complexion as the Minister, and on these grounds alone, I submit, the Minister has put them out of the Army.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has endeavoured to suggest here that the Army authorities reviewed the cases of these men, and that on a review of the circumstances of these men put them out of the Army.  The Minister has endeavoured to suggest that the initiative came from the military authorities.  I want to tell the Minister that I do not believe a single word of it.  I do not think that anyone in the House or in the country does.  The distribution of these dismissals from the Army, because that is what they are, is rather interesting.  Out of a total number of 61, we find that 10 are from the County Westmeath, 11 from the County Tipperary and 18 from the County Cork, so that the concentrations in regard to these dismissals are in these three counties: Westmeath, Tipperary and Cork.  Only in two other counties was the number of people discharged <Col N="1945" /> as high as four, namely, Wicklow and Limerick.  There were 12 counties in which there was no one discharged at all.  If the Minister challenges what I say, and I am sure he will, it would be interesting to hear from him what are the special conditions existing in Westmeath, Tipperary and Cork, that have brought the military authorities to say that there are, respectively, ten, 11 and 18 persons of long Army service and of long service in the Reserve with a good character in both, in these particular counties whose services were no longer required.</P>
    <P>The Minister has repeatedly stated that this new Force is an entirely non-political Force, but the Ministerial Press on the 22nd February last reports &ldquo;an official statement which was published yesterday&rdquo;:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;By bringing together again old comrades-in-arms it is hoped that it will go far to heal the bitterness that has so seriously retarded national progress during the past few years. Volunteers are quite entitled to have any political opinions they think fit; they are simply asked not to introduce these opinions into their Volunteer activities.  The Government and the Army authorities have taken all possible steps to render the Force strictly non-political, and it is confidently expected that they will be supported in their endeavours by all political groups and by the people as a whole.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It has already been pointed out here to the Minister that in selecting the officers that he did select for the new Force, all of them being of the one particular political outlook, and with the one particular political history, he did not give his new Force a chance: that he exposed this new Force to the charge of being a political Force.  The action that the Minister has taken, action directed against a certain number of men in the Army Reserve, dismissing them in the way that he has done without giving any reason good, bad or indifferent, indicates that he has prejudiced the Army Reserve with a political outlook.  That will, most inevitably, have reactions on the whole atmosphere of the new Force which, as the Minister has been <Col N="1946" /> reminded already, is sufficiently prejudiced by the fact that he has selected the officers in charge of it entirely from a group with one particular political outlook and with a particular political history.</P>
    <P>The Minister has informed the House that the new Force is going to cost a considerable amount of money, and as it is going to be one piece with the Army the Minister, in organising it, gave it a separate uniform. I should like to ask the Minister, now that this Force is developing, whether his experience, up to the present, has not been such that he ought to review the question of having a separate uniform for this Force?  The Minister has put the officers of the new Force into, I understand, the ordinary Army uniform.  The difference that exists between the Army and the Reserve and the new political Force, a difference in uniform, is bound to create a certain amount of difference, a difference of <i>esprit de corps</i> as between two classes and will inevitably create an outlook, I do not say a political outlook or political differences but, at any rate, it will produce a situation which will divide the Volunteer Force in spirit from the Army as a whole.  I ask whether the Minister has since had that matter under consideration and whether he proposes to continue to have a separate uniform for his new Force?</P>
    <P>The statement was made in January or February last in the Ministerial Press that the Minister had taken an important decision and that it was intended to confine commissions in the Army in future to members of the Volunteer Force and discredit the cadet system.  I do not know whether the Minister has since addressed himself to the question of commissions in the new Army but what has since happened makes it advisable that the Minister would tell us now what the position is with regard to future commissions and what will be the system in future in giving commissions in the Army.</P>
    <P>The Minister promised some time ago to make a statement with regard to the question of pensions for officers, non-commissioned officers and men.  I <Col N="1947" /> should like to know when will the Minister promulgate his decision with regard to this question of pensions for the officers, non-commissioned officers and men in the Army?</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>With reference to the point which Deputy Mulcahy raised as to a pensions scheme for the Army, I hope to introduce a Bill for Army pensions in the course of a few weeks.  Deputy Mulcahy accused me of dismissing reservists because of their political opinions.  That is not so.  If the Deputy holds that, I suppose he will also, logically, have to hold that the remainder of the reservists are Fianna Fáil supporters or otherwise I would dismiss them. After all, there have been 61 reservists dismissed out of a total of around 8,000.  That is very much less than one per cent.</P>
      <P>As far as I am concerned I do not care what politics a soldier has, whether the soldier is in the regular Army, is a reservist, or is a volunteer. All I want, and what I demand of them, is that they will be prepared to obey Army regulations which are made out in the ordinary way and that I have confidence in them that they will do their duty according to the oath they took when they joined the Army.  Deputy Mulcahy said that in some way, in answer to his question, I endeavoured to throw responsibility for the dismissal of these reservists on to the shoulders of the military authorities as distinct from myself.  In answer to some of Deputy Mulcahy's supplementary questions, I clearly pointed out that as Minister for Defence I was responsible for the running of the Army, that I took full and absolute responsibility for dismissing certain men and for keeping on others and if there is any blame to be apportioned on the score of the dismissal of certain numbers of reservists, that responsibility is mine and attaches to no one else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In August of last year it became necessary for me to issue regulations forbidding members of the Reserve from being members of the Army Comrades' Association or the National Guard or any military or semi-military <Col N="1948" /> body not lawfully maintained by the Government of the Saorstát or membership of any secret society.  The position is that the reservist or volunteer while on active service is prohibited by the Army regulations from being a member of political organisations. The soldier or volunteer is forbidden to be a member of any military or semi-military body not lawfully maintained by the Government and he is also forbidden to be a member of any secret society.  If it comes to my knowledge that any member of the Reserve or any member of the Volunteer Forces breaks that regulation I will have him in the Army as short a time as possible.</P>
    <P>I want to repeat that I have no objection to members of the Reserve or Volunteers having any political opinions they like.  Reservists and Volunteers can have any political opinions; so long as they are soldiers and obey the regulations they will be retained in the Reserve.  I do not believe that the remainder of the 8,000 who are in the Reserve are followers of Fianna Fáil.  I do believe, however, that they are prepared to obey the regulations which have been issued and that they are prepared to serve in the manner set out in the oath they took.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy also raised a point about a separate uniform for the Volunteers.  I think it is only right that the Volunteers should have a distinctive uniform.  It is so in every country in the world, and if we could afford it I would have a distinctive uniform for every corps in the service. We have certain distinctive badges for certain units, and if it were possible I would go much further and have a distinctive uniform.</P>
    <P>In regard to the system of commissions, it is intended to confine the commissions in the regular Army to volunteers.  I want to get as officers for the regular Army men who have a really keen interest in military life, and I think the best possible proof of that is in the case of the young man who comes forward and gives his services voluntarily.  When we want cadets for the regular Army, we will hold an examination from amongst the Volunteers. We can then sort out the men <Col N="1949" /> who are most suitable from the educational point of view and from the military point of view.  The present Officers' Training Corps will be incorporated in the Volunteer force through time.  I think that these are all the points which were raised.</P>

      <P>It is obvious from sub-section 1 (a) of Section 2 that the decision in the Erne fishery case is being referred to and that provision is also being made for possible, further, judicial decisions operating in like manner. On that question of possible future judicial decisions and also on the question raised in sub-section 1 (b), dealing with the abandonment of several fisheries by proprietors who, presumably, are not in a position to finance a very costly action to maintain their title, the Minister ought to let us know what his policy is.  I should like to know, for instance, whether or not the Minister encourages attacks on these rights, whether the Minister and the Government are behind the attacks on this particular type of property.  I must say that it looks rather like it, especially having regard to the company the Minister keeps.  The Minister went up to Dundalk on Sunday, accompanied by the Minister for Defence.  The Minister for Defence there gave expression to some views on spoliation of land and appropriation of land.  He talked of depriving of their land farmers who, to use his own words, did not care for Fianna Fáil and who were bullock-worshippers. He said that those who disagreed with Fianna Fáil and those who farmed their lands in a certain way, rather than the way Fianna Fáil thought they should, might find their land taken from them.  I wonder if this proposal is on a par with that point of view. Is it on a par with the proposal to deprive persons of property to which they have a title and for which they probably paid good, solid money?  If the Minister is behind the attacks on these private rights or, at least, rights that have been asserted for a number of years, he should say so openly. Apropos of this, the thing which has chiefly made me believe and fear that the Minister is a party to these attacks is the personnel of a Commission he has set up to inquire into the question of inland fisheries as a whole. One would imagine that, in the setting up of such a Commission, the persons to constitute it would be very carefully selected by the Minister in order to secure that they would have an <Col N="1952" /> unbiassed mind in dealing with the matter before them.  One member of that Commission has, since he became a member, in his private capacity challenged one of those rights appertaining to tidal waters.  The principal proprietor of that right and his immediate ancestors have exercised it for nearly 150 years.  It can be easily proved that it was exercised since about 1750.  When the Minister appoints a person of the type I refer to to a commission dealing with a matter of such importance to the public and to individual owners, I am afraid he gives the impression that he is a party even to the particular act of this particular member of the Commission.  Of course, if the Minister wants a certain decision from that Commission he is probably correct in selecting that type of person.  If his aim is that the Commission should bring in some recommendations by way of confiscation of all these fishery rights, well then, of course, he has obviously appointed the right type of persons.  I think, however, as I have said already, that he should say so openly and that he should let the public know.  In fact, I think that he might go a bit further than that, because, mind you, I feel that we ought to be ashamed of clause (b) there.  I think that we ought to be ashamed that proprietors of property are brought into the position that they have got to abandon their rights because of lack of money to prove their title in the courts.  That is the position in my opinion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Clause (b) really refers to the poor owners of fisheries as distinct from the rich owners.  The rich owners may be able to finance a big and costly legal action, but the poor owners cannot hope to do so unless, at any rate, they have some guarantee that their own costs will be met.  Usually, the persons who infringe the rights are men of straw or persons of little or no property who could not possibly pay the costs of the proprietors if the costs were given against them.  I think that the Minister, if he is behind these attacks on this particular type of property, should make some provision by which persons, who contest those rights and succeed in the courts, should be paid their <Col N="1953" /> costs.  In my opinion, there should be some provision by the State for this. I do not make any suggestion as to how that might be done.  It might be a matter for a special Vote.  I do not know that it necessarily could be effected by having the Attorney-General as defendant in all these cases. But, at any rate, I think it is something that, in fairness and as a demonstration of support of private property as a whole, the Government should contemplate doing.  I say so because it is very easy to drift&mdash;other countries have drifted&mdash;from attacks on private property to attacks of another kind, and there is no other way in which one can contemplate that that drift will occur more easily or more rapidly.  The &ldquo;have nots,&rdquo; very naturally, always are rather envious of the &ldquo;haves,&rdquo; and it would have a really good stabilising effect if the Government would say, in the case of any of these fishery rights which are challenged through the ordinary public going in and trespassing on them or preventing the proprietors from exercising the rights they have exercised for a great number of years, that if these proprietors succeeded in an action in the courts the Government would be prepared to meet the costs of the action.</P>

      <P>I am rather surprised that Deputy Lynch did not make the speech he has just made on the Second Reading, because it is rather straining the point a bit to bring in, under this particular clause, a speech on the confiscation of private property.  If the Deputy disagrees with the Bill, that is a very big principle and I think it should have been raised on the Second Reading.  I do not see that there is any doubt about the policy we mean to pursue under this Bill.  The Deputy says that paragraph (b) of sub-section (1) is a disgraceful paragraph to bring into any Bill.  We were the owners in certain cases.  The Minister for Lands and Fisheries was the owner of the Ownea River, for instance.  It was considered advisable to surrender any claim to that river as a result of the decision in-the case of the River Erne.  If this clause were not there the Minister for Lands and Fisheries would have to <Col N="1954" /> have the case brought to court in order to have it decided by the court before the owners of the River Ownea could be brought under this Bill.  Surely we do not want to go through all that cumbersome proceeding if the owner thinks that a decision already given in the case of one river covers his case and if he is willing to surrender his claim and not make any further claim to it.  The Deputy has made his position quite clear.  In effect, he said: &ldquo;They are the <i>private</i> owners of property to which, undoubtedly, they have a title,&rdquo; in spite of the Supreme Court.  According to that, the alleged owners of the River Erne, no matter what the Supreme Court or Magna Charta may say, undoubtedly have a title.  That, undoubtedly, is the Deputy's position. If that is so, why did the Deputy remain on in the Cumann na nGaedheal Benches for three or four years after the Attorney-General of that Government had gone in and taken part against the alleged owners of the River Erne?  I think it was a very queer thing for the Deputy to do and that it showed that he had not very much faith in his own convictions.  Judging from his speech now, and if he had any regard for the convictions he expressed in that speech, he should not have remained with the Cumann na Gaedheal Government when they allowed their Attorney-General to go in and take the part of the people who were fighting that case against the people who, as he himself says, undoubtedly had a title in the case of the River Erne.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy attacks the Commission because a certain person who was put on the Commission, he says, challenged the right of a person who has enjoyed, through himself or his ancestors, certain property for the last 150 years. We have no intention of tying the members of our Commission to silence on the subject while they are sitting on that Commission.  I take it that if the Deputy had had the appointment of this Commission during his term of office he would not put people of that type on it, but people of the type of the owner, and there would be absolutely no complaint from the Deputy, or from those who think like <Col N="1955" /> him, if we had appointed on the Commission that owner whose right was challenged.  If we had packed the Commission with owners and people of that type there would be no complaint whatsoever.</P>
    <P>Another point raised by the Deputy was that clause (b) will hit the poor owner rather than the rich owner.  I do not see that point.  There may be something in what the Deputy says, but I cannot see it.  If a person thinks that he has a right in a certain fishery and that that right is valuable, I am quite sure that he will fight for it.  It is quite possible that, as a result of the Erne decision, a number of people will not fight, because they may come to a conclusion that they have no case to fight as the Erne decision covers their case.  However, the suggestion that these people should get their costs is rather a novel one.  Again, I am under the impression&mdash;although I may be wrong here, and the Deputy can correct me&mdash;that the Cumann na nGaedheal Government, in one of their Bills about 1923 or 1924, were responsible for removing that provision. The Deputy, being a member of the legal profession, knows about such matters better than I do, but I am informed that up to that period one party in a legal action was entitled to ask the other party to lodge costs before proceeding.  That provision was removed by Cumann na nGaedheal when they were in office&mdash;I suppose for some very good reason.  I think it was the right thing to do, because so long as that provision remained it was possible for the rich man to make it impossible for the poor man to defend his claim in court, the poor man finding himself unable to lodge costs before proceedings.  We had the general taunt from the Deputy about confiscation of private property.  It, of course, only goes to show that the Deputy is imbued with this sort of propaganda, which is being carried on by the Fine Gael Party.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. F. Lynch Mr. F. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister chose to misinterpret practically every word I said.  First of all, I did not say that clause (b) is a disgraceful paragraph <Col N="1956" /> to bring into any Bill.  I said that we should be ashamed of what underlies clause (b), in that certain persons, who have exercised a title which has not been disputed over a number of years, should be deprived of their rights because of a lack of money to defend them in a costly legal proceeding.  That is what I said and it is quite a different matter from saying that it is a disgraceful paragraph to bring into any Bill.  You must bring in some such paragraph, of course, to deal with cases which obviously come under the Erne fishery decision, like a case in Donegal or an area like that, to which the provisions of Magna Charta could not possibly have applied or which could not have been put in defence, as it was called, before Magna Charta. The Minister took me up on the question of undoubted title.  I was referring to the case of future judicial decisions, such as the case of a man who defends his title in court and it has been found by the court that he has undoubtedly a title.  Then, I say, in fairness to that man, where he has exercised that title for a number of years without interference and where it is interfered with now and especially if the Minister is behind it, there ought to be some provision whereby that man could get his costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister tried to get across some of the cheap political stuff he can never get away from.  If I had the appointment of the Commission, he said, I would probably have the owner of the particular fishery I was referring to on it.  I challenge anybody to say whether, with respect to the personnel of any commission I appointed during my time, that I chose persons who were biassed in any one direction in respect of the matter into which they had to inquire or whether, on the contrary, I chose persons of independent mind who had no particular axe to grind with regard to the result of the inquiry.  The country is not divided into mere fishery owners and those who are challenging the rights of those owners. There are thousands and thousands of persons in the country of independent mind who do not care a straw so far <Col N="1957" /> as they themselves are concerned and who have nothing to gain from the result of an inquiry or from what recommendations are made by the Commission.  The Minister had all those to choose from and why then choose persons who have a particular axe to grind in the matter?</P>
    <P>I must say that my memory does not serve me too well on this question of the lodgment of costs but, even if it were so, what I am coming at is really very much to the same point.  In that one case, if the legislation was ours, it was perfectly right that a man should not be deprived of his rights of litigation because of the defence putting down a motion that he should lodge costs.  It was perfectly right that that should not be so&mdash;that the rich man could put the poor man always out of court.  Is this not very much the same thing?  We are putting certain poor farmers here out of court.  Unless the Minister is taking on his shoulders the responsibility for these attacks&mdash;I am not saying the Minister is doing it &mdash;but is the fact that the persons who are challenging the rights of these poor owners&mdash;perhaps rather small private fisheries but still, maybe, the only asset these men have&mdash;not putting them in the position in which they are unable to defend their legal rights because of lack of funds?  Is it not the very same thing the other way round?</P>

      <P>I was glad to hear the Minister state that probably the decision in the Erne Fishery case, and the legislation in connection with it, will mean that title to ownership will change hands and that the people concerned in the fishery industry will benefit.  As to Deputy Lynch's point with regard to the small owners, I should like to know the people to whom he refers.  They are probably the people concerned with the Laune Fisheries and others in that category, who, I submit, could not be classed as small owners.  They are people who obtained the same title rights as are being challenged now in the Erne Fishery case.  With regard to the Deputy's challenging to show that he did not approve of certain appointments during his period as Minister for <Col N="1958" /> Fisheries, I should like to ask him how it is he allowed an inspector named Alfred Dodd, of Killorglin, County Kerry, to retain his position as inspector of fisheries in that district, while at the same time he was part owner of the fishery?  The Deputy was very well aware of that, and yet he allowed Mr. Dodd to carry on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not clear what the Minister is aiming at in Section 3.  I <Col N="1959" /> looked up the Fisheries Act, 1848, and Section 8 simply says that persons using fishing engines, nets and so on, must be licensed and rated in a manner subsequently prescribed, and must pay an annual duty.  Section 2 of the 1848 Act imposes a penalty for using engines without a licence.  Section 29 provides that persons using or having engines, etc., must produce a licence when required, under penalty.  The side note is more illuminating; it says: &ldquo;Partial repeal of Sections 8, 22 and 29 of the Fisheries (Ireland) Act, 1848,&rdquo; but the section does not make it clear what part of the sections is repealed, and what part remains unrepealed.</P>

      <P>The three sections are repealed.  I do not understand that marginal note.  The reason why these three sections are repealed is because licences are being issued under Sections 6 and 7&mdash;similar licences under the local licences system.  If they were not repealed the person would be entitled to ask for a licence under both Acts. The intention is to avoid overlapping.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 4 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>On the section I should like to ask&mdash;although I think I can almost calculate it from the penalty clause later on; at least I can calculate a minimum&mdash;how much, in addition to the ordinary draft net licence, will be charged to make up the special local licence.  The draft net licence, I think, is £4 10/-, under the 1925 Act.  In the case of the Erne I think it is nearly all draft nets that are used.  In some of the estuaries I think drift nets are used, and some of those estuaries may come within the scope of this Bill.  A drift net licence under the 1925 Act is only £3, and that is an anomaly, undoubtedly, in the 1925 Fisheries Act which was not, if I may say so, the fault of the persons who drafted the Bill.  The proposal to increase the drift net licence was defeated, I think it was in the Seanad, and the amendment was maintained here in this House subsequently.  Perhaps for all <Col N="1960" /> these nets there will be one fixed sum. If that were so it would meet the case, because I believe that the drift net men have got away with it since the 1925 Act as against the ordinary draft net men.  They have certainly benefited by the fact that a certain amendment was carried here which left the licence duties in the Schedule to the 1925 Act rather lopsided.</P>
      <P>Sub-section (5) of Section 4 provides that &ldquo;Any order under this section may provide that where a special local licence to fish for salmon with a single rod and line is granted for any year to a person to whom an ordinary licence of a similar kind has been granted for such year, the licence duty payable in respect of such special local licence shall be reduced by 30/-.&rdquo;  I am wondering how the figure of 30/- was arrived at.  The salmon rod licence is £2.  If that salmon rod licence is taken out in the same locality as the local licence, where the local licence would now be issued, one would imagine that the man would get the benefit of the full £2 he had already paid.  I could see the point if it were that he went to another fishing district, because there was a provision in the 1925 Act that if a man has taken out a £2 salmon rod licence in one area, and he goes into another area, he can fish there by having his licence endorsed on payment of a sum of 10/-.  I could understand the reduction of 30/- if the provision were that when he went into another district, outside the district in which he has taken out his ordinary salmon rod licence, the reduction would be 30/-, but if the special local licence is issued in the same district in which he has a salmon rod licence I suggest that the reduction should be the ordinary £2 which he has paid.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

      <P>I think the Deputy has not understood that sub-section.  That refers to a person who has taken out an ordinary licence in another district. In the ordinary way he would pay 10/- going in there.  The special local licence is reduced by 30/-, which comes to the same thing.</P>

      <P>I quite agree with what Deputies have said in regard to the question of draft-net licences.  A special case could be made on behalf of the coastal fishery people, because of the fact that the inclemency of the weather and the open nature of the fishing ground makes it practically impossible for them to avail of the full fishing season.  Some special concession should be made on that account.  I have in mind the fishermen on the Cromane-Killorglin coast, and other parts of the coast, which are really extensions of the Laune fishery. Those people are in a different position from the fishermen working inland.  I should like to make a special plea to the Minister in so far as those people are concerned.</P>

That is what I wanted to know, because I have been making calculations on that basis and I think I have arrived at least at a minimum figure for a special local licence as a result of that.  Three times the special local licence duty is provided for, where the Minister has made on order, and £50 in other cases.  Presumably, I can calculate, therefore, that the special local licence will not be less at any rate than £17?</P>

At any rate, some provision must be made by a pretty high special local licence fee if the rivers are not to be ruined by over-netting and if funds are to be provided for the board of conservators.</P>

      <P>Before the interval I was anxious that no misunderstanding should arise about the charges levelled in this House against certain people in the City of Dublin.  I said it was not made clear whom these charges were made against and that the language used was so exaggerated that somebody should enter into the debate from a different angle than that of mere Party politics.  I should have thought that if employers in Dublin were carrying out industry under Eastern conditions and with foreign ideas the names would be announced in the House publicly and if any of the speakers who referred to these individuals or companies were unable to produce evidence, or felt that their evidence <Col N="1963" /> was not strong enough, then these accusations should not be made.  If Deputies are afraid to mention the names, if they give them to me I shall mention them, because I think it is an outrage on the Irish people as a whole to make these accusations without being able to prove them.  I was referring to the conditions under which industry was developing in this State and said that the country towns were being left uncared for and in a state of hardship owing to the fact that our overseas trade was dwindling so much and that ordinary business tended to come to the cities.  I asked if some special inquiry or commission could not be set up to investigate the position of our country towns and to give people who want to establish industry here under the protection of the tariffs every guidance and encouragement to start in the country towns.  In these towns federations of unemployed are springing up and committees are being formed by different parties to try to find some way of bringing industry into these towns.  My experience is that they are not making any progress in starting industries in our country towns.  These federations of unemployed have a real grievance and they are quite right in coming together to endeavour to find some means of living besides the dole and other methods of assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very hard to discuss business in an institution like this, because politics and business can never be mixed.  Although these Estimates can be criticised by Parliamentarians, yet in view of the attempts being made to establish industry, they should not be opposed with any bitterness and any criticism offered should be of a constructive kind.  I would be interested to hear more elaborately expounded the progress that is being made and the advantages that this money will bring about.  There is no question but that to bring about industrial revival in this country is a tremendous task. It requires constant attention and a good deal of courage.  In view of the economic chaos that exists in our foreign trade, the development of home industry requires getting away <Col N="1964" /> from the old economic road and seeking short-cuts which are full of hidden obstacles.  I am sure that when the Minister changed over from being one of the leading Opposition Deputies and took up the responsibilities of a Minister he discovered what a tremendous difference it made to be the caretaker and the guardian of the industrial revival of the country and that instead of an easy passage he found it was full of repercussions and reactions when he set out to change from the old hard road of experience.</P>
    <P>It requires every effort on the part of our people, irrespective of political views, to bring about industrial revival, and where they can co-operate they should do so.  The capital is here, I know.  Although a large number of the community has suffered through the economic war, at the same time there are many who can and will co-operate in endeavouring to solve the unemployment problem and establish national industries under proper conditions with decent working hours and decent wages.</P>
    <P>For that reason I would hate to get up in this House to add to any of the accusations that were hurled at the Minister this afternoon or on the last day, or on whatever day it was that Deputy Norton made his speech in this House.  I was not present on that occasion but I hold that it was an insincere speech.  I hold that that speech was calculated to fit in with the local elections that are about to be held, that his imagination was playing with the ticker as the votes were being counted and the results were coming through. He, of course, hoped that his speech would be read down in his constituency. It was a speech full of hypocrisy; it had no constructive thought whatever. It was simply a general attack launched at the Minister for Industry and Commerce because he thought it was time to dissociate himself from Fianna Fáil.  He has been travelling, however, in the Fianna Fáil omnibus all the time in the form of a very good strap-hanger.  Down in his own constituency he is fond of referring to what he is doing in fighting the national cause, but, apparently, he thought the time had come when he <Col N="1965" /> should do something that would show him in some different light than merely the complete tail of the Fianna Fáil Party.  Thus it was that his criticisms were not worth anything by reason of their insincerity.  Deputy Norton might have got up here to fight for the towns in his constituency and to make some suggestion as to how we might establish some industries in them, but instead he launched a general attack just like a soap-box orator, a demagogue&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister in his opening statement referred to certain increases that have occurred in the Estimate, the principal increase being that in connection with the operation of the Unemployment Assistance Bill. As that will be discussed on a later Vote, I do not propose to delay the House in referring to it now.  I presume that the increased Estimate is due to the fact that so many extra clerks have had to be employed. Whilst I quite admit that everything in connection with the examination for these clerkships was carried out according to rule and whilst I have no complaint to make in regard to the people selected, I should like to ask the Minister whether it is a fact that certain appointments made prior to the introduction of the Unemployment Assistance Act were made otherwise than through the labour exchange. I have reason to believe that several appointments in the local labour exchange in Dundalk were made from Dublin and that the applicants did not apply through the local labour exchange as I believe they should have, according to rule.  Some of those who applied through the <Col N="1966" /> labour exchange were turned down. In fact, I will go so far as to say that in one of these cases the individual concerned said that he never made application, that it was on the recommendation of a member of the Party he was appointed.  I do not know what truth there is in that statement.  I should like the Minister to bear in mind that as far as I am concerned I am very sorry to have to make any charges against the Government in the making of appointments, because I know that frequently people criticise the Government for the mere sake of criticising it.  I have, however, reason to believe that the facts as given to me are correct.  I hope and trust that as far as appointments in future are concerned we have heard the last of favouritism for any particular job that comes within the purview of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his opening statement the Minister dealt with very many phases of his activities during the past year.  No doubt the Minister has been very active in doing all he possibly could to set up factories and to create employment. Certainly he has worked very hard in that direction and I congratulate him on the fact that he has succeeded in having very many new industries started all over the Twenty-Six Counties.  My criticism of the Department's work will come under various heads.  One has relation to the question of building costs.  I would suggest to the Minister that he should move very slowly in the imposition of any tariffs whatever upon materials that are used in building and which cannot be produced here, especially materials which are used in the erection of working-class houses.  It is a fact that some of the tariffs which have been imposed have considerably increased the cost of building in this country as compared with Great Britain.  I know for a fact that certain types of houses which can be built in Great Britain at anything from £550 to £600 cost £750 to £800 here.  My experience of building costs, prior to the Great War, was that the cost of building was much greater in Britain than it was in Ireland.  The reverse is now the position.  There is no doubt <Col N="1967" /> that many of the materials used in building that were tariffed cannot be produced here or, as far as I know, will not be produced here for a considerable time.  I do not think it wise on the part of the Government to impose tariffs simply for the reason that we are engaged in an economic war with Great Britain.  Some little consideration should be given to that aspect of the situation, especially when the Government at the present time is so anxious to erect houses for the working classes at a cost which will enable the tenants to pay the rents proportionate to the cost.  Every sixpence added to the cost naturally means an increased rent to the tenant.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the question of the railways and I think that he stated he had a few applications from the Great Southern Railways and one from the Great Northern relative to the proposed closing down of certain branch lines.  I think the application which came from the Great Northern line refers to Ardee branch.  I should like to inform the Minister that Ardee is a very prosperous little town, the inhabitants of which have done very much during the past 25 or 30 years to improve the trade of the town.  I hope the Minister will do his utmost to induce the Great Northern Railway Company to keep that line going.</P>
    <P>On the occasion of the last Estimate I felt called upon to speak to the Minister relative to the question of unemployment benefit for railway workers who were out of work as a result of the late strike.  On that occasion, I think the Minister promised that he would introduce a Bill to amend the Unemployment Act, with a view to enabling men who are out of work under the same conditions as these men were out of work to receive unemployment benefit.</P>

      <P>I will postpone that reference if you wish, Sir, but I think this is merely a question of the <Col N="1968" /> administration of the Act, as it stands. I would like to know from the Minister if he has given the matter any consideration since October 4th when it was brought to his notice.  If not, when will he be in a position to state if he will introduce the necessary provision in the Act, to enable men placed in a similar position in future to receive unemployment benefit?  If I remember aright the Minister on that occasion admitted that these men were entitled to receive unemployment benefit, because they were out of work against their own will, and were no party to a strike that took place at the time.</P>
      <P>I saw by the Budget statement that the imports of boots are on the increase, rather than decreasing.  That is an extraordinary state of affairs, in view of the fact that we had so many new boot factories started during the past year or two.  In answer to a question by Deputy Mulcahy, the Minister for Finance stated that the items under which increased revenue had been derived were mainly on boots and wearing apparel.  I do not know what is the cause of that; whether it is that we have certain people who still believe that the foreign article is superior to the home-made article, or who, perhaps, to use the words of the Minister for Finance, might like to crow over the neighbours by having articles made in London or Paris.  Whatever the cause, the fact remains that there has been increased imports of boots.  I want to inform the Minister that there are, as far as my knowledge goes, certain boot factories which are not fully occupied.  They have had occasion recently to suspend some of their workers for a few weeks. I would like the Minister to give that aspect of the situation serious consideration, to see whether it would not be possible to have these factories working at high pressure.  I do not suggest what means could be adopted, but I think the Minister took certain means in other directions, for the restriction of imports.  It may be that he will have to adopt that course if, as he intended, our factories are to be kept at high pressure, and to expand as quickly as possible, and thereby give employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1969" /> The Minister referred to the erection of a factory for the manufacture of industrial alcohol.  This question might be raised, partly on this Vote, and partly on the Vote for the Department of Agriculture.  As far as I know, these factories will have to use potatoes for the manufacture of industrial spirit.  I presume the Minister has in mind the position as it affects the people of Cooley.  I do not know if the Minister intends to have a factory erected in that area, but certainly something should be done quickly to ease the situation there.  It is a well-known fact that last season unfortunate farmers in that area, which is nearest to Dundalk, which was formerly their chief market town, were forced to dispose of their potatoes at 25/- a ton, the irony of the situation being that at present they can hardly sell them at all, while they have to look on helplessly and see potatoes selling from 3/6 to 4/- a cwt., or from £3 to £4 a ton in Dundalk.  I hope the Minister will push on as speedily as possible the erection of a factory for the manufacture of industrial spirit, and thereby ease the position of the people in the Cooley area.  I am not going into the question whether it will be a paying proposition or not. That is a scientific question, and demands knowledge that, I am sure, the Minister will be able to get from experts.  Whatever their opinion is, I trust that as a result of the efforts of the Government the position of farmers in Cooley area will be met.  I will not labour the question because it has now been before the House for the last seven or eight years.  It is sufficient to say that better types of farmers could not be found anywhere. They have had to put up with severe losses for some years.  I impress on the Minister the necessity of coming to their help as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Much has been said about the policy of the Minister in regard to conditions prevailing in factories. Owing to the atmosphere here, this would be the last place to discuss such a question.  It is only right and proper, however, that reference should be made to some of the statements made by the leader of the Labour <Col N="1970" /> Party on this Estimate.  While it may be possible to agree with a great deal said by Deputy Norton and by Deputy Davin, at the same time, any man who has given any little thought to our resources, and to the condition of our people generally, must come to the conclusion that this is only a little country, and that we are not possessed of the vast resources of other countries.  In my opinion, it would be much better, if, instead of unduly and unfairly criticising the Minister, all Parties co-operated with him in his endeavours to make a success of his industrial policy.  We heard a great deal about the wages paid to juveniles in factories, and we heard it stated that juveniles should not be employed there, and there was talk about continuation schools.  There is an old saying that the child must creep before it walks.  After all, the juvenile wants to make a start sometime.</P>
    <P>I would like those people who criticise the conditions in factories to endeavour properly to understand the position.  I want to make myself clear that, so far as I am personally concerned, I am out for the best conditions possible in every class of work and industry.  So far as the employment of juveniles is concerned, one must have some little thought for the thousands of families here.  One must consider especially the parents who have large families, possibly three or four boys and three or four girls.  They are not in a position to keep their children at school until they are 16 or 18 years of age.  In a great many cases it is a God-send to the parents to have their children at work.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the wages paid.  We all know that in factories, just the same as in trades when a boy comes to serve his time, he cannot expect to get a big wage when he starts to work; but as the years go on and that particular boy improves in his work I presume his wages increases. The same would apply to the young girl starting work.  In that way I think that there is not a great deal of substance in many of the charges that have been made, not alone against the Minister, but also against those who <Col N="1971" /> are engaged in these industries.  The industries are only in their infancy. We are not by any means an industrial country; we are fighting older concerns than ours, and the least we all might do is to display a little sympathy and give a little more consideration to those who, at the moment, in very trying circumstances, are endeavouring to increase employment by setting up new factories.  This is not perhaps the proper place to discuss such a question. I would much rather discuss it around a table where people could approach it in a calm way, and possibly better results would accrue from such discussions.</P>
    <P>It was stated by Deputy Davin that the Minister was not doing his duty with regard to the work of the Prices Commission.  Of course Deputy Davin, with his usual political adroitness, made use of the words &ldquo;the unfortunate farmer&rdquo; and instanced him selling his beef at 1¾d. per lb. and the butcher charging the poor man 8d. or 9d. a lb.  There does not seem to be any qualms of conscience on the part of Deputy Davin because the farmer sells his beef at 1¾d. per lb.  His only concern seems to be that if the beef were sold at 4d. per lb. there was no point in the farmer getting 1¾d.  I do not think that is honestly playing the game.  So far as I know the workers in this country, they are prepared to pay a fair price for their beef in order to give a fair return to the farmer for the labour he bestows on raising his cattle.</P>
    <P>On the whole, I think the Minister has done very well.  So far as I am personally concerned, I am aware that much has been done in the constituency I represent in increasing employment through the setting up of new industries.  I will ask the Minister to hasten very slowly in regard to the imposition of any further tariffs that would place an undue burden upon the people, especially tariffs that would raise the cost of building, in view of the fact that large numbers of houses are being erected and will, I am sure, be erected in the future, to accommodate the working-class people in our cities and towns.  I would like also to <Col N="1972" /> know if it is his intention to amend the Unemployment Insurance Act so that the men to whom I have referred who were entitled to benefit, and other people who may in future be placed in a similar position, will be treated satisfactorily.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>With the exception of the last two speeches and perhaps one other speech, the criticism of the activities of the Department of Industry and Commerce voiced from the benches opposite was somewhat different to what I had anticipated.  I should have thought that the Party opposite would have considered it good policy to have based their main attack against the Department on the delay which has occurred in the establishment of certain industries which were in contemplation or the development of other industries to the point at which they would be supplying all the requirements of the country.  I feel that any Party in Opposition that was genuinely anxious to fulfil its duty as an Opposition and to ginger up the Government to do good and carry out its programme would have taken that line. I think it would have been wise to have taken that line even if no other consideration except the very narrow one of Party advantage was borne in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Quite a number of the speeches which were delivered from the opposite benches gave evidence of the existence in that Party still of the mentality which regards Irish industry as something degraded and unclean and the policy of developing Irish industry as wrong, something to be impeded and obstructed and, if possible, defeated. The main subject upon which members of the Opposition and certain members of the Labour Party spoke was the conditions which they allege exist in Irish factories.  I can easily understand the resentment which some of the speeches made must have created in the minds of those who are associated with Irish industry, a resentment which found expression in the speech of Deputy Minch.  Whereas it is quite possible that in some Irish factories conditions are not what they should be, any attack upon these conditions should be directed against the individual firms concerned and not against <Col N="1973" /> Irish industry as a whole.  Unfortunately the attack was on Irish industry as a whole.  The speeches made by Deputy Norton, Deputy Mulcahy, and other Deputies opposite were all directed towards creating the idea that all Irish industry was a matter of baby farms, sweat-shops, and the like.</P>
    <P>These speeches have been reported, and very widely reported, not merely in the Press of this country, but the Press of other countries.  These speeches got considerable publicity in the Press of other countries.  Deputies forget that there are a number of industries connected with the export trade; and the general description of industry which they gave in their speeches was applied to the entire industry in this country.  It has gone abroad throughout the world that Irish industry as a whole is based on child labour, wretched wages, factories conducted under insanitary and unhealthy conditions.  I asked Deputies what were the firms to which they were referring and with one exception they refused to answer.  That is bad policy; and it is bad policy for several reasons. The statements made are obviously not true when applied to industry as a whole.  Secondly, even if they are true, they should not be made except in such a manner as to leave no ambiguity and doubt in anyone's mind as to the firms and the industries to which they related.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacDermot said that Deputy Norton's speech was reported upon a back page of the <i>Irish Press.</i>  He will have noted it was reported in a front page of the <i>Irish Times</i> and of the <i>Irish Independent.</i>  Both of them gave Deputy Norton's statements about sweated workshops employing young children at low wages great publicity. They wrote leading articles about them.  I have these leading articles here.  He is quoted as having said that the conditions existing</P>
    <P>&ldquo;were undermining decent rates of wages, and were a menace to well-established firms which paid trade union rates of wages&rdquo;</P>
    <P>and again:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is a misuse of language to <Col N="1974" /> describe these places as factories.  It is not fair to people who have invested real capital in enterprises to permit operations of the kind.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These statements should not be made in the manner they were made by Deputies or newspapers unless they are prepared to relate them to particular firms or industries.  The <i>Irish Independent</i> and the <i>Irish Times</i> black-leaded these phrases.  They did not attempt to relate them to any individual firms or industries, no doubt thinking that they would lose advertisement revenue if they did so.  They do not refuse to accept advertisements from any firms that offer them.</P>
    <P>There is another consideration. Many of the people associated with the ownership of these newspapers are also associated with the control of a number of these industries.  There are very few industries in the Free State as a whole in which, for example, the rate of wages paid to adult workers&mdash;the lowest rate of wages paid to adult workers&mdash;is lower than the lowest rate paid to a number of employees in the railway.  On the board of each of these newspapers there are railway directors. There are, at the present time, negotiations proceeding between the boards of the railway companies and the members of the union of railway employees concerning these rates of wages.  I trust that we can take it from these leading articles that these directors of these newspapers will show that in the course of these negotiations they are prepared to stand, for the first time, for a policy of rising wages.  I am all for a policy of rising wages.  I think it was a very disastrous mistake for this country ever to embark upon a policy of general reduction in wages.  I think it was a mistake for any country to embark upon that policy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>My views, in that regard, are very similar to those embodied in the report of the Director of the International Labour Conference in a statement to be put before that body next week.  He said:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Reliance on wage reduction as a <Col N="1975" /> sovereign remedy for unemployment has certainly been rudely shaken by the experience of the present depression. Though it is never possible to isolate the wages factor from the many other factors which influence the flow of business, there is evidence to show that wage cutting, so far from being a stimulus to employment, may possibly have worked in the opposite sense.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to hear Deputies on the opposite benches standing up against a policy of low wages.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that is true; in fact, I think it is quite a new development in their Party.  It was indeed by the Party opposite and the Government that preceded this one that the general wage reduction campaign was initiated.  Not only did they deliberately set out to reduce the general wage level for labourers in this country, but they did so in a most drastic manner.  They even suppressed the Dublin Municipal Council because it refused to reduce the wages of the workers.  They publicly announced their policy of producing a general reduction in costs by reducing wage payments all round.  No doubt, in pursuing that policy they were following the Governments of many other countries, but they were wrong, as the Governments of other countries were wrong.  It was that policy the world over which produced the depression in 1929 which is yet with us.  If we are to get out of that we have to go in a contrary direction, and reverse that policy.  We have to ensure that there is an all-round increase in the purchasing power of the workers, who constitute by far the greatest bulk of the population of this country, and spend upon consumption goods, probably, more than 75 per cent. of the total amount spent upon such goods in any one year.  I am delighted to learn from the speeches of Deputies opposite that we are to have their support in any policy of that kind, and I am much more pleased to learn from the leading <Col N="1976" /> articles of the <i>Irish Times</i> and of the <i>Irish Independent</i> that we will have their moral support in that policy also.  Of course, it may be that the <i>Irish Times</i> and the <i>Irish Independent</i> merely decided that any stick was good enough to beat the Government with, and that they gave headlines to Deputy Norton's phrases without consideration of their possible effect on industrial interests.  Perhaps they will wake up to the fact some day that they were ratting upon their class, even though for once they might, by mistake, be defending good national policy.</P>
      <P>It is quite true that there is need for new legislation for the regulation of factories and workshops in the State.  The main legislation was passed over 30 years ago and things have changed very considerably since and new legislation is required. But we object to Deputies opposite telling us that new legislation is required.  They were in office here for ten years, and it never occurred to them during that period.  This Government has been in office for two years, and we have reached the position when we will be able to introduce a Factories and Workshops Bill in this session.  It is a big Bill.  It took a long time to prepare.  As originally framed it was contemplated that it would fill 450 pages.  We are trying to get it reduced so that the Deputies opposite will not be asked to work too hard merely to read it.  We will get it reduced.  It is, nevertheless, going to be a comprehensive measure. It is going to represent a codification of all the existing factory and workshop legislation, and a modernisation of it.  It will contain a number of additional provisions which, in our opinion, modern conditions necessitate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Rice told us that factories can be established in kitchens, basements, stables, lofts and the like.  Of course they can.  That is the law.  If factories are being established in these places at the present time we cannot stop that.  That is the law as we found it when we came into office.  We are going to change it, but this Government is not open to criticism because <Col N="1977" /> that is the law.  Our predecessors are. I do not think it is right that any factory should be established in a basement. I do not think that we should permit any factory to be brought into existence the main floor of which is below the level of the adjoining thoroughfare.  I do not think a factory should be allowed to be operated in a house that is occupied for living purposes by anyone except the proprietor of the factory.  I think that we must have very rigid conditions regulating the ventilation, the heating, the cleanliness, the safety and so forth of factories and workshops.  We are taking steps to that end.  I hope that we are going to get support for the legislation that will be necessary to ensure that the conditions in Irish factories will in future be all that we desire them to be.  I doubt it.  Judging by the attitude of the Party opposite on other legislative proposals to improve social conditions here, we are not likely to get their support in this matter. Perhaps they may feel that they have committed themselves by their speeches on this Estimate.</P>
    <P>The legislation controlling working hours is also antiquated.  There is, in fact, no legislation controlling the working hours for men.  There is certain legislation in operation affecting the working hours for women and children.  At the present time it would be illegal to employ a woman or a child for more than 12 hours a day or for more than 60 hours a week.  That is the law as the Cumann na nGaedheal Government left it.  When Deputies opposite criticise the Government because it is possible that, in certain industries, women or young people are being worked for 60 hours a week or for 12 hours a day, the answer is that there is no power to stop it: that the legislative instrument which we inherited from our predecessors deprives us of the power to stop it, and that the re-fashioning of the instrument necessary to deal with that situation is at the present time in progress. We have not delayed about it.</P>
    <P>There has been a lot of talk too about child labour.  There is, of course, no power at the present time to regulate the type of labour that may be <Col N="1978" /> employed in various industries.  There are certain powers to regulate employment in a few industries in which employment was, in the past, generally regarded as being detrimental to health.  But, apart from the very few industries covered by that legislation, there is, practically speaking, no power at all to determine whether in any particular occupation the persons employed must be men, women or children. We are going to take the power of regulation.  I do not know if the Deputies opposite want to abolish the employment of young persons altogether in industry.  Judging by the speeches of some of them I thought that they had that idea in their minds. It is, of course, illegal to employ anyone under 14 years of age.  Up to that age young people must be at school, but after they have reached the age of 14 there is no compulsory school attendance, and the law contemplated that such young people would go out and seek employment, generally employment by way of apprenticeship: that they would learn some occupation.  It may be that the school leaving age is too low.</P>
    <P>There is at the present time a Commission, established by this Government, considering the measures that would follow as a consequence of a decision to increase the school-leaving age.  It is obvious that any attempt to increase it is going to create very great difficulties.  They talked about it in Great Britain some years ago, but when they came to measure the cost and the difficulties involved they did not proceed with it.  They may proceed with it now, but they have not done so yet.  Increasing the school-leaving age, in so far as it involved very heavy additional expenditure upon education, on the provision of schools and of teachers, would be a very serious step, but linked up with it is the much more serious consideration that the average working family cannot afford to give its younger members the benefit of continuous education up to the age of 16 or 17.  In Great Britain, when they contemplated raising the school-leaving age to 16 they also had to contemplate the provision of payments to the parents of the children to compensate <Col N="1979" /> the parents for the loss of earning power of their children.</P>
    <P>There is nothing wrong in young persons of 15, 16 or 17 years of age being employed in industrial occupations, provided they are so engaged for the purpose of learning some trade which will be a source of earning power to them in after life; but there is considerable objection to those industries which are established upon the employment of young persons only: those industries which are usually described as blind-alley occupations where young persons come in at 14 or 15 years of age, are kept on until unemployment insurance contributions have to be paid on behalf of them, are then dismissed and their places taken by other young persons brought in for the first time.  That type of employment has very definitely got to be regulated and prohibited so that young persons, on leaving school and going into industry, will be given some avenue along which they can continually make progress until they are in a position to earn an adult wage and provide for themselves.</P>
    <P>I think that there may be undue emphasis placed on the fact that a number of young persons are employed in industry in this country at present, due to the fact that a number of the industries which are being established are new industries.  I have noticed that employers, as a body, like to take in young persons when it is a matter of training workers in some new occupation.  They find it much easier to train youths of 17, 18 or 19 in some new industrial process than older men, and consequently where a new factory is being established in a district where no such factory ever existed before&mdash; where it is necessary to train the labour engaged from the raw&mdash;the tendency always is to take younger people in preference to older people. We may deplore that tendency but there it is, and at present we have no power to control it.  In due course these younger people will have reached adult age and will still be employed in these factories.  The only objection that would arise there would be if the practice were to become habitual as was alleged in the case of the Wexford firm.  The allegation there was that <Col N="1980" /> the firm mentioned took in young persons, that it dispensed with their services when they had reached adult age, and replaced them by young persons employed for the first time.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish asked us to hold an inquiry in the case of the firm he mentioned. The Deputy knows that inquiry was held and that certain discussions took place between the officers of the Department of Industry and Commerce and the management of that firm.  But we have no power to do more than make representations. Deputies may take it from me very definitely that I am of opinion that undue employment of young persons as a policy is detrimental to national interests and will have to be stopped. It is inevitable in modern commercial life, with the kind of competition that exists between one industrialist and another for markets, that one firm is bound to seek competitive advantages over another, first, by replacing male labour by female labour and subsequently replacing female labour by juvenile labour, not because female labour is more suitable than male labour, or that juvenile labour is more suitable than adult labour, but because in each case lower costs can be secured and the goods can be marketed at a lower price than the figure at which their competitors can market them and an increase of business secured.</P>
    <P>There are only two ways in which that situation can be remedied.  One is by such a degree of regulation as would be indistinguishable from what Deputy MacDermot calls State socialism or secondly, by imposing conditions by which no one firm will be able to obtain competitive advantage by debasing labour in that way. Neither is there any attempt by the State at the present time to regulate wages except in Trade Board trades.  It was always contemplated that the rates of wages paid in industry would be regulated by agreements entered into between the representatives of the employers and the workers.  I think that is the best system of getting an elastic arrangement in any industry.  Occasionally, you will have disputes. <Col N="1981" /> There will be a falling out and an inability to agree between two parties. In such a case the Department of Industry and Commerce intervenes and endeavours to negotiate agreements. Our aim has been to establish a permanent industrial council in each industry so that grievances would be discussed and an endeavour made to negotiate a settlement before any strike or lock-out occurred.  We have succeeded in doing that in one industry, and efforts will be made to bring it into existence in other industries. In certain industries it is not possible to contemplate that fixation of wages by agreement, because the industries are in such a way that it is not possible to make such arrangements. These are industries which are subject to trade boards.</P>
    <P>In passing, I should say that some confusion may have arisen from my statement that the packing trade is subject to a trade board.  The usual formalities for the bringing of that trade subject to a trade board have been taken; the usual legal notices required by law have been published and so forth.  It is possible that the actual board has not been constituted but, in any event, it will be in operation in the very near future.</P>
    <P>In the case of all these other trades there is a board consisting of an equal number of representatives of the employers and employees with the chairman appointed by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  Occasionally there are other appointed members but not more than three.  These boards arrive at recommendations as to the minimum wage to be paid in the industry.  That minimum wage is enforced by law, and it becomes an offence against the law to pay a lower wage.  There have been recently a number of prosecutions for that offence.  Although in earlier years certain legal difficulties prevented the Act being fully operated&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Any review would have to be of a general nature or it would necessarily be of an undue length. There were a number of matters raised with which I will deal and I will try to be as brief as I can.  I will take the industries in groups. The first group consists of food, drink and tobacco.  It covers a fairly wide range of industries&mdash; bacon curing, milling, confectionery, jam manufacture, meat, vegetables and so forth.  The figures show that there has been an increase in the number of people employed in that group of over 2,000 since 1931.  Flour milling, baking, and confectionery manufacture account for the bulk of the increase.  In that group of industries, except in the case of flour milling, there have been very few new establishments.  The development that has taken place has been in the form of an increased output in the existing establishments.  In the figure I have mentioned there is not <Col N="1984" /> included the employment given in the packing of foodstuffs and so forth in consequence of the package tax. That is regarded as a separate group of industries, in which over 1,200 persons have been employed.  In order, however, to measure precisely the effects of Government policy during the past two years, it is necessary to examine the position regarding food production generally, including not only industrial but agricultural production.  In 1931 the total imports of foodstuffs of animal origin amounted in value to over £2,500,000.  The value of these imports was reduced in 1933 to £400,000.  Of that £400,000, £266,000, or 66 per cent. of the total, is represented by the import of fish, which is, in fact, the only substantial item still left.  Under the heading of &ldquo;Cereals and feeding stuffs for animals,&rdquo; there was a total import in 1931 to the value of over £6,000,000, while the corresponding figure for 1933 was less than £2,500,000.  In 1931 the value of the import of wheaten flour amounted to £1,700,000.  In 1931 that figure had dropped to £700,000 and will, we trust, disappear altogether this year. The production of that quantity of wheaten flour increased the production of offals, with corresponding effects on the import of offals.  Oat products which, in 1931, had been imported to the value of about £90,000 fell, in 1933, to £7,000.  Under the heading of &ldquo;Miscellaneous articles of food,&rdquo; the total imports in 1931, omitting such articles as tea, coffee, raw cocoa and hops, amounted to about £2,000,000, which sum was halved in 1933.  The remaining £1,000,000 will practically disappear when the new sugar factories come into operation.</P>

      <P>I have not got the figures.  I am dealing only with industrial products, as such.  In the apparel group, there are, of course, many different industries.  Since 1931 there has been an increase in employment <Col N="1985" /> in the apparel industry of about 4,500 persons, which represents a doubling of the employment given in that industry. That expansion involved the establishment of about 70 new factories of various kinds.  These new factories alone gave employment to 2,500 persons, the balance representing increased employment in existing concerns. The figure which I gave for employment does not include tailoring, dressmaking or millinery establishments. It refers only to what is known in the trade as &ldquo;factory production.&rdquo; There is evidence of a very substantial increase in the number of persons engaged in tailoring, dressmaking and millinery work on their own behalf.  The Department places that figure at about 1,000.  In the year 1931 the total import under the heading of Apparel, excluding boots and shoes, amounted to £3,750,000.  In 1933 that had fallen to £2,000,000, showing a drop in imports to the value of about £1,750,000.  There is clearly room for considerably increased production and employment in the present year, and in future years, under that heading.</P>

      <P>The position is: the industry supplied 50 per cent. of the requirements in 1933.  There has been continuous increase in production, involving, as the Deputy knows, a new factory which opened during the present week.  It is not possible to say with precision what percentage of the total trade of the country these factories are capable of supplying in the present year.  In that connection, Deputy Mulcahy and Deputy Coburn referred to the fact that the import figures for the first quarter of the present year showed an increase. That increase is, I think, due to two causes.  The first and, I think, the main cause, was anticipation on the part of certain firms that the duty on boots and shoes would be increased, or that the Control of Manufactures Act would be operated to restrict imports. For that reason, they were getting in supplies in advance.  The increase is also due to the fact that a very large proportion of the retail trade in boots and shoes is in the hands of English multiple shops.  One Deputy&mdash;I think it was Deputy Coburn &mdash;talked about the possibility of people still preferring to buy English boots or shoes.  I do not think that that is so.  I think that the public is very well satisfied with the value, quality and style of the boots produced by the Saorstát factories.  But they are not always able to get them. That is due to the fact that these multiple shops have arrangements made with manufacturers in Great Britain under which they take the whole output of a single factory.  They can afford to pay the import duty here if they spread the cost of paying that <Col N="1987" /> duty over their entire sales, whether in this country or in Great Britain.  We have made various representations to the management of these stores and not without result.  The situation will, however, require careful watching to ensure that boot and shoe manufacturers here get an opportunity of doing what they are rapidly becoming capable of doing&mdash;supplying the total requirements of the country.  I think that there is still room for one or two, if not more, additional boot and shoe factories before we can say that our production capacity is all that it might be.  The number of additional workers employed in the industry as compared with 1931 is 1,400.  It is to be noted in the case of that industry that we have succeeded in doing what Deputy Minch was talking about&mdash;securing a degree of decentralisation.  The new factories are situate in Dundalk, Drogheda, Kells, Kilkenny and Limerick, while the existing factories of Cork, Waterford, Carlow and Dublin have also benefited by the measures adopted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the textile group, with the exception of two new plants, established for the manufacture of rope and twine, the additional employment of roughly 1,000, as compared with the figure for 1931, took place in existing establishments&mdash;the numerous woollen mills, the linen and cotton factories and the jute spinning and weaving factories. It is to be noted that the total import of textiles in 1933, as compared with 1931 showed no reduction.  That, of course, was due to the fact that, despite the rapid increase in the production of textile goods here, the expansion in the ready-made clothing trade, which is the principal market for these goods, was still more rapid, and the demand of the ready-made clothing trade for piece goods was met partly from the increased production of the Saorstát mills and partly from the increased imports of the type of cloth they required.  The Department at present is concentrating on the possibility of securing the production here of the cheaper grades of cloth which are required, in the main, by the ready-made clothing trade.  As is <Col N="1988" /> well known, most of the Saorstát woollen mills produce high-grade cloth only, for which they are able to find an export market on merit.  In our opinion, there is room for at least six additional mills to produce the lower-grade cloth which is represented by the 6,000,000 square yards which we imported last year, and we have at present under consideration plans to secure the establishment of these mills in various parts of the country.</P>
    <P>Under the heading of metal manufactures there has been an increase of employment of about 2,000 as compared with 1931.  A number of workshops were established for the assembling of various metal articles, such as gas cookers, gas meters, weighing machines, bicycles and so forth.  The main increase in employment, however, in connection with these firms, was in connection with the fabrication of constructional steel and in the manufacture of metal window frames and so forth.  The general foundry and engineering trade, which was languishing for many years owing to severe competition from abroad, can now give increased employment to over 400 workers.  A new plant has been established for the manufacture of galvanised hollow ware and various other articles, such as the manufacture of wire, spades and shovels, tin containers, brass rods, gun-metal goods, razor blades, reinforcing metal, sparking plugs, motor radiators, coffin mountings and so forth.</P>
    <P>As a result of the protective duties and the other measures that have been adopted by the Government, all the commercial motor car bodies and omnibus bodies used here are now manufactured in the Saorstát and a very substantial beginning has been made in the creation of an industry for the assembling of chassis and the assembling of the bodies for the ordinary private motor car.  There are six or seven makes of car now on the market which are entirely assembled in the Saorstát both as to chassis and body.  Perhaps I should not say that they are entirely assembled here, but assembled in accordance with the definition of <Col N="1989" /> assembly which has been prepared by me and which qualifies the persons conforming to that definition to obtain certain facilities in the matter of importing parts and in the matter of the road tax concession where the horse power exceeds 16.  With regard to the question of wood and timber, up to last year practically all the timber requirements of the Saorstát were imported planed and dressed, but the imposition of the new duties has resulted in a substituted import of raw timber.  Modern fast-planing machines have been installed by a number of saw-milling firms.  The imports of builder's woodwork, which, prior to 1931, had been imported to an average value of about £60,000, fell in 1933 to a value of £15,000, despite the substantial increase that took place here in building activities in that year.  That also we have reason to think should disappear this year. The domestic woodware imported in 1931 was about five times the value of that imported in 1933.  Furniture imports also fell by half.  Wooden boxes and parts are now imported only to the value of about half the amount formerly imported, and the current year should see that disappear also.  Other wooden manufactures which were imported in 1931 to the value of £200,000 are now all being produced at home.  We have found considerable difficulty in getting precise figures as to the numbers of persons employed in that trade because it is carried on in a very large number of establishments all over the country, but we estimate that the increased employment cannot be less than 1,000 or 1,500.</P>
    <P>There has been a very definite expansion in the production of all classes of goods required in the erection of houses&mdash;bricks, roofing materials, and so on&mdash;and about 25 new concerns have been opened for the production of these goods.  Deputy Brodrick spoke at some length on the question of slate production.  I cannot say that I am satisfied with the present slate production in the Saorstát.  I think that those who control the slate quarries might have <Col N="1990" /> shown considerably more enterprise and courage in the matter of the investment of capital and in the increasing of the production of these goods, which are in very considerable demand.  In fact, not merely are they in demand in this country, but in other countries.  I am informed by the proprietors of one of the principal slate quarries in the country that they have on their books orders from other countries sufficient to absorb their total output.  Accordingly, we could have supplied not merely all the requirements of our own country, but could have developed an export trade as well.  As it is, we do not even supply our own requirements, and licences for importing in certain cases have to be issued by the Department of Local Government.  Actually, there is no import duty on slates&mdash;Deputy Brodrick is misinformed in that regard &mdash;but the Department of Local Government and Public Health have laid down a condition that they will not give the housing grant in respect of any houses except Irish roofing materials have been used.  Occasionally, however, they have permitted the use of imported slate in these houses where special circumstances made it undesirable that tiles should be used, and they are taking a similar course in respect of other housing materials where home production is inadequate.</P>
    <P>There has been a substantial expansion in the production of grates, ranges, rain-water goods, and so on, but even still we are not producing anything like enough of these articles. No matter how substantial an increase in their output the existing foundries may be able to show there is, in addition to these foundries, room for one large foundry for the production of grates, ranges, rain-water goods, and so on, and we are trying to make arrangements for the establishment of such a factory in the South of Ireland.</P>
    <P>With regard to the production of slate, there were four slate quarries in operation in 1931.  At the present time, we have got ten in active commercial operation, and in the case of about seven additional quarries there is work in progress at present&mdash;not, however, on slate production, but in preparing <Col N="1991" /> the quarry for production or in exploration work, such as the clearing of over-burden&mdash;work which is, in the main, subsidised by the Department of Industry and Commerce.  The main slate quarries at present in production are in Tipperary, Cork, one in Donegal, and recently a slate quarry which exists in Mayo has been granted facilities under the Trade Loan Acts and should be able to increase its production in the very near future.  There have, of course, been very considerable developments in the printing, stationery and bag and box-making industries, and as Deputies are aware, two large factories for the production of cartons and boxes are at present being built in Dublin, in addition to five new establishments which have already been brought into existence. There are a very large number of industries in respect to which detailed reports would take a long time, such as those dealing with paints, polishes, soaps and candles, pottery, tanning, glass bottles and so forth.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a reduction of about 30 in the total number employed in the tobacco industry, a reduction which was substantially less than I anticipated because there have been very considerable developments in the type of equipment used in tobacco factories, which, in other countries, have resulted in the elimination of labour to a very large extent, so much so that the German Government, contrary to what one would have considered the spirit of the German nation, has recently made a <Col N="1992" /> decree prohibiting the use of machinery in the cigar industry so that hand labour only will be employed.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mulcahy asked what was the position in connection with hosiery. The position is, so far as plain hosiery is concerned, that the existing concerns are probably capable of supplying all the requirements of the country and, in fact, there is some small export trade in hosiery of various kinds.  We are not, by any means, supplying our full requirements in ladies' silk hosiery and various types of fancy hosiery.  The existing establishments are capable of supplying much more of the market than in fact they are supplying, but these are a class of goods in respect of which advertising counts a big lot and many well-known brands have got a hold on the public taste which it will not be easy to break&mdash;not that the imported goods are any different or any better.  In some cases, they are much worse and are certainly dearer than the products of the Saorstát concerns.  The public do not appreciate that the same yarn is used, in exactly the same machines and under exactly the same conditions, in all factories producing these goods and there is, in fact, no difference whatever between the ladies' silk stockings produced in Leicester or some other English town and the ladies' silk stockings produced in this country.  The machinery, the yarn, the work, the skill of the workers and everything else are precisely the same in all cases; the only thing different is the name on the package and the amount spent on advertising&mdash;and the more money spent on advertising, the dearer the price at which the goods have to be sold.  It is anticipated, however, that we should be able to remove entirely the item of hosiery from the import list in the present year.  Certain developments are still necessary in the matter of very cheap hosiery but three new factories have been established mainly for the production of cheap hosiery since the beginning of the year and when they get into full production, I think the last of that item will disappear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Broderick spoke at considerable length about matters relating to <Col N="1993" /> building and Deputy Coburn also strongly advised us not to do anything which would result in an increase in building costs.  I am not satisfied that buildings costs cannot be reduced in this country.  I think there are factors operating to keep these costs up which will have to be dealt with and removed.  I do not wish, however, to say anything on the matter, as the Prices Commission, as Deputies are aware, is engaged in an investigation into the costs of all building requisites. There is, I think, no reason whatever why woodword or bricks or tiles or slates or paints or varnishes or any other thing required in the construction of a house should not be as cheap in this country as they are in any country.  In fact, in respect of some, there is every reason to say that they should be cheaper.  In the case of woodwork, for example, where the raw material is imported mainly from the Baltic, the mills here get it free of duty, whereas the mills in Northern Ireland and Great Britain have to pay 10 per cent.  duty and yet the price of woodwork is higher here than in either of these countries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>Very much higher.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Much too much higher. There is, of course, room for considerable expansion in the production of bricks.  There are quite a number of places in this country where excellent bricks can be produced and although a number of brickworks have been opened in various parts of the country, there is still room for more, particularly in the West.  Bricks are an article which have this peculiar characteristic&mdash;they cannot be transported for long distances and it is not economic to transport them by rail at all.  Consequently, it is an industry which lends itself to the establishment of small local works supplying local requirements.  It is not likely at any time to be developed upon other lines, whereby we would have one large works supplying the requirements of the country, and if there is anybody in Galway interested in the production of bricks in Galway, we shall be very glad to facilitate him in every way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the matter of marble, about <Col N="1994" /> which Deputy Broderick also spoke, certain developments are taking place.  We had at one time a substantial export trade but it completely disappeared.  In fact, all production had stopped for many years when I came to examine the position first.  Production has now been commenced at two or three centres and marble is being quarried for use in connection with various buildings which are in course of erection&mdash;public buildings of various kinds and cathedrals and churches. The possibility of regaining our export market in marble is a matter that requires examination.  The chief competitors in the market are, of course, the Italians, who have their industry very highly developed and very highly organised.  They have a very strong hold on the market, and it will not be an easy task to break into that market again.  In connection with the marble question and also the brick, tile and slate questions, however, I want Deputies to appreciate that the Department of Industry and Commerce has no power to engage in the production of these things.  Our sole function is to interest private individuals or groups of individuals in getting into that form of production and facilitating and assisting any such groups that we may get and if, in fact, there is nobody willing to invest money or to undertake the organisation of a company for the production of any of these things, the Department has very little power indeed, although in certain cases it might be prepared directly to undertake production as a form of State enterprise.  That is something, however, which, I think, we ought not to attempt to do until other possibilities have been fully explored, because it is bound to land us in a number of difficulties.</P>

I promised Deputy Coburn that I would do my best to find some <Col N="1995" /> formula which would have the effect he desired.  We have been examining that matter, and I cannot say that I see a solution of the problem yet.  Our efforts to find a solution have been complicated by the fact that the particular section of the Department which is directly concerned in the matter has been very heavily overworked in recent months in connection with the coming into operation of the Unemployment Assistance Act.  As soon as that work becomes routine, and the machinery is working smoothly, we will be able to give more attention to the matter.  I can assure the Deputy that it is not being overlooked.</P>

      <P>I am awaiting the Deputy's suggestions.  Deputy Coburn also referred to the appointment of clerks in connection with the labour exchanges.  I presume he must refer to temporary clerks, because it is only in connection with temporary clerks that the Minister for Industry and Commerce has any function.  Permanent clerks in connection with those exchanges are recruited by the Civil Service Commissioners.  The appointments of those temporary clerks are made at headquarters.  This is and always has been the practice.  Appointments are made from the lists prepared by the local exchange manager, who prepares that list from those who are registered as unemployed at the local exchange.  The persons on the list are interviewed by an officer of the Department who makes his comments upon their suitability. The report containing those comments is then sent up to Dublin, where the decision is made as to who will get the appointment.  In fact, the procedure is quite an elaborate one to operate in connection with those posts, which carry a very low salary, and which frequently do not last very long.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of Deputies directed their remarks to the question of the establishment of an industrial alcoholic plant.  I should say that we are not establishing an industry; we are starting <Col N="1996" /> an experiment.  The purpose of the experiment is to find out if there are any special circumstances, either in the climate of this country or the soil of this country, which would enable industrial alcohol to be produced here under circumstances more favourable than in other countries.  We think the experiment will probably prove successful.  There is reason to believe that we can grow a variety of potatoes with a very high starch content. There is reason to believe that the climate of this country will permit of a campaign season much longer than is found possible elsewhere, and that, consequently, we will be able to get the costs of production much below the figure which has been achieved in other countries.  There are, of course, uses for industrial alcohol other than transport purposes.  In the majority of continental countries they have at the present time legislation requiring the compulsory admixture of home-produced industrial alcohol with imported petrol for transport purposes. We contemplate taking similar powers by legislation here, but nobody need postpone buying a car on that account, because the total maximum production of the plant now proposed to be established, mixed with imported petrol, will be hardly noticed.  The total production available for transport purposes is not likely to exceed 500,000 gallons, whereas our total consumption of petrol in any one year is about 40,000,000 gallons.  The admixture of 500,000 with the 40,000,000 will have a very small effect.</P>

You can pay whatever price you like for the potatoes; you can pay whatever price you like for the coal; you can pay your worker and your manager as much as you like, and work out how much it is going to cost, bearing in mind that we are going to purchase the wash for cattle food at 1/2d. per gallon.</P>

      <P>That is 4½d., so the net cost of his raw material is going to be 1/4½ at least The Minister is borrowing £132,000 for his experiment.  If he is paying off the interest and principal and depreciation at, say, 6 per cent., that is going to work out at 2½d., so the net cost of his raw material, after deducting interest, depreciation and all that, is going to be 1/7, and the Minister told us that he is going to turn out a gallon of the stuff at 1/9.  That leaves 2d. a gallon for the complete process of conversion. The Minister has made himself responsible for that statement.  I should like to know does the Minister stand over that simple sum, or does he ask us to wipe that off the blackboard completely, and off the records of this House, and go back to this new sum, because before working out the answer <Col N="1999" /> to this new sum I should like to know if he repudiates the old one.</P>

      <P>They are going on well. Deputy Coburn asked where these experimental plants were to be established.  We propose to establish them in North Louth and in the surrounding areas.  That district was selected precisely for the reasons stated by Deputy Coburn, that you have there in North Louth a peculiar situation&mdash;a district where potato growing has been the mainstay of the population for generations but where, on account of the regulations of the Department of Agriculture, they are not allowed to sell them in the Free State, due to the prevalence of black scab in the soil. The establishment of two of these distilleries will, we hope, secure the complete utilisation of all the potatoes grown in that area.  We hope to get the distilleries established and working in time to deal with this year's crop, but I can give no undertaking that that will be done, because there have been <Col N="2000" /> a number of unexpected delays already, and I am not optimistic enough to say that there will be no more.</P>

The purpose of the experiment, however, is to find out if we can grow here in quantity potatoes with a much higher starch content than 18 per cent.  We may be able to get up to 22 or 23 per cent. in which case the price of the industrial alcohol will be lower.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree, but the loss of the year was due to unexpected delays. There were a number of comments on the peat scheme.  I have here extracts from all the speeches made upon the peat scheme by Deputies opposite during the various debates that took place.  They are quite amusing reading now.  I do not propose to read them, however.  Deputies will be glad to hear that the peat scheme is proceeding quite satisfactorily.  There were, of course, the usual suggestions from Deputy Belton that some of the £20,000 to be voted this year is going to provide salaries for the organisers of the Fianna Fáil Party.  It would not be a bad idea, but, unfortunately, the expenditure of that sum is going to be controlled by the Peat Marketing Board, which consists of the Chairman <Col N="2001" /> of the Agricultural Credit Corporation, a Director of the I.A.O.S. and an officer of the Department of Industry and Commerce and, in part, by the I.A.O.S., which will have control of most of the expenditure upon the organisation of peat societies, etc. Unfortunately, Deputy Belton's suggestion did not occur to us in time or we might have arranged otherwise.</P>
      <P>Deputy Brodrick said nobody could get work in connection with bog road schemes undertaken in the West of Ireland except he was a member of the Fianna Fáil Party, that any member of the Blueshirts, as he called them, was debarred from getting employment. I want to know if Deputies opposite repudiate as supporters of theirs all persons at present employed either as gangers or workers on relief schemes. Are they prepared to say that none of them are supporters of their Party or, if they think they are supporters of their Party, that they do not want them?  Of course they will not.  They know quite well that there has been a completely impartial administration of these schemes.  The one thing we are going to do is to see that membership or support of the Fianna Fáil Party is not going to be a barrier to any person getting employment as a ganger or worker.  It has been a barrier for ten years.  The one change effected when the Fianna Fáil Government came into office was to remove that barrier so that its own supporters had an equal chance with anybody else engaged in that work.  There is no Deputy opposite who does not know that we have in fact injured ourselves and our own supporters in every county in Ireland by a rigid adherence to that impartial administration.  They print in their official organ the resolutions passed by the Fianna Fáil clubs disbanding themselves as a protest against the appointment of some Blueshirt as a ganger in their district. Yet, despite the fact that they can read these resolutions and print them in their organ they come and make these allegations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Both Deputy Mulcahy and Deputy Morrissey asked what was the position in respect of cement.  I had hoped that we would have had the foundation <Col N="2002" /> stones laid by this.  We were engaged in negotiations with a well-known Continental company for the establishment of cement factories in this country. These negotiations had reached the stage where nothing was left except to get the signatures to the dotted line.  Then at that particular stage certain things happened in the company as a result of which there was a new board of directors&mdash;circumstances under which the company could not immediately proceed to take up with us where the old board had left off.  The position was, in effect, brought back to where it was when we started.  Negotiations have been opened up again with a number of different firms interested in the position, and I trust that within a month from to-day we shall have reached the position where some agreement will have been made which will enable the establishment of the industry here to be commenced. I do not say that the actual business of erecting the factories will commence within a month, but, in so far as the Department of Industry and Commerce is concerned, the making of the arrangements to that end will be complete within that period.  Again I say that our hopes may be disappointed, but on this occasion I do not think they will, except, of course, some entirely unexpected development takes place such as occurred before.</P>
    <P>Deputy Coburn and other Deputies referred to the position in respect of the closing down of certain branch railway lines.  I stated in the Dáil, when the Railways Bill was going through the Oireachtas, that I would not refuse an order for the closing down of a branch line in any case where it was clear that the public were not supporting the line&mdash;that the number of passengers travelling or the amount of merchandise transported over the line was clearly not paying the working expenses.  That would be the general rule, although there may be exceptions to the rule.  In the case of the Ardee branch, in which Deputy Coburn is interested, the railway company have applied only for an order permitting them to terminate the passenger service. They do not propose, I understand, to terminate the services of <Col N="2003" /> goods trains.  I must say that I cannot see why passenger trains should be run on that particular branch when a much better service can be given by omnibuses. The bus service can be extended as the traffic extends and can be run much earlier and much later in the day than the trains.  Where only a short distance is involved they are just as comfortable a means of travelling.</P>
    <P>Deputy Morrissey asked about the position in connection with Slievardagh coal.  We have been considering the various measures which would have to be taken to secure the development of the extensive anthracite coal resources at Slievardagh in County Tipperary. The services of a very well known English coal-mining engineering firm have been engaged and the experts of that firm are, I think, at present engaged in the preparation of a report upon the area and the measures which should be taken to secure the most economical development of it.  At the same time we have established a Committee, consisting of persons best fitted to consider and recommend in the matter, to advise us as to the various measures which it would be necessary to adopt to secure a market for the increased production of anthracite which may take place at Slievardagh.  When we get the report of the engineers, on the one hand, and of the Committee, on the other, we shall be able to determine upon our plans.  I think it will be necessary to come to the Dáil at that stage and secure approval for the proposal that will be submitted.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies have criticised the operations of the Prices Commission. They did so, I think, on a misunderstanding of the position.  The Prices Commission, as such, is not concerned with the price charged on the occasion of individual sales by a particular shopkeeper to a particular individual. The Prices Commission are concerned only to undertake a general investigation into the prices of either protected commodities or articles of common necessity.  They have been engaged on a fairly elaborate investigation into the price of wheaten flour. <Col N="2004" /> In order to complete that investigation, they had to get the flour millers to change their system of accounting and then wait for a period of months during which the new system of accounting was in operation before they could give their opinion on it and publish their report.  I understand the report on flour will be forthcoming in the near future.  They have also been engaged in an investigation into the prices charged for bread.  In that case they had considerable difficulty in getting the bakers to submit information which would enable them to examine the position.  They have, of course, very drastic powers to compel the submission of evidence, but they were reluctant to use these powers because they felt that the persons concerned did not fully appreciate the position. In due course, by waiting a bit and by methods of persuasion, they got the information they wanted.  A report on bread prices is being drafted at the moment.</P>
    <P>They also carried out an investigation into the price of mineral oils and they submitted a report which indicated that there was no need to take action.  It has not been published because there was only one firm chiefly involved.  The report at the moment is being examined from the point of view of whether it is desirable to publish it, having regard to the effect it might have on the interests of the one firm concerned and the fact that there was no foundation for the allegation that undue profits were being made.  They are also engaged in carrying out investigations into the prices of other commodities and they have been appointed particularly to carry out an inquiry into the price of housing materials.</P>
    <P>In addition to the Prices Commission, there is a Prices Controller, who is responsible for investigating the prices charged in particular sales, that is, the prices charged by any shopkeeper for any commodity to an individual customer. He, however, can only take action when he has received a complaint. I want to say in speaking to this matter&mdash;and I would commend this to Deputy Flynn-that I have no sympathy with anybody who, feeling that he has been overcharged by some shopkeeper, <Col N="2005" /> merely growls about it and does not sit down and put the details of the particular transaction on a piece of paper and send it to the Controller of Prices, Dublin, because such a person is obviously content to growl whereas by taking the action I suggest he, or she, might not only secure a refund of the overcharge but a general reduction of the price of the commodity in that district and, therefore, do general good in the district.  Wherever the Prices Controller has received complaints he, or an inspector under him, has carried out investigations and in a number of cases he has been able to get refunds of the amount overcharged. Any person who desires to have a complaint investigated has machinery in existence by which it can be done. Deputy Brodrick made a number of allegations in regard to the Tuam beet factory.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Minister passes from the question of prices, I should like to know if he is in the habit of influencing the Prices Commission as to the commodities, the price of which they are to investigate.  One item to which they might turn attention is vegetables.  There is a most extraordinary gap between the price that the producer of vegetables can get and what the public has to pay for them. Considering that we are an agricultural country, the variety of vegetables also is miserably poor.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the Prices Commission have certain intentions in that matter and that when an opportunity offers they intend to make the necessary inquiries.  The President on the occasion of the laying of the foundation stone at Tuam said that it was intended that a certain number of native speakers from the western districts would be employed at the factory during the season.  We have <Col N="2006" /> persuaded the board of the company that it would be a good policy so to arrange, and they have so arranged. Deputy Brodrick is obviously mixing up the employment of workers in the factory with the matter of the employment of workers by the contractors for the construction of the factory.  Not merely is it the intention of the company to make arrangements for the employment of these workers at Tuam but, in fact, they have constructed housing accommodation for these native speakers when the campaign opens and the fulfilment of the President's promise arises.  Deputy Brodrick also alleged that nobody could get employment in connection with the work at Tuam who was not a supporter of Fianna Fáil.  I would like to bet that for one letter he has received from his supporters alleging that no Blue Shirt can get employment, I can produce ten from the local Fianna Fáil supporters saying that no Fianna Fáil supporter can get employment at the factory.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy MacDermot made reference to the negotiation of trade treaties, and he asked if political considerations entered into the question when the matter of negotiating treaties with particular countries arose.  We have no political objection to negotiating a trade arrangement with any country. We have, in fact, been conducting discussions which, on occasions, might have been elevated to the point at which they might be called negotiations with practically every country where the classes of the goods that we export or could export, are imported.  We have been also approached, by a number of other countries which were looking for something for nothing. There are quite a number of countries which are selling goods to this country and which really cannot buy anything from us.  All these countries in general <Col N="2007" /> offer most-favoured-nation treaties to us, but we have been endeavouring to utilise the market here as a bargaining factor with various countries.  In the case of countries like Germany, to which Deputy MacDermot referred, we have not committed ourselves to giving any concessions.  Germany is entitled under treaty to get most-favoured-nation treatment here, and the only question that arose in that connection was whether we should continue that treaty.  It has been continued.</P>

      <P>Not very many, I admit. The only one in Europe, I think, is Switzerland which takes a very substantial number of horses from this country every year.  There is quite a substantial trade with Switzerland. We have been, in fact, directing trade towards Switzerland in order to maintain it.  There are other goods also. Agreements have not been made on the basis of securing a mathematical balance of trade in any country, but to secure an opening for our produce where the level of prices or the demand for goods makes trade worth while. There are not many countries where agricultural prices are better than they are here.  In fact, in most countries in Europe the level of agricultural prices is so much lower than it is here, and it hardly pays to export, and the Governments of these countries are trying to secure their internal trade by regulating the imports of external products.</P>

      <P>I would not like to offer an opinion.  It would be a substantial sum.  I am not thinking of a small foundry but of one where articles would be produced more or less by mass production methods.  The total requirements of grates would be about 40,000 a year, of which not 20,000 are being produced at present, so that you could contemplate a daily output of grates to supply requirements, apart altogether from ranges or rain water goods and other things of that description produced by a mass production foundry.  I do not want anyone to take these figures as being necessarily accurate.  I am speaking from memory. I would like to deal with other matters, but I have spoken at length.  I listened to Deputy Rice trying on the usual fallacious theories in connection with trade and shipping statistics, and unemployment and employment figures.  The position of course is, as Deputies are aware, that the total value of external trade, that is, imports and exports added together, to which the Deputy referred, has no significance whatever in relation to national prosperity.  We could have a total export trade, with the figures rising like a rocket, with everybody in the country starving, industries destroyed and agriculture ruined.  We could have an external trade brought down to nil, and the country prosperous and everyone working.  If Deputy Rice is under any delusion in this matter, I invite him to read the speech made at the annual meeting of the Cork Incorporated Chamber of Commerce some months ago by the President of that body, in which he dealt very excellently with that particular argument.</P>

      <P>Deputy Rice made a number of arguments based on the unemployment figures.  It is, of course, entirely fallacious to make any comparison between the unemployment register to-day and the unemployment register of 1931.  The fact that every unemployed person in the country can at present get cash benefit by registering is, of course, an essential difference.  In 1931, agricultural workers, or people living apart from the exchanges, had no interest in the exchanges.  Even those living in towns very rarely got employment through the exchanges, because there was no policy in operation at the time requiring men for public works to be recruited through the exchanges.  There was, in fact, a definite Government order requiring preference to be given to a particular class, which practically meant that only persons in that class could get work through the exchanges.  The operation of all these factors resulted in no one registering at the exchanges except those who were in receipt of unemployment insurance benefit, and who therefore had an interest in doing so.  The fact that only 15,000 vacancies were filled through the exchanges on the average during the years 1930, or 1931, is an indication of how little purpose was served by any unemployed person registering there. The position was reversed in 1932, when preference was abolished, and everyone had an equal claim to any employment going, and, consequently, an interest in registering.  A definite order was issued that all workers required for public works were to be recruited only through the exchanges and, consequently, as against 15,000 vacancies filled in 1931, almost 100,000 were filled in 1932.  There was, consequently, more reason for registering at the exchanges, particularly in so far as public works were concerned as no one could get employment who was not registered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2010" /> Now the position has changed again. Inducement to register has been definitely extended to all those who were not ordinarily engaged in industrial work, because the unemployment assistance scheme is in operation and persons claiming assistance, even though they might not be ordinarily engaged in industrial work, are registering at the exchanges. Consequently, you get a maximum figure in the register of unemployed, which does not represent the measure of destitution or hardship in the country at all.  It represents the total number of persons who, no matter what the circumstances, would take work, or a different form to that which they have, if it offered.</P>
    <P>It is common knowledge that a very large number of agricultural workers throughout the country, although actually employed by farmers, nevertheless registered at the exchanges in the hope of some better-paid work such as road work, turning up.  At Tuam, Thurles and Mallow, where the beet factories are in construction, we had to take very drastic action to ensure that the supply of labour for local farmers would not be entirely depleted. All farm labourers in these districts registered for work at the factories, and a number of them got work, but they had to be withdrawn to ensure that ordinary farm operations in the districts would not be neglected.</P>

      <P>Deputy Corish referred to the Port and Harbours Tribunal. The preparation of legislation embodying the recommendations of the Tribunal is proceeding.  It will take time.  No doubt we could shorten the time, if we were prepared to concentrate upon it, but it would be difficult to do that at present, having regard to the several matters that are engaging the attention of the Department. I think we have dealt with the most <Col N="2011" /> urgent matters in the Regulation of Rates Bill.  There are other matters urgent, I realise, from the point of view of a port like Wexford.  I will try to make such progress as is possible with the measure.  Some parts are straightforward and simple, but other parts will be regarded as contentious, and consequently we must proceed carefully in the framing of that legislation, which is of the type that, once passed, is not likely to be amended readily for a number of years.  I hope to be able to produce the Bill some time soon, but I would not like to make a definite promise.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kelly spoke of a matter concerning the position of the owners of horse-drawn cabs.  I have very considerable sympathy for the people who are engaged in that particular calling, which is now nearly obsolete and certainly it is very unremunerative.  I realise that sympathy is not much help to them, but I am at some difficulty to devise any method to assist them.  Suggestions were made that certain places or districts should be closed to motor traffic so as to give the cabby a chance.  I doubt if these were practicable, but any suggestion made will have very careful and sympathetic consideration.  I am not very hopeful of being able to devise a practicable scheme of helping these people, very many of whom are much too old for training as taxi drivers or such work; but if any such scheme is suggested, or occurs to me, I will be very glad to consider it.</P>

      <P>There is one matter I would like to question the Minister about, and that is the <Col N="2012" /> Directory of Irish Manufacturers.  The Minister told us nothing about what we want to know with regard to that matter, and he has told us some additional thing that we do not want to know.  As regards what we want to know, it was in October, 1932, that the Minister said he would consider laying a statement of certain matters dealing with new industries before the House. In the beginning of last year, more than 12 months ago, he told the House he was having prepared a Directory of Irish Manufacturers.  Additional staff was put on it some months ago.  At least, we ought to hear from the Minister what are the headings under which he proposes to give information about Irish industry in that publication. Is it going to be an impersonal statement of the position like a census of production, or does he propose to list&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Will the Minister tell us now, after all the work of preparation, what this directory will tell us about Irish manufactures?  The Minister tells us to-night that he has advertised the intention of the Department to put advertisements into the publication.  I think that is an amazing thing, and I would ask the Minister to reconsider it.</P>

      <P>I am merely asking this question.  The Minister is inviting Irish manufacturers to put advertisements into his publication. <Col N="2013" /> There is a book published, the Irish Industrial Year Book, by a body that is dependent upon subscriptions and financial assistance of one particular kind so as to keep this going as a propagandist organisation for the purpose&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I put it there is an organisation there which is endeavouring to propagand Irish industry, and is dependent on advertisements to publish that very useful publication.  In view of the fact that the Minister refuses to give the names of the individual companies here lest it be prejudicial to the other companies engaged in that particular type of industry, is it reasonable that the Minister should practically coerce Irish manufacturers into putting advertisements of their stuff in what is going to be an official directory, comprehensively made up to show the position of Irish industry in the country?  I submit the Minister is simply putting in filling-up stuff, and we should hear under what headings he is going to give information.</P>

      <P>The handbooks will give information as to the products that are produced here and where they are obtainable.  If the Deputy wants fuller information than that, information concerning capital investment, the number of persons actually employed on a particular date, and so on, he will have to await the publication of the reports from the Census of Production that is being taken each year.  The 1932 reports will be published shortly <Col N="2014" /> and the 1933 reports at a later date.  I could not possibly get that detailed information concerning each industry earlier than the report from the Statistics Branch.

    <P>That a sum not exceeding £931,220 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1935, for the Salaries and Expenses in connection with Unemployment Insurance and Employment Exchanges (including contributions to the Unemployment Fund) and Unemployment Assistance (9 Edw. 7, c.7; 10 and 11 Geo. 5, c.30; 11 Geo. 5, c.1; 11 and 12 Geo. 5, c.15; <Col N="2019" /> 12 Geo. 5, c.7; No. 17 of 1923; Nos. 26 and 59 of 1924; No. 21 of 1926; No. 33 of 1930; and Nos. 44 and 46 of 1933).</P>
    <P>The gross amount required is £1,950,790.  The appropriations-in-aid amount to £554,570, making the net total £1,396,220.  The net increase of £1,203,129 is due entirely to the passage, during the course of the year, of the Unemployment Assistance Act. The sub-heads are, I think, in the main fully explained in the notes which appear on the Estimate.  As regards salaries, wages and allowances there is an increase of £90,000 due entirely to the necessity for a substantial increase in staff for the administration of the Unemployment Assistance Act.  This also explains the increase in travelling expenses and incidental expenses, the expenses for the umpire and the Courts of Referees and so forth.  The contribution to the Unemployment Fund shows an estimated increase of £2,000. That figure is, of course, an estimate. It is impossible to tell with any degree of accuracy what the revenue to the fund from the sale of stamps will be. It is anticipated that it will be somewhat higher this year than last year, and consequently an increased State contribution, the amount of which is fixed by legislation, is budgeted for. The main item is the estimated expenditure on unemployment assistance of £1,500,000.  That figure is also an estimate, because there are not in existence any data upon which a reliable forecast could be made.</P>
    <P>This is the first year in which the Act has been brought into operation.  In fact, it is only coming into operation at the present time.  There are roughly £200,000 applications for qualification certificates to date.  I do not want Deputies to run away with the idea that that figure represents £200,000 people out of work.  Any person who applies for it is entitled to get a qualification certificate.  In fact, in due course every person in the country who is qualified&mdash;that is, whose means are less than the amount set out in the statute and who is not disqualified for any of the reasons stated in the statute&mdash;will have his qualification <Col N="2020" /> certificate.  A number of questions which have been asked in the Dáil concerning the Unemployment Assistance Act appear to be based on a confusion of ideas between an application for a qualification certificate and a subsequent application for unemployment assistance.  The qualification certificate corresponds to the insurance card under the unemployment insurance scheme.  Every worker will have his certificate.  When he is at work the certificate will be in his possession. When he is out of work the certificate will be lodged with the exchange, and if he can sustain it he will, presumably, make a claim for unemployment assistance: that is, when his unemployment insurance benefit, if any, has been exhausted.</P>
    <P>Of the 200,000 applications for qualification certificates 60,000 have been issued up to the latest date for which I have figures.  Our experience to date has been that 15 per cent. of those who applied for qualification certificates were not entitled to receive them.  85 per cent. did prove their claim to qualification certificates.  It is very noticeable that of the persons who have received their certificates less than half have applied for unemployment assistance. The assumption is that the others who received their qualification certificates were either at work when they applied, or have since obtained work.  The total number at present receiving unemployment assistance is somewhere round the figure of £20,000. The total amount that is being expended weekly is about £10,000 or £11,000.  It is impossible to give precise figures, because certificates are being issued at the rate of £2,000 a day, so that the situation is changing from day to day.  In the administration of the Act we are endeavouring to give first attention to those persons applying for certificates who show, on the face of their applications, that they possess no means of any kind.  It is assumed that, as a general rule, such persons would be in most urgent need of assistance. In any event it was possible to deal with their applications much more expeditiously than with the applications of those who, on the face of their applications, showed that they possessed <Col N="2021" /> means, because where means were shown an investigation had to take place in order to assess their yearly value for the purposes of the Act.</P>
    <P>In some districts there has been confusion and, I think, in some cases hardship has been caused by the manner in which the local assistance authority either misinterpreted the law or misunderstood the manner in which the Unemployment Assistance scheme was being brought into existence.  I think that applies particularly in Cork where the assistance authorities appear to have got a very confused idea of the new situation, an idea which could not possibly have entered into the minds of anybody who had taken the trouble to study the nature of the legislation or the various speeches and explanations of it which were delivered by me when the Bill was passing through the Oireachtas.  I recollect stating in the most distinct manner that the Bill which was then before the Dáil in no way relieved local assistance authorities from any obligation they had to provide for the relief of destitution in their areas.  I saw in this morning's newspapers a report, which may not be correct, that the Cork Board of Assistance claims that it was released from all obligation to make any provision for able-bodied destitute persons by the passage of the Unemployment Assistance Act.  That is, of course entirely incorrect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will recollect that Deputy Briscoe contradicted the Minister on that point, and was very explicit in saying that it did.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not responsible for what anybody else said.  I am talking about the obvious terms of the Act and the statements that I made myself. The surprising thing about the Cork Board of Assistance is that they apparently jumped at conclusions without making any attempt whatever to verify the conclusions.  I have no record that they, at any time, addressed any inquiry to my Department, either as to the date at which the scheme was coming into operation or as to the manner in which it would operate.  I think it is obvious to anybody <Col N="2022" /> who has given the matter any consideration that the whole scheme could not be brought into operation overnight. It was inevitable that there would be a very large number of applications made during the period in which the scheme was being initiated and that it would take some time before all these applications could be disposed of.</P>
      <P>The Dublin Board of Assistance, with commendable foresight, made the necessary arrangements to deal with that situation.  They are gradually reducing their expenditure upon outdoor relief and the number of cases relieved as the Act is coming into operation is gradually being reduced. If the Cork Home Assistance Authorities had shown the same foresight or the same genuine concern for the welfare of the people under their charge, the situation there would have been entirely different from what it is.</P>
      <P>Apart from Cork there are only one or two districts in which the local authority appears to have been badly advised as to the effects of the Act and the manner of its administration. But in these places every effort is being made to speed up the application of the Unemployment Assistance Act. In Cork, I may say that we are at present paying out unemployment assistance at a weekly rate which, if continued for the course of a year, would amount to a sum nearly double the total cost on the Cork Municipal Council for outdoor relief last year. It is impossible to give any picture of the situation in respect of the scheme as yet, because two or three months will elapse before it will be in operation to such an extent that one would be able to form conclusions as to the extent to which it was required and the cost which it will involve upon the public funds.</P>
      <P>The Estimate this year was £1,500,000.  It is obviously desirable that whatever provision is made should be adequate, so that no difficulty will arise.  In future years, we will, I think, be able to make a more accurate estimate, based upon experience and probabilities, than is now possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Persons who are refused the qualification certificate, or, having got the qualification certificate, are refused <Col N="2023" /> unemployment assistance or get unemployment assistance at a lesser amount than that to which they are entitled are, of course, entitled to appeal.  Where the refusal is a refusal of a qualification certificate the appeal lies to the committee established under the Unemployment Assistance Act, a committee which is at present practically in continuous session, because every person who has been refused has availed of his right to appeal.  Where the refusal is a refusal of unemployment assistance on any of the statutory grounds there is an appeal to the Court of Referees, and from the Court of Referees, on certain points, to the Umpire.  A number of persons have communicated with the Department of Industry and Commerce objecting to the refusal of unemployment assistance by the local officer, and Deputies have sometimes approached the Department on behalf of such persons.</P>
    <P>It would save the time of the Deputies and the officers of the Department if Deputies would understand that the Minister for Industry and Commerce has no function in these matters. Where the applicant is refused unemployment assistance by the insurance officer on any of the statutory grounds his right of redress lies in his appeal to the Court of Referees, and from the Court of Referees to the Umpire, whose decision is final.</P>
    <P>The Court of Referees will, I anticipate, have a somewhat busy time for a period until there has been laid down a series of decisions which will govern future cases.  That applies more to the Appeals Committee than to the Courts of Referees because so far as the Courts of Referees are concerned, the questions they will have to consider will be similar to those arising under the Insurance Acts.  So far as the Appeals Committee are concerned they are doing entirely new work and they are building up, and will build up in a short time, a series of decisions which will operate in the future to determine the way in which the Act will be interpreted by the local officers.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is anything <Col N="2024" /> more I could usefully say at this stage. I ask Deputies to believe that every effort is being made to bring the Act into operation.  The officers of the Department of Industry have had a very great strain placed upon them. They did the work with considerable energy and they have accomplished a very great task indeed.  Deputies will contemplate the magnitude of the task when I say that we are bringing into existence for the first time a new social service which in the magnitude of its operations and the amount of money involved is substantially greater than the Old Age Pensions Scheme or the National Health scheme or any other social scheme in operation now in the country.</P>
    <P>It is not easy to foresee all the difficulties which arise in such a task, but so far as they have arisen they have been dealt with and the machinery is now working smoothly, dealing with the applications at the rate of 2,000 a day.  It will be some weeks before all the applications will be disposed of, but once they have been disposed of the handling of future applications in the administration of the scheme will become a matter of routine.  The experience which is now being acquired by the various officers will be of considerable value in the permanent administration of the scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask the Minister just one question.  I can quite understand that in legislation of this character, where so many processes have to be provided and so many questions answered, at the beginning a certain amount of difficulty will arise in the administration of the Act.  We all appreciate that and none of us wants to embarrass the Minister or his Department in any way.  I got the information which I required in relation to the administration of this Act in the reply I got to some questions I asked to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to put to the Minister one or two other questions which will obviate the necessity of putting them on the Order Paper.  Would the Minister at an early date introduce legislation to abolish what is known as the &ldquo;waiting period&rdquo;?  It is the cause of <Col N="2025" /> very serious hardship to many of the unemployed when they have to put in what is known as the &ldquo;waiting period.&rdquo;  I need not develop that to any extent, because the Minister is aware of the difficulties and hardships.</P>
    <P>My second question would be more in the nature of a supplementary question arising out of his reply to-day. That is in cases where the statutory obligations have been complied with to qualify for unemployment assistance, will the payment be retrospective? There are, we know, cases where some delay has occurred in the issuing of the certificates.  I am aware that some delay must arise and has arisen in that connection.  But that delay having arisen, many of the unemployed persons, who have applied for unemployment assistance, were of opinion that when the certificate was issued the payment would be made retrospective.  I should like that the Minister would satisfy the House, and particularly persons who have been so unfortunate as to apply for home assistance, as to what is to be the procedure in that respect.  To put a concrete case: a person fills up the questionnaire and is found at the end of a period to have qualified in every way for a certificate. Can the Minister see his way to make the payments, when the person has received the qualification certificate, retrospective as from the date on which he applied?</P>

      <P>The Minister, in his opening remarks, was not quite clear.  He implied that a certain amount of hardship was being occasioned to persons seeking unemployment assistance.  It was not clear whether some of that hardship was not caused by his own local officers.  That was the impression he gave.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The hardship arose from the fact that the local assistance authorities had failed to make provision for the maintenance of outdoor relief until the applicants had received unemployment assistance.  In the case of Cork, they made no provision for payment of outdoor relief after the 1st April, although the Act did not come into force until the 18th April.</P>

      <P>Then, the Minister's remarks were directed entirely to the boards of home assistance.  It is only fair to recall in that connection that some of the Government Deputies, when the Bill was passing through the House, stated that the home assistance authorities would be entirely relieved from dealing with able-bodied unemployed.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>That was challenged from various sides of the House, and the Minister was asked to make the matter clear.  He probably did make it clear, but some of the statements of Fianna Fáil Back Benchers carry far and deep at times.  There is so much complaint in different parts of the country as to inability to get assistance under this Act that I should like to know if the Minister has scheduled, under the statutory power given him by Section 4, any particular classes of persons or any particular area in which no person shall for some particular period be regarded as unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>So that the Act applies all over the country without restriction as to class or area.  I should like to know from the Minister who the Unemployment Appeals Committee are, where their headquarters are, who the Court of Referees are and whether he has taken any steps under Section 22 to arrange for courses of instruction for persons who are unemployed and seeking assistance under the Act.  The Minister tells us that about 20,000 persons are receiving assistance under the Act.  The Minister will recall that the figures issued weekly now are not comparable in any way with the figures for 1931.  The table he issues weekly now is, nevertheless, headed: &ldquo;Table showing the Number of Persons Registered as Unemployed.&rdquo;  As long ago as October, 1932, the Minister realised that the classes of persons then registering required a certain analysis.  He did not, in fact, arrange to make any analysis of the position until about 16th January, 1933.  Subsequently <Col N="2027" /> he told the House that he had made that analysis, that it was very interesting and that he would convey the results of it to the House. Later he changed his mind as to that. At present we are getting the exact type of return that we got in 1931, although the Minister repeatedly tells us that it does not mean what the heading of it says it does.  I should like to know what arrangements the Minister is making now to change the type of weekly return, so that it will mean something.  At present, the Minister tells us that it means nothing. That is when it suits him to say so. I presume that out of the 90,000, odd, registered as unemployed, about 20,000 have claims current under the ordinary Unemployment Insurance Act and that 20,000 are being paid a certain amount under the Unemployment Assistance Act.  Does the Minister intend to make his weekly return to show the different classes of persons who are at present all lumped together under the heading of &ldquo;unemployed&rdquo;? The Minister has repeatedly told us recently that these people are not all really unemployed, that some of them are unemployed, that some are farmers, that some have casual work and that, generally, they represent a varying degree of employment and unemployment. I think that some more reasonable and more intelligible return should be substituted for the weekly return issued now.  It might be well, too, if this return continued to be issued, because there must be something in common with it and the figures of the past.  It would be useful enough, in spite of anything the Minister says, to be able to compare these figures, but he is in a position now to issue something more intelligible and informative, and I should like to know whether or not he intends to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that it will be generally accepted that great dissatisfaction prevails all over the country in consequence of the slowness with which certificates under the Unemployment Assistance Act are issued by the Department.  The Minister has told us now that the Department has done <Col N="2028" /> its best, having regard to the difficulties which prevailed, owing to the fact that this was a new Act and that the machinery had to be got into operation. The Minister has also told us that the public assistance authorities have neglected their duty in not making provision for destitute people after the 1st April.  As it is the opinion of the Minister that that position obtains in some areas, I should like to support the plea of other Deputies that, in cases where certificates have not yet been issued, although applied for as far back as March last, payment should be retrospective. These people have been treated badly in the various areas. In view of the fact that, in certain urban areas, the ratepayers have been mulcted to the extent of 9d. or 1/6 in the £ for the unemployed, I think that the Government should give special consideration to this plea, since they are getting the proceeds of that rate. As a matter of fact, the incidence of the 9d. rate is greater than it superficially appears to be in so far as urban and city areas are concerned. An effective rate of 9d. in the £ would be entirely different from the rate which produces the full amount of a levy of 9d. in the £.  Local authorities are bound to give certain rebates and allowances of that kind under Acts of Parliament and these are not taken into consideration in so far as this rate is concerned.  In some cases, a rate of 10d. in the £ has to be struck to raise the amount required by a nominal 9d. rate.  I raised that question when the Bill was going through the House but I could get no consideration for it from the Minister. In some industrial areas, where there are large numbers of unemployed, this rate of 9d. in the £ is being levied. I have in mind Wexford, where a rate of 9d. is being levied and where applications under the Unemployment Assistance Act were made a considerable time ago, while certificates have not yet been issued.  I think that, in these cases, the Minister should provide for retrospective payment.  Even where public assistance authorities have been paying home help since 1st April to people who are entitled to it, the amounts paid are disgracefully <Col N="2029" /> small.  I think that the average amount of relief paid all over the country apart from Dublin, or Cork, perhaps, would be in the vicinity of 6/- or 7/- per week.  Under the Unemployment Assistance Act it would run from 12/- to 15/- or £1 a week, and I think that the Minister should have the difference made up so far as regards people who have genuine claims.  I should like to mention that there is a great deal of dissatisfaction also about the method of calculation with regard to certificates.  I have in mind the case of one man with five children who has been absolutely destitute for about five years.  His brother, who does not live with him but is in fairly good circumstances, has allowed him the sum of 10/- a week, and because of that allowance from his brother a certificate has been refused to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It could not be refused for 10/- a week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether the full certificate has been refused, but I do know that there has been some cut in it.  I think that the Minister will agree that it was only because the man was destitute that his brother was giving him that allowance and that the man ought to have been told that he would not get the certificate if this money was coming from his brother.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In another case, of which I know, a ridiculously high sum is being charged against a man because he had a goat. It is absolutely ridiculous to be making calculations in that way in the case of unfortunate people who are on the verge of starvation.  I think that the Minister should pay attention to this matter, especially with regard to the retrospective effect of the Act. These people are in a bad way.  They have made applications for certificates more than two months ago and it is not their fault that their applications have not been considered.  I think everybody will agree that there would be no objection from any part of the House if the Minister would agree to pay retrospectively on the certificates that, undoubtedly, will be issued in connection with a number of cases. One would like to know also how the claims or applications are being considered. <Col N="2030" /> Is each area being considered in proportion to the number unemployed, or has Dublin, Cork, or Waterford, say, been taken first, or has each area got its due proportion of the number of applications that have been adjudged upon?  I think that is a very important matter.  Some localities seem to think that they have been neglected and I should be glad to have an assurance from the Minister that that has not been the case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Broderick Mr. Broderick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broderick</NameTxt>
      <P>During the Minister's speech I heard him mention the question of the Cork Board of Assistance. I understood him to say that they had failed to appreciate their liabilities for the ensuing year.  Appreciating to the full the magnitude of the Minister's task, I am not inclined to be too carping or critical.  However, out of the spirit, which eventually developed into this Bill&mdash;the spirit which arose, if my memory serves me aright, through the motion of Deputy Morrissey when this House accepted the principle of the provision of either work or maintenance for the unemployed&mdash;out of that spirit developed an enormous increase in the cost of what was known formerly as home assistance.  The result of that spirit was that, as well as fulfilling their statutory obligations, they had now to undertake liability for the people who were unemployed.  The result was that the liability of the board of assistance last year was increased by a sum of £20,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister says that we did not make the necessary provision.  I think that everybody accepted, up till rather late in the year, that unemployment assistance was going to come into operation on 1st April, and I might point out to the Minister, as he might be unaware of it, that all subsidiary bodies, such as those boards of assistance, have to have their accounts made up and their demands made on the parent body in January.  We fully believed in January that we were to be relieved of maintenance in lieu of employment on 1st April.  Subsequently, it transpired that it was on the 18th.  We could not know, on 10th January, how it was going to be delayed, and even then some of us advocated provision for <Col N="2031" /> even a greater amount.  I am afraid that some of us, who were in closer association with the Minister than I can have the honour of claiming, were quite emphatic that we were making too great a provision altogether, as, subsequent to our provision being made, a motion was handed in to reduce the provision we had made by a considerable sum.  By that time, however, the effect of the new policy was to be seen.  But we could not see until then that we had not made sufficient provision.  We had made provision, however, for our statutory obligation&mdash;the relief of destitution in our area&mdash;and that is the only obligation we have.  Any obligation, other than that which the Minister transferred to us, is not fair to us and we have no statutory obligation to fulfil it.</P>
    <P>Apart from that, we levy rates for the maintenance of destitute persons and now there is your tax for the aid of unemployment assistance.  Those people are now paying both, but your side have not come in and given us the relief we claim.  As I said in my opening remarks, I appreciate to the full the magnitude of the service undertaken. I quite realise that it has got to be in operation for a considerable time before it can become fully operative. In the meantime, however, areas in our constituency are rated for the relief of destitution, and are also taxed for unemployment assistance, and I think that, in equity, we are entitled to a refund of the moneys that accrued to the Minister under taxation that we have made up on the rates.</P>

      <P>One would be happy&mdash; I would at least&mdash;if one knew that unemployment assistance was now working smoothly.  Anybody living in the country, however, would have to say that the very reverse is the case, because I have never known of anything that gave rise to a greater amount of dissatisfaction than the operation of this Act that was looked upon originally as a very beneficent Act. Its operation, so far, has caused nothing but consternation because of the number of people who have been debarred from the receipt of home assistance as a result of it and who <Col N="2032" /> have been trying to conform to the requirements of the Act since early in March with very little hope of getting any benefits from it.  To a certain extent, I am not surprised at this, as the Act has had to be administered by the Unemployment Insurance Department, but I must certainly say they are not dealing with it very satisfactorily. Having thrown the Unemployment Assistance Act on top of the same shoulders with very little accretion to the staffs, it was only natural to expect and anticipate the chaos that has arisen.  I have before me at the moment the case of 175 men in one little village in County Limerick whose forms were filled in early in March&mdash; some as early as the 2nd March.  These 175 application forms are still lying in the Civic Guard barracks and cannot be returned to the exchange because of lack of a suitable form on which to fill the returns which the Guards have secured from an investigation of the claims. That is only one barrack and it is typical of others I have heard of.</P>
      <P>I have a letter in my case from one man whose wife has had three operations and is under the dispensary doctor's care.  He has made application for relief in order to provide the necessary medicine, sustenance and nourishment for her and he has been told that as he is now entitled to unemployment assistance, he cannot get it.  The net result is that the dependants of those 175 men men are actually on the point of begging.  That is not by any means an isolated case but is typical of what is happening in County Limerick.  With regard to the speeding up of this matter, I suggest that if the basis of valuation is not radically altered, it would be better to scrap the Act entirely because the benefits that were expected from the Act are not going to materialise under the present system of valuation.  We find 2/6 per hen, 15/- per goat, and I have a case in which a Civic Guard put a valuation of £1 per perch on two perches of land belonging to an agricultural labourer in Ballybrown, in the County Limerick. If my mathematics and notation have not gone west completely, that would represent £160 per acre and that would be something to talk about in the country with regard to land valuation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2033" /> I should like to know who has given these instructions to the Civic Guards. They have surely not been sent round the country to constitute themselves valuers of goats, hens, land, and these classes of things?  They must have got some specific headline sent to them.  I cannot trace where it came from, but they certainly got some instructions, and they are doing a work through the country for which they are unfitted.  It is not their job and they must be carrying out the instructions of somebody whose job it is.  I suggest that whoever is responsible for giving the instructions and for basing the valuation as it is being based seems determined to wreck the beneficence of the Act, and I suggest that the whole foundation of the Act is going to be shattered if it is to continue on that basis.  I have met some of the few people who were lucky enough to get payment and their dissatisfaction, I think, is greater than the dissatisfaction of those who have not been paid when they find the amounts they are to receive.  I met one man from Adare &mdash;a single man living in a cottage with his mother&mdash;who received a postal order for 6d.  I thought that it might have been a mistake and might have been intended for 6/- and I made some inquiries.  Although I did not get to the exact root of the matter, I was told that it may possibly have been correct, as the basis of payment may have been 6d. a day and, in some cases, 9d. a day. This was his first payment and it might have been a payment in respect of only one day and was probably correct.</P>
    <P>I know another man in the City of Limerick who has a wife and family. He has no means but he and his family are in receipt of some money from a society to which he belongs.  His fellows in that society were decent enough&mdash;those of them who were at work&mdash;to make a rather heavy contribution every week to enable something to be paid to those who were out of employment.  It is only a local union and it has no amalgamation or big funds behind it.  These contributions were more or less charitable subscriptions by the employed members to keep the unemployed members from starving.  These contributions have <Col N="2034" /> been taken cognisance of and this man, who would be entitled to 17/6 a week, is in receipt of 4/6 instead.</P>
    <P>The chaos in respect of the issuing of qualification certificates and the subsequent determination of the candidates' suitability is, to my mind, very largely due to lack of planning in advance of the Act or of the administration of it.  The Act was passed through this House in August and September, and I might say that at that time it was thought that it was capable of being put into operation by January.  Subsequently it was gleaned that it could not be put into operation until April, and the staff did not come to be recruited until January.  Six thousand applicants sat for the examination, and something under 400 were passed into the Service.  Surely a very considerable number of the remainder must have been sufficiently qualified to be called on to co-operate in this work, but what happened was that a certain number of civil servants were drafted in from one or two other Departments, but, in my opinion, not by any means a sufficient number.</P>
    <P>I heard Deputy Norton complaining last week of people working long hours in factories, but I suggest that the civil servants engaged in the unemployment exchanges at present are the most sweated people in this country.  They are working inordinate hours which are not at all suitable for the heavy work on which they are engaged, which are likely to sap their strength and undermine their health and calculated to unfit them for doing the work competently or fittingly.  They are doing ordinary unemployment insurance business from 9 o'clock or 9.15 in the morning until 5 o'clock in the evening, and then they turn over and try to devote a few hours of the evening to carrying on the business of unemployment assistance.  That system is certainly not going to bring this chaotic condition that obtains now into reasonable order.  People have looked forward to this Act as a most beneficial measure. It was the intention of the Government to do the very best thing possible for the people who are condemned to unemployment, and I am very anxious to know what it is has come between <Col N="2035" /> the Government and the Act and the administration of it simply to negative the good effects of the measure passed through this House, because that is what it actually amounts to.  I would suggest to the Minister that if he wants to get to the root of the matter and speed things up, he must get down to this question of valuation and put it on something like a reasonable and fair basis, because already I have heard people clamouring for the withdrawal of the Act.</P>
    <P>I should like, as I said at the outset, to say something about the administration of unemployment insurance in the exchanges.  That is, to my mind, the most important branch in the Minister's charge, dealing, as it does, with the working class people and with small farmers, in whom the people on these benches, at least, claim to have a particular interest.  The regulations to deal with many of the cases seem to have been framed with the express desire of inflicting the maximum amount of hardship on anybody who is compelled to seek assistance through the employment exchange.  That is notorious.  If, for instance, a man who has a case makes a claim, in the first place, the claim has to be sent back to the employer for a statement by him as to the man's reason for leaving his employment.  If the employer gives a <Col N="2036" /> reply which is in any way calculated to disqualify the claimant for any reason, the case has to go to Dublin, and if it is refused when it comes back, he can appeal against the decision to the referees.  In many cases the case is again sent to Dublin, examined and sent back to the exchange, and then the Court of Referees is called into being to examine the case and to give a decision, which must go again to Dublin, and where it is possible that it may be upset.  There are, in all, five or six different ramifications of the case between the exchange and headquarters, and each time there is a cold storage period of a few days and, sometimes, a few weeks.  Finally we have a gentleman called the umpire&mdash;a barrister, I presume, who sits in chambers in Dublin.  He has power of life and death, and from him there is no appeal.  The Court of Referees is constituted for the purpose of dealing with matters of fact, and the Chairman is appointed by the Minister himself.  They are supposed to have actual contact with the circumstances.</P>
    <P>I move to report Progress.</P>
    <P>Progress reported: Committee to sit again to-morrow.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until 3 p.m. Wednesday, 30th May, 1934.</P>
