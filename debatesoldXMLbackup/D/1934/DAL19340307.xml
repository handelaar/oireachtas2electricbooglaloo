      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he will take steps to provide for a general revision of rents on recently erected cottages in rural areas and on those at present under construction as in the very depressed state of the agricultural industry, which has caused unemployment and the lowering of wages, farm labourers are unable to pay any higher rents than the tenants of the older cottages are paying.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. O'Kelly)</NameTxt>
      <P>The fixing of rents of cottages provided under the Labourers Acts is a matter in the first instance to be dealt with by the local authority concerned by regulations to be made by them under Section 29 of the Act of 1906 which are subject to confirmation by the Minister for Local Government and Public Health.  Such rents also require the Minister's approval for the purposes of the Housing (Loan Charges Contributions) Regulations, 1932.  Section 29 of the Act of 1906 provides that the rents shall be fixed so as to secure a reasonable return having regard to the circumstances of the locality affected on the expenditure of the local authority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether his Department has declined to approve of the proposals as to the prices arranged to be paid to the owners by the Clare County Board of Health for the purchase of lands for <Col N="158" /> building cottages at Clare Castle, Ennis, Ennistymon and Killaloe, and if so, why; and whether in view of the fact that the erection of labourers' cottages in these areas cannot be proceeded with pending his approval, he will reconsider the matter and sanction the proposals of the board of health without delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The reply to the first part of the question is in the affirmative. I consider the prices proposed to be paid for the lands referred to, which range from £80 to £133 per acre, are altogether too high for land for the building of labourers' cottages, and I have advised the Clare Board of Health and Public Assistance to exercise the compulsory powers conferred on them by the Housing (Financial and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1932, if they are unable to obtain suitable sites for labourers' cottages at reasonable prices.  The reply to the last part of the question is in the negative.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Vice-President's reply, while admitting that the prices named seem to be excessive, that these prices are in fact excessive, why does he not take a similar view about the price paid by the Roscommon Country Council in respect of a site for the country hospital, or are we to assume that the Vice-President considers that a higher price may be paid for a site for a county hospital than for site for labourers' cottages?</P>

The amount of the deductions made up to the 31st December, 1933, (the latest date up to which information is available) from the pay of the services to which the Act applies is £207,000 approximately.

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

      <P>The charges on drainage ratepayers are imposed to meet two obligations, viz.: (1) the repayment of capital advances towards the cost of the works, and (2) the maintenance of the districts.  The present policy of the Government is to undertake works in drainage districts only when free grants are forthcoming from Government and local authorities sufficient to ensure that the annual burden (for repayment or <Col N="161" /> maintenance) on the rated occupiers does not exceed the annual benefit conferred by the works.  The provision of free grants from State funds is on a generous scale and it is not proposed to increase it.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether, in view of the fact that the number of unemployed workers in Gorey has reached a high total never touched before as shown by registrations at the local labour exchange, he will make an allocation from the Relief Schemes Vote to enable work of public utility to be started in that town which would relieve distress amongst the unemployed there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The present increase in registration at unemployment exchanges is regarded as being due to expectation of benefit under the Unemployment Assistance Act.

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware if the facts are as stated by Deputy Keating. If they are as stated by him, I have no doubt that the reason why the unemployed did not register in 1930-31 was that they knew it was hopeless.</P>

      <P>A census of the fat cattle in County Wexford has been taken, and the appropriate number of licences has been issued.  The basis of allocation of licences is uniform throughout the country, and it will, therefore, be understood that it is not feasible to give special treatment to feeders of fat cattle in County Wexford, as this could only be done at the expense of feeders in other parts of the country.</P>

      <P>I move that the Bill be read a Second Time.  This is the annual Army Bill, and I was hoping that, instead of introducing a Bill simply to extend the present Army Act for another year, I would have a completely new Army Bill before the Dáil.  I hope, if we can get time in the Parliamentary draftsman's office, to have that Bill introduced within a few months.  It is ready in our Department, but it is a matter of getting the Parliamentary draftsman to go over it and put it into form for circulation to the Dáil.  The Army has already been discussed on the additional Estimate for which we asked a few weeks ago, and it will come under discussion when the annual Estimate comes up in another few weeks. I do not think there is anything to discuss in it to-day.</P>

      <P>On this Bill to-day, one thing strikes one particularly, and that is, that the Minister for Defence follows the time-honoured precedent of his predecessors by saying that he has a fervent hope of introducing legislation of a permanent nature which would make this annual renewing Bill unnecessary.  One hopes that he will be a little more successful in realising that hope than his predecessors were.  So far as the defence forces of this country are concerned, I think I would voice the sentiments of Deputies on all sides of the House when I say that the National Army is one of which this country is justly proud.  The organisation of a permanent defence force is a highly technical question, and, so far as I am aware, most Deputies in this House are highly satisfied with the general discipline and the deportment of that force, but under this Bill we seem to be revising the powers under which the Minister has embarked on the recruitment and organisation of a new force in this country, and in that connection one is inclined to ask oneself the simple question: What do we want the new force for?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I read with admiration in the paper this morning a speech delivered by President de Valera in Trinity College last night.  He was speaking on the occasion of Lord Cecil's address on disarmament and he said that he had come to the conclusion that there was nothing more wanted in the world to-day than peace &mdash; international peace, internal peace and de-militarisation. Somebody once said that Ireland was a country in which it does not very much matter what you do so long as you say the right thing. One is tempted to think of that when President de Valera pays an eloquent tribute to de-militarisation while he is investing a very large sum of the national revenue in militarising hundreds and thousands of young fellows who have been lucky enough to grow up in this country unacquainted with the use of firearms.  We are now embarking, under the defence forces powers conferred on the Minister, on the task of teaching every young fellow in this country, of good character and qualified to become a member <Col N="169" /> of this force, the art of using firearms and one comes back to the original question: Why are we doing it and what good can we hope to do by it?  I recall, when this Bill was before the House last year, Deputy Tom Kelly intervening with a question and in column 507, volume 46 of the Official Debates.  Deputy Kelly is reported in the following terms:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Is the Minister aware that there is a widespread and growing feeling among the people of Ireland that we do not want any Army and will he take steps to consider, before he brings the next Bill before the Dáil, the advisability of doing away with the Army as quickly as he can?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Kelly is going to get a disappointment. We are not only not going to adopt this rather preposterous suggestion but we are going to build up another larger army.  We know that really what was at the back of President de Valera's mind in embarking on that scheme was to provide a force in which the I.R.A. of to-day could serve the elected Government of the country and save their faces at the same time.  The Minister for Defence has spoken of providing a platform on which men parted by the stress of civil war can come together again. Let me say with all sincerity that there is no expense and no trouble that I would think excessive if we could find such a platform.  Almost any scheme which would provide common ground for men separated by the stress of civil war in the past would be commended to me by that consideration regardless of any other, but what are the facts?  I do not know how authoritative <i>An Phoblacht</i> is.  I would be very glad to be corrected if I do the leaders of the Irish Republican Army, which at present flourishes in the land, an injustice, but I understand that <i>An Phoblacht</i> is their official organ.  Mr. Gilmore comes out there last week and says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The small farmers would overwhelm the ranchers if they were released to take possession of the ranches.  Stripped of his ranch, the rancher is disarmed; stripped of their banks, the bankers are disarmed; <Col N="170" /> deprived of their Press, the Imperialists would be silenced and disarmed, their threat would be gone, but Fianna Fáil dare not take this road for here are tasks that could only be carried through in a working-class revolution.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I want to say again that no expense, no trouble will be too much if we can find common ground on which to reunite all sections of our people on the fundamental principle of the sovereign right of the Irish people to decide what Government we will have in this country.  But is it common sense to be providing platforms for people who take the view that the only solution of our national ills is a working-class revolution?  I am not as familiar with these gentlemen's outlook as is the Minister for Defence.  He may discount what they say when they cry out for a Communist revolution.  He may know that no particular significance should be attached to that cry.  But to the ordinary man who is taking Mr. Gilmore and others of his colleagues at their face value, at the value which they set upon themselves, it would seem that they declare that the only acceptable solution of the present difficulties in this country is the Communist revolution.</P>
    <P>We are told that we ought to spend, I think it is £280,000 annually, in building up a force to provide common ground for them to come together with their fellow-countrymen from whom they were parted by the civil war. Suppose we assume that that excellent purpose could be served by building up such a defence force; suppose we assume that all this stuff in <i>An Phoblacht</i> is to be discounted and that these I.R.A. men are anxious to accept the principle of the sovereignty of the Irish people to decide by their votes what form of government we shall have in this country and that they would be willing to join forces under the control of the elected Government of the people.  Suppose we accept all that, then we have to ask ourselves how is it that out of the Army to which the Minister for Defence delights to pay a tribute, out of the Army to which the President delights to pay a tribute, we could not find 20 regular officers to <Col N="171" /> undertake the organisation of this new force?</P>
    <P>We must either believe that the men whom the Minister for Defence wants to get, the I.R.A. men, are <i>bona fide</i> or that they are not.  If they are <i>bona fide</i> our National Army is an Army which yields allegiance to the elected Government of the Irish people.  They are not politicians.  Therefore, any man who is prepared to co-operate in a <i>bona fide</i> way in the scheme which is in the Minister's mind cannot have any objection to associating with his own fellow officers in the force.</P>
    <P>The Minister pointed out how grateful and gratifying a sign it was to see a number of young Irishmen who had been out in arms against the officers of the National Army going up to the appropriate barracks, making their declaration of allegiance to the State, accepting their commissions at the hands of the Minister for Defence, and entering into association with their erstwhile antagonists in the civil war. The Minister for Defence went on to admit that none of these 20 men has had recent military experience.  They have been engaged on civilian work of one kind or another for a long time. The Minister will agree with me that he has far more than 20 well trained men amongst the regular officers who could have undertaken this task of training this army.  Yet the Minister will say that this new force is non-political and that this new force is designed to provide a platform for any decent young man, no matter what platform he belongs to, to come forward and serve the State.  Side by side with this declaration the Minister appoints 20 men who are well known to be violent protagonists of his own Party. One of these young men&mdash;and let me mention no names, because it may have been due to an indiscretion, at least it is evidence of an indiscretion, if not something worse&mdash;went round just before he was commissioned making trenchant speeches.  All of these men, or I should say, perhaps, nearly all of them, have taken a very active part in party politics within the last 12 months. Let me correct that statement so far as to say this&mdash;that all those who were <Col N="172" /> resident in the country 12 months ago took an active part in politics during that period.  And these are the officers of a force which is non-political.</P>
    <P>The Minister's explanation of that, I imagine, would be that the members of the I.R.A. would find a very serious difficulty serving under regular officers of the Army.  Now, either the I.R.A. mean business or they do not.  Either they mean to bury the past and serve in good faith with those who were their antagonists in the past or they do not. If they do, they ought to consider it an honour to serve under a commissioned officer of the National Forces. If they do not, then the whole purpose of this new national force falls to the ground and we are going to have set up in this country something entirely different from what the Minister has represented.  In the light of these facts I think the House should give very careful consideration to the departure which is being embarked upon.  I can see no prospect whatever of the new force serving the purpose which the Minister for Defence and the President have in mind.</P>
    <P>I have seen on every hoarding in the country warnings issued by responsible I.R.A. leaders to the young men of the country not to be fooled by the Minister for Defence, to avoid and boycott this new force which they describe as an attempt to turn every honest Republican in the country into an Imperialist. These facts all suggest to me that the purpose that the President and the Minister for Defence have in mind is not going to be served by the creation of this new force.</P>
    <P>What is going to happen?  We are going to gather into a military force every young man in the country who is of decent character.  When I say military force I mean a force that is military in the only really dangerous sense and that it is a force that is armed, a force that teaches its members how to use arms.  We are going to take a generation of young men who do not remember 1918 to 1921, who have no recollection of the unhappy period of the civil war&mdash;we are going to take a generation of young men who are practically uninfluenced by all that unhappy period in our <Col N="173" /> history and we are going to turn them into a militarised, armed body of youths for no useful purpose whatever.</P>
    <P>Surely the greatest disaster that can overcome this country is the familiarising of every young fellow in the country with the use of arms.  Surely every responsible man in the country realises how pregnant with danger is such action.  At this time when disarmament is a problem which is perplexing the whole world and when the problem of abolishing and driving out of the minds of young people militaristic ideas and ideals is perplexing the people of the whole world, surely it is an act of extreme madness on our part to set about creating that problem here in this country.  Any movement which would organise the youth of this country without putting arms in their hands would seem to me a commendable and a useful movement. Any movement designed to organise the young people of this country in the use of arms seems to me a great disservice to this country.  I believe that every responsible person in this country agrees with me in this contention. In my opinion, in putting arms into the hands of a body of young men who never carried them before we are sowing the wind and we will reap the whirlwind.  The tragedy of the situation is this, that I am convinced that Deputies on the opposite benches know that in their hearts just as well as I do, but they have not the courage to say so.  They let this thing happen and they let the situation develop and, in eight or ten years, we will have a problem in this country such as is perplexing the best minds in Europe at present, and it will be all of our own making.</P>
    <P>One wonders if there is any use addressing this remonstrance to the Minister.  He has set his hand to the task now and I suppose he will not go back.  But there is a way out even yet, if the Minister wants to take it. There is no reason on God's earth why this body he proposes to create should be an armed force.  He can organise it on athletic lines, on lines of general physical culture, without familiarising its younger members <Col N="174" /> with the use of lethal weapons.  If he has any regard for the future of the country, he will take that line. If he does not do it he is going to create in our midst a sort of semi-armed camp which is going to bring about infinite trouble and infinite demoralisation all over the country in time.  I would urge him with all the emphasis at my disposal to do two things: (1) to abandon the idea of organising this new force as an armed force; (2) to correct the impression, which has undoubtedly made headway in this country, that this is a political force, by choosing, at least for the present, officers drawn from the regular Army to direct its operations. There can be no objection whatever if those particular twenty gentlemen who are at present being nominated captains go into the National Army and serve a period in order to gain the necessary experience and the necessary skill in matters of organisation which are requisite for the organisation of a force of this kind.  It would be a reassurance to everybody in the country that those 20 gentlemen are <i>bona fide</i> desirous of burying the past, of accepting their appointments as military officers, eschewing all politics for the future and ready to serve the State as regular officers of the State defence force. After their period of training with their fellow officers at the Curragh, the Minister may decide that some of them might profitably be employed in the organisation of this force and that others might very profitably be employed in the activities of the regular Army.  That would be a matter for his own discretion.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, we would have in control of this force 20 highly-trained men; 20 men, who, the Minister will remember, were engaged against him in arms during the civil war and who, when he was appointed Minister for Defence, loyally accepted the decision of the Irish people and have loyally served him as the Irish people's representative ever since he came into that office.  That action was favourably commented on recently by the President. I think it was something of which this country can be very proud.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="175" /> I think it was a magnificent achievement, not only for the officers of the Army, but also for the Government that organised that Army.  I think it was a good thing that the outgoing Government of Cumann na nGaedheal put into the hands of the incoming Government of Fianna Fáil an Army with that splendid tradition, that splendid morale, that splendid outlook. I think it was something that the nation may justly be proud of, that in ten years we had built up a defence force with so splendid a tradition, so splendid a morale, so splendid an outlook.  I think it would be no excessive tribute to those high qualities in that Irish Army if the Minister for Defence had committed to the care of 20 officers trained from that Army the organisation of this new force.</P>
    <P>I think it would not have been a great demand to make on the 20 gentlemen whom he has chosen for the new defence force to ask them to condescend to take their place in the ranks of that National Army beside their fellow-officers; to serve beside their fellow-officers and to hold themselves at the disposal of the Minister for Defence for whatever future activity he may appoint for them.  If that course were followed, I believe that the success of this organisation would be much more probable.  If the organisation is based on an unarmed scheme, I believe it ought to be able to serve every purpose that is present in the mind of the Minister and of the President by way of reconcilement, and it would eliminate from it an element of great danger for the future of this country.  I urge most strongly on the Minister, before he goes further in the development of this force, to adopt those suggestions.  If he does, I think he will find that they will both serve the purpose he has in mind and serve the best interests of the country which he is desirous to serve.</P>

      <P>I wish to make a few brief remarks on this Bill.  If the Minister is instrumental in bringing about the happy feelings which existed up to the Civil War, if he brings our comrades <Col N="176" /> again together, I think that he deserves the gratitude of everybody in this country.  Deputy Dillon stated that foreign nations are perplexed at present with the problem of reducing armaments and armies.  To my mind that is all eye-wash.  As far as I can see and understand in my own humble way, all the nations of the world are arming at present for a great world conflict.  Whether I am right or wrong in that opinion, I do not know, but I think it is a most necessary thing to have the youth of this country trained in arms.  In my travels in South Africa I have seen the youth of that country, both young boys and young girls, riding across the veldt to local schools.  They were trained there in the use of arms, but they were under proper control.  Any game that was to be found in the country was shot by them in the mornings when they were on their way to school.  Those youngsters were good riders and deadly shots.  They could pick a fly out of the bonnet of anybody, and, God knows, there are many bees in the bonnets of the politicians and warriors that we have in this country at the present moment, and it would be well if those bees in the bonnets of our politicians, statesmen and soldiers were subdued.  I think that it would be all for the benefit of the country. I think that this proposal will be for the benefit of the youth of Ireland.  It will give them a grand physical and military training and, if there is any danger of an invasion of the country, not alone the youth of Ireland, but the oldest members of the community will be willing and able to jump into the breach in our hour of trial and emergency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that this scheme of the Minister for Defence is a good one because everybody knows that outside of the army control there is a considerable number of rifles, machine guns and revolvers at the present moment, and I think that it is the idea of the Minister to bring in all those people who are anxious for trouble and who are anxious to show their prowess, not in the political arena, but in other arenas.  I think that if the Minister is instrumental <Col N="177" /> in bringing in all those parties under the control of the proper authority he deserves the gratitude of the Irish people, and, as far as I am concerned, I am going to support this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I might almost say that I am rather amused that the Minister who, regularly and unfailingly, got up to criticise me, when I was in office, in bringing in this renewing Bill, should now proceed to do the very same thing for which he criticised me.  I do not blame him for that, except that I think he should have been a little wiser before the event instead of being wise after it. There are one or two things about the Army which I have always viewed with a certain amount of concern.  Men who joined the Army, whether from the beginning or who came in since through the stepping-off ground of the cadets, have certain rights in the way of expectation of promotion and so on.  There are men in the Army now who have been there from the very beginning and who are still only lieutenants or captains.  Very often that happens in armies on account of the fact that the men themselves have not been suitable for promotion, but in our Army the situation was different.  In the beginning, the men were, roughly, more or less about the one age, and instead of the natural going out of men when they reached a certain age limit, our case is that we have men in the higher ranks of about the same age as those in the lower ranks.  Naturally, the prospects of promotion of those in the lower ranks are considerably disimproved by that condition.  Some steps were taken to try to rectify that situation, as the Minister is aware, but he has taken steps now which, to my mind, are directly contrary to justice.  If a man is not fit for promotion, he should not be promoted; but if he is fit for promotion, then the natural flow and sequence should take place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are men in the service at the moment, men who are cadets, second lieutenants, first lieutenants and so on, who had a hope of rising in rank according as vacancies occurred so long as their merits justified such promotion. <Col N="178" /> The Minister has gone out of his way arbitrarily to inflict an injustice on the men of the lower ranks by going to the ends of the earth in order to take men, some of whom are already over age, and place them over the heads of the cadets and men in the junior ranks who have already had long service in the Army.  The Minister may say that that was a good act on his part and that he had friends in distant parts of the world whom he wanted to pay out of public funds. Personally, I would disapprove of that, but what he is actually doing is that he is definitely injuring men in the lower ranks of the officer class. That, in my opinion, is a real injustice.</P>
    <P>The Minister has started what is called this new Army.  Going along the roads to-day, I saw painted on the roads: &ldquo;Boycott the Militia.  Join the I.R.A.&rdquo;  The police are well aware as to who the people are who disfigure the roads in that way.  I presume that the Government, notwithstanding its appalling record during the last two years, will take appropriate action against the people who are guilty of scrawling along the roads in that fashion.  They must take such action. We are now going to expend a large sum of money in creating this new Army, or this political Army, or whatever you like to call it, and the supporters of the Government, or those who are claimed to be their supporters, are actively engaged in trying to make that expenditure a mere waste of money.  As I say, I presume that action will be taken against those people. The Minister, time and again, got up here, when he was in opposition, and, no matter how I reduced the cost of the Army, he and the members of his Party consistently said that the economies should have been bigger. They always reminded me of the Emperor of Abyssinia, who wanted to see a railway train, and who, when the train was drawn up before him at a certain place, looked at it and said: &ldquo;I thought it was bigger.&rdquo;  That was their consistent attitude when they were in opposition.  As I pointed out some time ago, the direct expenditure on the Army, in the last <Col N="179" /> few years we were in office, was a little over £1,100,000.  The cry of Fianna Fáil at that time, when the general taxation of the country was much lower, and when the general prosperity of the country was very much higher, was that it was a wanton extravagance and that we were seriously injuring the country by that expenditure on our armed forces.  They are now increasing the cost of the Army themselves.  Time and again they said that we had to expend that much on the Army merely because we were anti-nationalist and Imperial and all the rest of the things they used to call us, and that the Army had to be maintained only because of contingent revolutionary conditions in this country which would disappear immediately when they got into power. Now, when they have got into power, they find that they must make the Army cost the people more.  In the case of this Department, just as in the case of every other sphere of Government activity, they have reversed the promises they made.</P>
    <P>Personally, I think that, when we went out of office, the cost of the Army had been reduced to the minimum it could be maintained at; but certainly, under this new Administration by whose action the country has become so impoverished and is being driven towards bankruptcy, this is a time, probably, for even greater efforts towards economy in this particular Department than during our régime. On the contrary, however, for reasons which the Government has never had the consistency or honesty to tell us here, there is now to be an increased expenditure on this Department.  I was not here when the Minister was speaking, but I remember that, annually, be used the cry that we were importing our ammunition and that, therefore we were completely at the mercy of the ancient and historic enemy of the Irish people, if and when there should be a condition of war.  I believe that now some steps are being taken for the making of certain types of ammunition in this country.</P>
    <P>I should like to know if it is going to be as economical from the point of <Col N="180" /> view of costs as the previous method of importing munitions.  I should like the Minister also to explain whether, after taking this step, if we were completely blockaded we should be able to produce our own armaments in this country.  Of course anybody with any sort of intelligence at all&mdash;I do not include the Minister in that category&mdash; would know that this country is not able to produce the raw materials for munitions and that therefore it must import them.  That being so, the argument that was put up here on a previous occasion as to the dependence of this country on external sources during a blockade of our coast if we were at war was absolute humbug.  To use an old <i>cliché</i>, every avenue should be explored for the purpose of saving money for the people of the country, but I can see quite clearly here that the Army is going to cost us more than previously.  In a number of directions the Minister, in defiance of all wisdom, is going out of his way to make the Army more expensive and to give us less value for our money.  In regard to the new Army which he has created, something might be said for it but, personally, I do not see the specific advantage of a force recruited in that form as against the &ldquo;B&rdquo; Reserve which we created and that still exists.</P>
    <P>I think that it was fundamentally wrong in recruiting the new force to advert to the past.  We are always being told that the sooner the past is forgotten the better; yet in this new Army special arrangements are being made for men with old service.  The Army has to fulfil a certain function, to fulfil a useful purpose, and that should be the aim to have in mind when one is recruiting or when one is building up an Army.  If there are people who by reason of their services deserve something from the State, for having, say, tried to overthrow the State, then obviously the proper form would be to give something in the way of pensions to these people, but to bring in people who have no qualifications for the work that they presumably are to perform except that they were <i>personae gratae</i> with the members of the present Government ten or 12 years ago, is to <Col N="181" /> my mind perfectly scandalous.  This new body should be a body recruited from men who are eminently suitable for the work which they have to perform.  That should be the guiding principle in selecting these men.  To go back and recruit men who have clearly passed the age at which they would be recruited into any armed force and to make special arrangements for them&mdash; what does it mean?  It is merely a camouflaged pension scheme.  Personally I should prefer to see the thing done in a straightforward way by giving them the appropriate pension that the Government thinks they should have, rather than that they should be brought into an army and be actually a hindrance to the fulfilment of the functions that presumably the Army will fulfil.</P>
    <P>The country is going to have an army recruited on several lines&mdash;One body selected because they had early service and another to serve some useful purpose in the present and the future. When you have such an army mingling together in that way, it very often happens, as in life generally, that there is a levelling force which works down to the lowest common denominator instead of up to the highest.  This proposal of the Government is going to make for general inefficiency in that body.  If we are to have such a body we should certainly try to see that we get the best that is to be had. I am personally convinced that it would be much better to have given whatever the Government proposes to give to these henchmen of the Government in the way of a gratuity or a pension, to have the new body an efficient body and not to have it cluttered up with a lot of people who have no qualifications except some little debt which is due to them by the Party opposite.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Bill itself, one can hardly vote against it, because one knows perfectly well that the continuance and the existence of the Army depend on the passing of the Bill.  I do not know what the Minister said about a permanent Bill, or as to when he proposes to introduce it.  I was personally very careful to give no specific undertaking when I was in office as to when that Bill would be forthcoming, <Col N="182" /> because I knew it would be a long, complicated Bill, that would take a considerable time to get into draft and that would need careful consideration by the Government.  I do think, however, that a certain amount of apology was due from the Minister, seeing that he had thrown his weight about here so often when the last Government was in office, but instead we have that sincerest form of insult produced, an imitation of what was done in our time. I do think that these men who have been recruited into the Army should be recruited as Irish citizens, that they should give service to the country instead of having their country giving service to them in the way of gratuities for previous service to the persons who form the Government at the present moment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason I intervene in this debate is because of the astounding speech of Deputy Kent, to which I listened a few moments ago. I had always looked upon Deputy Kent as a man of peace until I heard his rather belicose pronouncement a few moments ago.  I hope we shall never see the day in this country when our school boys and girls will go to school armed with shot guns and rifles, that might usefully be turned, on occasion, against the schoolmasters.  I do hope that we shall never reach that stage in this country at any rate.  When I read in the Press quite recently that even the presence of blue shirts caused a strike in some schools, I was just wondering&mdash;and I commend the thought to Deputy Kent&mdash;what the presence of guns, perhaps a few machine guns, would mean if they were introduced into the national schools in the country. Turning to the serious side of the matter, I consider this a very serious position for the Irish people.  I find that in the year 1933-34 the Estimate for the Defence Forces amounted to £1,253,334.  The Estimate for 1934-35 for this country, which at the moment is undergoing a severe economic depression, is £1,476,731, or an increase of £233,397.  While I have advocated for many years back in this House that we should at some stage or another introduce, in relation to the maintenance of military forces, something <Col N="183" /> of a more permanent character, on this occasion, seeing that there is a huge increase, a relatively huge increase, in the amount to be voted for the Army, I want to be taken as registering my objection to the Vote, whether there is a division on it or not.  I feel in all the circumstances&mdash;the very severe economic depression that exists in our cities and towns, and the appalling depression that exists in agriculture&mdash;that this sum of £233,397 which is in excess of the Vote of last year, could be more usefully expended in coming to the relief of agriculture or in some other way that would help to relieve the economic depression through which our people are passing. I, in common with many other ordinary citizen of the State, am prompted to ask the question: what do we want this new Army for?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is it going to achieve?  If I could feel with the Minister that it would be a means of bringing together many of those who were in conflict and in opposite camps during the civil war I would support it.  My endeavours during a long period of years have been towards bringing about that state of affairs, but I do not see the slightest chance that it will achieve that object.  We have already heard here in this House quotations read out by Deputy Dillon&mdash;and many of us have ourselves read Press paragraphs and inspired articles emanating from another force, namely, the I.R.A.&mdash; which are aimed indirectly at preventing members of the I.R.A., and those whom they may hope at some time to rope into their organisation, from joining the new force set up by the Minister for Defence.  Again, we have the fact that the officers are recruited not from the regular Army, in which the present Minister for Defence in common with the previous Minister for Defence takes a very definite pride, but from persons who were in open arms against the established Government of this State during the civil war.  In that connection, I think we should not lose sight of the statement made by President de Valera in this House no later than a couple of <Col N="184" /> weeks ago, when he expressed grave doubts&mdash;not in those actual words, mind you; I do not want to misquote him; but the words are there to be read by anybody in the official report and in the ordinary daily Press of the country&mdash;as to what was really the legitimate Army during the civil war period.  Now that is a statement coming from the head of the State&mdash;the State built up by ten years' hard endeavour and hard work; built up at the risk of the lives of many Ministers and indeed of many members of this House.  That splendid organisation, the National Army, was handed over in full working order, a loyal Army to the present Minister as it was a loyal Army to the previous Minister; a loyal Army to this administration as it had been a loyal Army to the previous administration. That is the slap in the teeth&mdash;to use the expression that has become familiar in this House from its use by the Minister for Industry and Commerce&mdash;given to this National Army, in spite of its tradition and all the bouquets that have been flung at it by the Minister for Defence, Deputy Aiken, and by the previous Minister for Defence.  That is the appreciation that is paid to that Army&mdash;a slap in the teeth, to use the phrase now made familiar by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>Now, I am a lover of peace and subscribe to nearly every word that was used the other night in the presence of President de Valera, when the President himself expressed the hope that at some time or another we would have in this world full disarmament, if it were possible.  That was seconded and agreed to by the former Minister for Defence, but on that occasion a member of the Seanad suggested that, while it was all right to talk and to give lip service to peace amongest nations abroad, if we looked over our own shoulders we might be better engaged in cultivating peace at home.  Those are not the exact words, but a brief summary.  One is naturally driven to put the question a second time: whom or what is this army going to fight?  Have we not already in sufficient numbers an Army <Col N="185" /> that was formed under the previous régime?  What is the necessity for bringing about the establishment of this new Army?</P>
    <P>As Deputy Dillon pointed out a moment ago, it will mean that you will eventually train a number of young boys who, up to the establishment of that Army, were not familiar with the use of arms.  They are now to be trained how to shoot, by competent instructors.  Whom or what are they going to shoot?  Let us again come down to brass tacks and see what use, in the name of God, this Army would be&mdash;even if it were twice as numerous as the Minister for Defence has indicated&mdash;against an invading force?  They could just hold them up for a few hours, the same as the little army in Belgium did when the European War broke out.  Our greatest security lies in having no Army at all.  The greatest security that this country could have is to scrap all armies.  Unlike Deputy Kent, who, I believe, was more jocose than serious when he made his rather warlike speech, I believe the best contribution we could make towards our own security would be to abolish even the National Army, though I do not want to suggest it at the moment.  I feel that the National Army has very useful functions to perform, in addition to our police force if and when required.  On the other hand, can any sane man in this House tell me&mdash;I probably will lay myself open to some very smart repartee but there are some sane people outside the House; more sane people, relatively and proportionately, than are to be found on the Government Benches opposite&mdash;what object this new force is going to achieve?  The Minister for Defence will possibly accuse me of being a non-militarist, with out having been a soldier, etc., but the question that he and every sane man in this House must face up to is this: what use would our 20,000 or 50,000 or even 100,000 of an Army in this country be against an invading force?  Five or six decent battleships would blow the whole lot of us to smithereens in a <Col N="186" /> few minutes.  That is true, and it is not liked.</P>
    <P>I would make this suggestion with all due seriousness to the Labour Party.  Labour parties throughout the world are pacifists, and in the final analysis what occurs in every war is that it is the working-class people who make the food for cannon. It is the working-class people who suffer.  Let me remind the Minister that in the great conflict here in 1916, and from that on, even to the civil war, it was the working-class people who suffered.  The other gentlemen held high office, and were snugly ensconced as Intelligence Officers. Many of them lacked any kind of intelligence, but it does not matter. They were safe, and it was the poor Pasty Murphys, and the Johnny MacCarthys, and the poor humble labourers and workers in the country, who suffered.  They have got no pensions, either under President Cosgrave's régime or the present one.  I doubt that very many of them will get pensions under the Minister's own pension Bill which he introduced here last session.  I would ask the members of the official Labour Party in this House to vote with me on this matter of armies, for the reason I have just advanced&mdash;apart from the other reasons altogether&mdash;that if there is any trouble in this country, whether it comes from an invading force or whether it is internal trouble, the people who suffer most are the working-classes.</P>
    <P>For that reason I want to register my vote against this Bill.  This is the first occasion on which I have done it, or which I propose to do it, as a pacifist, as one who does not believe in war, but who, perhaps, if put to it, would make as good a defence as some of the soldiers.  I can use a gun as well as any man&mdash;but always under licence. My name has been registered with the Minister for Justice as holding a gun licence for more years than I care to remember at the present moment.  I would put this to the Labour Party in particular, that it is the people whom they are supposed to represent who will suffer most in any conflict that comes about in this country.  It is they who <Col N="187" /> have suffered in the past, and for that reason I am registering my protest against this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had some very interesting speeches on this Vote to-day. We had Deputy Dillon, whose principal objection was that 20 new army officers had been appointed. Deputy Dillon, apparently, thinks that while 500 or 600 army officers can be drawn from one particular side, the drawing of 20 officers from the other side was a terrible outrage.  Deputy Dillon quietly folded a big blanket around his head in 1917 and took it off in 1927&mdash;or was it 1931?&mdash;and he now turns round and talks about those men not having the necessary experience and skill.  Those 20 men are men who beat the best army that England could produce in the field, and beat them repeatedly, from 1917 to 1921.  They have had that experience.  Deputy Dillon, who professes such a terrible respect now for the National Army, made the extraordinary statement in this House, when he was a member of another Party, that he would neither take off his hat to the &ldquo;Soldiers' Song&rdquo; nor kow-tow to the Tricolour. That is the respect he had then for that Army, for the National Anthem, and for the flag of this country.  Since he has been enrolled in the fold, I believe he has taken off his hat to the &ldquo;Soldiers' Song,&rdquo; and I believe that he has even learned a few verses&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Anyone living in this country to-day and seeing the trend of affairs in this country must realise that there is an absolute necessity to endeavour to draw together all the national forces in this country, and particularly the young men who are being misled on one side or the other.  I never had much respect for politics or for politicians, but there has undoubtedly crept into Irish politics&mdash;whether it came in with the MacDermots and the Dillons I do not know, but unfortunately it came in <Col N="188" /> just at the point at which they came in &mdash;during the last two years, the same dirty filth and mud slinging&mdash;the kind of stuff that made us blush for shame the other night when the President of this State had to get up and make a statement here&mdash;that could be read only in the newspapers of the time when we had the Molly Maguires and the other mob here on the warpath against one another.

      <P>If there is an effort being made to pull the young men of this country together to serve this country, I say that the Minister for Defence is doing very useful work.  I have met old comrades of mine who were parted from me in the civil war and who are now in the National Army and despite all that Deputy Desmond Fitzgerald said here to-day about the Army, their statement to me is: &ldquo;There is one thing we are certain of anyway&mdash;we are being treated like human beings since the new Minister for Defence came in; and we are not having any more of Desmond Fitzgerald.&rdquo;  I am still more surprised at Deputy Anthony.  He asks what good or what use is the Army and suggests that it could do nothing for 24 hours.  I remember the period when Deputy Anthony did not hold that view, when Deputy Anthony thought that even a wooden gun on Parnell Bridge in Cork was sufficient to beat back the Germans, and when Deputy Anthony used to come out every night in a uniform and with a big military stride and with a long timber musket on his shoulder, pace up and down Parnell Bridge asking &ldquo;What German dares invade Parnell Bridge while I am here?&rdquo;  The Deputy Anthony who at that time thought that a timber gun&mdash; not even an old shot gun&mdash;was sufficient to beat the Germans, now thinks that our Army is not sufficient to beat anything.  He has undoubtedly changed his views immensely.</P>

      <P>That is the non-militant Deputy Anthony we have to-day as compared with the military gentleman I saw when I, a poor young fellow, used to come into Cork with a load of oats, striding up and down Parnell Bridge in such an attitude that I thought the horse would shy at him. Of course, we are living in different times and different days but I am glad that the Farmers' Party in this House has given its blessing to the idea of pulling the young men of this country together, because if ever there is an invasion threatened in this country or if ever this country is threatened by any foreign enemy, it is not the regular Army we shall have to depend upon but on the patriotism of the young men of this country&mdash;of the same young men who banded themselves together from 1918 to 1921 and beat a bigger force than will ever again come against us.  I believe that the formation of this force, no matter what pessimism there may be on the opposite benches, will do an enormous lot to pull together the young men who, undoubtedly, to-day are being dragged into two different camps in this country and to get them into one solid force, determined on one thing alone&mdash;serving their country in her hour of need.  We undoubtedly want an Army in this country; we want an Army in this country to defend what we have already got and, please God, to finish the job our comrades died for.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Anthony that some form or show of opposition should be put up to this Bill, not in the sense of abolishing the Army but, to quote the words of the last speaker, to defend the little we have got now.  If Ministers come into this House looking for more money and still more money when the national income is declining, we will very soon want no Army to defend what is left, because there will be nothing left to defend.  A sum of about £300,000 more for the Army is being asked for this year over and above what was asked for last year, and all indications that any intelligent man can see anywhere point to the fact that this country is <Col N="190" /> going down economically.  Yesterday and for many days, the whole Oireachtas has been engaged in discussing a Bill to cut salaries.  Why? Because the country cannot pay them, and now you are going to increase the outlay of the country on the Army.  It is quite true, as Deputy Anthony says, the Army is not of the size that any invading nation would take seriously, but for the purposes for which we want an army our Army is big enough.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Corry that if the formation of this new Volunteer Force would bring together old comrades, we should be prepared to go the whole way not only in paying this £300,000 extra, but £1,000,000 extra or even £10,000,000 more if it would achieve that object.  How will it?  It will not.  I do not want to go into the political side of the matter, because I am only opposing it on the ground that this country cannot afford to pay for the luxury of a larger Army now in the light of our bank returns and our trade returns, which are going down, while our unemployment figures are going up.  In addition, the price of everything we have to sell is going down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Look at this matter from your own point of view, and let the conditions governing your own private business be the conditions that ought to govern the country at the present time.  You can only see one thing ahead of you&mdash; ruin and bankruptcy.  What applies to the individual applies to the nation. Is it not time that those in control of the destinies of the nation took stock and said: &ldquo;We must economise&rdquo;? Instead of that we are confronted with another proposal, which will be put forward later, to give sanction to an increase of £2,000,000 in the Estimates this year over last year's Estimates. As a supporter of that we have a Deputy, a man who some five or six years ago wrote this pamphlet I have in my hand, on how to reduce taxation and to abolish income tax.  He wrote that when he was out of office.  That man got into office on the specious plea that he was going to bring about economies all round.  When such men come into office they show themselves greater spendthrifts, and spendthrifts <Col N="191" /> on matters that are not essential to the economic life of the country&mdash;greater spendthrifts and greater wasters than their predecessors.</P>
    <P>If we are in an economic fight let us have one fight at a time.  Let us mobilise our economic strength instead of wasting our economic strength on a force that is absolutely useless for the purpose of offence or defence.  If a Minister came up with a proposal to continue the Army for another year on its present basis there would be no need for discussion at all in the matter.  But inherent in this Bill is a proposal to increase the expenditure on the Army.  We have a proposal to increase expenditure at the same time that the country is going down economically and financially.  That is the time a proposal is put up to spend more money on an unproductive service like the Army.  A sum of £70,000 is going to be added to the cost of the Gárda Síochána since last year.  Where is the money to come from?  It is in that sense that I am opposing this Bill.</P>
    <P>Before I sit down I want to repeat that in my opinion any effort, even if it were to increase the Army Vote or the Police Vote or any service whatsoever, even at a cost of £10,000,000, would be money well spent if it brought together old comrades in the fight for independence, comrades who are now estranged and bitter enemies. If such a proposal were put up I would support it even if it cost ten millions provided I were convinced that it would achieve its object.  But this will not achieve that object, and it is imposing a burden on a country that is going down.  Instead of being asked to put up two million pounds less than last year the country is being asked to put up two million more than last year.  While we are not within £20,000,000 of being as well able to face our responsibilities this year as we were last year we are asked to spend more money on the Army.  The thing is nothing short of insanity in the present state of the country.  Like Deputy Anthony, if there is a division on this Bill, I will be delighted to vote against it.</P>

      <P>We have heard from Deputy Corry that certain undesirable tendencies are revealing themselves amongst the youth of the country at the present moment. I will only say one word as to that. In a speech made yesterday in England I notice that Mr. Baldwin, in advocating democracy, pointed out that England was perhaps distinguished from other countries by the fact that the ordinary citizen, when he saw crime being committed, was prepared to rush forward at the risk of death or serious personal injury to assist the police.  He gave a series of examples during recent years in England where that had occurred.  That is the spirit that I agree is associated with democracy, and that is the spirit that I would wish to see developed in this country.  When Deputy Corry talks of dangerous tendencies developing amongst the youth of the country he might remember that as far as our Party is concerned, at any rate, the spirit to which I have alluded to the very spirot that we have been trying to develop.</P>

      <P>The point I wish to make is this: We are all anxious to develop more civic spirit in this country; we are all anxious to assuage the bitterness of the past; and we are all anxious to bring the citizens of this country together as much as possible.  But I deny that it is by playing up to militarist instincts that that can best be achieved.</P>
      <P>The recruitment of this force is something that has been decided upon already, and I suppose it is no use flogging a dead horse.  We have not yet heard any suggestion as to its utility, beyond the suggestion that it will take care of a certain number of young men who might otherwise be doing something more undesirable. The President did, indeed, in reply to the point which was repeated by Deputy Anthony to-day, the point that even the enlarged Army would not be sufficient to repel the invading forces of any powerful nation, say, that while the Army could not do that, it could after the invader had established himself make the position of the invader extremely uncomfortable by conducting a guerilla warfare similar to what was conducted in 1919-1921.  I must say that I feel a shudder pass through me at any one contemplating our returning ever to such a state of things as prevailed in this country from 1919 to 1921.</P>
      <P>But it is worth pointing out that the size of the army that it is appropriate for a country to have depends very largely on that country's foreign policy.  If one were to take seriously the utterances about foreign policy of the greater number of speakers and supporters of the Fianna Fáil Party, I must admit that we would indeed need in this country a far larger professional Army than we have and, in addition to that, conscription for the entire population in time of war.  The greatest security&mdash; and I say this with full seriousness&mdash; that this country can possibly have against invasion from anywhere is membership of the British Commonwealth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="195" /> The reason that that is such a great security is that, if any interference with us by physical force were attempted so long as we are members of the British Commonwealth, there is not a single one of the overseas members, such as Canada, South Africa and Australia, that would not be on our side.  If the invasion contemplated was one from Great Britain, that is something that Great Britain could not do without breaking up the entire Commonwealth, so long as we are members of it.  But when responsible politicians in this country advocate, not only our becoming a republic, but advocate by implication, by the general tone of their speeches, and by the spirit that they evoke in their followers, that we should be in a state of perpetual hostility to the people across the water in England, do they realise the enormous danger of a military character with which they are proposing to confront this nation in future?  They propose to expose us as a small nation of three millions to possible warfare in days to come with a nation of over forty millions across the sea and we will have nothing whatever to protect us against the renewal of the sorrows of Irish history except such little forces as we can muster in this little State of ours.</P>
    <P>One word as to the operation of the new defence force.  I regret its creation; I cannot see its utility.  It has made a bad start in the matter of the officers who have been selected to run it.  It is not too late for the Minister to undo some of the harm he has done.  It is not too late for him to divert, say, 50 per cent. of the officers appointed in connection with the new defence force to the regular Army and to replace them in the new defence force by existing officers of the regular Army.  Then we could with some confidence tell our friends and supporters throughout the country that the Government was making a serious effort to establish a nonpartisan force.  I will tell the Minister this.  I have been expressing the opinion myself to colleagues and friends throughout the country that <Col N="196" /> the Opposition should do nothing and say nothing to cause this to be a partisan force.  I take the view that we should give the Minister the benefit of every doubt we can as to this being an honest attempt to establish a nonpartisan force.  I should like, if the Minister will do what is necessary to disarm suspicious which, so far, have proved to be impossible for me at any rate to conjure away&mdash;I should like to see our supporters go into the new defence force just as much as the supporters of any other Party.  But, if that is to be done, the Minister must give those of us who would like to assist him in this matter a sporting chance.  I suggest that the first thing he should do is to make such rearrangement of the officers connected with the regular Army and with this new defence force as will enable us to assure with confidence those who trust us that this enterprise of the Minister for Defence is not simply an attempt to create something that will be politically useful to his own Party.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy MacDermot made one very dangerous statement and I would appeal to him not to repeat it. He said that Fianna Fáil advocates a perpetual state of hostility to England. Neither Fianna Fáil nor any other Party in this country at any time ever advocated perpetual hostility to England.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister will recollect that I used the words &ldquo;by implication.&rdquo;  I am quite well aware that President de Valera and other Ministers have disclaimed the desire for hostility with England&mdash; quite well aware of it&mdash;but the general tenor and tone of Fianna Fáil speeches throughout the country have been quite otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to point out to the Deputy that this is one of the unfair things which England has always said about this country&mdash;it is one of the slanders&mdash;and if he uses any form of words that can by any manner of means be stretched to fit in with that British slander he will find that he will be quoted very often by them. If they do not quote this particular <Col N="197" /> instance, if he does not watch out and repeat that sort of stuff, they will take care to quote it themselves in justification for what they have done.  This country never had any quarrel with England unless England interfered with us.  If England gives us what we want &mdash;that is, if she gives the Irish people the right to run our own affairs in our own way&mdash;we will have no more quarrel with her.  I believe that Irishmen of all Parties in the House should point that out clearly to everybody.  I do not want to say anything more about it at the moment.</P>
      <P>Deputies Dillon, Fitzgerald and MacDermot criticised our appointing 20 newly-commissioned officers to take charge of recruitment of the volunteers, or, as they put it, to take charge of the new force.  I want to point out that there is only one force, that is the National Defence Force, and that we are adding to that force a number of volunteer regiments to be recruited. In order to recruit those volunteer regiments we added 20 officers to the staff of the regular Army.  Those officers, together with other officers of the regular Army, went out throughout the country to organise and recruit these volunteer regiments.  These particular 20 officers will not be controlling the force.  A number of them are captains.  They, in turn, are controlled by the executive officers of the military districts concerned, who are commandants. These commandants are controlled by the higher ranks of the Army, and so on and so forth.  I cannot see any legitimate reason for criticising the Government for bringing in these 20 officers.  I think that the vast majority of the people in the country are delighted to see this being done, and I think that Deputy Dillon is pursuing a bad line of criticism of the Government's policy when he is on that particular line, and I would advise him to take some other line of criticism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another criticism used by Deputies was that we were doing a great disservice to the country by taking in fresh young men who never had any idea of or training for, war or arms before, and training them as soldiers. I do not think we are doing any <Col N="198" /> disservice to the country by this.  I should like to see world peace and national peace established, as much as any man.  I should like to see world problems and national problems settled by reason and argument rather than by force, but we all must realise that we are not in a situation when any reasonable man can look forward with any sort of hope to the time when international problems are going to be settled by reason and argument, or even to the time when internal problems are going to be settled by reason and argument, unless you have behind the people who want problems to be settled in that way a force that can compel such problems to be settled by reason and argument.  One of the things behind the League of Nations was that those who got together in that body had some sort of agreement between themselves that if one nation or unit forming the League broke out, and took warlike steps before they were justified, or before they were approved by the League, the League would step in and bring that unit to heel.  The reason that the League of Nations failed, and that we had this war between Japan and China, was that the League did not stand up to that.  We realise that there is a large number of nations of the world which could beat us; but we realise also that if the Irish people are put to it, and if some foreign nation unjustifiably interferes with our affairs here, or attempts to land a force to cursh the Irish people, there is sufficient spirit in the Irish people to fight to the last ditch rather than submit to them.  A knowledge of that fact by foreign countries, and of the fact that the Irish people have not only the spirit to fight, but the training to fight efficiently, will make foreign countries think twice or three times or, perhaps, four times, before they interfere in an unwarranted way with our affairs.  I do not believe that it is a disservice to the country to organise this Volunteer Force.  I believe it is a great service to the country, and one which future generations, looking back, will believe to have been a wonderful service to the nation.</P>
    <P>We are going to organise and train <Col N="199" /> these young men as soldiers.  We are not going to educate them into going around looking for rows and trailing their coats.  We are bringing them under the elected representatives of the people, pledged to uphold the Government elected by the people. These young men will be not alone a source of strength in the country's efforts to secure recognition of its international rights, but they will be a source of strength to whatever Government is here in getting acceptance of democratic principles by everybody in the country.  They will be a disciplined example to all the young men in their neighbourhood of how young people should behave towards their Government.  They will be volunteers, trained as soldiers, and ready to obey.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzgerald and, I think, Deputy Dillon, said that by bringing in these 20 new officers we were cutting across the expectations of promotion which the present junior officers in the Army have.  The only thing that I can say is that if this Volunteer Force had not been started we would not have wanted these officers and that, therefore, at the present time, the junior officers in the Army have as good a chance of promotion as they had before.  Deputy Fitzgerald also alluded to the fact that we were not producing our own munitions.  I am sorry to have to admit that we are not, but I hope that, as soon as we can, we will be able to do so.  Since we came into office I did everything I could to speed up the making of munitions here and I hope to be able to announce progress in that direction before long.  Deputy Fitzgerald also said that he did not see any advantage in the Volunteers over the &ldquo;B&rdquo; Reserve.  That is strange, because during the last year he was Minister for Defence he tried to organise a volunteer scheme.  He did it at a great deal of expense and the whole thing was a flop.  I am delighted to be able to say that the efforts we have made to organise the Volunteer Force are meeting with success in all parts of the country where the area administrative officers have gone, and that, <Col N="200" /> notwithstanding the fact that Deputy Dillon and <i>An Phoblacht</i> have combined to knock the scheme, we have been successful and are getting men of all parties into it; not alone into the ranks but into the committees.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzgerald said that the Volunteer scheme was in some way a camouflaged pension scheme.  That is simply a senseless remark from Deputy Fitzgerald, seeing that these men are not paid.  Deputy Fitzgerald also said that the mixing of the three lines would lead to inefficiency. The three lines will not be mixed, except in the local halls.  When the first line troops are up for training they will be called up in their own companies, in their own battalions, with their own officers, and they will have nothing to do with the second or third line.  There will be no mixing.  For local training purposes, however, and for local sports and recreational purposes, they will be all members of the local sluagh and under the command of the local sluagh commandant, but that is not a war organisation. It is an organisation for training and recreational purposes. Deputy Belton, in his own words, had to make some show of opposition to the Bill, and he made it.  He said he was prepared to spend ten million pounds, however, if it brought old comrades together.  I think we have not alone that problem of getting old comrades together, but we have the problem of making sure that the same thing will not happen in future as happened heretofore, and that the soldiers we have will keep together.</P>

      <P>And will continue to be worked.  Deputy MacDermot said that the greatest security anyone could have against invasion is membership of the British Commonwealth.  I do not know.  We certainly did not find that membership of the British Commonwealth saved us from the invasion of the Black and Tans.  I certainly would not like to have to rely on the help and support of the Dominions, or on the hope that they were going to stand by us if the same thing happened again.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely there were a lot of people like Deputy MacDermot at that time saying that they would be content with Dominion Home Rule and I did not see the British coming forward to offer it to them.  Instead the British slogan was: &ldquo;Shoot, do not argue.&rdquo;  We want, if they ever get into that berserker rage in future, to be able to take on the argument.  There is one argument I admit that has to be faced in connection with this force and that is the argument of the expense. A sum of £233,000 more than last year is to be expended in the coming year on Army services but a large proportion of that will be capital expenditure which will not be repeated in future. As I have said, there are three basic and very big reasons for starting the force and every one of them is sufficient to justify the expenditure of the amount which we propose to expend, or even, as Deputy Belton has said, the expenditure of ten times that amount.</P>

      <P>It is in Committee on Finance that the main debate has taken place in the past. Before the Minister rises, I wish to reply briefly to questions put privately to the Chair by two Deputies, as to <Col N="207" /> the scope of discussion on this Vote. On the positive side, questions of expenditure and administration may be discussed.  The question of taxation does not arise, nor variation in taxation.  Legislation, passed or pending, may not be discussed.  It is not permissible to analyse detailed items of the Vote&mdash;to discuss the incidence of a specific tariff, for instance.  Matters raised should have a general bearing, and the Opposition Parties usually indicate in advance what matters they intend to raise.  I understand that two subjects have been selected on this occasion.  In the main, the debate is confined to the question of expenditure.  The time-honoured question, &ldquo;where is the money to be got?&rdquo; may be neither asked nor answered on this Vote.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>In speaking to the motion, I should say that the total estimate for the Supply Services for the year 1934-35 is £29,709,107.  It is usual on the first Vote on Account for the year to ask for approximately one-third of the total amount required for the annual supply.  In the present instance we are, as may be seen from the Order Paper, asking for £10,560,900, which is something more than one-third of the total Supply Estimate.  The excess Vote over this fraction is occasioned by the fact that on certain Votes more than one-third <Col N="208" /> of the total amount to be provided must be expended in the earlier portions of the year.  I wish to make a detailed reference to some of the more important of these.  On Vote No. 25, which is for the Supplementary Agricultural Grant, one half of the total provision set out in the Volume of Estimates is asked for now. That is because one morety of each of the grants there detailed becomes payable from the 31st July.  Similarly in the case of Vote No. 28, for Universities and Colleges, the grants to be provided out of this Vote are paid quarterly to the University Colleges of Cork, Dublin and Galway, and half-yearly to Trinity College, Dublin. As one half of the total Vote thus becomes payable about the 1st July that amount is asked for in this Vote on Account.  In the case of Vote No. 56, Land Commission, the amount asked for is substantially greater than the normal one-third.  The explanation there is that one-half of the provision under sub-heads K, H and T, which together account for £684,140 of the total estimate, will have to be paid into the Land Bond Fund in June next.  In the case of Vote No. 69 for Relief Schemes, the estimate here includes the sum of £130,000 for the completion of schemes commenced in the current financial year, and the sum of £100,000 for the drainage of bogs, etc., in connection with the commercial development of peat.  It is probable that the bulk of the expenditure under the foregoing heads will have to be met in the early part of this financial year.  Accordingly in this case, as in the case of the other Votes, half the total provision is required on account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In connection with Vote No. 14, I should like at this stage to draw the particular attention of the House to a certain provision which will be covered by that Vote.  Deputies will perhaps remember that during the progress of the Damage to Property (Compensation) (Amendment) Bill of last year through the Seanad I made a statement, in reply to a question addressed to me by Colonel Moore, on the subject of compensation claims for damage to property in Northern Ireland.  It will be remembered that <Col N="209" /> our predecessors paid compensation in certain cases of damage in the pre-Truce period, where applications to the Northern Courts had been refused on the grounds that the property was damaged as a matter of military necessity.  I indicated in the Seanad that the Government were prepared to consider similar claims in respect of the post-Truce period, that is between 12th July, 1921, and the 20th June, 1922.  Since then two cases have come under my notice, which, while not strictly within the letter of the category laid down, are certainly within its spirit.  In both of those cases the damage which was done was very considerable, and was done by Crown Forces within the stated period.  In one case, however, the application for compensation, amounting to £2,067, was dismissed by the Northern County Court on the ground that the premises were used as a place where I.R.A. ammunition was kept, and that they burned of their own accord as an act of spontaneous combustion.  In the other case a decree for £1,070 by the County Court was reversed on appeal, on the ground that accident had not been negatived.  Both cases present features of special hardship, and after careful consideration of all the facts and circumstances I have reached the conclusion that we could not equitably refuse to extend to those cases the same treatment that has been given in the cases dismissed by the courts on the grounds of military necessity. Pending investigation as to the actual damage done, and the cost of reinstatement, it is not possible to state with accuracy what compensation would be fair and reasonable, but on the information available it is not likely that the aggregate payments in the two cases will be more than £2,000. Any payment that may be made will, as in the other Northern Ireland claims coming strictly within the category which I have outlined in the Seanad, be met from this Vote.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to the fact that the total Estimate for the Supply Services for the year 1934-35 is £29,709,107, and Deputies are no doubt aware that the provision to be made by way of annual Vote for the <Col N="210" /> Supply Services represents only part of the expenditure which the Government has to face during any financial year.  In addition, provision has also to be made for the expenditure arising out of Services chargeable upon the Central Fund.  At the moment I am not in a position to say exactly what additional amount will thus be required to make full provision for the coming financial year, but it may be taken to be about £5,700,000.  Reverting to the Estimates for Supply, it has already been remarked that they represent a substantial increase over the Estimates for last year.</P>

      <P>The principal Votes on which increases occur are Vote No. 7, Old Age Pensions, where there is an increase of over £125,000; the Vote for the Local Loans Fund, which shows an increase of £2,050,000; the Vote for Public Works and Buildings, which accounts for an increase of over £113,000, almost half of which is represented by an increased provision for new schools and colleges; the Vote for the Department of Agriculture, which shows an increase of £127,000, of which £90,000 is in respect of a new purchase scheme for oats; the Vote for Primary Education, on which there is an increase of £98,000, largely occasioned by an increase of £294,000 in the amount required for the pensions of national teachers, offset, however, by a decrease of £226,000 in the amount to be provided for their salaries; and the Vote for Unemployment Insurance and Unemployment Assistance, where there is an increase of £1,203,000, the result of providing a sum of £1,500,000 required for the purposes of the Unemployment Assistance Act of 1933, offset, to some extent, by increased Appropriations-in-Aid. In the Vote for £350,000 for Relief Schemes, there is an apparent decrease, as compared with last year, of £200,000, but, in fact, there is a substantial increase of £200,000 over <Col N="211" /> the initial provision made last year. Deputies will recollect that in the original Estimate, which was before the Dáil this time last year, the amount provided was £150,000, and this was subsequently increased by two Supplementary Estimates to £550,000.  In the Land Commission Vote there is an apparent decrease of £1,526,000 due mainly to the elimination of the two items&mdash;£795,000 and £1,403,000&mdash;which were provided from the Central Fund last year to enable certain payments to be made to the Land Bond Fund and to relieve the Guarantee Fund in respect of the deficiency in the amount of annuities collected.  These items between them total, approximately, £2,200,000.  After making allowance for their elimination from the total of last year's Estimate, there is a substantial increase of over £671,000 in the provision which is being made for the Land Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to avoid misunderstanding, it will possibly be advisable to point out at this stage that, over and above what was provided last year for the relief of rates on agricultural land, an additional £220,000 will be granted, making the total amount to be provided in the coming financial year for the relief of such rates £1,970,000, and this is to be compared with a gross sum of £1,948,000 provided for that object by Deputy Cosgrave's Government in 1931-32.  No Vote for this additional amount appears in the Estimates as, like the £250,000 which was provided last year and which will again be provided this year, the provision can be made only by way of a Supplementary Estimate which will be introduced after the Oireachtas has passed the necessary legislation enabling the grant to be made.  These are the principal items which account for the increase in the estimated cost of the Supply Services for next year. The Estimates are up, undoubtedly, by £1,790,000 as compared with the total of the original and the Supplementary Estimates last year, and up by no less than £6,779,475 as compared with the total of the original and Supplementary Estimates introduced in the year 1931-32 by the Government of our predecessors. <Col N="212" /> I know that Deputy Dillon&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Virtually, every penny piece required for the Supply Services next year will be spent in this country on Irish people, promoting Irish industries, fostering Irish agriculture and providing employment for the workless and relief for the destitute. Of the £21,921,000 which our predecessors required for Supply in 1931-32, over £2,000,000 were sent to Great Britain, as the <i>Independent</i> admits in a leader this morning, as was an additional amount of, roughly, £3,000,000 collected by way of land annuities.  The whole of this £2,000,000 and more, which formerly appeared in the Supply Estimates for payment to Great Britain, is now to be distributed in our own country, to our own people in the form of increased old age pensions, accounting for some £700,000, and increased unemployment assistance, accounting for £1,500,000.</P>

      <P>Not only have we this year embarked on a scheme for the production of our own sugar from home grown beet, which will result in an annual expenditure of, approximately, £360,000 in agricultural wages alone, but we are making provision to lay down, at a cost of £102,000, an experimental plant for the manufacture of industrial alcohol.  If that experiment succeeds, we shall have initiated a very far-reaching development indeed in agricultural production.  Our predecessors did not spend one penny in this reproductive way, although they found millions to send out of the country.</P>

      <P>Similarly, for the reafforestation of the country and for the purpose of establishing a native timber industry, which will provide a large mass of employment for our rural population, particularly in the more congested and less fertile districts, we are providing, merely as an initial step, almost £122,000 as compared with £64,000 provided by our predecessors in 1931-32.  Again, in regard to public health works, and through a scheme for the development of our peat resources, for the purpose of giving employment as contrasted with unearned assistance, we are providing £350,000 as against £140,000 provided in 1931-32.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="214" /> My general contention is true also in respect of education, and it is truest of all in respect of housing.  In 1931-32 our predecessors, by way of free grants under the Housing Acts, provided £212,000.  This year we are providing £400,000 for the same purpose.  In addition, under the Local Loans Fund, we are providing for loans for the housing of the working classes £850,000 as against £200,000 provided by our predecessors.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>For loans for the acquisition of houses under the Small Dwellings Acts we are providing £466,000 as against no provision formerly.  Under the Labourers (Ireland) Acts for the provision of houses in rural districts we are providing £2,765,000, once more against no previous provisions by our predecessors. All these sums make a total provision for these and other purposes of the enormous sum of £4,539,000 as against £730,000 which was provided by the Cosgrave Government in 1931-1932. As I have said already, it is not the amount of money which is spent, but it is the purpose on which you spend it, that counts.</P>
      <P>It will be realised that this expenditure upon housing and services of an ancillary and dual purpose, provides, first of all, a considerable amount of employment, so considerable, in fact, that I believe I would not exaggerate if I were to say that, at the moment, unemployment is virtually nonexistent in the building and associated trades in the Free State.  Secondly, and more important from every social and Christian aspect, we are removing the monstrous evil the prolonged existence of which has been a disgrace to our Government and people.  Not merely has this Government and its supporters recognised that, but those who, on political grounds, are most strongly opposed to us have recognised that also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the leading Opposition journals in exposing the housing conditions that exist in our slum areas has done very good work.  Many readers of that journal have banded themselves together with other good citizens <Col N="215" /> and they demand that these conditions should no longer be tolerated and that everything that the Government could do, within the limits of its resources, should be done to end those bad housing conditions.  We, in the Government, have the same conviction. Moved by that conviction and as an indication of our sincerity we are asking the Dáil to provide the funds that are required if any significant advance is to be made with this problem.  I am sure that no section, inside or outside the Dáil, no citizen who has not a vested interest in the maintenance of the existing housing system will dare criticise us for that.</P>
    <P>What we are doing in regard to houses we are doing in the other social services.  The condition of the farmer has been and will be referred to in the course of this debate.  This Estimate provides for an increase amounting to £700,000 for old age pensions.  Fully five-sixths of that amount is finding its way into rural homes.  The Estimates continue the grant for the provision for free milk for necessitous children that has been given in previous years.  The Estimates make further provision, already indicated, for the expansion of our industries and particularly for the establishment of new industries relating to agriculture here.  We are an expanding community with an expanding business.  This country is a going concern.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>The speech to which we have just listened is couched in a tone highly unusual as coming from the custodian of the public purse.  Ministers for Finance in other countries make an effort, at least, to give the impression that they are <Col N="216" /> interested in keeping down expenditure and lightening the burden on the taxpayers as far as they can.  But our Minister for Finance speaks as if he were representing all the spending Departments rolled into one.  While some of the expenditure which has been advocated may be laudable and justifiable, particularly in view of the conditions that the present Government has created in this country, I must say that I should feel happier about the situation and about the financial prospects of the Irish Free State if we had as custodian of the public purse somebody who gave a little evidence of an interest in economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance simply cannot get away with it.  He cannot get away with the impression which he has tried to create that the expenditure to which the House is now asked to assent is something in accord with, and in actual development of, the general policy of the Fianna Fáil Party before it came into office.  No political party in any country ever promised economies with more emphasis and with more of an air of reality than did the Fianna Fáil Party.  They not merely promised it in general terms but they gave the country to understand that they had a watertight plan ready for bringing it about.  They were going, of course, to save the Irish farmer from paying the land annuities.  They were going to prevent money from going out of this country which they maintained ought not to go out of it. But all that was to be left in the pockets of the people who were paying it or it was to be applied for their benefit.  They were not relying upon that money in any way for the accomplishment of the general promise of reducing the taxation of the country. There was a definite undertaking given, as emphatically as an undertaking could be given, that large economies had been planned and were to be accomplished when they came into office.  I am not going to take up the time of the House by quoting once again the election speeches, election leaflets and election posters that have been quoted here many times before. Neither am I going into a discussion, <Col N="217" /> which the Ceann Comhairle has indicated would be inappropriate at this stage, of the various heads in detail that are included in this Vote.  But I just want to make it plain that on this side of the House, at any rate, we are not in the least deceived or dazzled by the line which the Minister for Finance has had the audacity to take in recommending this Vote to us.</P>
    <P>What I do propose to do in the brief remarks that I wish to address to the House is to come down to some of the matters that are at the root of these Estimates.  The Minister for Finance has prided himself on the fact that he has prevented money from going out of this country.  Has he ever asked himself how much money he has prevented from coming into this country?  Is not that a material question to ask?  Every item in this list here, he says, is for expenditure of a reproductive kind in our native land.  I see a little item of £2,450,000 for export bounties and subsidies; for trying to buy our way into the despised British market.  Is that really quite covered by his description that everything in this Vote is to be expended reproductively in our native land?  A week or two ago we had a couple of remarkable speeches made in this House&mdash;remarkable for their length, remarkable in some other respects&mdash;by the Minister for Finance and his Parliamentary Secretary&mdash;the Tweedledum and Tweedledee of the Fianna Fáil Party&mdash;two chips of the same block&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">

      <P>Two blocks of the same chip.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;who manage to combine the aspect of peace and plenty with a certain tendency to have a rush of blood to the head whenever they are making a political speech. Both of the speakers laid enormous stress upon recent declarations by English Ministers, particularly by the English Minister of Agriculture, to the effect that the latest restrictions imposed upon our produce going into England had been imposed, not with the desire to injure us, but because they suited the English people themselves. <Col N="218" /> I am not surprised that the Minister for Finance and other members of the Government were rather startled by that, but I am surprised that they should have expected us to be startled by it.  It was not we on this side of the House who predicted that the British could not manage to do without Irish agricultural products.  We predicted the contrary. Unfortunately the majority of the people believed the members opposite and not us.  Nor was it we who predicted at the last general election that if the Irish people renewed the authority previously given to the Government, an immediate settlement with England was almost certain.  It is the people who made statements of that sort that have got to do a bit of explaining away&mdash;it is not we who have to do the explaining away&mdash;when you find British Ministers saying that some of the restrictions on Irish produce are now put on because it suits them to put them on.  Of course, that is so. That was to be anticipated.  We knew only too well that vested interests would grow up in England that would be suited by the economic war which the Government chose to provoke.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is inferred apparently by the members of the Government that the fact that those vested interests have grown up, and the fact that the British have embarked upon a policy of protecting their own farmers against competition from overseas, are conclusive against the possibility of a settlement being reached even now.  Whether they are sincere in that inference or not I find difficulty in deciding, especially as at the very moment that they are making such statements I find, through reading the Press, especially the local Press, that members of their Party are still going about saying that what they call a victory in the economic war could be gained at any moment but for the unpatriotic conduct of the members of the Opposition. I confess to having very great difficulty in understanding how they can reconcile such statements as that, which they continue to make, with the emphasis they also lay on the fact that it is no use ever hoping to get back <Col N="219" /> the British market, because the British interests are now suited by keeping us out of the British market.</P>
    <P>This House and this country cannot too often be reminded of one simple basic fact and that is, that we need never have put ourselves in the position of an overseas supplier to the British market at all; that we were regarded and treated, for all practical purposes, as home suppliers of a home market; and that there was no reason, other than the folly of the Government, a folly, as I truly believe, arising mainly out of Party bitterness which blinded them to realities, why we should ever have been stirred out of the unassailed position which we held, a position that was exactly the same for us as it was for the farmers in Northern Ireland, and the farmers in Great Britain.  In that case, everything that this British Government or any future British Government might do to protect the home farmers from competition, so far from being something that we would have to regret or fear, would be exactly what suited us best. Instead of devoting so much time to making flamboyant speeches, instead of committing themselves every day to fresh expenditure of one kind or another; expenditure of which a great deal seems to me only productive in the sense that they hope it will be productive of votes in support of their Party; expenditure which often takes the form of attempting to buy off people who are making themselves troublesome or inconvenient to them; I think that even now they would be far better employed in applying their minds to the problem of bringing to an end a state of affairs which is ruining Irish agriculture.  That it is perfectly practicable to bring it to an end, I am absolutely convinced.  That it would involve no dishonour to us to bring it to an end, I am equally convinced.</P>
    <P>The Government are obsessed with the fear that they would be accused of surrender if they took the sensible course and the course that is in the interests of the Irish people.  To my mind, the policy they have adopted in the past has been a policy of surrender, <Col N="220" /> a surrender of Irish interests and, I regret to say, a surrender of Irish honour.</P>
    <P>I do not think that they have anything to fear from the verdict of history with regard to any action they may now take to remedy the situation they have created.  They often point to the situation with regard to the British debt to America, and they draw a parallel, which seems to afford them great satisfaction, with the debt to Great Britain covered by the Cosgrave Financial Agreements.  Now, not much has been said about that in this House, and especially not much has been said on this side of the House about it; but I think it is, perhaps, desirable that a word should be said about it, because I see that it is a matter which has been rather actively revived in the recent past in the course of controversy in the country on the subject of what we ought to do about our financial relations with Great Britain.  I do not think that the parallel is one from which the Government can derive any comfort whatsoever.  I want to recommend to them a consideration, from the business point of view, of the advantages of the course which Great Britain adopted as compared with the course which we have adopted.  Great Britain had a perfectly plausible case&mdash; I shall not say a good case or an overwhelming case, but a plausible case&mdash; for repudiating her war debt to America.  Consider the case for a moment. In the first place, it was borrowed, not in the shape of money but in the shape of credits whereby purchases were made at high prices in America during the war.  In the second place, the obligation need never have been incurred at all but for the fact that Great Britain was making far bigger loans to her European Allies, and that America declined, until she actually came into the war herself and, I think, for some time even after that, to make such loans to any of the Allied Powers except Great Britain. Added to those circumstances was the case which the French have always exerted themselves to make, for binding up the question of war debts with the question of reparations.  Added to that was the fact that after the war <Col N="221" /> Allied nations, beginning with Russia, defaulted to Great Britain to a larger extent than the extent of Great Britain's debt to America, although it is worth remarking that Russia, alone of all the nations of the world, took the course of complete repudiation which has recommended itself to the Executive Council of the Irish Free State.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>Finally, there was this situation, that by universal consent of economists no nation has a business to be a creditor nation at all unless it will allow goods to be imported whereby debts owing to it can be paid; and America, as we all know, has pursued since the war a policy of sky-high tariffs which has made it an economic impossibility for her debtors in Europe to meet their obligations, however much they might wish to do so.  In view of all those things, the British would have had a very plausible case for repudiating their debt to America, and, of course, that course was urged by some sections in Great Britain.  They did not do it. Why?  I will not put it on the ground of a high conception of honour, but on the lowest of the various grounds which actually caused the line of conduct they did take.  The lowest, and, I would say, probably the most powerful motive was that the British, as a nation with long business experience, had realised that repudiation is bad business, and that whatever you try to do in the way of readjusting the financial relations existing between you and another country that are to your disadvantage and, perhaps, beyond your ability to cope with, you should not resort to a system of repudiation.  They have not done so to this day, and there is not the slightest doubt that it has paid them not to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Similarly, here now, there is not a man in the country that would not have supported the Government, and that would not now support them in trying to get the best financial relations with England that possibly could be got. We told the Government, and we were right, that the course they insisted on pursuing, blinded by party bitterness, of maintaining that Deputy Cosgrave <Col N="222" /> and his colleagues were a gang of traitors and the British a gang of swindlers, and that the agreements made between those traitors and those swindlers should simply be treated as null and void, could lead to no profitable results, and, God knows, we have been more than justified.  It is not too late for them to retrace their footsteps.  They can still approach the British in a different spirit.  They can approach them with a view to arbitration, if they like, or if they have more courage, they can approach them with a view to settling this matter by some businesslike offer without anybody having to place themselves on the stool of repentance.  If they make such a businesslike offer they can bring the thing to an end as a matter of good business.  If they want fair arbitration they know very well they can get it.  I myself can think readily of various individuals who would make chairmen of such an arbitration, whose impartiality and whose ability could not be doubted for a single moment.  One of the most distinguished of the English judges at the present time is Lord Russell of Killowen, a most patriotic Irishman, and the son of a most patriotic and distinguished Irishman, and yet a man in whose judicial impartiality the English, I am sure, would have perfect confidence.  He occurs to me as one. Other members of the Irish race throughout the Commonwealth might be considered also as possibilities, or French Canadians or Dutch South Africans.  Assuming that our own representatives were Irish citizens, and that the British representatives were British citizens, I can see no difficulty at all, if we approach this matter in a businesslike manner, about getting a chairman whose impartiality and ability would be above reproach.</P>
    <P>Alternatively, if the arbitration method was not the one to be followed, I maintain it is the duty of the Government to do what they can along the other line, to see whether the will for peace on the other side of the water is not such that they will be prepared to consider some very reasonable and satisfactory settlement of the financial differences between us. <Col N="223" /> I appeal to the Government to think very seriously before rejecting this plea.  Expenditure is going up and up.  The main industry of this country would go completely out of existence to-morrow, if it were not for subsidies from the Government in one form or another.  How long can we expect to go on artificially maintaining our main industry?  You can artificially maintain small industries, and growing industries, but, if the fundamental industry is in a totally unsound condition, and only kept alive by repeated stimulation by the Government; by doses of Government subsidies and bounties, what are the prospects of this country being able to continue meeting expenditure on this scale?  I confess that for my part I cannot take an optimistic view of the future, if we are going to proceed along these lines.  The Government may shut their eyes to the distresses of the farming community. These distresses, none the less, exist. No candid man going down the country could deny that they exist; and no candid man could deny that hope and enterprise are being strangled in the farmers.</P>
    <P>When it would be so easy, so sensible, so generally welcomed to make a step towards peace why not make that step?  We are all hopeful about the various infant industries that are being started.  Personally I would hate to see the economic fate of this country such that it would be only a sort of immense grazing ranch. I want something more than that for this country.  I want to see a love of beauty developed; a love of making beautiful things.  I want variety of occupations.  I want to see the creation of an industrial tradition and of industrial habits.  We have a name for being lazy and inefficient.  We are not lazy and not inefficient.  When we go abroad and work elsewhere we show that we are not lazy or inefficient. There is some justification for such reproaches if one looks within the shores of Ireland alone.  But that is because we are a people of quick intelligence and one of the main woes from which we suffer is boredom; lack <Col N="224" /> of interest, owing to the fact that we have not got enough creative and productive activities to be interested in. I am 100 per cent. with the Government in trying to bring such things in here, in trying to add variety to employment, and in trying to add to the skill and the enthusiasm of the workers.  But it cannot be done if as a first step you are going to ruin the fundamental industry.</P>
    <P>It is a most extraordinary fallacy to suppose that there is something incompatible between zeal for agriculture as the fundamental industry and zeal for the creation of other industries, subsidiary to agriculture or unconnected with agriculture.  The members on the opposite side are too fond of assuming that our minds are closed to ambitions that appeal to their enthusiasm.  Our minds are not closed to those ambitions, but we cannot help feeling that the minds of members on the opposite side are closed to such considerations as I have been alluding to, in connection with the fundamental industry of this country, and I beg the Government once again to take the only path that can lead to peace and to progress.</P>

      <P>This is a stupendous bill to present to the people of this small State.  In introducing the Vote the Minister attempted, as far as he could, to camouflage his extravagance and his inefficiency.  He has attempted, if I may so describe it, to be eloquently ambidextrous.  On the one hand we had his statement that we are an expanding community, with an expanding business, and, on the other hand, he alluded to the increasing relief that this Government had provided for labour, for agriculture, and for industry.  If we have such an expanding business in this expanding community, why should there be an increasing demand for the relief of unemployment?  One wonders how far this country can go on bearing this ever-increasing expenditure of this wilfully extravagant Ministry, a Ministry which is bleeding the heart's blood from the people of the State.  They have almost made it prospectively <Col N="225" /> impossible for any succeeding Government to arrange for a transfusion of new blood.  This is a bill for £30,000,000, if we include the £250,000 of the Agricultural Grant that the Ministry left out.  There is, in addition, nearly £6,000,000 for Central Fund Charges.  The complete bill is £36,000,000, an amount that no section ever expected would have to be introduced, because that is a sum that no section can bear.</P>
      <P>The Minister attempted to describe this State as being fairly prosperous. One would like to refer to the prosperity that there has been during the last 17 or 18 months, and to picture in particular the position of agriculture, the chief industry here.  We had it from a responsible Minister lately that he intended to bring in a measure for the limitation of the number of cattle.  The export of cattle is perhaps our chief industry, and in this country of expanding business we are about to resort to the experiment of cutting down the production of the principal part of that industry.  We have resorted to a number of experiments in the last 15 or 16 months, all of which have landed us in this position, that an Estimate of £21,000,000 in 1931-32 has grown to about £30,000,000 for 1934-35, or an increase of some £8,000,000 in two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I note that the Minister for Agriculture is absent to-day.  I wish that he were here instead of the Minister for Finance, because when one is discussing this Vote one must necessarily make allusions to the agricultural industry.  I am told the Minister is at the Royal Dublin Show inspecting cattle.  What he is inspecting cattle for I do not know.  He proposes shortly to diminish the number of cattle and yet he is out to-day viewing stock at the Dublin Show.  I suppose he is congratulating certain exhibitors that they have got the progenitors of good and useful stock for this country.  It is almost an insult to those exhibitors that the Minister should even have attempted to go anywhere in their vicinity to-day, judging by his expressions in the House within the last couple of months.  Even the exhibits might get excited at the Minister's <Col N="226" /> proximity.  Deputy Corry seems amused at that.  When the Deputy is amused he generally assents to what one is saying.  If he disagrees he is in a very aggressive mood.</P>

      <P>The Minister who has been for the last 18 months vivisecting the Irish farmer without an anaesthetic is at the Dublin Show to-day.  There is very little prospect for the poor, mutilated agriculturist, even if he survives a few more of the Minister's experiments.  In the <i>Irish Times</i> to-day there is a definition of &ldquo;Staggering Bob.&rdquo;  Within the last few weeks I made certain allusions to that term.  I do not know that many of the younger members of the House are familiar with what &ldquo;Staggering Bob&rdquo; really means.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a period in the last century when male calves were not very profitable and the farmers took the hide off the calf and then sold him for a bob and the expression became quite common, &ldquo;Staggering Bob.&rdquo;  The Minister for Agriculture, who, no doubt, is compelled to do it through the manipulations of the Minister for Finance and other members of the Government, is bringing us back to the same bad days.  It will not be any comfort to the farmers, even those whom Deputy Corry represents, to get back to the days of &ldquo;Staggering Bob.&rdquo; We would much prefer to get back to the days of 1931 when the farmer could raise his calves in comfort with the <Col N="227" /> definite certainty of getting £4 or £5 each for them at the end of four or five months.  All that is to be altered under the expanding prosperity of this Government.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance, in the course of his camouflaging statement, made some reference to the amount they were spending on oats and wheat. The amount spent on oats last year did not bring any grist to the farmers' mill. The Minister for Agriculture said oats were practically all used up.  It is not a source of comfort to the farmer who sold oats last November to know that oats are now used up when he got only 4/- a barrel for them.  That amount did not suffice to cover the cost of putting the oats into the land not to mind taking them out of it.  I should like the Minister for Finance to take a trip through the country and interview farmers in the southern, eastern and western counties.  Let him have a heart to heart talk with them just as he had a heart to heart talk with a few business men who, he told us, had found last year a year in which they collected their accounts easier than in any of the preceding years.  I do not know where the Minister discovered those shopkeepers, but, following the Minister's statement, I made it my business to interview 70 or 80 shopkeepers around my own district and I have not found one shopkeeper prepared to verify the Minister's statement.  In fact the almost universal reply of the shopkeepers I spoke to was that it was almost impossible to get money in now. One likes to accept a statement made by a Minister and I can only say that the shopkeepers from whom he got his information must have been definitely pulling his leg.  I cannot conceive of any shopkeeper making such a statement. There may, perhaps, have been some of the new-found manufacturers who are propped up by the Minister's tariffs and who are making money at the public expense, who would make a statement of that sort, but certainly no retail shopkeeper in the country would be responsible for such a ridiculous utterance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were questions asked in the <Col N="228" /> House at various times recently that illustrate the condition of agriculture. To-day a Deputy from Wexford asked what the Ministry propose to do with the second moiety&mdash;not of the annuities &mdash;of the stall-fed cattle in Wexford and other places.  Part of the first moiety is provided for by licence.  They can go into the despised British market in order to sell some of this stock.  They can sell 42 per cent. if they are lucky enough to get a licence.  The unfortunate farmers in Wexford, who have more of this type of stock than farmers in other parts of the country, will have the remaining 58 per cent. on their hands.  When the Deputy asked the Minister what they were to do with their stock and if he could offer any hope for them, there was no reply.  And this is the prosperous agricultural state of Ireland!  One does not know whether the present restrictions applying to stall-fed cattle are going to be continued after the end of March, during the summer, and applied to grass-fed beef.  If they do I can definitely assure the Minister that the livestock business for the farmers will be killed and the Minister's hope expressed some years ago that the live-stock industry was useless and should be substituted by a grain policy will largely have been brought into effect. If a similar restriction is continued during the summer it will amount to the practical cessation of any livestock business, other than the production of butter, in this State.</P>
    <P>The production of butter would even become impossible if we had not our livestock.  I mentioned the word &ldquo;butter.&rdquo;  When one is talking about agriculture, one cannot get away from the dairying end.  The livestock end has been injured, almost beyond repair.  The damage that has been done will take years to set right. Ministers have, however, told us that the bright spot in the farming industry is dairying.  I hope that Deputy Corry is listening to me now, because he issued a challenge a week or two ago to the Opposition to prove that the dairy farmers were not prosperous.  He made the case, as the Minister for Agriculture made the case before him, <Col N="229" /> that the Dairy Produce Act, brought in last year, saved the dairying industry; that it put the dairying industry in a position which it could not possibly have reached under the Cosgrave Administration.  I was one of the Deputies on this side who voted for the Dairy Produce Bill.  Deputy Corry said that I was compelled to vote for it.  I voted for that Bill, as I stated at the time, in the hope rather than in the expectation that it would do good.  When we were finishing the debate on that measure, I asked the Minister for Agriculture, across the floor of the House, if the Bill gave the farmers any power beyond the power they already had if they liked to avail of it.  He said &ldquo;no&rdquo;&mdash;that it gave them nothing beyond what they already had under legislation provided by the Cosgrave Government.  That measure did not, as Deputy Corry and others claimed, produce any decided improvement.  What did produce the extra price for milk were the subsequent manipulations of the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Agriculture.  They made other arrangements, when the Dairy Produce Act failed to have the effect desired, to maintain the price of milk at about 4d. per gallon, which is not at all a paying price.  They said they paid the creamery farmer 102/- per cwt. for his butter.  To provide a price of 102/- per cwt. they had to resort to a series of manipulations.  They had to levy under the Dairy Produce Act, on the farmer, 4d. per lb. for his butter.  That was, of course, passed on to the community. They had themselves to come to the rescue with a bonus out of the Central Fund of 30/- per cwt.  It was not always up to 30/-.  Sometimes it was 27/- and sometimes 28/-.  They had to charge the consumer 5d. per lb. more for his butter than he would have paid if they had not engaged in all these manipulations.  The sum total of the three expedients was that they made the price of butter 102/- per cwt. at the creamery, or roughly 4d. per gallon for milk.  The price of milk under the Cosgrave Government was always over 4d. per gallon.</P>

      <P>We could have done this for 20/- a cwt., if we have continued in power.  I shall even satisfy Deputy O'Brien before I am finished.  Deputies opposite say that they have maintained the price of milk to the farmer at 4d. per gallon.  Deputy Corry forgot the calf, when making his challenge, just as the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Industry and Commerce, forgot the calf in dealing with this matter at Newcastle West and elsewhere. I suppose the Minister for Finance also forgot that there was such a thing as a calf in the dairy farmer's business.  If they had secured 4d. a gallon for the milk and left the calf as it was, we might not have said anything. But, by their experiments and their manipulations, they reduced the value of the calf by, at least, £4.  Even Deputy Corry will not get up and deny that.  A difference of £4 in the price of a calf represents the equivalent of 2d. per gallon in the price of milk.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>When I am finished Deputy Corry can contradict my arguments. The dairy farmer is getting, roughly, the equivalent of 2d. per gallon for milk, and the Minister for Agriculture stated in this House a couple of years ago that no lesser price than 5½d. would cover the cost of production for the dairy farmer.  That is the position in which this Government of huge promises has placed the dairy farmer in the course of two years.  We all know the position in which they have placed the live-stock farmer.  If they have added any grist to the mill of the tillage farmer, I, for one, am not aware of it.  Now, everybody knows that if you interfere with the chief industry of the country you interfere with every subsidiary industry, and, above all, you interfere with the working people of the country.  Except for doles and assistance schemes and turf schemes and other such schemes which the Government has brought in to assist the labourers, they would be in the position, at the present moment, that no one would like to envisage. But how long can the Government go on supplying this assistance and those doles when we find the Minister for Finance to-day presenting us with a bill for £30,000,000 odd, and which will be increased by another £6,000,000 for Central Fund charges?  Even Labour Deputies know that this country cannot sustain a bill for £36,000,000 a year, and they must know that in another year the position of the labouring people in this country will be impossible. There is a limit to what the taxpayers can bear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance himself made a very eloquent statement in this House a few years ago in regard to <Col N="232" /> taxation generally.  He said the incidence of taxation is very rarely restricted to those upon whom it first falls, because it is passed down and down the social scale until eventually it reaches the people on the lowest rung of the ladder&mdash;the working people. The Minister was speaking the truth there.  He was putting into other words the old saying: &ldquo;You cannot tax the rich without robbing the poor.&rdquo;  This bill for £36,000,000, which the taxpaying people will have to face, will eventually be passed down and down the social scale until finally it will fall upon the shoulders of the workers and the agricultural labourers and the urban labourers.  This enormous taxation bill comes from a Ministry by whom £21,000,000 was regarded as monstrous taxation, scarcely describable in words.  One wonders what additions there may be to this huge bill as it stands now, before the end of the current year.  If we take the example of last year, we find that the original Estimate was added to by millions for Supplementary Estimates, and that before we are finished with this year's Estimate we may find it will not be £30,000,000 that will be the figure reached but £35,000,000, or even £40,000,000, if we include Central Fund charges.  There is no guarantee that the total may not reach from £35,000,000 to £40,000,000, but the fact is that the people in the country will not be able to bear it.  The people have endured more from this Government than they ever endured before, but even the worm will turn, and if the people are given a chance they will do&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If the people are given a chance Deputy O Briain may find that his Government have done nothing for his future political security judging by the taxation they are inflicting as shown here to-day.  We all hope that this Government, having failed in efficiency and in economy, and in everything else, will take the course that all Governments of its kind should take, namely, appeal to the people at an early date to pronounce judgment on their policy.</P>

      <P>Deputy Bennett, in a very long and able speech, has expounded very clearly his views as to the feelings of the country.  He has brought into his survey the lowest stratum of the labouring people so that they may be able to appreciate the condition of things in the country.  He told us that the agricultural industry, which is the main industry in the country, has definitely faded out owing to the action of the present Ministry. He went into details about the dairy section and the cattle raising section and the tillage section of that industry, and even rambled on the shopkeeping section of the community.  If what he says is perfectly true, I wonder where the Minister for Finance is going to get this money from that he talks about.  If everybody is bankrupt already it will be perfectly safe to vote for this now, as we will have the definite assurance that the Minister cannot get any money at all.</P>
      <P>I come from the same constituency as Deputy Bennett.  I have the fortune or misfortune of not being a farmer.  If the Deputy has met some shopkeepers who have been pulling his leg, I also have got other sources of information in that direction.  I take a serious interest in my constituency, and I try to find out from the people how things are going on.  I have long since abandoned getting anything from the farmer except the same old dismal jeremiads that we have got from Deputy Bennett. I have met shopkeepers in Limerick who told me that the times were pretty good.  I challenge anybody who knows Limerick to deny what I am now saying.  I have been told by shopkeepers&mdash;the owners of drapery houses and provision merchants, and various other types of people&mdash;that last Christmas was the best Christmas they had in the last ten years in ready cash transactions.  While Limerick is a city, it is really only an overgrown provincial town, depending on the hinterland which, according to Deputy Bennett, has been so bady hit in recent years, and it is these people who come into Limerick City as the customers of the shopkeepers.  I can produce evidence to bear out what I say, and I can produce the men who gave these reports.</P>

      <P>The Deputy mentioned the fact that the Minister for Agriculture instead of being here is wasting his time at Ballsbridge.  There are other people apparently wasting their time at Ballsbridge or else they must be attending a show there, as they did for many years.  Are we to assume that all the people attending that show came up from the country to waste their time at Ballsbridge?  If so, they must be bigger fools than we gave them credit for.  Surely the people at Ballsbridge are not holding this show for the fun of it.  I think it will be found that there are a great lot of people as well as the Minister wasting their time at Ballsbridge.  There was a question put this afternoon by a Deputy from Wexford.  Deputy Belton, I think, put the matter very fully in a statement to the Minister for Defence and the Minister, acting for the Minister for Agriculture, promised that fuller information would be given when the matter was inquired into.  Deputy Bennett made the Minister's absence a cause of complaint in this matter. I think the show at Ballsbridge to-day is evidence that agriculture is not completely washed out.  We heard to-day in answer to a question put by Deputy Burke, of Clare, in connection with the building of cottages that the board of health were abandoning a scheme there, because the Minister would not sanction the payment of from £80 to £130 per acre for the acquisition of land required for the building of labourers' cottages.  I wonder were there very valuable mineral resources under that land, considering the price that was asked for it.  In the County Limerick we had no difficulty in securing cottage sites for the building of 1,000 cottages.  The fact that the owners are looking for prices ranging from £80 to £130 an acre for their land does not square very well with the black picture that is being painted here from the benches opposite.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am supporting the Vote and I am going to let the Minister find the money.  On behalf of the people I represent. I say that we are getting a fair and square deal.  At the present <Col N="235" /> time our people cannot leave the country as they used to do in years gone by.  We have a larger population to maintain now.  I am glad to say that our people are going to be maintained, and on a higher standard, particularly the poorer classes, than they used to be some years ago.</P>
    <P>Provision is made in the Vote for an additional sum for old age pensions. A considerable share of that is going to go to the agricultural community. Provision is also made for the support of able-bodied unemployed whose treatment up to recently was a positive scandal, especially in the country districts. Poor decrepit old men were put in the position of having to carry on a struggle with the boards of health to get a few shillings outdoor relief. The removal of that kind of thing is a matter for congratulation to all of us.  These old people are our own and are entitled to kind and generous treatment.</P>
    <P>The programme outlined by the Minister, in my opinion, amply justifies the increased expenditure proposed. I believe that wise spending is the highest form of economy.  It is the only means whereby you can have any prosperity in the country.  The Government have embarked on a new policy and we are going to back it with confidence and hope.  The House, I suggest, should have no hesitation in giving that policy the necessary financial backing.  I believe it is a policy that is going to come up trumps and that we shall evidence its wisdom in a short time.  On the other side we have nothing but dismal Jeremiahs.</P>

      <P>However, I have got to say them.  I am very glad to see that there is somebody else as well as the Minister for Finance optimistic. Deputy Keyes appears to be quite optimistic.  But only 12 months ago the Minister for Finance was applauded by his Party when he stated in this House that property and industry could not bear one penny piece more in taxation.  But to-day the Minister is asking for £6,000,000 more than he asked for last year, and he is applauded by at least Deputy Concannon. When we on this side made an appeal to the Minister to increase the agricultural grant last year that was his reply; that property and industry could not bear one penny piece more in taxation.  Therefore, on that basis there is only one thing that will justify an increase in taxation this year and that is increased prosperity.  We have two Ministers in the House who believe that this country is enjoying increased prosperity: the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Industry and Commerce. A few weeks ago the Minister for Finance stated here that everything was prosperous: that there was absolutely no need for a reduction in wages all over the country, and that whatever reductions had taken place were due to a ramp on the part of the Opposition.</P>

      <P>Deputy Victory from Longford got quite indignant yesterday because some of us on this side moved amendments the effect of which, if passed, would be to exempt dispensary doctors and veterinary surgeons from the cuts proposed in their <Col N="237" /> salaries.  We pointed out that their emoluments, so far as they were derived from private practice, had really disappeared. They have gone, in the case of the veterinary surgeons, because of the conditions of the livestock market. Under present conditions there is no use in bringing a vet to see cattle. Deputy Victory said that everyone must bear their share of the economic war, but the Minister for Finance does not seem to think there is an economic war on at all.  Notwithstanding the fact that our trade has diminished so much as to be almost practically gone the Minister comes in to-day&mdash;I will not say that he is really as good an optimist as he is a bluffer&mdash;to bluff us with a proposal for £6,000,000 more than he asked for last year.  It would hardly be fair to the Minister for Finance to refer him to the speeches he made when in opposition.  I think if he were to be reminded of some of the things he said then he would be amazed himself. There are a few things, however, that I desire to refer to, to remind the Minister of the situation that the Opposition at the time thought existed in this country.  I am referring to the year 1929-30.  Deputy de Valera, the Leader of the Opposition at that time, said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Before we consider raising our social services to the level of those in Great Britain, let us compare our taxable capacity with that of Great Britain.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I wonder would the Minister for Finance be agreeable, on the basis then laid down by Deputy de Valera, to compare his suggested taxation this year with the taxation of Great Britain.  I am sure if that were done the Minister for Finance would be really ashamed of his figures.  Deputy de Valera, as he then was, pointed out that if we were to take our taxable capacity at 1.5 per cent.  &ldquo;it would mean taxation in the Twenty-Six Counties of about £12,000,000.&rdquo;  He was then comparing our taxable capacity with that of Great Britain, and on that basis he estimated in 1929-30 that the limit of our taxation should be £12,000,000.  He went on to say:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="238" />&ldquo;What have we here?  We have over £21,000,000 for the Supply Services. We cannot afford that.  I think the Labour Deputies will admit that there is a limit to which we can go even in the social services, and if we go beyond that limit we are going to do damage to the community as a whole.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was when we had a £21,000,000 Budget for the Supply Services as against £30,000,000 to-day, and that is only four years ago.  Further, he said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Whilst I say that, no reduction in existing social services should be brought about except after the most careful examination, and reduction rather in the administration of the services than in the benefits to individuals.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy de Valera also said at that time and in the same debate:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We were laughed at last year when we said there was the possibility of reducing the total taxation by £3,000,000.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In other words, to reduce it from £22,000,000 as it then was.  He was then in opposition, and he is now President of the State.  Continuing, he said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Minister for Finance has reduced it now, and in the way we want it; while they laughed at us last year, he is going to reduce it this year.  He might say in reply that some of the items would naturally reduce because they lapsed during the period.  That is quite true, but looking ahead and bringing in a type of legislation which would diminish the cost of the two Houses of the Oireachtas, which would get rid of the burthen of the Govern-General and by legislation or administrative action which would diminish our expenditure further on the Army and the Civic Guards, I believe that the figure we mentioned in last year's Estimate would be within reason.  I believe there is room still on nonsocial services for a reduction of another £1,000,000.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The expenditure on both the Army and Civic Guards is being increased this year by President de Valera's Government. <Col N="239" /> In face of all that I think the Minister ought really to feel ashamed of the figures that he brought before the House to-day.  When we saw the figures published in this morning's newspapers well, I will not say that there was very much of an element of surprise in them, because really this Government has all the essentials of prodigality as far as spending is concerned. It is a matter of spend, spend, spend with it.  How the country is going to stand the spending that is going on by this Government does not appear to appeal to Fianna Fáil at all.</P>
    <P>Now let us see exactly whether this country is able to bear a greater burden this year than last year.  I have been listening to Deputy Keyes speaking about the agricultural industry. I certainly was surprised to hear his statement, and I shall be surprised if there are to be found in any part of the country shopkeepers who can do a better trade now than they did before. Apart from anything that may be said with regard to politics, what is or is not good politics, we ought to consider what is the earning capacity of the people at the present time.  Surely people who were getting, say, £15 or £16 for a cow last year cannot have the same purchasing power this year when they are only getting £9 or £10. Nobody can deny that.  Further, people who got 10/-, 12/- and 15/- per barrel for their oats last year cannot have the same purchasing power when they are only getting 7/- or 8/- per barrel for their oats this year.  Therefore, somebody must be wrong.  All these palliatives of trying to enrich agriculture by bounties and subsidies are bound eventually to end in failure. They cannot go on.  As pointed out by Deputy MacDermot, you may for a time carry on by subsidising your second or third industries but you cannot carry on your main industry in that way.  At the present time you have cattle, sheep, horses, pigs, poultry, eggs, butter, oats, wheat and beet, subsidised by the Government.  You cannot carry on an agricultural industry in an agricultural country in that way.</P>
    <P>The main industry, which in this <Col N="240" /> country is agriculture, is bound to determine the purchasing power of the people eventually.  The more you try to keep the main industry going with bounties and subsidies, particularly if these bounties and subsidies are being supplied through borrowing&mdash;and the Minister for Finance told us last year in his Budget statement he was about to supply them through borrowing&mdash; the more you place burdens on that industry.  The Minister for Finance stated here last year that he was going to borrow on the assets created by the retention of the annuities and apply that money to bounties and subsidies. But if you borrow for the purpose of keeping going the main industry of the country, that borrowing will eventually mean a burden on the main industry. It is bound to.  You cannot subsidise it in that way except for a very limited period.  If we can afford £6,000,000 in taxation more than last year, our trade ought to show it in some shape or form. The Minister for Finance said that every penny he was budgeting for was going to be spent in this country or that it was being kept in the country. That is not so.  As Deputy MacDermot pointed out, the bounties and subsidies are not being kept in the country or anything like it.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance very carefully avoided, as Deputy MacDermot pointed out, the question of the amount of money he has kept out of the country.  According to the figures which were published in the end of 1933 and taking the figures for 1931 as against those for 1933, our exports declined by £17,000,000 and our imports declined by £14,000,000.  If that £14,000,000 meant that in this country were being manufactured the requirements of the people to that extent, then there would not probably be so much cause for alarm, but that is not so.  It definitely is not so, because the Minister for Industry and Commerce will admit that we are still not in a position to provide all the necessaries which are purchased by the people or anything like it.  We had a decrease of £14,000,000 in imports and a decrease of £17,000,000 in exports.  Our adverse balance was increased by £2,750,000.  Before that happened the <Col N="241" /> Minister for Finance told us that we were not able to pay one penny more taxation than was imposed at that time.  He comes in to-day, in the situation which now exists, and says that we are well able to bear a further £6,000,000.  There are other figures in regard to the agricultural surplus in this country which I should like to quote.  In 1931 we exported produce to the value of £27,800,000.  In 1933 we exported £13,100,000 worth.  That was a decrease of £14,000,000.  The Minister for Finance did not tell us anything about that.  Surely, no matter what Deputy Keyes, the Minister for Industry and Commerce or the Minister for Finance may say, that must reflect itself in the condition of this country. We got into the country £14,600,000 less than we did in 1931.  Calculating the number of cattle that we exported that year, as against the number exported last year, and getting an average price for each, we find that the average price in 1931 was £16 11s. 0d.  For last year we get an average price of £10 6s. 0d. for a lesser number of cattle.  That must again be reflected in the condition of the country.</P>
    <P>Let us again turn to the only figures that I have available to see if our production is increasing.  Some people, of course, think that cattle are anti-national in this country, that they should not be here at all except to a very limited extent, but rearing pigs is a national industry.  Let us see how far we have progressed in the pig industry. Last year there were bought in the Free State 903,305 pigs for bacon curing and for export.  In 1931, before the Fianna Fáil Government came into power&mdash;I am not saying that you are responsible for the decline, mind you; I am just giving you the figures&mdash;there were purchased in this country 1,104,999 pigs.  There was a falling off of 201,634 pigs last year as against 1931. Yet this is the year that we are able to bear £6,000,000 more in taxation. Somebody may say that the reason these pigs were not bought is that England did not want them as England is now developing her own pig industry and her own bacon industry, but the extraordinary thing about it is that while that decline is shown in our pig <Col N="242" /> industry, there was an increase shown in Northern Ireland.  In 1933 there were bought in Northern Ireland 433,396 pigs as against 416,121 pigs in 1931.  There was, therefore, an increase of 17,300 in the number of pigs bought.</P>

We have further figures here which are, I am afraid, not reassuring either.  I am very glad that the Minister for Industry and Commerce is here, just to hear one thing I have to say.  He said here the other night that there were at least 30 new factories within a two-mile redius of this House, each employing an average of 200 hands.  I hope there are.  We are all very anxious to believe there are, but I certainly have not much faith in the unemployment figures, and I am glad the Minister for Industry and Commerce is coming to my way of thinking about them, as he is.  He definitely stated here a week or two ago that registration really represented nothing more than expectation of work.  That is quite right, but there are figures which I am afraid are a very sure tell-tale of the position, and a very sure tell-tale of the distress which exists; those are the home assistance figures.  Home assistance is certainly something that is not administered on a political basis or anything of that kind.</P>

      <P>Well, I hope so in any case.  I have never known it to be administered on a political basis.  In the case of Dublin, in a certain week in February there were 11,085 more people on the list in 1933 than there were in 1931, after all those factories which the Minister has established in Dublin.  We have been very anxious to see those factories, but we always did come to the conclusion that if they were in the country at all they were <Col N="243" /> in Dublin.  It is a very strange and sad commentary on the Minister's own figures that there were 11,085 more people on the list which my friend, Deputy Kelly, deals with in connection with the administration of home assistance&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Does not the Minister admit that it is a very strange commentary on his practice that the home assistance bill is going up week by week and month by month?  It is an extraordinary thing, is it not?  This, mind you, is the time that the Minister for Finance chooses to put a further burden of £6,000,000 on the people of this country.  I am sorry the Minister was not here when I quoted what the President&mdash;when he was Deputy de Valera&mdash;stated from these benches in 1929-30, that this country was definitely not able to bear a higher rate of taxation than £12,000,000.  He did not qualify it, as the Minister for Finance tried to qualify his Budget to-night, by <Col N="244" /> suggesting that it was not a question of spending; it was how you spent that mattered.  There is one thing, in any case, which this Vote will do, and it is probably well that it was done at last; that is, it will expose the sham.  It is all a sham.  As I said, the people were not surprised this morning when they saw the bill they were going to be asked to pay.  As far as I know the people in business, particularly people in the farming business, they are in the grip of despair at the present time. It is not, perhaps, the very best thing to be pessimistic.  I do not want to be a pessimist.  I should like to be an optimist.  I should like to be even as big an optimist as the Minister for Finance or Deputy Keyes, but it is very hard to be that way.  We have the Minister for Industry and Commerce telling us that there is evidence of prosperity everywhere in this country, and the Minister for Local Government comes in the following night, and says that salaries must be reduced because the country is not able to bear them. I heard the Minister for Industry and Commerce alleging at one time that there was no agreement on these benches.  In wonder when they will get agreement over there.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce says he knows the farming community is very badly off, and has testified to that by getting bounties for the various activities of the farmers; yet the Minister for Industry and Commerce says that everything is glorious, and that there is every evidence of prosperity.  The sooner the Government&mdash;no matter what Government is in this country&mdash;get it into their heads that the main industry must be put in such a position that it will be able to show a profit, the sooner they will get into a position to solve the difficulties which confront them.  We have beet, wheat, industrial alcohol, tobacco, oats&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Those are the matters mentioned by the Minister for Finance to-night.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce thinks that this is a great joke.  It is not such a joke to the country.  It is not such a joke to <Col N="245" /> people who attend the fair of Roscommon and nine-tenths of whom have to take home their cattle.  It is no joke when the rate collector of the county council calls on them the following day.  When four or five of them meet him and say: &ldquo;We are not going to pay our rates because we have not got the money to pay them&rdquo; the Minister for Industry and Commerce asserts that that is a campaign against the payment of rates.  &ldquo;That is a No Rates Campaign&rdquo; the President would say.  It is not a joke at all.  If the Government think that by subsidising beet, by subsidising wheat, by subsidising oats, or by subsidising industrial alcohol, they are going to make the main industry prosperous, well they have not started to think yet.  They ought to think, and they ought to grow up, or try to grow up. That is too childish.  If the main industry of the country is going to be subsidised who is going to subsidise it?  It must be put into a position of prosperity.  If must be able to show a profit itself.  That is number one.  Until the Government gets that into its head it cannot get anywhere.</P>

Any activity that is connected with the land is a losing proposition to-day.  The Minister knows that perfectly well.  Does the Minister propose to pay a subsidy to those out of his new factories?  If he does, his factories will not live.  You must provide your factories with a purchasing public.</P>

      <P>That is number one. The main industry of the country is going to provide that purchasing public, or it is not going to be provided. That is a thing which the Fianna Fáil Government has not got as far as yet.  They were never able to consider what would be the reactions of their own policy.  The Minister for Agriculture, and the President particularly, said that &ldquo;The British market is gone, thank God.&rdquo; He says it is a blessing in disguise. I think he can at least claim to be the first leader of any Parliament in the world who has thanked God that the export trade of his country has gone.  He can have all the honour and credit for it.  Nobody will try to take them from him.  He never realised that when he was saying that he was killing his own policy of more tillage.  There was the reaction of his policy.  If we are not going to have livestock in this country we are not going to have tillage.  We had tillage last year at a bad price, but it is nothing to the bad price which I am afraid there will be next year, if the Minister for Industry and Commerce, in conjunction with the Minister for Agriculture, starts slaughtering cattle.  Possibly of course, the Minister for Industry and Commerce may find an outlet for those slaughtered cattle in this way&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>There was an amendment moved yesterday to another Bill, which provides certain specific rules for merchandise coming in here.  If the Minister could get boats to call here and give them ballast of the slaughtered animals he would have found a good way to get rid of them.  But who is going to pay for them?  As was said here recently, so far as the British market and our anxiety to hold that market were concerned, we were endeavouring to get the British to pay for the stock but if the Minister for Agriculture starts to slaughter the stock and if they have to be paid for, it will not be the British who will pay for them.  Who will pay for them? <Col N="247" /> There is nobody to pay for them but the agricultural community all the time. The whole thing is a vicious circle.  If the agricultural community is all that even Fianna Fáil says it is&mdash;at least, at election times, I know what they say in my own county; we increase, as a matter of fact, from 70 to 85 per cent. of the burden bearers of the country at election times&mdash;but whether we are 70 per cent. or 85 per cent., or even a lesser percentage, we have to carry the burden all the time and if the Minister for Industry and Commerce thinks he can afford to subsidise every department of that industry, he is making the biggest mistake he ever made in his life and he has a whole lot to learn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture says he wants more tillage for more livestock. He said that in this House not six months ago while the Minister for Industry and Commerce says that he will probably be driven to slaughtering them.  It is very hard to find common sense between them all and it is certainly very hard to see how this country is going to get out of the situation into which Fianna Fáil has driven it.  There is one other thing here to which I should like to refer. There was a speech delivered in this House on the Vote on Account in 1929, when the demand was not £29,000,000 but £21,000,000.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce, then Deputy Lemass, found very grave and very serious fault with the members of the Government Party who remained silent while that huge sum of money was being voted, while that huge sum of money was being placed in the hands of people who did not know what to do with it and while the people were being bled white.  He implored of the back benchers of Cumann na nGaedheal to justify their existence as Deputies in this House and he informed them that their constituents down the country would not be satisfied with their silence while this huge sum of money was being voted.  Another gentleman made a similar speech&mdash; Deputy Hugo Flinn&mdash;and while I think it would be an affliction which the <Col N="248" /> House would scarcely endure if I were to quote his speech, there is one bit in it that it would be a pity not to refer to because I would like to refer it directly to the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  Deputy Hugo Flinn, on that occasion, said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The sooner they get on with the job of bringing the expenditure of this country within the limits of its capacity to bear, the better for the country and the better for the cleanness of their reputation when they have gone.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Is that not very appealing?  Would the Minister like to hear that to-day? Even though it does come from Deputy Flinn, I very strongly recommend it to the Front Bench of Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance, in winding up his little speech and putting this proposal before the House said: &ldquo;We are a country with an expanding business; give us the wherewithal to carry it on.&rdquo;  The Minister sat down then.  He had thrown out such a mouthful that it was nearly time for him to sit down.  He has gone now, I suppose, to have some little refreshment and he has left the Minister for Industry and Commerce here to deputise for him.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce is a man who is very keen on the development of industry.  In fact, he has arrogated to himself the powers of a pocket edition of Mussolini in controlling industry and imposing tariffs at will.  I have no fault to find with either his policy in that respect or his powers as a pocket edition of Mussolini, but I have fault to find with his total disregard for the very industries that he is protecting, in view of the fact that he forgets the most important end of industrial development&mdash;the purchasing power of the public.  Any fool at all can make an article but the real skill is in selling an article, and no skill will sell an article if there is not the purchaser to buy it; and the Minister for Industry and Commerce, while endeavouring to develop industry, is conspiring, at the same time, to kill the purchasing power of the community there to buy it.  He is very fond of quoting for us statistics and signs of our prosperity. <Col N="249" /> I hope he will speak on this and that he will indicate to the House one sign of our prosperity at the present time.</P>

      <P>Why, then, did the Minister suggest that we would have to slaughter cattle and, presumably, turn them into artificial manure?  Are they all going to be knackered in Keeffe's?  Apparently, the Minister has changed his mind since the last wire he got from Ballsbridge.  I should like to refer the Minister to the indications in respect of which it is suggested that the welkin would ring in this House, if they would only read in the way the Minister would like them to read, or, at least&mdash;we would all like them to read in that direction&mdash;in the way that would suit his book, but, unfortunately, no matter how the figures are manipulated now, they cannot be made to read that way.  We will take one unfortunate incident that occurred this year, and the Minister waxed eloquent on this.  He is not usually dishonest and he does not usually misrepresent things but, when he is in a corner, he will get out of it by any means.  He was in a corner here one day and I remember how dexterously he worked himself out, and when he thought himself safely out, he cleared out of the House.</P>

      <P>He believes in running away so that he may live to fight another day.  However, we floated the Fourth National Loan.  That is a great barometer as to the financial condition of the country.  We floated that loan on terms very favourable, everything considered. I was going to say considering something, but it would give the Minister a key, and as he is taking a note now I will not give him that key. <Col N="250" /> I know what is in the Minister's mind &mdash;that the Fourth National Loan was floated at 3½ per cent.  It was not subscribed, unfortunately.  The previous National Loan was issued at 4½ per cent., and it was subscribed.  I am sure the Minister will say: &ldquo;If we only offered it at 4½ per cent. we would have got ten times the money we asked for.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>That is what the Minister said the other day.  However, whatever the Minister is going to say, I will have a reply to him another time, but I thought I was killing two birds with one stone.  Perhaps the Minister changed his mind since he got the wire from Ballsbridge.  The Third National Loan in, I think, 1927, was issued at 4½ per cent., at the time when the Bank of England rate was 4½ per cent., and it was subscribed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>We will come to that in a minute and we will find whether the industry is there and where it is. The late loan of £6,000,000 was floated at 3½ per cent. at a time when the bank rate in London was 2 per cent., that is to say, it was nearly 100 per cent. more than the bank rate in London and it was not subscribed.  When the Cosgrave Government issued a loan five or six years ago they issued it at practically the bank rate in London and the loan was fully subscribed. Is that any reflection or does it reflect in any way on the comparative economic strength of this country at those two periods?  Does it reflect the confidence that the people with money had in the respective Governments?  If there is no variation in the confidence then there must obviously be less money about and less money for the <Col N="251" /> Government to carry on all this great work that has been elaborated by the Minister for Finance.  There is either no money about or else the people with a free will to exercise that free will in the investment of their own money had not sufficient confidence to give it to the Government recently even though they were offered much better encouragement than what was offered at the time of the Third National Loan and what was offered in the case of the other National Loans.  The other National Loans were issued and offered to the public at practically the ruling bank rate of interest, but the late loan was offered at 80 per cent or 90 per cent. above the bank rate and it failed. In that condition of the country the Minister and the Government come along and increase taxation.  They bring in increased Estimates.  The Minister for Finance, in dealing with another matter here, quoted a reputable journal.  He gave us a history of that.  I accept the prestige of the journal, but it was very unfair to this House that he quoted the extracts that suited him and left out the extracts that did not suit him.  What that very article that the Minister quoted disclosed was that the bank clearances in the last year were down as compared with the previous year.  Does the Minister deny that?  I will give him the highest financial authority on it. Even though we had an adverse trade balance in other years the invisible income balanced that.  But for the first time since this State was set up, the flow of money into this country is less than the outflow.  I am sure the Minister will not deny that?</P>

I quoted, not only from the journal but <Col N="252" /> from the particular paragraph from which the Minister quoted, that is, the bank supplement of the <i>Economist</i> of 14th October last.  With all respect to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, that is a little better authority than the Minister for Finance.  On finance I want to say that we paid out more than we got in.  That article referred to the strong financial position of our banks.  The Minister will easily admit that no matter how strong the financial position of a country is, and no matter how strong its banking is, once there is more going out than there is coming in, the prosperity of the country will come to an end.  Notwithstanding all the industrial activity we hear so much about, there are less notes in circulation now than a year ago.  The Minister will not deny that?</P>

Our imports also declined but our exports declined far more than our imports.  Will the Minister deny that?  I will give him some figures and these are from an authority equally as good as the <i>Economist.</i>  They are from the <i>Statist,</i> dated 17th February:&mdash;&ldquo;Heavy declines are recorded in both the import and export branches for the Free State for the year 1933.  The imports have fallen to £35,000,000 from £42,000,000 in 1932, or a decline of 15.9 per cent.  The exports have declined to £19,000,000 from £26,000,000, or a decline of 27.1 per cent.&rdquo;  Now, where is the industrial activity?</P>

      <P>Another important indication which I do not want to labour is that money has frozen up, as is shown by our bank returns.  It is going into fixed securities and into deposits.  It is going out of the country.  There is less money deposited to the credit of our banks in the Free State now than a year ago.  Our banks are carrying more external deposits than we had a year ago, while the discounts and advances to their customers have declined by some millions.  In those discounts and advances, which are small proportionately to the banks' strength, there is a very big chunk of frozen assets or frozen debts&mdash;you can have it nearly any way you like&mdash;which accumulated in years gone by.  They accumulated at a time when there was comparative prosperity here, and when cattle, comparable with the famous, Clonmel cattle which were sold at 50/- apiece, would fetch £25 or £30 apiece. At that time those frozen debts were incurred.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Nothing will thaw them now, not even the sunny smile of the Minister for Industry and Commerce or his colleague the Minister for Finance. It is doubtful whether these are assets, and these paper assets are counted in the banks' returns of discounts and advances to customers.  We have the Government's own experience in endeavouring to float a loan on good terms.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce said that they were unfavourable terms, that the terms should have been better, and then they would have got the loan.  I want to make the point that the terms offered were better comparatively than the terms of any preceding loans and by comparatively I mean by comparing the general bank rate of interest ruling now and the rate of interest when the other loans were floated.  The Minister made a strong point in that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is an extraordinary thing that a representative of labour here should congratulate the Minister on the provision he is making for public assistance and so on.  While we have people idle, of course, they must be fed.  Bouquets, however, should not be thrown at the Government merely because they are taxing one section of the people and handing the money to another section.  The only way they can earn bouquets is by putting the people to work.  Unemployment is going up here.  The published figures indicate that.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce asked where any staple industry was paying now. Unemployment figures are going down in Germany, in the United States and in Great Britain.  President de Valera recently sent a message to the President of the United States congratulating him on the anniversary of his taking up office.  Our President has had two anniversaries since he took up office. but he has not been able to show what President Roosevelt is able to show&mdash;<Col N="255" /> the number of unemployed that he has put to work; the general arrest of the rot in the economic life of the United States, and the hope that he has given to the people owing to the measures he took to stop the downward march.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us all that they were doing for agriculture and industry. We are told of their policy of finding new markets.  Last year we bought nearly £11,000,000 worth of goods in markets outside Great Britain. A good deal of these goods were bought in Germany.  Our distinguished Ministers for Finance and Industry and Commerce should apply themselves to the practical problems of international trade.  Germany buys very little from us.  When we get a chance we have to sell to Great Britain at a very low price, and even the pounds we get from Great Britain are only worth about 12/6&mdash;gold parity.  The Minister proposes to open up international trade with Germany, which is on gold, and pay 20/- in the £1.</P>

      <P>We imported, as I say, nearly £11,000,000 worth of goods last year.  Do we send goods to those countries to pay for goods?  Of course, we do not.  We had to send money or bills.  We were told yesterday that the Minister for Industry and Commerce must get powers to see that the goods do not touch English soil.  That is in effect what he was after.  I challenge the Minister to say that a penny piece of that £11,000,000 was paid direct to those foreign countries.  It had all to go through British acceptance houses.  Without the British imprimatur on the bills of exchange we would not get one pound's worth into this country or into any foreign country.  The Minister will not shake his head at that. It is just the visible things that can be seen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="256" /> A ship can be seen loading or unloading in England and then striking out for the Free State, but the collection of bills and the sale of bills in the London Bill Market is not seen here, and there is more commission paid on these bills than would be paid for warehousing goods coming here via England.  We are told about all the money and all the wages that we are going to have out of this sugar beet scheme.  I saw here where £550,000 was paid for unemployment relief last year.  I suppose that about £400,000 of that would be for wages. The Minister might as well say that the £400,000 for relief schemes has been paid out for wages.  He could not stand over his proposal, when he introduced the Sugar Beet Bill, as being an economic proposition in itself.  The 80,000 tons of sugar that the four new factories will produce, when going, will cost this country annually a loss of about £1,000,000.  I would not say that that money would be badly spent if there was anything else paying; but when everything else is losing what are we going to pull up on?  Take the grocery store man.  He is handling butter; he is handling bacon; he is handling sugar.  On those things there is no profit.  There is generally a loss, but he has to carry these items.  Other items will give him a profit that, spread over the lot, will give him a net profit on the whole transaction.  Going over the whole gamut of agricultural economy in this country no items can be picked out on which anybody can say that there is a profit to the nation.  Are we to pull up for what we are losing on home-grown sugar beet with potatoes? The Minister, if he ever grew potatoes, would know that industrial alcohol that will provide a market at 35/- a ton for potatoes will not pull up for any loss on any other item.  We have a loss of 7/- a barrel on wheat, for which there is a bounty, and even without that, the basic price of wheat here is higher than that at which we can import it.  Looking at all the items, there is nothing on which we are making a profit sufficient to pull up for the losses we are admittedly sustaining on the others.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="257" /> Then we come to industrial products &mdash;the Minister's special preserve.  We will be told here in this House that these factories are paying their way. They are paying their way, but inside a high tariff wall.  If that tariff wall were pulled down, down would go the industries; but that tariff wall is kept up, and the industries inside that wall, that have to be subsidised in order to be kept going, have to provide the money to buy the produce of these tariffed industries.  It would be only a waste of time to labour all these points, because the Government themselves know it just as well as we do, or just as well as any people outside or inside this House know it.  I could quote speeches of all the present Ministers when they were in Opposition, shedding crocodile tears about the burden that was upon agriculture and industry, and saying that that burden was too great for industry to bear.  Yet, the burden that is put on agriculture and industry this year is more than 60 per cent. above what it was in the years when the Votes were criticised.</P>
    <P>There is just one point more to which I should like to refer.  We were told about £100,000 for draining bogs. It is a pity that some of those who are devising these schemes were not put to drain the bogs.  There is also £150,000 for free milk and £700,000 for an increase in old age pensions, and so on; but we are saving the £5,000,000 that heretofore went to England. Surely there is no medium-sized baby in this country who believes that tripe now.  Has not Mr. Thomas given the answer to that?  He has got all the money he went out to get.  Whom has he got it from?  He has got it from this country.  Not only are we paying them to England, but we are paying the cost of collection as well, which is over and above what had to be paid before the present Government came into office. I am not attributing to the present Government all the depression in agriculture or the increased depression since Fianna Fáil took office, because there has been increased world depression since Fianna Fáil took office &mdash;not, of course, because Fianna Fáil took office&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but there has been superimposed on that the artificial depression here of the economic war. Now, in that state of affairs we are asked to bear increased taxation and less prices, even without the economic war, than obtained two years ago. The Minister, probably, is aware that prices are a bit better in England than they were two years ago, and that they are considerably better in the United States of America.  The secret of President's Roosevelt's success was that he set out on the deliberate policy of raising prices.  He did that for two reasons.  One reason was that the farmers of the States were suffering from what many farmers here have been and are suffering from, frozen debts, because they incurred those debts at a time when, let us say, a bullock was worth £30, and the price of a bullock is now only £10.  In order to liquidate a debt incurred for one bullock three years ago, he would have to provide three bullocks now.  President Roosevelt set out on that policy of raising prices in order to help the farmer to liquidate those debts. Nothing analogous to that has been done here, nor has it been attempted or even thought of.  Nothing has been thought of except to shovel out doles and tax people to provide the doles. We have a Labour Deputy congratulating our Government on having no more imagination nor ingenuity than taxing Peter to pay Paul for doing nothing&mdash; subsidising new-fangled notions of industry and agriculture.  At a time when the agricultural and industrial economy, which we had been practising and which we were proficient in, was not paying, we set about introducing new-fangled notions here, and we start trying to learn and develop and practise for a profit something that we know practically nothing about.  The best way that our Government can congratulate the American Government is, not by sending high-sounding cablegrams, but, by copying the methods that have been successful there, and that have been successful in Great Britain, in Germany, in France and in Italy.  When I suggest Germany and <Col N="259" /> Italy, I am not suggesting that the Minister should change his shirt.</P>

      <P>We are getting a transfer of £200,000 to the bounties. Personally, I wish the Minister would transfer the whole of the bounties in that direction, and bring them down to the source of production.  Lighten the cost at the source of production, because when the initial cost is light, industry has a chance of expanding. If you add too great a load to an industry at its source you cripple that industry.  Instead of throwing little presents here and there to help the export of a few cattle, sheep, pigs, butter or other things, if the money were given to lighten the cost of production at the source, it would be far more beneficial ultimately for industry generally.</P>

      <P>I am feeling somewhat depressed and despondent to-night, because it has become quite clear, after spending many days at it, that I have not succeeded in teaching Deputies opposite the elements of political economy.  On the occasion of a number of debates of this kind I have tried, at very great pains, to teach Deputy Belton, Deputy Brennan, Deputy MacDermot and other members of the Party opposite how to read the economic statistics made available by my Department.  Despite that they proceed to misunderstand them, and to draw from them conclusions which they are not capable of supporting. I am going to try again.  I admit that it will probably be wasted labour but, in a good cause, one can afford to spend a little time.  I may succeed on this occasion in getting some Deputies opposite to grasp some elementary truths about the economic situation in this country.  At the beginning let me put myself right on one point.  It appears to be the practice of Deputies opposite, and of leader writers in the newspapers that support their policy, to assume that everybody should represent conditions in this country to be deplorable and the outlook for the <Col N="260" /> future to be as blue as Deputy O'Neill's shirt.  If anybody has the foolhardiness to attempt to suggest that things are not quite as bad as Deputies opposite represent them, he is immediately open to precisely the type of misrepresentation that we had to-day from the Deputies, and in this morning's leading article in the <i>Irish Independent.</i> If I venture to offer the opinion that although conditions may not be as good as we would like to see them, nevertheless they are not as bad as Deputies opposite represent, and are improving, the leader writer of the <i>Irish Independent,</i> like Deputy Brennan and Deputy Belton, will represent me as saying that the country is &ldquo;wallowing in prosperity.&rdquo;  That was the phrase the <i>Irish Independent</i> used this morning.  Deputy Brennan represented me as saying that the country was so prosperous that people did not know what to do with their money.</P>

What I am suggesting to Deputies opposite is that conditions are not as bad as they represent them to be, and that they are improving.  The main point I want Deputies to grasp is that conditions are improving.</P>

      <P>I am going to do so, not by quoting some obscure article in <i>The Economist</i> or <i>The Statist</i>, but by giving such an array of statistics from the official publications of this State that even the Deputy will not have the hardihood to contradict my conclusions. Deputies assumed that the increase in the Estimate for Supply Services must necessarily involve an increase in taxation. I will deal with that later.  On that assumption, however, they proceeded to ask: &ldquo;Can the country bear <Col N="261" /> increased taxation?&rdquo;  They endeavoured to prove that it could not even bear the existing taxation, because it was stated that the purchasing power of the people was diminishing.  That is the first thing we have got to get clear. Is the purchasing power of the country diminishing or not?  How are we to find that out.  Obviously the most satisfactory way of finding out whether that assertion is true or not is to ascertain if the people are in fact purchasing less.</P>

      <P>Money in circulation. In 1933 the people purchased more than they purchased in 1932.  That fact is ascertainable from various sources, but particularly from the Trade and Shipping Statistics that Deputy Belton so frequently misunderstands.  The latest of these returns is for January, 1934, and was published only last week.  It contains the latest information relating to economic activities that are covered by our export and import trades.  How are we to ascertain whether the purchasing power of the people is diminishing or not?  Let us look at the figures for imports, leaving out of account those classes of goods which are being produced here, and in respect of which we have not got corresponding production figures.  Taking into account only those classes of goods, the imports of which fluctuate with consumption, we will find out whether the purchasing power of the country is diminishing or not.  Tea, sugar and tobacco are three fairly safe guides.</P>

      <P>Most of the other building materials we are making for ourselves for the first time, and we expect to be making all classes in due course.  The imports of machinery have increased and that is an indication of industrial activity.  Now, there is a particular item and I think Deputy Belton will hardly be able to make any misrepresentation about it.  The imports of motor cars have gone up considerably. I suppose the Dublin workingman in hard times stops eating meat and buys a motor-car instead. The imports of wine have gone up. The sales of boots, shoes and cloth of all kinds have also increased considerably. I know that Deputy Belton, Deputy Dillon or Deputy MacDermot will stand up soon and say that I have been representing the country as wallowing in prosperity.  The fact is we have not even fairly begun our task of reconstruction&mdash;when one takes regard of all the field that has to be covered.  We have made considerable progress.  Things are getting better, but we have a long way to go before we will be satisfied.  It would appear from the activities of the Cumann na nGaedheal Government that very little satisfied them.  Like other Deputies over there, Deputy Belton always paid undue attention to the figures of our external trade.  He and Deputy Brennan have quoted figures to show that the value of our external trade has diminished by so many millions since 1931.  It has.  There are, however, two facts in connection with that, that I want to impress on Deputy Belton. The first is that our external trade has decreased less proportionately than that of the majority of countries.  It has decreased by a lesser percentage than the total of world trade has diminished.  Secondly, the decrease in <Col N="264" /> our external trade is a natural result of economic development at home.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Professor Johnston of Trinity College, an eminent economist, and one who can claim to speak with some authority on economic questions, in a recent lecture suggested to the Government that they should prohibit exports.  He said it was unnecessary for this country to maintain exports so long as it had available abroad to purchase the goods required nearly £200,000,000 and over a number of years if we prohibited exports that capital would be repatriated for us here in a very effective manner.  That is an impractical suggestion from the political point of view, but it draws attention to one fact.  We are bringing back into this country for utilisation here capital formerly invested abroad. Men are realising their holdings in British Government securities or other foreign securities and are bringing back the money to set up factories in this country.  They do not bring back that money in the form of bills of exchange, but in the form of goods imported into the country and the more of it that comes back the greater will be the divergence between the total value of our imports and the total value of our exports and the gap that exists, in so far as it is not covered by invisible items, represents capital repatriated for us in this country.</P>

      <P>Even if we are to take the stand of Deputies opposite and regard the figures for our external trade as the sole test of national prosperity, I again say that things are improving.  I have here the latest available statistics, those for January, 1934, and I observe that as compared with the same month in the previous year there was an increase in the export of cattle, an increase in the export of sheep and an increase in the export of horses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of pigs exported decreased, but that is something to be glad about because it is offset by a substantial increase in the exports of bacon and hams.  There was an increased export of condensed milk and butter, an increased export of biscuits, porter, beer and spirits.  Now, as regards the industrial products, there was an increased export in macadam and gravel, linen piece goods, woollen and worsted tissues and jute goods.  There are minor items that I do not wish to mention.  I think I have covered all the main classes of goods in the exportation of which there has been an increase.  Our exports definitely have shown an increase.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, 1933 and 1934.  I submit that proves that conditions are improving.  But I am not prepared to take that as a standard.  We do not export goods for any other reason except to pay for the goods we import. We are deliberately diminishing the total volume of imports in consequence of our efforts to increase home production. As the President of the Cork Chamber of Commerce said last week, if we were to discover in this country a coal mine capable of yielding 3,000,000 tons a year we would stop importing that quantity of coal, and because we would stop importing that quantity of coal, we could <Col N="266" /> stop exporting goods to the same value that are now going out to pay for the coal that we import.  The result would be that our external trade would have diminished by £6,000,000, but this country would have been £6,000,000 richer in consequence of the exchange.</P>

But, again, I want to say that we have a long way to go before I, at any rate, will be satisfied that we can afford to rest on our oars and &ldquo;take things easy,&rdquo; as our predecessors did. We are getting going.  The position of the farmer has been frequently referred to.  We had from Deputy Brennan the extraordinary assertion that a sure index to the failure of the Government's economic policy and the rotten economic condition of this State was that we had to support agriculture by protection and subsidies.  I interjected a question, which produced a rebuke from the Chair.  I was not entitled to put the question then, but I am entitled to put the question now: What country in the world is not protecting agriculture by protection and subsidies at the present time?  I want some Deputy opposite to tell me that.</P>

It is a problem which arises not only for us but for the Danes, the Dutch and the Canadians, all of whom are trying to solve the problem at the present time and are being less successful in their efforts than we have proved to be.

      <P>Even Deputy McGilligan who tried to base his case upon the narrow figure relating to the yield from the sale of unemployment insurance stamps admitted there were 14,000 more people in insurable employment <Col N="271" /> in 1933 than in 1931.  The exact figure was nearer to 16,000, and that was an estimate for whole-time employment for 52 weeks of the year.  In modern industrial conditions there are many workers who do not get whole-time employment, and the real number of additional hands taken into employment in that year was substantially higher than 16,000.  If one included the number of insurance books turned over, or exchanged, it will be found that the number was 45,000 higher in 1933 than in 1931.  I assert, therefore, that there was a much larger number of people in insurable employment in 1933 than at any time previous since the Free State was established.</P>
      <P>The population of this country has, of course, increased in the last couple of years for the first time in a century, and that has aggravated the unemployment problem that we have to deal with.  Deputies, of course, can make whatever case they think suits their policy upon this basis.  The fact is that if emigration took place in 1933 and five years previous to that on the same basis that it actually did occur in the year 1926, there would be 100,000 fewer people in this country.  Emigration has stopped.  The position has been reversed.  Immigrants have exceeded emigrants and our population has increased consequently fairly rapidly. This has produced an unemployment problem which it is not going to be easy to solve, because the great majority of those who might have gone, and are now remaining at home, are living in districts in which it is very hard to absorb them into industrial pursuits.  Most Deputies are aware of that.  A great number of these emigrants came from the western seaboard and in those districts it is not easy to find industries capable of absorbing them.</P>

In 1932, the bank clearances were abnormally inflated by the transactions in connection with the conversion of the British loan, and consequently, 1932 is an abnormal year.  But taking 1933 as against 1932, a substantial increase is shown, and that increase is emphasised by a similar increase in the value of the currency notes in circulation in mid-December.</P>

      <P>I also said, in regard to unemployment, that we could not possibly devise any plan that would be so automatic in its working that we could provide work for every man immediately he wanted it in the locality in which he resided.  Consequently, it was necessary to put behind the industrial plan a scheme of public works, and behind the scheme of public works a third line of defence against destitution in the form of the Unemployment Assistance Act, which Deputies opposite appear to be very strongly opposed to.  I might, in that connection, draw their attention to the statement occasionally made concerning that scheme by the Leader of the Party opposite.  If I insult anybody by calling him the Leader, I apologise, but he calls himself the Leader.  Deputy Belton tried to make some point about the recent National Loan.  Later on, in his remarks, he did give some evidence of having read some elementary text books on economics, because he said that in time of business activity people do not lock up their money in gilt-edged securities. They do not.  Nobody invests in gilt-edged securities bearing fixed interest if he can find a more profitable use for his money elsewhere.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dillon might serve a useful purpose by offering himself as raw material for such a factory. It is recognised by all economists that in time of business stagnation and depression the price of gilt-edged securities rises.  People in these circumstances try to get their money into a safe investment and out of industry. In times of business activity and development prices of gilt-edged securities fall because people are taking their money out of them, and are putting them into industrial investments. What is happening here is that new opportunities for investment in industry are offering to the owners of capital every day, and I am glad to say that they are showing no hesitation in availing of them.</P>
      <P>Let us consider these accounts for a while.  Deputies either do not understand these figures or they are deliberately trying to create some false impressions on the strength of them. These figures show an increase in the requirements for the Supply Services of £1,800,000.  But there is included in that figure the Estimate for Local Loans which shows an increase of over £2,000,000.</P>

      <P>The fact I want Deputies to appreciate is that the increase in the total of all the Estimates is more than off-set by the increase in the Local Loans Vote alone.  If we took out of these accounts, as I think was the practice one time, the local loans figure, the figure for the Supply Services for this year would show a reduction on last year.  In any event, in so far as these local loans are concerned, they are repayable by the local authorities at interest, so that Deputies need not worry on that account.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is completely ignoring one single item which accounts, and more than accounts, for the total difference between the Estimate for last year and the Estimate for this year.  In conclusion, I will stress the point that I started with: that things in this country are not as satisfactory as we would like to see them but they are improving, and they are improving despite the efforts of the Deputies opposite to prevent an improvement.  I wonder what idea had Deputy Brennan in his mind when he said that the price of oats and barley last year was bad, and that this year it was likely to be worse.  I suppose he hopes that, as a result of making that statement, he will be able to prevent people entering into forms of production that are nationally useful.  The price of oats and barley will not be worse.  The Government is determined to see that they will not be worse, and that whatever steps are necessary to ensure that the full amount of these commodities that we require will be produced and sold by the farmers at a price that will be remunerative to the farmers, will be taken just as we have taken steps against the opposition of <Col N="276" /> the Party opposite to achieve the same result in relation to butter and to other products.  It is not always easy, in relation to a complicated industry like agriculture, to find a simple method of achieving one's ends, but we are covering the field bit by bit and devising a machine which is going to secure to the farmers what we promised to secure for them: a position in the home market from which they cannot be driven and a market for the increased production of a large variety of products at guaranteed prices, prices which we would undertake would be in excess of the cost of production.</P>

      <P>I hope that when the Deputy speaks he will, at least, try to be intelligible.  The point that I want to stress, however, is that in so far as the agricultural field has been covered and a plan devised to deal with the particular problems offered in that field, that plan is working out successfully.  In due course we will cover the whole field and carry out the Fianna Fáil plan in relation to agriculture 100 per cent. just as we are carrying it out 100 per cent. in relation to industry.  Deputies opposite have failed to produce any plan.  In their criticism of this Vote on Account they have been remarkably deficient in the suggestions they had to make concerning the manner in which the ends they profess to desire could be achieved.  When Deputy Dillon&mdash;or preferably some member of the Party capable of dealing with its policy&mdash; comes to speak I want him to point out the particular items in the Vote on Account that he wants deleted for the benefit of the income taxpayers.</P>

      <P>What I have to say on this Vote on Account will perhaps differ a good deal from what has been said on this side of the House earlier. In view of the boasts made by the Fianna Fáil Party in the past, my criticism will be directed largely to the reductions in certain Estimates. Before dealing with that I cannot allow the statement of the Minister for Industry and Commerce to pass without some comment: the statement that their efforts to support agriculture have had desirable results.  I hope every farmer in the Fianna Fáil Party is satisfied with the results that have been achieved.  I happen to have been at the fair in Caherciveen on the 5th of January last.  I remember a man buying two nice Kerry cattle there. He went home very pleased with himself. He could afford to keep them until they grew antlers.  They were two nice cattle.  Somebody asked him what he paid for them&mdash;I knew&mdash;and he replied: &ldquo;50/- for the pair.&rdquo;  I will leave that particular incident at that.  I was not going to go into the general question at all except for the Minister's statement that their efforts to support agriculture have had desirable results.  I wonder if that was a desirable result for the person who sold this nice pair of Kerry cattle to that particular buyer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My comments will be rather directed to the reductions, strange as it may appear, because the reductions are in Departments in regard to which every promise that Fianna Fáil ever made, was in the opposite direction.  During the year, of course, they have divided the Department of Lands and <Col N="278" /> Fisheries.  I believe the Fisheries section is now to be under the Department of Agriculture and Forestry is taken from the Department of Agriculture and is to be placed with Gaeltacht Services.  The taking of Forestry into the Department of Gaeltacht Services may be quite right but certainly, in my opinion, it is quite wrong to take Fisheries away from the Gaeltacht Services.  Our idea in 1927 when Lands and Fisheries were brought into the same Department as Gaeltacht Services, was that every service connected with the Gaeltacht should be brought under one head so that the whole problem might be dealt with as one problem, looking at it from all of these angles.  If not a better arrangement, it was the next best thing to having a Commissioner entirely in charge of services in the Gaeltacht.  I thought myself then that that arrangement was the ideal arrangement, when you had a Minister who at the same time had control over the division of land in the Gaeltacht and fishery control, which enabled him to provide for the supply of boats for the half-farmer, half-fisherman of the Gaeltacht.  You had all these activities under the one head.  We must realise the fact that in the Gaeltacht the greater portion of the economy is half-fisherman, half-farmer.  No efforts of ours, probably, will ever make such a man a whole-time farmer or a whole-time fisherman.  Our best efforts should, therefore, be directed towards making him a better farmer in so far as he is farming and a better fisherman in so far as he is fishing.</P>
    <P>I regret to see that the estimate in the Book of Estimates, apart from the Vote on Account, shows a very serious reduction in two big items of expenditure in the Gaeltacht, kelp and carrageen.  Deputies on the opposite benches, while they made every political use of these items in the past, used to sneer at them, but these things were, in fact, of real value in the Fíor-Ghaeltacht. The Dáil deliberately voted a considerable amount of money towards the development of the kelp and carrageen industry in the Gaeltacht. We were getting very good results because a number of persons <Col N="279" /> were being employed in both of these industries during a long period of the summer-time&mdash;from the time the May weed came in as far as kelp was concerned, and during the whole summer as far as carrageen was concerned.</P>
    <P>This industry was of real benefit to what I might call the Fíor-Ghaeltacht and to the persons who most needed it in the Gaeltacht, because unfortunately our Fíor-Ghaeltacht is confined almost entirely to persons who are most in need.  Every halfpenny is cut off in these Estimates in the expenditure for kelp, and carrageen is taken from the persons in the Fíor-Ghaeltacht who need it most.  Any expenditure in Gaeltacht services, all your money expended on so much per person in each house who speaks Irish, will not have anything like the same result that you could get from these particular items of expenditure.  I believe moneys are to be expended in houses in the Gaeltacht where Irish is spoken and that so much will be given for the children in the house who speak Irish by way of bounty for them.  That is quite a good thing, but it also applies to the Breac-Ghaeltacht.  It is all very good, but of no real benefit to the persons who want assistance most and to the persons who deserve it most because of their own hard work.  Every penny, every pound of it is hard-earned money and that is its virtue.  There is no pauperisation, and there never was, about it.  The people who got it never felt that a halfpenny of the money they got in that way was in the nature of home assistance or anything of that kind.  They felt that they were earning the money when they went out into the sea to cut the weed and so on.  That is the scandal I see about any reduction in this direction.</P>
    <P>I will not talk about what has happened the Gaeltacht housing schemes since the Government came into office.  Everybody in the House knows very well what has happened especially Deputies representing the Gaeltacht.  The Gaeltacht housing stood for a great deal, mind you, even greater than any industrial development there was.  What we were doing <Col N="280" /> on behalf of the man living in a cabin to provide him with a decent house for his family, to provide him with a chance of development in the way of poultry or pig-rearing, to provide him with a room in which he might have a loom to carry on industry in the Gaeltacht, represented some progress. These are the things that make me sick when I come in to discuss a Vote of this kind.  These are the things about which Deputies on the opposite benches, when they were on these benches, used to castigate us.  I always felt sick when I was not able to do more.  They always did make me feel sick when I could not do more but they make me far more sick now when I see a Government that were supposed to be the champions of the Gaeltacht coming along now to provide far less than we provided for the Gaeltacht.  I do not know how they will stand over their promises, their promises were so widespread in every direction.  Mind you, they were cute in that way.  They made such widespread promises that even the most industrious person, by necessity, would have to forget about 98 per cent. of them.  They made promises in so many directions that their promises on behalf of the Gaeltacht are forgotten. The persons on the opposite benches who used to criticise my Estimate here every time it came up are very silent now when a Vote is being brought in which is far less than the Vote we brought in for expenditure in the Gaeltacht.  I wonder to God they are not ashamed of themselves.</P>

We have the same manipulation of figures&mdash;wrong figures; figures that they know are wrong&mdash;walloped away with the same old gusto from the Opposition.  Deputy Bennett here to-night started off first of all with the cattle; then he went on to the calves. He said we had forgotten all about the calves.  I endeavoured to correct him at the time, but he would not give way.  He said that he was replying to a challenge I gave.  The challenge was given in this House at least six times within the last seven months; the challenge was given on two occasions by me, in connection with the figures for a 40 acre farmer.  I proved on the figures I gave that the 40 acre farmer was at least £40 better off to-day under the Fianna Fáil Government than he would have been if Cumann na nGaedheal continued in office.  I have challenged contradiction on that and nobody has contradicted it because he could not do so.</P>

He said he lost £4 apiece on his calves.  The average price of calves in 1931 was £2 17s. 3d.  How Deputy Bennett could manage to lose £4 on a £2 17s. 3d. calf I cannot imagine.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the kind of stuff we always get from them.  He even <Col N="282" /> tried to make us believe that the milk farmer of the County Limerick would be as well off under the benevolent rule of Cumann na nGaedheal, despite the fact that Cumann na nGaedheal last year endeavoured to compel that farmer to sell his milk at 1½d a gallon.  They got up here and opposed our Bill for the stabilisation of the price of butter, and walked brazenly into the lobby to compel the farmer to sell his milk for 1½d. a gallon.  I wonder how many cows would we have in County Limerick supplying milk to Deputy Bennett's co-operative creameries had Cumann na nGaedheal succeeded that night in defeating the Bill for the stabilisation of butter prices, and in compelling the County Limerick farmer to sell his milk for 1½d. a gallon.  That would have been the result of the defeat. Deputy Bennett, to give him his due, would not agree with Cumann na nGaedheal that night.  Deputy Bennett became a convert for the night, because he dare not go back to his County Limerick farmers after voting against it.  He was led along by the nose here after Fianna Fáil to vote for the Bill, after all the advice he got from Deputy Cosgrave and the rest of them.  The late Farmers' Party came along also, and trotted into the lobby after us to vote for it.  They were also converts for the night to the policy of Fianna Fáil.  Then we heard their wailings about the cattle.  I wonder when will Deputies opposite realise that as far as cattle are concerned, in this or in any other country, their day is gone&mdash;in this or in any other European country, anyway.</P>

      <P>Last year the Danes imported into Germany 250,000 head of cattle.  This year the total number of cattle allowed to be imported into Germany from Denmark is 25,000. They can take the other 200,000 head and supply the wailers of Cumann na nGaedheal if they want more bullocks. As a matter of fact, during the last 12 months they had to slaughter 100,000 head of them.  It is an extraordinary condition of affairs certainly. <Col N="283" /> but they had not any economic war with Germany that I am aware of. Those are rather peculiar facts, but they stick out.  We have the same thing happening in practically every other European country.  England has at last taken the lesson that we preached from those benches opposite, and that we are now carrying out. England is learning the very same lesson now.  I remember when we endeavoured to get the late Government to give some inducement to the Irish farmer to produce wheat, the reply was that the climate would not allow you to grow wheat in this country; you could not grow it; it should not be grown; we can get it over from Canada or the Argentine for so much per ton; therefore, we should bring it across; the wheat-growing farmer of this country should be left to pay the rate demanded on the high valuation and find it where he could.  That day has gone.  The Irish farmer to-day knows when he is ploughing his field and putting in his wheat that he is going to get a remunerative price for his crop.  On the day he sets it he knows what he is going to get for it.  In 1918 and on to 1926 I grew wheat every year.  In 1926 I sold wheat in Cork at £6 a ton to the miller.  I stopped then.  I saw that the Cumann na nGaedheal Government wanted bullocks, not wheat.  Out of eight acres of wheat this year I got £105.  Then they tell us that the farming community are finished.  The farmer who followed the advice of the Fianna Fáil Government, and took advantage of every assistance that was given to him by Fianna Fáil, is better off this year than he was any year Cumann na nGaedheal was in office&mdash; at least from 1928 on.  He is better off. I grew something less than three-quarters of an acre of tobacco this year and got £180 for it.  How many bullocks would Deputy Finlay keep for that?</P>

      <P>Oh, shut up!  Do not always be grumbling.  We had an amount of complaint here in connection with the Estimates this year. What does the Estimate provide for? We had Ministers on these benches a few years ago stating that it was not their business to provide employment for the people and that men might have to die of starvation in this country and that it was not the business of the Government to see that they did not.  We are going to see that nobody dies of starvation in this country and we are providing for that in this Estimate.  I would tell those who are looking for relief in rates that owing to the provision made here for unemployment relief, we were able to reduce our estimate for rates in the South Cork area by 1/- in the £.  That is 1/- in the £ off the backs of the moaning ratepayers about whom we hear so much from Deputies opposite. The same thing applies to everything else, and I cannot see what the moaning and groaning is about.  The farmers of this country have one great thing to be thankful for.  It is that Fianna Fáil came into office at the particular period at which they did come in; that Fianna Fáil came into office before this quota system was started by Britain.  Deputy Lynch, a few minutes ago, wanted to know the figures for 1931 and 1933 and not the figures for 1931-32 and 1932-33, but any Deputy in this House who compares the figures for 1929 with the figures for 1931&mdash;and those were the <Col N="285" /> two years in which the farmers enjoyed a benevolent prosperity under Cumann na nGaedheal&mdash;will find that, in 1931, we exported more agricultural produce to Britain than in 1929 and got £13,000,000 less from Britain for it, and in order to hold that most useful market we paid John Bull £5,000,000.  Those are the facts and those are the facts that Deputies opposite ought to consider.  I did not hear any Deputy opposite saying that the price of cattle had improved in Britain since 1931 or that the price of any kind of agricultural produce had increased in Britain since 1931.</P>

The only view they ever held was:  &ldquo;You cannot get any market for any produce you produce <Col N="286" /> here; you cannot get any protection whatever.  So long as we can get anything cheaper in any country in the world, it is going to come in and you are going to be knocked out.&rdquo;  The Irish farmer has a protected market and he is as well entitled to protection as any industrialist.  If I had my way, instead of giving a bounty on wheat, I would fix the price of wheat at 30/- a barrel and compel the millers to pay that.</P>

      <P>Yes; we had the same wail about butter.  Deputy Bennett told us that the consumer had to pay 5d. a lb. more for butter.  What if he had?  Is the farmer entitled to his cost of production?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCurran" hpid="Mr. Curran Mr. Curran">

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputies opposite had their way, he would not get half what he is getting for butter now.  The price of butter, Free State or Danish, on the English market for the last 12 months has been round about 70/- a cwt., and that is without any tariff. That is the price that the Irish farmer would get for his butter were Cumann na nGaedheal sitting here.  If they were sitting here, he would get 70/- a cwt. instead of 136/-.  Those are facts that Deputies opposite like to close their eyes to.  They cannot have it both ways.  They cannot have the consumer, as they call him, buying farm produce at less than the cost of production and at the same time have protection given to industries here. The farmer is just as much entitled to protection as the industrialist and so far as we are concerned, he has got to get it.  I do not wish to delay the House too long.  Deputy Belton, apparently, is becoming a little converted, if I might put it that way.  He was not so sure as he was a few months ago, nor is he so noisy.  The trouble that we are faced with at present is that we have a Party over there who are so mixed up that none of them is responsible for the sins of the Party that was there before them. <Col N="287" /> They will accept no responsibility. Deputy Belton says: &ldquo;I am not responsible for the sins of Cumann na nGaedheal; I only joined them last month.&rdquo;  Deputy Dillon comes along and says: &ldquo;I am not responsible for the sins of Cumann na nGaedheal; I was elected as a Centre Party man and I only joined them a few months ago.&rdquo;  It is the same with the rest of them and we cannot get any Deputy to stand up there and say that they are accepting responsibility for the hardships that Cumann na nGaedheal inflicted on the country during the ten years they were in office.</P>

We are providing employment for our people in this country.  Our policy is going ahead as fast as we can force it ahead, and thanks to John Bull it is going ahead faster than we expected it.

      <P>I regret I have to answer these interruptions.  We cannot test the feelings of the people every week according to the anticipations of the Deputies opposite, but they have got the result.  As far as this Estimate is concerned I have to say this, that if Deputies opposite can pick out any portion of it to which they object, let them pick it out and let us hear about it.  I have singled out one of the largest items in the Estimate and I asked them if they objected to that, but they are prepared to spend that much extra now.  They are prepared to do what the Cumann na nGaedheal Government would not do.  Having converted them to the extent of agreeing to provide something to help the unemployed, I think I may say that we have gone a long way towards converting them and I am sure that in four or five years' time they will have gone the rest of the way towards their conversion.  I would say from what I see of him that <Col N="290" /> Deputy Belton is the most intelligent one of them over there.  Bad as the best of them.  I think from the appearance of Deputy Belton that he has been converted a long part of the road and I am sure we will have the rest of them later on.  I am very pleased to support the Estimate here. If Deputies opposite would say what portion of the Estimates they object to, we might be able to go part of the way to meet them.</P>

      <P>I love listening to Deputy Corry.  I hope he will take it as no disrespect to him to say that I regard him as the Fianna Fáil cat. He is always getting out of the bag and some of his colleagues are struggling to get him back again into the bag.  Last night I saw Deputy O'Dowd getting up and saying that a statement made by Deputy Corry was a most monstrous and scurrilous one. That was what the Deputy said of the statement made by Deputy Corry.  An effort was made to put that cat back into the bag.  It was not put into the bag without a great deal of struggling, mewing and scratching and I am sure there will be a lot more scratching when Deputy O'Dowd comes back and finds that Deputy Corry has said that so far as Fianna Fáil is concerned the cattle industry is done for.  I wonder what Deputy Victory will say to that when he goes back to Longford and tells the farmers of that part of the country that the cattle industry is done for.</P>

Deputy Corry is a muscular man.  But will he deliver that message?  He is a man who can run fast, but it would be well for him to have that gift when he has made that communication to the small farmers of Connaught.  It is interesting to know now that the Fianna Fáil Party has definitely decided that the cattle industry of this country is to be wiped out.  That is now on record and <Col N="291" /> every honest Fianna Fáil Deputy should go down to his constituency this week-end and tell them that the Government has decided that the cattle industry is to be wiped out. Even Deputy Gibbons may have some difficulty in persuading the farmers of Kilkenny to swallow that.</P>

      <P>I expected a cordial reaction from the Deputy.  I want to say a word with reference to the mention which Deputy Corry made to a speech which he alleged Deputy McGilligan, who was then Minister for Industry and Commerce, made in this House.  He implied that Deputy McGilligan stated that it was not a part of the duty of the Government to provide work and that if men could not get work they could starve as far as the Government were concerned.  The statement, of course, is patently false. He never made any such allegation. He said, in the course of his speech, that it was not part of the duty of the Government to provide work for everybody. Somebody interjected: &ldquo;Then you would let them starve.&rdquo;  I think Deputy McGilligan replied:  &ldquo;If you cannot provide work, they must starve. Some people might say that but the Deputy and I are agreed that that is a doctrine to which we could not subscribe.&rdquo; That is what Deputy McGilligan said and the endeavour has been made time and time again to place a different construction on his words.  It is nearly time that that cheap fraudulent libel should be dropped because nobody believes it and it only reflects discredit on the Deputies who try to revive it.</P>

Deputy Corry and the Minister for Industry and Commerce wound up with a flourish:  &ldquo;Indicate to us,&rdquo; they say, &ldquo;something in those Estimates which you desire to have reduced.&rdquo;  There is one particularly striking item in No. <Col N="292" /> 18.  I remember the edification with which I used to read the speeches of Deputy MacEntee, as he then was. When the annual Estimate for the secret service came up Deputy MacEntee, as he then was, used to say: &ldquo;£10,000 for spying on our fellow countrymen; Oh, noisome bribe; oh, horrible thought.&rdquo;  That was a hardy annual.  He used to get up and wring tears out of his handkerchief at the horrible demoralisation to which Cumann na nGaedheal had brought this country when they spent £10,000 per year spying on their fellow countrymen. The last year Cumann na nGaedheal was in office, hey actually spent £2,700 of the annual appropriation of £10,000 on the secret service. This year Fianna Fáil proposes to appropriate two and a half times as much money for the secret service as Cumann na nGaedheal ever did.  What do they want it for?  Is it for spying on their fellow countrymen?  Is it for discovering plots amongst Waterford farmers to withhold rates?</P>

      <P>After all, when somebody says to another, &ldquo;You planted arms here,&rdquo; if that allegation were false, it is sedition.  Somebody was charged with having stated that, and a competent court of jurisdiction in this country said it was no sedition to have said so.  I wonder is there a part of that £25,000 going to soothe the ruffled feelings of the individual to whom that remark was addressed. £25,000 for Fianna Fáil secret service! Whom are they going to spy upon? Whom do they want to spy upon?  We all know they have got their spies. We all know they have their spies in the ranks of our organisation.  They are welcome to them.  If the poor spies can turn an honest penny spying in our offices they are heartily welcome. <Col N="293" /> They will have a soft job, except in one particular&mdash;that their ingenuity will be tested compiling information in order to ensure their retention in the service of the Minister for Justice and the Minister for Finance.  Because a spy will not get his money if he does not carry stories, and if there are no stories to be carried, the spy will lose his job.  So, when there are no stories to carry, when everything is open and above board, the spy invents stories.  And when you have an hysterical Government in office, supported by an hysterical Party, the paid spy can get his invented stories believed, and you have prosecutions and proclamations and Coercion Bills and all the rest of the paraphernalia of the poor old bewildered British Government in this country.  You have President de Valera and the present Minister for Finance following solemnly in the weary footsteps of the Marquis of Salisbury and &ldquo;Buckshot&rdquo; Forster, dragged by the nose by the lineal descendants of the same people who dragged by Salisbury and &ldquo;Buckshot&rdquo; Forster into the morass of Irish coercion and paid spies.  They are paying their spies with our money.  They are paying their spices with the proceeds of the Local Services (Temporary Economies) Bill which is passing through the House at present.  That is one item which I suggest to Deputy Corry is capable of reduction and I have no doubt he agrees with me.</P>
      <P>Now, I will tell him another item. There is an item here of £2,250,000 for bounties.  That item can be got rid of in the morning.  If President de Valera wants to settle the economic war he can settle it as well as, or better, than any other man who can sit in that seat.  He can settle it without compromising the honour of this country by a hair's breadth.  He can settle it without yielding a single item in the rights of this country.  He can settle it with honour and he can recover the despised British market for our products, free of penal duties.  That will provide for another £2,250,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>He can settle it in many ways.  He can settle it by the exercise of common sense.  He can settle it if he sits down for one hour and exercises a quality that a lot of us thought he had at one time and that a lot of us are beginning to suspect now that he has not, after listening to him for two and a half hours last Thursday and Friday.  If he has not common sense, I have no doubt the Minister for Finance will intervene to provide that material.  Far be it from me to say in his courteous presence that he is bereft of common sense.  He has so many other attractive qualities that we will assume that that is constructively present without going any further.</P>
      <P>I want to say a special word about another reduction that Deputy Corry could make in the Estimates.  Did he look at No. 57 where there is an increase of £104,000 in the Estimate for Industry and Commerce?  Why? Because the country is crawling with inspectors.  In the words of the Minister and his colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, they are creating hordes of them every month and the Deputy knows it.  There were never more inspectors, there were never more junior civil servants in this country than there are now.  They are swelling the ranks every week.  The Deputy remembers the time when he was making the welkin ring in East Cork about the extravagance of Cumann na nGaedheal in having hordes of inspectors swarming all over the country that we did not want.  There is no comparison between the regiment of inspectors of Cumann na nGaedheal and the army corps of Fianna Fáil.  Where there were hundreds before there are thousands now.  At the same time that we are appointing extra men we are reducing their salaries.  And the Deputy asks me how are we going to reduce these Estimates!</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I pass now from the Deputy and perhaps I was not wise to spend so much time on him.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce, I have no hesitation in saying, without the slightest desire to be offensive, has the most brazen exterior of any man in the public life of this country.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce would <Col N="295" /> say anything, anywhere, any time, if it suited his purpose.</P>

      <P>The Minister flourished the Estimates to-day, and he said that the Estimates last year were £27,918,000.  This year they are £29,000,000 odd.  He said that that is only an increase of about £1,700,000; but, he said:  &ldquo;We are going to provide £4,000,000 for local loans, £1,500,000 for unemployment relief, and we have increased the Estimates under a number of other benevolent heads,&rdquo; which, he says, more than offsets the increases.  In fact, he says, these Estimates are lower than those of our predecessors or those of last year.  Now the Minister knows, and the Minister for Finance knows, that to say that is a deliberate perversion of the facts.  It is worse, because it is a half-truth.  It is the kind of equivocation calculated to deceive the more innocent of President de Valera's supporters.  Last year, when the Estimates were published, in a leaflet similar to that circulated last night, there appeared on the cover, under the heading of the total Estimate for 1933-34 the figure of £22,039,951.</P>

      <P>No, last year.  In round figures it was about £22,000,000 or £23,000,000.  This year, when the same document is circulated, there appears in the same place the sum of £29,709,000.  That represents an increase of £7,000,000 on the Estimates. I do not deny that it is only right to offset the £4,000,000 for Local Loans, because that, undoubtedly, is an item of capital expenditure which will be coming back to us in time.  Nevertheless, you must keep these things in fair comparison.  The fact of it is that the same Estimates this year stand at £29,000,000 odd that stood at £22,000,000 or £23,000,000 last year. To this Estimate of expenditure must be added the Central Fund expenditure which amounts to £6,000,000.</P>

You thought we were going to do it at once, but we mean to do it in the course of a lifetime.&rdquo; Now we are told that the £5,000,000 is all really included in the Estimates this year, and I have no doubt that the Minister, if he had time to look up his speech of last year, would find that he said something of a similar nature then.  I know he is shocked when I suggest that there is anything in the nature of deception in the attitude he adopted.  Nevertheless, I draw the attention of the House to the fact that last year the Estimate was £23,000,000 odd and this year it is £29,000,000 odd.  We do not know what Supplementary Estimates he will present during the year.  If they are on the same scale as last year, that Supply Services Estimate will be £34,000,000.</P>

      <P>Right enough, he is in a job.  He is a caretaker, or is he an operative worker?  I hope that Deputy Corish will take care of him in the Operative Workers' Union.  As I was saying, is it not amazing what they have got away with so far?  For how long, I wonder?  That disposes of the Estimates position, and the House will understand me when I say that, if they accept the Minister's undertaking that there will be no Supplementary Estimates comparable with the Supplementary Estimates of last year, my idea is that the total expenditure is going to be in the nature of £34,000,000 or £35,000,000.  If, as I suggested, it is quite possible that there will be large Supplementary Estimates brought in under various <Col N="298" /> heads, as there may be, we may be face to face with a Bill at the end of this year of something in the nature of £39,000,000.  That would not be so bad if you did not turn to the trade returns which the Minister for Industry and Commerce quoted so eloquently and at such great length to-day.  Let us deal with them.  The trade of this country consists of imports and exports&mdash;that is its external trade&mdash;and we remember when the external trade of this country was over £100,000,000 and when the adverse trade balance was about £11,000,000.  At that juncture, Deputy MacEntee, as he then was, got up and said that sometimes his heart stood still in contemplation of the disaster which was just around the corner, and that if this business went on it would inevitably mean that we would be driven straight on to the rocks and that the ship of State would founder. Our external trade to-day has fallen to a figure of little more than £56,000,000 a year, if it is that much, and our adverse trade balance is £16,000,000  That was the last figure published.  When that figure of £16,000,000 of an adverse trade balance was published, the total exports for the same 12 months were £19,000,000, so that when our export trade was £48,000,000, and our adverse trade balance £11,000,000, the Minister's heart nearly stopped.  But, when our export trade dropped to £19,000,000, and our adverse trade balance had risen to £16,000,000, apparently the only effect it has on the Minister is to make him hysterical.  He has lost all regard for trade now, and what in the past was a presage of disaster, we are now told by his colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, is an indication of prosperity; so that with our trade practically gone, our exports falling steadily, and our adverse trade balance rising steadily, our expenditure is going to rise at the same time. Yet Deputy Corry gets up and says: &ldquo;It is all grand&rdquo;; and Deputy T. Kelly says: &ldquo;The more the merrier;&rdquo; but the Minister for Finance smiles rather sourly through it all.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce undertook to instruct us all to-night <Col N="299" /> in political economy and in national economics.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I want to tell the House,&rdquo; he said,</P>
      <P>&ldquo;that if we could find a coal mine in this country that would produce £3,000,000 worth of coal, we could reduce our exports of agricultural produce by £3,000,000, because we could dig up the coal and we would be £6,000,000 richer.&rdquo;</P>

It is like the riddle about the travelling train; when you have made out all the calculations you are asked the colour of the engine driver's beard.  In this case we are told that if we raised our £3,000,000 worth of coal from the ground and if we did not export £3,000,000 worth of agricultural produce, we would be £6,000,000 the richer.

      <P>I now want to deal with perhaps the most daring escapade of the Minister for Industry and Commerce. He got the trade statistics and fervently prayed that no one else had got them.  He read them.  But some one was good enough to go out and bring them in to me.  When the Minister for Industry and Commerce saw them arrive, he dropped trade statistics and took up Estimates.  I want to <Col N="300" /> prove, he said, that the situation is getting better and better, that in January this country was much better in exports of cattle, horses and butter than in January, 1933.  I want Deputies to pay very careful attention to this, because it is most illuminating. Our Exports of cattle in January, 1933, were 35,832 head, and in 1934 41,902 head.  In 1933 we received £446,366 for cattle and for 6,000 head more in 1934 we received £368,022, so that we received £80,000 less in 1934 for 6,000 more cattle.  Is not that great evidence of increasing prosperity?  Now we turn to horses.  In the same month in 1933 we exported 297 horses, for which we received £47,000, and in 1934 we exported 551 horses, for which we received £75,000.  We find that there is a small drop in the quantity of butter, but prices were approximately the same.  There is a very material decrease in the export of eggs.  In fact, if you go down the lists you will find, compared with last year even, that there is a very material decrease.</P>

    <P>Let us go back to find out what were the conditions the month before we had the blessing of a Fianna Fáil Government; the last month that we lived deprived of that extraordinary blessing.  Our trade in January, 1934, was £4,432,000 and the adverse trade balance was £1,650,000 in that month. In January, 1932, the adverse trade balance was £1,203,000, so that our adverse trade balance for one month was increased by £450,000.  Our trade in that particular month is reduced by about £150,000.  Our exports in that particular month are down by about £1,000,000.  If you chose to go back month after month you will find that each month, during the last 12 months, as compared with the previous 12 months Cumann na nGaedheal was in office, it is down in some cases in one month by £2,000,000.  Is it not a glorious record?  Is it not striking evidence of the increasing prosperity of this country? Yet the Minister for Industry and Commerce had the effrontery to get up and tell us that things are getting better.  He asked: What are the indications of improving trade? Greater consumption of tea, greater <Col N="301" /> consumption of sugar, greater consumption of tobacco, greater consumption of motors.  He stated every one of these things with his tongue in his cheek.  No man knows better than the Minister for Industry and Commerce that, while there is a larger quantity of tea coming into the country, it is of very inferior quality.  The average cost of tea coming into the country during the past year has fallen by about 1/7.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Has not the average price of tea fallen?</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly not.  What is happening is that lower-grade tea is being consumed.  The trend of the tea market for the past six months has been strongly upward.  The trend of Irish tea consumption has been steadily falling from grade to grade. There was a time when the tea buyers of Mincing Lane used to say when they found that good tea came forward in the sale: &ldquo;That is Irish tea.  We could not buy it for consumption in England at all.  They always want the best tea in Ireland.&rdquo;  Tip-top tea came to be known in Mincing Lane as &ldquo;Irish tea.&rdquo;  Now, the Irish people have been reduced to drinking the same quality of tea that is sold in the poorer quarters of London.  It may be argued that they are consuming more tea.  They probably are.  It takes more tea at 1/8 or 1/6 per lb. to make a pot of tea than it does of tea at 3/4 or 3/8 per lb.  The Minister said that the consumption of sugar is going up. I do not know where he gets his figures.  I am not prepared to contest them.  His statement may be true, but I do not know what it indicates.  All I can say is that sugar is, perhaps, one of the cheapest of foods.  It is not going to be the cheapest in future, when the Minister has put his penny per lb. on it in order to float the four white elephants he brought into the world.  His activity as an accoucheur of elephants is going to be a very expensive business for this country. <Col N="302" /> There was a time when sugar was one of the cheapest foods the poor could buy.  One would expect that, in times of stress and anxiety, the consumption of sugar would rise.</P>
      <P>As regards tobacco, everybody knows that unemployment is the best friend the tobacco manufacturers have.  An idle man will smoke far more than an employed man.  He has more time to do it.  That is well known.  If the Minister will look at the speech of the chairman of the Imperial Tobacco Company, about two years ago, he will find that he commented on the fact, where you have unemployed men hanging about, they will smoke more&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody will grudge them the consolation of a smoke if they are standing at a street corner or waiting in a labour exchange queue to get a job.  How they get the tobacco, I am not concerned to inquire.  It is a source of satisfaction to the Minister and to everybody else that, under modern social conditions, we are in a position to make trifling comforts of that kind available to them.  No one is more ready than I to acknowledge this, with appreciation, the principle underlying the Unemployment Relief Bill.  The first time mention of that principle was heard in this House was on the motion introduced by Deputy Morrissey calling for work or maintenance for the unemployed.  I stand for that principle.  The Minister stands for it. It is a pleasure to have found common ground.  Out of that position and such social services as we have the unemployed did get tobacco.  Wherever you have men suffering under great mental stress the consumption of tobacco will arise.  Where is there a farmer, large or small, in this country who is not suffering great mental stress?  Consequently, the consumption of tobacco rises.  These are no indications of rising prosperity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister went on to say that the importation of motor cars has increased.  Nobody knows better than the Minister why that is so.  He changed the duty on motor cars three <Col N="303" /> times in the year 1932.  There was a new motor car duty on every time we came into the House.  No man knew whether, if he bought a motor car on Monday, the Minister for Finance would not take £50 off the price on Tuesday or whether if he placed his order for a car there might not be £75 put on to the price before delivery. The result was that you had a great number of orders held back and that you had a large number of motor cars purchased in 1933 which would normally have been purchased in 1932. You have an abnormal importation of motor cars in 1933 but it is trifling with the intelligence of Deputies who are living in the country and moving amongst the people, attending fairs week after week.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall give the Deputy another example.  The import of clocks and watches has increased considerably.  What is the significance of that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose no Party in this country has ever thumped the tub more about red tape, the civil service mind and the Merrion Street outlook than the Fianna Fáil Party.  Is not that the Merrion Street outlook? Imagine going up to a farmer who has brought two bullocks to the fair and is offered £7 for the pair, striking him on the back and saying, &ldquo;My dear fellow, make no mistake, you are much better off than you were last year.  You have been importing more clocks and watches.&rdquo;  That is the perfect Merrion Street mind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister shuts his eyes to the condition of his own neighbours, as they can be seen if he goes down the country any day.  Then he tosses off an observation about the importation of clocks and watches.  Is that not enough to show how completely remote from reality this Government is?  They have become so absorbed in their figures, statistics, calculations, schemes, and plans that do not come off that they have <Col N="304" /> entirely forgotten the ruin and destruction that is coming on the country while they are planning and scheming.  Another jewel was contributed by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  He said: &ldquo;There are some ignorant Deputies who imagine that increased estimates mean increased taxation.  Not at all.  We shall borrow.&rdquo;  That is like the man who longed for a cheque book so that he might write cheques and hand them out among all his friends.  He noticed that all the rich fellows had cheques and that they could hand them out <i>ad nausea.</i>  Unfortunately, he discovered, when he stole his neighbour's cheque book and started writing cheques, that they all came back.  The Minister says: &ldquo;We shall go out and borrow.&rdquo;  Sometimes it is not easy to borrow.  The Government tried to borrow £6,000,000 and all they got was a couple of hundred thousand.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will agree that the Minister for Industry and Commerce is mistaken when he imagines you can go out, straight away, and raise money by borrowing, and that he is doubly mistaken when he says that borrowing money does not increase taxation.  It does; and the taxes will have to be paid by the Irish people; the Irish farmers will have to pay them. Sooner or later these moneys must be paid&mdash;the interest on the loan, quite apart from the capital. Every penny borrowed will have to be paid.  Let no Deputy think that in authorising the Government to plunge into this sea of expenditure there is an easy way out by borrowing.  There is not.  You have to pay for your borrowed money and that will add to the taxation of the country for years to come.  I want to say one last word upon this Estimate.  Does anybody remember what the President said when he was talking about the capacity of this country to bear taxation?  He then said we are practically sending £5,000,000 a year to England.  For every £1 Ireland can afford England can afford £66.  That is a proportion of 66 to one.  That means that we have to send to England the equivalent of £349,000,000 per annum.  I ask Deputies on the Government Benches to multiply that £349,000,000 by 66 and they will find that this assumes the amount of an annual burden of taxation, taking the President's figures, amounting to something like £2,310,000,000 per annum&mdash;an amount equal to the entire British national debt, and Deputy Tom Kelly says &ldquo;the more the merrier.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Corry says the farmers of this country are much better off under Fianna Fáil than they would be in any other country, and Deputy Corish and the Labour Party sit back quite futile. I cannot but think that sometimes they <Col N="306" /> wonder, scratch their heads and say: &ldquo;It is nice to take part in spending a sum which is equivalent to £2,310,000,000.  But it cannot go on for ever.  Yet, let us be merry while we may.&rdquo;  If the members of that Party were less abstemious than I know them to be, I might remind them of the unpleasant consequences of the morning after the night before.  You cannot be merry, I think, where you pay so terrible a price, and this country is going to have a very bad morning after the night before if it goes on spending on a basis of £2,310,000,000 per annum.  That is the situation with which this country is face to face and it is well that we should consider it.</P>
    <P>I want to ask two or three questions. Why does the Minister for Finance find it necessary to increase the Secret Service Vote?  He has got the money. I know he will not answer my question. But I feel there are scrupulous Deputies in the Fianna Fáil Party who hate to think of the employment of men to spy upon their fellow men and who will insist on knowing who has got this money.  Somebody has got it.  I see there is an increase in the Gárda Síochána Vote.  If every new member taken into the Gárda Síochána is as good as the members of the rank and file which they have come to join, I have no complaint.  But I want to make this complaint:  The Minister for Justice has put it across me in the last three months by posting a policeman behind every door in this Dáil. I object to that.  It is now three months since this House began to crawl with members of the Civic Guard&mdash;plain clothes and uniformed men, and so with other buildings. What they are doing there God only knows.  I think they would be much more usefully employed somewhere else.</P>
    <P>I will not refer to the Circuit Courts now, because that will more properly arise on the Estimates themselves. But I join with Deputy F. Lynch in protesting against the reduction in the Gaeltacht Services under every head. It is a public scandal, considering the housing activities of the Minister, that when there are hundreds of applications from people in the Gaeltacht <Col N="307" /> there is no money to go on with building operations there.  We are told the Government is straining at the leash to give out money and here is a place where they could profitably employ thousands of pounds and instead of that the Gaeltacht Services are cut.  Yet we are told that this Government is solicitous for the promotion of the Irish language and for the protection of the Gaeltacht.  It is a public scandal in this state of affairs that we should have an increased Vote for the Department of Industry and Commerce of £104,000 this year.  That arises from the creation of the licensing system which at present prevails in that Department and which I have had to deal with on more than one occasion.  But I feel it would be unworthy of the occasion now to go into that matter in the absence of the Minister.  I hope, later on, to open up the whole question and to examine it carefully.  I propose to say no more now in regard to that or in regard to the inflated Estimate for the Minister's Department.</P>
    <P>We have an increase of £240,000 for the Army.  We heard to-day what it was for.  We often heard in years past, Deputy MacEntee as he then was, telling members of the Fianna Fáil Party that the expenditure on the Army was due to extravagance in the administration of the Army.  Now the Government have the administration of the Army in their own hands; they are determined to make the most of it. If they were spending it on our own National Army for its own development and increasing its perfection it could be defended, but they are not. I see there is provision made for the repayment of the Dáil Eireann External Loan, but the provision is only £12,000.  Surely there is more of the Loan outstanding than £12,000.</P>

I think that every Deputy on those benches ought to carry this home and consider it well: remember that it is not only treason but heresy to contest the truth of anything that President de Valera said says.  Begin with that.  Remember this: that President de Valera said that for every pound of taxation that our people can bear the British people can bear £66.  Beware of treason and beware of heresy, and remember that the Budget of the gentleman who used to be the economical Deputy MacEntee, the man who was going to reduce public expenditure by £2,000,000 per annum in this country&mdash;by the equivalent of £132,000,000&mdash;is going to introduce a Budget this year to finance national expenditure which, on President de Valera's own computation, is the equivalent of £2,310,000,000.  Take that home, think it over and go down and ask your constituents what do they think of Fianna Fáil promises.</P>
