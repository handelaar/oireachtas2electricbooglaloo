      <P>(Clare) asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he is aware (a) that road works under the Clare County Council in the neighbourhood of Ennis and Ballynacally were closed down by the finance committee of that council on the afternoon of Monday, 12th February, 1934; (b) that a general strike was in operation in the town of Ennis since midnight on the 8th February until about 4 p.m. on Monday, 12th February; (c) that two non-union men were allowed to work by the Clare county surveyor for several days on works on which some 20 men should necessarily be employed; (d) if he will state when his Department was notified of the position in Ennis, and what action his Department took on receiving such notification; (e) whether he will consider further the application made for a full inquiry into road administration in County Clare; (f) whether his Department has expressed approval or otherwise of the resolution adopted at the finance meeting of the Clare County Council resolving that only trade union labour be employed in schemes of work under its control; and (g) if he is aware of the action of the Clare county surveyor in appointing a man in charge of a county council van whose name did not come through the employment exchange.</P>

      <P>(Clare) asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he is aware (a) that 12 cottages are in course of construction at Kildysart, Co. Clare, on which the conditions of employment are far less favourable than conditions operating in several other employments in the area; (b) that local labour is not being employed, and (c) when his Department was first notified of this position, and what action it has since taken.</P>

      <P>A complaint has been made that tradesmen from other parts of County Clare are employed in the erection of labourers' cottages at Kildysart workhouse and that wages at trade union rates are not being paid the labourers working on the scheme. The matter was reported to me in November last and on the 22nd November I brought the complaint to the notice of the Clare Board of Health and Public Assistance calling their attention to the provisions of Section 8 of the Housing (Financial and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1932.  The Board of Health are in communication with the Minister for Industry and Commerce as regards the proper rate of wages payable to workers in the Kildysart district.</P>

      <P>(a) The number of applications received by the Clare Board of Health and Public Assistance for the erection of labourers' cottages since the passing of the Housing (Financial and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1932, is 738; (b) the number of cottages included in the Clare County Scheme Order, 1933, as confirmed is 165.  A further order made by the board for the acquisition of land for the erection of 296 cottages has been submitted and a local inquiry as to the propriety of confirming this order will be held at an early date. (c) The number of cottages in course of erection is 13.  (d) The number of cottages which it is estimated will be completed before the 31st March, 1935, is 242.</P>

    <P>* There is no exact information as to the number of houses actually in course of construction by private enterprise in rural areas where the time for completion extends to 1st April, 1935, but it may be assumed that the greater portion of the number approved of in urban areas are in progress as these houses have to be completed by April next to qualify for a grant of £60 which ill be reduced to £50 thereafter.

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he will state whether it is proposed to take any action arising out of the demonstration towards a Deputy and delegates to the Fine Gael Convention on the night of the 9th February, 1934, about 10 p.m., by a hostile and disorderly crowd of men, two of whom were caught and brought to a Gárda on duty in Dawson Street; whether any inquiries have been made in the matter, and, if so, what was the nature and result of the inquiries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>I have made inquiries into the matter referred to in this question and I have ascertained that nothing occurred in the presence or hearing of the Gárdaí in Dawson Street which would justify the arrest of the two men who were pointed out to them by Deputy Belton and Dr. Hennessy.  I <Col N="1763" /> am informed that the Deputy and Dr. Hennessy admitted that they were not assaulted or threatened by these men. The names and addresses of these men were taken by the Gardaí and offered to the Deputy.  I am satisfied that no further action could properly have been taken by the Gárdaí in the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, did he ascertain whether a crowd followed us from Grafton Street and these men were the advance guard of that crowd?  Is he aware that they caught up to us there and they charged us with being members of a murder gang and called us murderers?  Probably the next thing would be an assault.  We gave that information to the Gárdaí.  Is the position this, that the Minister considers that people can go around in groups insulting citizens on the streets of Dublin without any action being taken by the authorities in regard to them?  Is that actually the position that the Minister is taking up?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not taking up any attitude of the kind.  The Deputy stated in the course of a debate here that he had been set upon.  The information I have had from the Gárdaí is that the Deputy and another gentleman pointed out two men in Dawson Street, two boys or two men.  These two boys denied to the Guards that they were in Wicklow Street at all.  The Deputy was then asked by the Guards if he was threatened or assaulted by those two individuals and he said he was not.  The other gentleman who was with him said he was not threatened or assaulted.  The Gárdaí had no power in such circumstances to do anything except to get the names and addresses of those individuals.  They got them and gave them to the Deputy in order that he might take whatever action he liked.  The Gárdaí had no power to arrest in such circumstances.  If they did they would have been exceeding their duty.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">

      <P>What more could the Guards do in the circumstances than they have done?  They procured the names and addresses of the two men whom the Deputy pointed out and it was then for the Deputy and the gentleman with him to take action if they so desired and the Guards would be there to give evidence.  The Guards asked the Deputy and the other gentleman if they had been threatened or assaulted and both of them replied that they had not.  The Guards had no power in such circumstances to arrest. They did all they could by getting the names and addresses and furnishing them to the Deputy so that he could take whatever action he liked.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I to understand from the Minister that in future crowds can follow Deputies of this House through the streets calling them murderers and no action will be taken? People followed in that way have no redress except to take the names and addresses of those who follow them and then perhaps charge them in the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy was listening to the answer I have given to Deputy Belton he would not come to any such unfounded assumption.  I have explained already that these two men were pointed out by Deputy Belton and his friend to the Guards. There was no mob; there were only two of them and they were pointed out by the Deputy to the Guards.  He said they were the people who had followed them in Wicklow Street.  These two men denied that and the Deputy informed the Guards that he had not been threatened or assaulted.  That is very different to the suggestion that they were part of a mob.</P>

The Minister for Industry and Commerce will come here and will explain the proposals which are to be covered by the Estimate.  The Deputy will then have an opportunity of either criticising those proposals or opposing them in the Division Lobby if he thinks fit.  The sole purpose is to get the matter before the Dáil at the earliest possible moment.  The circulation of the Estimates will not add anything to the information which the <Col N="1797" /> Deputy may have in his possession in regard to this proposal.

      <P>No, but the House understands that the Executive Council propose to have no reply to the matter introduced into this debate by Deputy Cosgrave on Friday.  Again, sir, I oppose this Estimate and the proposal that it covers.  The proposal definitely is to use public funds for the purpose of party propaganda.  The Executive Council propose to have a political shop-front of their own in Dublin, for which they have been seeking a man, and a political shop-front of their own in London, for which they have a man, but the work for these political propaganda shops and the material that is to be retailed through them is to be provided by this Information Bureau by persons paid at the public expense. It is to be given out through a party propaganda shop in the City of Dublin &mdash;obviously such&mdash;and through the new Secretary of our Legation in Washington, and thus the people at home and the people abroad are going to be doped with the necessary propaganda to cover the terrible state of affairs brought about here as a result of their policy, which will be issued through these agencies, prepared at the direction of these agencies, but paid for at the public expense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has been terribly interested in avoiding delay in the putting forward of what is to be done here with regard to the production of industrial alcohol.  He was urgently anxious on a similar occasion to tell what was going to be done with regard to beet.  We will hear on Friday something of what is going to be done or what are the promises with regard to industrial alcohol, but I submit that after that, after these promises have been made, we are going to be in a position in which we now are with regard to general information on industrial development here which we have <Col N="1801" /> tried to get from the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  We are going to be left without; we are going to be told that the statistics are not comparable. A new Department is being set up here to take out of the hands of ordinary civil servants the compiling and issuing of details of facts with regard to their Ministries.  The position in the different Departments has come to this, that the facts set out by the experts who handle these inside the Civil Service are so clear and so unpalatable that they have to be issued with a coating of propaganda over them or they have to be obscured entirely by a coating of propaganda, so that the ordinary channel for getting facts from Government Departments is apparently going to be shut up and the public abroad and at home are going to be supplied with what is prepared in a propaganda Department instead.</P>
    <P>Exception has been taken to statements made by Deputy Fitzgerald that certain passages were cut out of the paper, <i>United Ireland</i>, last week, and the Attorney-General has attempted to show that the Editor of <i>United Ireland</i> could print anything he liked and that the printer could print anything he liked.  The statement of the Attorney-General, however, was explicit on this point, that he told the police the passages which he indicated should be taken out were definitely seditious and that he, as Attorney-General, might proceed against the printer if he printed them.  Now, either the printer was being given, through the police officer, the opinion of a good Attorney-General or the opinion of a bad Attorney-General. If I, as a printer, got the opinion of a good Attorney-General that a certain passage was seditious, and if I considered the Attorney-General a good person, whose opinion was worth having, and a man who stood over his job, I certainly would not print that passage.  On the other hand, if I saw the opinion of a bad Attorney-General and that his opinion was not worth much, I might, nevertheless, hesitate very much, because, just as it might be a lot more troublesome to be handled in a dentist's chair by a bad dentist rather than by a good dentist, it might be even more inconvenient in <Col N="1802" /> the courts to be handled by a bad Attorney-General than by a good one. What happened definitely with regard to <i>United Ireland</i> is that pressure was brought to bear upon the printer, and the printer was bludgeoned into leaving out a paragraph which, as has been stated, was a normal comment on the Government's attitude.</P>
    <P>The President has informed us that the object of this Bureau is to keep the public at home and abroad right on certain matters&mdash;on the fact that there is no imminence of a civil war; on certain matters with regard to our finances; on certain matters with regard to our industrial development, and the position of employment here and what is being done for the people. The President said that the prestige and credit of the Saorstát have been injured by reports representing the country as being on the verge of revolution.  The President suggests that part of the duty of the Bureau of Information would be to dispel those ideas.  I want to suggest that the duty that is going to be thrust on this Bureau of Information is an entirely different one.  It is to prepare this country and countries outside for actions that the Ministry propose to take, because, while the President implies by his statement that he is thoroughly anxious that nobody would think for a moment that this country was near revolution, his Ministers are going around the country every Sunday telling the people that it is.  Take one particular Minister, the Minister for Education, who is reported in the Press on 5th February as having been in Kilkenny on the previous day, Sunday. The Minister is reported as saying:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The real purpose of those behind General O'Duffy, and who are using him as a catspaw in the game, is to seize power by unconstitutional means.  There is no use in saying or pretending that this will not happen or that it cannot happen.  We have seen and we know what is taking place on the Continent; and, if the object of that movement is not to seize power in the same way as has been done on the Continent, why is this movement modelled so closely <Col N="1803" /> and with such servility on the Continental organisations?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then he goes on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I say that the promoters of this movement have one object only&mdash;to build up and develop a military or semi-military organisation in this country on a Fascist basis until such time as they are in a position to take over power by a <i>coup d'étát</i>, and if they get the opportunity they will take advantage of it.  This is the purpose of these men who have been discarded by the electorate and turned down at two general elections.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Do we understand from the President that the Bureau of Information is going to issue, either to outside countries or to the people here, information that will deny the suggestions made in Kilkenny on 4th February by the Minister for Education?  I think it is important that we should hear the President on that point, because on the following Sunday, the 11th February, as reported in the daily Press of 12th February, the Minister for Education was again at it.  Referring to General O'Duffy's movement, the Minister said that these people seemed to have it at the back of their minds that they could get into power in some other way than by the votes of the people, and he proposed a policy of education as the only policy that would put an end to a scheme of things in which a minority were trying to seize power.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education was again at it on the 18th February.  As reported in the Press of 19th February he stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The position is a serious one so far as peace and good order are concerned. The fact that members of this private army do not carry arms, as we are told, cannot hide the fact that they are a private army with the object of overawing the people and setting themselves against the Government.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The President's own organ on 5th February published a statement in reply to a statement issued by the I.R.A. which stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1804" />&ldquo;As to the charge that we &lsquo;take no note of the widespread anger and resentment against the Fascists,&rsquo; and that we fail to urge the &lsquo;appropriate action&rsquo; against them, we take such note of these things that we see the almost certainty of civil war unless the action to be taken in the present situation is not left to those who alone have been given by the people the authority to decide upon that action and to direct it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>As to the attitude of the President's propaganda organ and the President's Minister on this subject, we have also had the ex-Minister for Justice, Deputy Geoghegan, explaining that one of the Estimates before the House at the present time, the new Supplementary Estimate for the Army, is to deal with a huge increase of expenditure incurred in order to throttle an attempt to rob the people of Parliamentary Government.</P>
    <P>We might take the President at his word in this statement of his.  The position taken up eternally by the President was that those who are politically opposed to him were unconstitutional. All his propaganda in the past had not only been to that effect, but definitely had as its kernel the charge that, whether they were in power or whether they were out of power, his political opponents were always preparing to prevent the majority of the people here from setting up whatever Government they wanted.  His whole propaganda on that matter, both at home and abroad, particularly abroad, before he took over office, was to the effect that the Cosgrave administration were making every possible preparation to prevent the Fianna Fáil Government taking over office if they got a majority here. The greatest sample that we get of the President's capacity as a propagandist, or of the President's spirit as expressed in propaganda, is in the weekly issue of the Fianna Fáil dope through the columns of <i>The Irish World</i> in the United States.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I fail to see what relation weekly propaganda in <i>The Irish World</i> bears to this Estimate. On an Estimate the House usually <Col N="1805" /> discusses the administration of the Department concerned.  It would require much ingenuity to relate propaganda in <i>The Irish World</i> or the President's capacity for propaganda in 1930, to the institution of this Bureau.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I say that this institution is being set up by the President for the purpose of issuing propaganda and that one of the matters upon which he is going to issue propaganda is the extent to which there is, or there is not, a revolution pending in this country. That is to say, for the overthrow of the present Government by force of arms.  I am suggesting that what the President is proposing to deal with through this bureau of information is the steps which he proposes taking, alleging that he has to put down revolution in this country, for preventing its uprising and I am saying that the propaganda that will be carried out by the President on that subject through this Information Bureau will be in acordance with and in keeping with the propaganda carried out in the past.  That is, it will be machinery for charging his political opponents with attempting to overthrow the majority Party in power here by force of arms.  I want to speak briefly of the President's roots in that matter.  We had a case here in this House where the President got up and told the House that I had been in Glasgow, meeting the British Minister for War for the purpose of getting armed assistance from the British Government to assist me and my colleagues in putting the Fianna Fáil Government out of power by force of arms.</P>

      <P>The President's Department is not under review in this a Supplementary Estimate.  Debate on a Supplementary Estimate is confined to the purpose of the Vote and its administration by the Department concerned.  As I have already said, Deputies may not discuss every possible contingency that might arise, and if they were allowed to voice their conjectures and surmises as to the activities of a Department not yet <Col N="1806" /> functioning the debate might be interminable. The &ldquo;roots of the President's information&rdquo; on certain matters are not in order.</P>

      <P>I am discussing the statement of the President in which he said that the prestige and credit of the Saorstát have been injured by reports representing this country as being on the verge of revolution, and the proposal put to this House that this Bureau of Information will have as part of its work the combating of suggestions made here and elsewhere that this country is on the verge of revolution.  I am arguing that the President's statements cannot be taken at their face value.  I am arguing that the purpose of the President in setting up this Bureau, in so far as it will deal with any aspect of what he refers to, will be to continue the line of propaganda that has been carried on all along&mdash; that his political opponents are acting in an unconstitutional way and that in particular they are seeking to overthrow his Government by force of arms.  The person who was responsible for the President making these statements here has been the spearhead of the President's propaganda drive in that direction for years past. Before the President sat down in his presidential seat, and when it was absolutely certain what the result of the election in 1932 would be, the particular person who induced him to make that statement with regard to me here in this House, induced the Minister, who is now the Vice-President, to go late at night to the Archbishop's house, in the City of Dublin, and to make the charge to the Archbishop there that particular members of Deputy Cosgrave's late Administration were preparing that night to seize arms in certain barracks in the City of Dublin and to prevent Mr. de Valera's Administration taking over office.</P>

I am charging the President with proposing to carry on this Bureau in the same spirit and under the same influence as induced him to come into this House and make the statement that he did, and that induced the person who is now Vice-President to go to the Archbishop of Dublin late at night&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That incident is not relevant.  Whoever called on the Archbishop of Dublin in 1932, it was not, I presume, the officer to be appointed under this Vote.  The Deputy will please resume his seat. Debate on a Supplementary Estimate is normally confined to the administration and policy of the Department. This Bureau will be open to annual discussion in this House when the Estimates are being considered.  That will be the time to review the activities of the Bureau.  To forecast now what the Bureau might do in every eventuality would lead us from China to Peru and from Canberra to Kinvara.</P>

      <P>As you have said, sir, the ordinary practice is to discuss the administration of the Department, but here is a proposal for some unnamed sum of money to be expended on a Department which does not yet exist.  You referred, sir, to the person who is to be appointed, but as far as this House is concerned, the person responsible is the President.  He is the person who is going to be responsible for the person who will operate this Department.  If we could only discuss its administration, as it has only commenced its administration since the day before yesterday, it would seem futile to bring the Vote before the House at all.  I submit that we should be allowed to discuss all its possible activities. The President himself indicated certain matters with which the Bureau will deal.  This is a Department acting under the aegis of the President for the purpose of giving information to the world in relation to the operations of Government Departments and Government policy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The point I make is that as we have been told already what we may not discuss, as it has been suggested that the proper thing to discuss is administration, and, as we cannot discuss administration, it does seem to us that some possible indication might be given to us of what we may discuss.  Failing that, I would suggest, with all respect, that the President took certain specific items that might be dealt with.  Are we to be confined to the items which the President suggested might be matters that might be dealt with by the Department, or are we to anticipate, arguing from the known to the unknown, certain matters which this Department may have to deal with, in giving service to the State which may be diametrically opposed to the interests of the State?</P>

      <P>The Deputy suggested that the Chair referred to the official, who may be appointed to this Department, as a proper subject for debate.  That is not so.  He also suggested that I proposed that the debate be confined to administration. During the two days on which this Vote has been under discussion, the Chair, owing to the exceptional character of this Supplementary Estimate, has given considerable latitude.  I say that the whole political situation here and the actions of any men three or four years ago are not in order in this debate. And every sphere of Government activity may not be debated.  It is not for me to guide the members of the House as to what they may say; it is my duty to pull Deputies up when they say what they should not say.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to be clear with regard to your ruling.  I do not understand you to restrict me to administration.  I can have nothing to say with regard to administration.  A Vote for the expenditure of a sum of money has been put to us for a particular purpose, action to be taken in the issuing of information by the Executive Council as a whole, with the President as the principal responsible <Col N="1809" /> person.  I am discussing the policy.  I am taking some of the President's remarks as to what he will deal with in the matter of propaganda through this Bureau, and I am indicating, not so much specific actions on the part of the President or any of his Ministers or any of his propagandists, but rather am I indicating the general line upon which propaganda from the Party opposite has proceeded in the past.</P>
      <P>I have mentioned a single instance with regard to the President and a single instance with regard to the Vice-President, indicating the lengths to which they are prepared to go to make the charge against their political opponents that they are acting in an unconstitutional way; not only that, but they are endeavouring by every possible means to get arms, now from a military barracks in the city, owned by the Irish people and controlled by Irish troops, and now from what is supposed to be an alien enemy across the water, all for the purpose of using them against the elected Government of the day here.  All these things have their roots in the past.  In 1930 they were issuing broadcast to the world that we were on the eve of a dictatorship here if the old Cumann na nGaedheal Party could possibly help it. Anyone anxious to believe that could have the word of the chief propagandist of the Fianna Fáil Party, the man who induced the President to make a certain statement here, and the man who induced the Vice-President to go to the Archbishop's Palace.  So far as propaganda along that line is concerned, the propaganda that is going to be issued here will not be propaganda in the nature of information that will clear the fair name of this country from charges such as the Ministers opposite have made against it.  Only their own actions could ever bring a stain on this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For one reason I oppose this Estimate. I do not take the President's word at its face value when he indicates what he is proposing to do with regard to making it clear that this country is not on the verge of revolution. If the President wants to give the House some sign of his sincerity <Col N="1810" /> in that matter, he will take one of his Ministers and talk to him and shut his mouth.  The others are just as bad, but for three weeks running now the Minister for Education has been at it, and his own organ has definitely stated that if they cannot do something that they have in their minds at the present moment, they see nothing before this country but civil war.  If the President takes exception to the case I make against him, in fairness to this House and to our people outside he should deal with the matter and give the House greater earnest than he has given up to the present, if we take his statements in conjunction with all the other statements, statements even by himself and other Ministers and all his followers throughout the country on the same subject.</P>
    <P>The President is going to tell the world and the people here the position with regard to our national finances and our alleged commitments to other countries.  But no people in this country have so misrepresented the country as regards the burden of taxation under which the people are labouring as the members of the Party opposite, through their propaganda machine.  As far as the world centre for the dissemination of their propaganda on the subject of taxation is concerned, the <i>Irish World</i> was their centre in 1930 and has been all along until the present; it was their chief propaganda agent for the world at large.  We were told in 1930 that the overtaxation of Ireland was most appalling.  The overtaxation of the Irish people a couple of years ago was, we were told, most appalling.  This Information Bureau is now going to soft pedal to our people at home and the people abroad as regards what the taxation really means.  The farmers are going to be told that their burdens are very much lighter than they used to be, that they have the MacEntee Millions coming to them every year to the tune of £6,000,000 or so.  The propagandists on the far side specifically took certain statements with regard to the last Minister for Finance, Mr. Blythe, and they made very illuminating comments on them for the information of the world.</P>

      <P>This Government is going to tell the world that taxation in Ireland is really very light, although the people are asked to bear £4,000,000 more annually since this Government came into office.  This Bureau is going to be used to show that an addition of £4,000,000 in taxation is the greatest benefit that could be conferred on the people, whereas, when they were promising before they came into office a reduction of £4,000,000 in taxation, they were pointing out that the taxation under <Col N="1812" /> which this country laboured at the time was appalling.</P>
      <P>That is the mentality of the Deputies opposite.  They saw the possibility of saving £3,000,000 out of £16,000,000 over a particular set of items in 1930, and they are asking us now to vote money to tell the world that because, instead of reducing the taxation of the country by £3,000,000, they have increased it by £4,000,000 or more, that this country is well delivered from the hands of the people who are now trying to get back into power by unconstitutional means and by an odd collection of arms from barracks here in Dublin or from the English War Minister in Scotland.  The President says they are going to tell the country about the great industrial development that has taken place here.  The mentality of the President, so far as can be known up to the present, has been that Irish progress has been sacrificed by the Free State Imperial clique, and when the Attorney-General made a short intervention in this debate he was shy of intervening on a second point.  I would like to hear the Attorney-General on another point. The President is going to tell the world at large what he and his Government are going to do to revive Irish industry.  But in September, 1930, they were charging Cosgrave's Government with wiping out the Clondalkin paper factory.  I do not see Deputy Brady here&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, briefly, the mentality of the Party opposite in the matter of propaganda and the issue of information is what it has been in the past, and I oppose this Estimate, because, to repeat again, the people who oppose this Government, and every Party that opposes them are unconstitutional, and this Bureau Department is going to be used to show they are.  Every Party who went before them in the past has been piling taxation on the unfortunate Irish people and has been sacrificing Irish progress to Imperial interests.  They sought to carry out the work of exposing the prosperity fake of the Cosgrave Government, and they are going to continue by means of the public purse to misrepresent their opponents and to draw a smoke screen over the appalling damage that they are doing here to the country at large by over-taxation, by industries that are developed in the most haphazard way with no roots to many of them, and very little prospect in front of them except further unemployment and the loss of a certain amount of capital.  We all know the position that has been taken up by the Minister for Industry and Commerce with regard to unemployment.  Unemployment figures in the country rose enormously in 1932.  They were so queer that he could not answer a question about them.  Then he told the House in October, 1932, that he was making an examination into what exactly they represented.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The country is going to be told through the medium of this Bureau the position with regard to employment and unemployment in the country.  The country could be told that by the Department of Industry and Commerce, but the Department of Industry and Commerce has refused, up to the present, to disclose it.  Certain figures have been issued, and they were so queer that a year ago special examination was <Col N="1814" /> made into them, I admit, three or four months after the Minister promised to make it.  In October, 1932, he promised an examination of these figures, and on the 4th January, 1933, his Deputy (for at that time he was away), the Minister for Education, told the House&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>It should not be necessary to remind the Deputy that those figures are quite irrelevant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, figures were published this week by the Department of Industry and Commerce showing the number of people registered as unemployed throughout the country.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce examined the different classes of people registered in different areas for the purpose of ascertaining whether they were really unemployed or not, or what exactly was meant by the abnormalities shown in these figures. That was 12 months ago.  He has got that information and he has refused it to the House.  When we come here to the House we are told that the total number of unemployed in the country to-day is more than last year; that the tendency to-day throughout practically the whole country is a tendency towards an increase in the number of unemployed persons registered, whereas for two months last year they were decreasing.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce will tell the House the figures are different, that you do not understand them.  He will tell you it is all right and that there was never less unemployment in this country than there is to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To side step away from the Civil Service whatever limitations there may be in the figures that are represented to the country and the House in regard to unemployment figures which you may have to-day, will mean that these figures will be worth nothing.  They will be but the most useless kind of propaganda dope.  When taken out of the hands of civil servants they are handed into the hands of a person whom it is proposed to employ for propaganda purposes in this new Bureau.  The Department of Industry and Commerce in issuing figures either from the point of view of industry, employment or unemployment, would <Col N="1815" /> be much more satisfactory to the country.  The people at home and abroad would be much more satisfied if they could get these figures from the Civil Service than from propagandists if they are to make head or tail of what is happening.  We are to have this new Bureau set up and then there are to be three centres of Fianna Fáil distribution of propaganda.  The main purpose of the setting up of this Bureau is to serve them with information and obey their beck as to lines upon which information is wanted by the Government.  It is simply making use of the public purse to do the fag work in the gathering together of information to put them in the most suitable light, and to cover them with the most suitable skin for the purposes of the President's policy.  The President's policy and the President's line of propaganda is a line that, while you may endeavour to cut off its tap root here in the discussions in the House, is going to have its tap root as long as the President is a propagandist.</P>

      <P>The Attorney-General said: &ldquo;In any case, the result of the consideration of the matter by the printer and his publishers and editor <Col N="1816" /> was that these passages were excised voluntarily by the people themselves.&rdquo; I just want to tell the Attorney-General that he was misinformed in thinking that whatever understanding there was went beyond the printer.  I want to say that I think the printer was quite right in coming to such an understanding&mdash;if he could do it&mdash;with the police.  I wish to say also that under the circumstances which prevail in this country at the moment I think that one might almost express the word &ldquo;appreciation&rdquo; of the Attorney-General. We have got to a stage in this country at the moment when there is a most arbitrary interpretation by a tyrannical Government as to the meaning of the word &ldquo;sedition.&rdquo;  A printer, or publisher, or editor may ordinarily be expected to have some fair idea as to what he would be allowed to publish and what he would not, but we are actually in a position in this country now when nobody knows what might be declared to be sedition.  Under such a declaration they may be put to enormous loss.  Consequently any printer who could get any sort of guidance beforehand from an authoritative source is well advised to get that guidance. That arrangement did not go beyond the printers.  The Attorney-General says he informed the police that he thought certain passages were seditious, and that if they were printed he might take the matter before the Military Tribunal.  What I am informed&mdash;on this I have only second-hand information, so I am not purporting specifically to refute what the Attorney-General said&mdash;is that the police told the printers that the copy as it was would not be allowed to be issued, but that it could be issued if these three passages were excised.  As I said, I have that information only second-hand.  Even supposing what the Attorney-General said to be true&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The Attorney-General's argument was that there was no censorship. The information I have is that the printers were informed that the paper would not be allowed to be issued.  11,500 copies were already printed, and they were at a loss to that extent.  I also want to point out that in the existing circumstances in this country, if a printer is told that the Attorney-General considers certain passages to be seditious, and that if they are printed he will probably take the matter before the Military Tribunal, that is absolute censorship, for this reason: sedition is a word&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It does seem to me that such a Bureau as this, which is going to issue information, will almost inevitably also have what I might call a negative operation in the form of censorship, especially in the existing conditions in this country, when the Government has a powerful censorship machine which it is using in a most arbitrary and tyrannical manner at this moment.  Further, I would suggest that not only is it using it tyrannically, but most unevenly, and that this Bureau is going to be used for the purpose of ensuring that the great injustice which comes through the uneven operation of the present censorship can be more effectively done when this Bureau is established out of public funds.  I should like to point out&mdash;but I will bow to your ruling&mdash;that whereas one item in one paper&mdash;an item which is merely a statement of opinion on Government policy; which is only what I might call an elucidation, the drawing of a conclusion to point out the moral of a statement made by the President himself in this House&mdash;is banned as seditious, another paper is allowed to print (after it has been submitted to some authority, whether the Attorney-General or the Military Tribunal, I do not know) open appeals to the young people of this country to join an organisation which is unlawful under the definition of the law as it is now applied in this country, the definition under Article 19 of the Constitution (Amendment) (No. 17) Act. A certain paper is allowed to issue appeals to all the young people of this country to break the law of this country by joining an unlawful association, <Col N="1819" /> whose purpose is to overthrow this State by force of arms, and to bring the people of this country into that immoral condition where the jurors will corrupt justice at its very source by committing perjury in the interests of that association.  They are also allowed to print open Communist propaganda, after that organ has been submitted to some authority. There are things which I myself have written, and I can assure you, sir, and the House, that there is nothing further from my mind than any desire to embark upon a course of sedition.  If I thought that anything I was writing was seditious it would not need the Attorney-General or the Military Tribunal to suppress it, because I would suppress it myself.  There is this absolute injustice, which is against justice, morality, and the common weal of the people of this country&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I will come on to a more recent matter.  I understand that this Bureau started operations on Monday.  This Bureau, for which the public is to be taxed, is, presumably, to fulfil some useful purpose.  On Friday morning last, Deputy Cosgrave referred to the fact that a certain building, used by an unlawful association in this country, was not interfered with, while another building, belonging to a lawful association, was interfered with.  He pointed out that one of the things that have shocked this country more than anything might conceivably&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>My contention is that the Act defines what is an unlawful association and it states certain methods and certain aims which make an association unlawful.  At the same time, it states that the Executive Council may state that, in its opinion &mdash;and we all know that the word &ldquo;opinion&rdquo; implies something which is open to doubt&mdash;a certain specifically named organisation is unlawful.  The Act also says that when the Executive Council has done that&mdash;and whether it does it honestly or dishonestly does not matter&mdash;the Military Tribunal are bound to accept that affirmation by the Executive Council as full and conclusive proof.  The Military Tribunal were bound to accept that false statement by the Executive Council as full and conclusive proof and the Military Tribunal had no option but to find as they found, but inasmuch as the organisation which owned that premises did not possess any of the aims or pursue any of the methods laid down in what is defined as making an unlawful association, I maintain that it was not an unlawful association, whereas, the other organisation is pampered and put in a privileged position by the members of this Government, an organisation whose method is crime and whose purpose is revolution but, which, for that very reason, is put in that pampered position and allowed to go free and to do all it can to seduce the young manhood of this country into their criminal ranks, under the very ægis of this Government.  That is why I say that No. 5 Parnell Square belonged to an organisation that was not unlawful.</P>

      <P>I want to bring it in on the actual administration of the <Col N="1822" /> Bureau about which we are now speaking. That Bureau, I understand, was opened on Monday; it was open yesterday and the day before and, presumably, to-day, though I know nothing about to-day, but the whole people of this country, horrified by the appalling crime carried out under the ægis of an organisation put in a specially privileged position and immune from the operation of the law of this country, by the present Executive Council&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am speaking now about the very administration of this office since it was set up.  The whole Press of this country and the Press beyond this country are interested to know whether there was any foundation in fact for the appalling revelation made by Deputy Cosgrave in this House on Friday.  There was no point on which it is more important that information should be given to reassure the people of this country that the Government was not guilty of complicity before and after the fact of the crime in Dundalk.  The Pressmen went on Monday, and went on Tuesday&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Before you give a ruling, sir, may I suggest that it is quite relevant, if the facts are as stated by the Deputy who is speaking, namely, that this Press Bureau, which is meant to give information on important matters to the public, has been in operation for two days.  If it has failed to give information on this important matter, I suggest that few things could be more relevant to this debate than that particular matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair does not know whether the Bureau, for which sanction is sought in this <Col N="1823" /> Vote, is in operation, but in any case a detailed discussion of the Dundalk incident is out of order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thoroughly agree, and I fully accept the Ceann Comhairle's ruling, but I did not hear the Deputy entering on a full discussion of that incident.  I suggest, with all respect, that he referred to the incident, and from the occurrence of that incident he drew certain conclusions as to the attitude of the Government on the question of giving information to the public.  That, as I understood him for the two minutes he was on this question, was the gist of his argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I have stated here that it was my information that this Bureau, and the director in charge of it, began operations, presumably, at the public expense, and the director, being paid out of public funds, the day before yesterday, Monday, and was, presumably, being paid as an operative functioning in this Bureau by the State to-day, yesterday and the day before.  I maintain that if this Bureau was to fulfil any useful purpose, if there was any justification for robbing the unfortunate taxpayers of this country, it had a pre-eminent opportunity of making it abundantly clear on Monday last.  Pressman after Pressman was going around seeking information. They were ready to publish that that Bureau had stated that there was no foundation whatsoever for the affirmation made here on Friday by Deputy Cosgrave and, on the other hand, they were ready to publish a statement on behalf of the Government that the Government was determined to bring to justice everybody who was in any way implicated in the appalling crime in Dundalk.  What service did the Bureau give?  Not one scrap of information could be given.  It leaked out that some number of detective officers had been suspended from their duty, but no word as to whether or not the statement made by Deputy Cosgrave here was true or, if it were true, what action the Government was taking to reassure the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All we have&mdash;and I presume it comes from this Department&mdash;is a reference in <Col N="1824" /> to-day's papers to what, I presume, was a private letter from the High Commissioner in Danzig to President de Valera.  Whether this Bureau had the permission of the writer of that letter to refer to it or whether it was merely given by the recipient of that letter in the hope that it might bring some personal kudos to himself, I do not know, but I do say that we have now two or three days' experience of the operation of this Bureau, and it has failed and failed lamentably and failed criminally in its first function, which would be to give information to the people that would reassure them on one of the most vital points on which they could possibly be informed.  As I said, it was stated here that the police were watching a certain place while arrangements were being made in preparation for a diabolical crime in which a woman and two children were mutilated by certain criminals.  That statement was made last Friday.  There has been a dead silence on the point ever since.  It has been stated that a man named Gilmore was arrested and released.  It has been stated that a caretaker of 44 Parnell Square&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy might relate those arrests to the Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I think so.  I presume that the Bureau of Information is giving information as to the operations of the various Departments of State, and that it was its clear function to give that information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>Could it be its function if the police were making inquiries?  Is not that a matter for the police Department?  How could it possibly be a matter for the Bureau?</P>

      <P>That is not true.  It is like some other statements that were made.  The position with regard to this is that a certain statement was made last Friday by Deputy Cosgrave.  I understood that statement to be that from No. 5 Parnell Square certain detectives or police officers were keeping in view certain other premises in Parnell Square.  Anything that was done in that way was done by the police in the exercise of their duties and in view of any information they might have had. The Deputy went further and stated that he was satisfied that certain mining operations, or something to do with mines were going on there.  He went further and stated that the only mine that was exploded was that exploded in Dundalk on the following day.  This can be the subject of debate at a later stage in this House.  All I am prepared to state to the House or to the people outside at this stage is that the police are satisfied that there is no relation between what happened in Dundalk and anything that took place in Dublin on the previous day.</P>

So far as having competent and reliable officers to carry out the investigation, from information, the source of which I could not disclose in any way, these competent officers are satisfied that there is no relation between Dublin and Dundalk.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as documents are concerned.  I do not understand what the Deputy wants to get at when he asks if it has been investigated by myself personally.  Every document and every report that has come in dealing with these particular matters has been examined by myself personally. Certain conclusions are submitted in those documents from these competent officers, and I have no reason to disagree with those conclusions of those officers who made certain investigations and who are still pursuing their investigations.  The Deputy will appreciate that at such a stage as this it is very difficult for me to go into any details, and I do not think that it would be proper that I should.</P>

      <P>I suggest that if the Leader of the Opposition were acting properly if he had the information which he gave to the House here he would, in the first instance, have put down a private notice question by which it could be properly raised here <Col N="1829" /> and not by a side-wind, in a debate like this, be making political capital out of this serious business.  Instead of bringing it in by a side-wind he could have asked a private notice question, just as he asked another private notice question, and given the Minister notice of it or else, if he had information which would lead to the connection of any individuals with this, he could have given that information to the Minister instead of coming along here and trying to prejudice enquiries which are essential in the matter.  I protest against the question being raised in this way.</P>

      <P>These are peculiar points of order.  I thought a speaker was only supposed to be interrupted on a point of order, yet the President got up and read out a paper.  What I have been trying to point out is that this Bureau, as it has been already in operation for a few days, shows its lamentable uselessness.  People are led to believe that this institution would be a means of getting authoritative information from Government sources, and the only authoritative information it could get since it was set up, as far as I can gather, seems to be a reference to a private letter sent from Danzig to the President. Whether it was published with the permission of the writer or not I do now know.  I suggest that this Department, useless as it clearly is, for giving information in which the public are keenly and rightly interested, will be used for the purpose of adding to the already existing injustices which are operating under this Government. <Col N="1831" /> There has been an argument just now about a matter that took place in Parnell Square.

The Bureau of Information on its negative side is associated with that censorship.  If it were anything, which would be worked impartially, something might be said for it but there is every indication, unfortunately, that we are going to have a tyrannical censorship, a censorship which, as between one Party and another, outrages justice.

      <P>I was not questioning the ruling of the Chair.  I was only talking about the general lack of ordinary good manners on the part of the President.  There is just one other matter to which I wish to refer.  On Thursday last a most immoral and diabolical doctrine was preached by the Minister for Industry and Commerce. He said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The policy of this Party has been approved of by the people and if the <Col N="1833" /> purpose of this Party is to give effect to its policy, then any Party purpose that this institution may be used to effect, in so far as it conforms with the policy the people have approved of, is a good purpose.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That, to my mind, is a most diabolical doctrine.  The argument is that the Fianna Fáil Party went out with a policy, and that they got a majority of votes.  Now, of course we need not go into the fact that the declared reason for the last election was that it was necessary before a settlement of the economic war could be arrived at, that the Government was prevented from enforcing a settlement in the way of a surrender by the British&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>How does the Deputy relate the settlement of the economic war to this Vote?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, sir, I am relating it to the argument that because the people gave a majority of votes to a certain Party, because the people approved of the policy of a certain Party, there has to be a suppression of justice, there has to be a Party tyranny based on the supposition that that Party is supported by the people.  The argument is that any money that the Government expends in promulgating and propaganding what they themselves want to be propaganded, is clearly justified, on the grounds that they got a majority vote at the last election.  I say that is a proposal of Party dictatorship in defiance of all justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The President, the Minister for Industry and Commerce and other Ministers have consistently assumed that nobody in this country has any right whatsoever except the majority. They are assuming now that they have a perfect right to go out and pick the pockets of the unfortunate minority. The minority is waved aside.  The only moral law is that the majority will must prevail.  The majority may want to rob the minority.  &ldquo;These,&rdquo; says President de Valera, &ldquo;are entirely my ethics.&rdquo;&ldquo;That,&rdquo; says the Minister for Industry and Commerce, &ldquo;is the policy of the Government.&rdquo; It seems to me that those statements <Col N="1834" /> and the whole argument of the Minister for Industry and Commerce must not be allowed to pass unchallenged. Governments exist to promote the well-being of all the people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to hear what bearing a speech on political morality or on the ethics of good government has to this Vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This Vote is a direct challenge to political morality.  The Fianna Fáil Party, not satisfied with getting, by a side-wind, a subsidy out of the unfortunate people of America, are now going to impose taxation on the people here for the purpose of misleading those people to their own detriment. That is clear to every intelligent person here from the statements made by Government Ministers.  At the last election the Government wanted to be given a majority so that they could put an end to the economic war.  Since then the President has declared that he thanks God for the economic war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The economic war may not be discussed now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The argument put up by a so-called responsible Minister in this House was that the ethics of this proposal were all right because Fianna Fáil got a majority in the last election and therefore it has the right to seize public funds to be used in the interests of the Party.  That is the argument put up in relation to the Bureau.  I say that that is an immoral argument and should at once be refuted.  This is merely an attempt to rob the Irish people in the interests of a certain organisation.  Does it mean that whatever other Government comes into power it can say: &ldquo;We have a majority.  Our policy is to put money in our own pockets.  The people voted for us and therefore we have a perfect right to do it.&rdquo;  That is the argument submitted by the Minister for Industry and Commerce and I say that that implies a Party dictatorship.  The Government adopting that attitude has not in mind the well-being of the people generally, but rather the people in their own political organisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every action of this Government has <Col N="1835" /> given an indication of that corrupt theory, and that corrupt theory has manifested itself in corrupt practice. Last Thursday a responsible Minister here preached a fundamental doctrine of corruption in justification of this corrupt thing that the President now proposes to do.  I know that Deputy Norton and his henchmen have got up in their usual slavish fashion and they have signified support of this proposal. Presumably they accept the theory of the Minister for Industry and Commerce that Fianna Fáil, having got a majority, have a right to seize public funds in the pursuit of their policy. Deputy Corish, in the interests of his constituents in Wexford, voted to give this Government powers to continue an economic war which is doing so much for the well-being of the people of Wexford. Deputy Corish and the members of his Party are pre-eminently responsible for the existing condition of things.  The present situation could not exist without their support. Apparently that Party now accepts the doctrine that Fianna Fáil, having got their majority, are not only right in pursuing their policy in complete defiance of and in utter disregard for any concern of public good, but they are also right in seizing public funds in order to blind the people as to what is the truth and as to what the real well-being of the country demands.</P>
    <P>Anybody who votes in favour of this proposal is voting in favour of a Party dictatorship.  Time and again we have had the President misrepresenting the situation.  Without even purporting to quote, he has declared that our Party stands for dictatorship.  Every act in his own career has clearly indicated that he is incapable of thinking in any other terms than in terms of dictatorship, and the policy of Party dictatorship was clearly proposed by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>

The late Kevin O'Higgins was murdered and the Deputy now comes in and in order to cover up his dirty act in supporting this proposal he refers to what the late Kevin O'Higgins took very good care should not operate in this country.  Kevin O'Higgins stood always between this country and any attempt at tyranny.  The Labour Party are now trying to use that as a justification for their slavish, crawling support of a corrupt proposal on the part of the present Government.  I do not think there was ever such an immoral proposal made or such an immoral doctrine preached as that put forward by the Minister for Industry and Commerce the other day.  I would not mind it so much except that he submitted it in all naïveté and simplicity.  He seemed to presume that everybody in this country accepted that doctrine, because he is incapable of thinking in any other terms than in terms of Party graft and Party dictatorship.  We are asked to vote here in order to give an additional machine to people who cannot think in any terms other than terms of corruption, Party graft and terms incompatible with any decent conception of public morality.</P>

      <P>I rise on a point of personal explanation, arising out of a remark made by Deputy Norton. Deputy Norton implies that in 1924 I stood to arrange an Army dictatorship. I utterly repudiate that and I will recall to Deputy Norton and to members of the House certain facts.  I would like, first of all, to refer Deputy Norton to the statement of the then leader of the Labour Party in this House on that particular subject.  I will ask Deputy Norton to refer to that and then review his outlook on the whole matter.  The second point I want to emphasise is that I handled the <Col N="1837" /> Army, so far as the State here is concerned, in 1922, 1923 and 1924.  I left the Army in certain circumstances in 1924.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the debate comes to an end I would like to point out that notwithstanding all we have been told there is one thing we have not yet been told.  It is a matter on which we are entitled to a plain statement; that is, whether the opposition to the Vote is opposition to the principle of a Bureau or not. It would be a fair inference from Deputy Mulcahy's speech to-day, for instance, that the Opposition would approve of a Bureau of Information if there were any other Government in power.  The Deputy, however, obviously contemplates this Bureau in present circumstances exuding dope, wrong information, and misrepresentation on every subject that it may touch.  It would be possible I think to have a Bureau that would not act in that way.  It would be possible to have a Government that would not mind telling the truth with regard to the big national questions that affect this country.  What we are concerned <Col N="1838" /> to know is&mdash;would the Opposition oppose the idea of a Bureau in such circumstances as that?</P>
      <P>Usually with regard to Estimates, we treat them as if they related to permanent things, as if the subject of the Estimate were part of the machinery of the State, irrespective of the Party in power.  Not so, however, in the present discussion.  I have heard a great deal of the discussion here and certainly a great deal of it has been based on the assumption that the Bureau will be used by the present Government to misrepresent the position in this country and particularly to misrepresent the opponents of the Government.  I suggest that is a new way of discussing Estimates. If there is a lack of confidence in the Government with regard to this matter, it would seem that that lack of confidence would apply to every Department of the State and would be a good reason for refusing money to any Department.  If the Ministers are prepared to mislead their own people, if they are prepared to mislead foreigners and to tell deliberate lies about the circumstances of this country, surely none of these Ministers is fit to be trusted with the guardianship of any Department.  Would the same criticism not apply to every Estimate brought before this House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think if there is still anybody to speak from the Opposition, we are entitled to know whether they would approve of a Bureau of Information in ordinary circumstances or, if there were not such an immoral Government in power as there is at present, would they agree that such a Bureau could be very useful both to this country, to our friends abroad, and to those interested in the country abroad? Would they agree about the setting up of a Bureau which would tell the truth about the aim of the Government in power and what the policy of that Government was with regard to constitutional questions, with regard to cultural questions, with regard to their line of policy on industrial development and the treatment of leading social questions such as unemployment? Would a Bureau which would tell the truth about these questions <Col N="1839" /> serve a useful purpose?  I think the House is entitled to know&mdash;and it is obvious that we ought to know in voting on this Estimate&mdash;whether the Opposition are prepared to agree to that, or whether their opposition is because the Government in power at present is a Government which not only may but must abuse the power that would be given to it by the approval of this proposal.</P>
    <P>I suggest that if there is any speaker on the Opposition who will attempt to answer that question he will find himself in a peculiar position with regard to his colleagues who have preceded him in the debate.  You could not possibly see any Government acting in so immoral a way as to misrepresent a situation with regard to every Department of life in this country at the present time.  I believe it would have to be admitted by everybody who views it at all in an impartial light that such a Bureau would be of immense advantage to those who were interested in the country, particularly those living abroad.  Even more, I consider that in the case of those living abroad, such, for instance, as the half a million Irish people living in Glasgow, that they are entitled, in view of their attachment to this country and in view of the very great services they have given to this country from time to time, to have information as to the Government's activities and to get it from sources to which they can attach confidence.  It seems entirely right that they should not be left to rely on English and Scotch newspapers to tell them what is happening in this country.  Anybody who has contact with the Irish abroad, in Great Britain or America, must know that one of the first questions you will be asked is what is your Government doing on a particular matter?  You will be asked such questions as, what is the position with regard to unemployment in your country, and have they got rid of the landlords yet, and so on.  It is not right, I suggest, in view particularly of the great services they have rendered to the home country from time to time that they should be encouraged to believe by prejudiced <Col N="1840" /> newspapers abroad that this country is in an anarchic state, or that this country is seething with discontent about unemployment, when that is not the case.</P>
    <P>This debate throughout has, to my mind, been a very sad reflection on the ability of the Dáil to discuss questions of principle apart from personalities. As a matter of fact, there has not been five minutes of the whole debate devoted to the question of the principle of the Bureau.  You have instead a whole list of accusations against different Ministers of the Government and against the Government collectively.  So far as the Estimate is concerned that has left the debate a useless one, giving no help to any Deputy to make up his mind.  So far as I can see for myself, the proposal to establish a Bureau is well justified in any circumstances; it must mean very great benefit to the prestige of this country and react to our advantage as a nation.</P>

      <P>Deputy Moore has put a couple of questions.  Really, though I wish to say that I generally appreciate what Deputy Moore contributes to this House and the spirit also in which he makes his contribution, yet surely he is asking us to do a thing that is completely unreal.  We are not discussing the question of this principle of the Bureau in the abstract.  We are discussing it in a concrete situation. We are not discussing it in reference to the individual who may be appointed as a civil servant as director of this Bureau, about whom I have absolutely nothing to say.  We are discussing it in reference to the political head of the Department, the man who, I presume, so far as this House and this country is concerned, will guide the policy of this particular Bureau.  I suggest in that connection that the most relevant thing we can discuss&mdash;and anything that ignores that and does not take it into account would be almost irrelevant and would certainly ignore the prime factor&mdash;is the President's control of this Bureau; not the use to which it will be put under some person in the abstract of whom we know nothing, but the use to which the President from what we know of him and his Government <Col N="1841" /> would put the Bureau.  That use of this particular Bureau was plainly indicated by Deputy Fitzgerald as described by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  He laid down the general principle that their Party having been chosen by the people of this country, and having got the confidence of the people of this country, were entitled then to help on their Party by any means that would help them on so long as the people put them in power.</P>
      <P>That passage was clearly read out by Deputy Fitzgerald.  It is as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The policy of this Party&rdquo;</P>
      <P>&mdash;that is the Fianna Fáil Party&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;has been approved of by the people, and if the purpose of this Party is to give effect to its policy, then any Party purpose that this institution&rdquo;</P>
      <P>&mdash;namely, the Bureau&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;may be used to effect, in so far as it conforms with the policy the people have approved of, is a good purpose.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that we must take into account&mdash;anything else would be completely unreal in this debate&mdash;the attitude of the President, and, to use a phrase used elsewhere by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, his conception of the truth.  After all he is the political head of this Bureau. It is a portion of his Department.  Does anybody in this House who is not committed wholeheartedly to the President believe, not that the President wants to tell the truth, but that the President can tell the truth or can see the truth.  That has always been my tremendous difficulty with the President. I am not interested now in the question of whether he wishes to put the truth as he may see it before the people.  That is not what I am debating. That question of honesty does not arise.  What does arise is the proved incompetency of the President again and again to grasp the truth.  It is not a moral delinquency that I mean; I am not suggesting that.  It is an intellectual failure on his part to grasp the truth.  Mind you, the man who is going to be at the head of this Information Bureau is the man who got up in this House and said that the <i>Irish Press</i><Col N="1842" /> was not a Party newspaper.  That is his conception of the truth.  I am taking it that that must be the line of policy&mdash;as he is the head of this Department and responsible for the policy of the Department&mdash;which this particular Bureau must follow.  Surely the President has made it quite clear again and again that he is incapable of seeing facts as they are&mdash;that he cannot see what is.  He can prove, we know, anything.  The Bureau I presume will have to do the same.  If the man who is appointed is sufficiently subservient he will have to take his conception of truth&mdash;to use that peculiar phrase from this debate&mdash;from the President.  I have no doubt that at the beginning you will find a man optimistic enough to think that he will be able to give his own conception of truth to the public.  Does anybody, even in that Party, think that he will be able to convince the President if the President happens to disagree with him?  I have asked in this House did anybody ever convince the President of anything.</P>

      <P>I do not think members of the Party have done so either.  The President is capable of seeing any truth he wants to see.  He is capable of proving to his own satisfaction, and I presume the Bureau must do the same, that the people of this country have morally no right to get rid of his Heaven-sent guidance; that even constitutionally they would have no right to get rid of it; and that any steps he will take to prove to them that even constitutionally they have no right to get rid of his guidance will be correct.  I suggest to Deputy Moore that the whole question hinges about the extraordinary conception of propaganda which the President has, about his conception of any other point of view, about his conception of indentification of the country, not of himself with the country, but of the country with himself, because after all remember you are dealing with a man&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;who, as head of this Bureau does not need to go to the country for the facts.  He can find them like other people in other countries have found them, by looking into his own heart.  That is sufficient. The Bureau will have to follow his conception of the truth, and that is the kind of dope which the country is bound to get; not merely may get, but, to use Deputy Moore's change from the word &ldquo;may,&rdquo; must get, and cannot avoid getting with the present Government in power, and with the President at the head of this propaganda Bureau.  It is precisely on our full knowledge of the propagandist powers and the propagandist mind of the Government and of the President that our main objection to this particular Vote lies.  I do not think that the House can afford for a moment to let that out of sight.  I can assure Deputy Moore that when discussing estimates it is not at all a question of discussing the Civil Service.  It is a question of discussing the policy of the political head.  That is generally what is debated when the general debate on the Estimate is on.  I suggest to him that we are following that precedent here in discussing the attitude of the President to propaganda, the confessed attitude that that is a Party Government that is sitting there; that it can utilise this particular office, and apparently the funds that will subsidise this particular office, for Party purposes, and that it feels perfectly entitled to do so.  We have had instances; I am not going into any detail in those things, but we have had instances as to their line towards those who critise them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Leaving aside now the question as to whether the Attorney-General had any right to do, or whether he was doing out of the goodness of his heart&mdash;we will suppose that he was doing it out of goodness of heart&mdash;what he did in connection with that newspaper, I should like to ask him and ask the House to look at the passages that he excised, and to judge from them what is the Government's attitude towards criticism.  I am not now dealing with whether or not he had a right to do <Col N="1844" /> what he did.  I am dealing with the attitude of mind even towards criticism. The suppressing of your opponents views ought to require more justification than the particular Government dope that is likely to be put out in the interests of the President.  We know they cannot stand any criticism of any kind.  Does anybody, or does the Party that is supporting this particular Vote, really believe that the truth is going to the people from this?  Is there the slightest chance that anything except the ordinary Party dope will go to them?  Will it be anything except an officially acknowledged type of propaganda such as we get from the paper that the President has described as a non-Party organ?  We have again and again here in this House tried to get various information from the President. He has made statements here and through the country.  Most of the people have been surprised to learn, sometimes months, sometimes years afterwards, that his statements meant the opposite to what they thought they meant.  Is that the truth we are going to get from this particular Bureau of which the President is the political head?  It might, I admit to Deputy Moore&mdash;unfortunately not &ldquo;must&rdquo; on this occasion&mdash;give useful information to the country.  It might, for instance, tell the country where all the industries are.  That would be most useful. Again and again in this House&mdash;and Deputy Moore referred to industries&mdash; every effort has been made to get information on that point.  Is there any reason why the information should not have been given and given effectively by the Minister for Industry and Commerce? Surely not.  Will this Bureau give the information which the Minister for Industry and Commerce refuses to give?  Can it give the information the Minister refuses to give?  Here is a matter on which not merely the people in this Party but, I can assure the Deputy, the people in his own, Party, his own supporters, really do want information.  I know, as I have said before, a Fianna Fáil Club in Kerry which cannot see the industries in its own native county and which suggests that there is a boycott there.  Numbers of industries may be there, but <Col N="1845" /> they cannot be seen by that particular Fianna Fáil Club in Tralee.  Will the Bureau give the information which the Minister for Industry and Commerce so determinedly refuses to give to this House?</P>
    <P>I suggest that the most relevant thing in this debate is the proved inability of the President to put a plain, objective statement on anything in which he is interested before the people, and that, for that reason, this House ought not to consent to vote the money for the setting up of this particular Bureau.  As I say, we know too well the propagandist activities, the propagandist spirit, the propagandist ability, if you like, of the Fianna Fáil Party and of the Fianna Fáil leaders.  You need only read the speeches of the Ministers, any time you like, from that bench opposite. They are not dealing with the subject under discussion but are very often merely statements of propaganda and misrepresentation of their opponents. They have shown themselves always, in office and out of office, past masters so far as that is concerned.  I suggest that that is the most relevant fact this House should bear in mind in the setting up of this particular Bureau, and it is because we know the spirit that is bound to, that must, if we use Deputy Moore's phrase, animate and inspire this Bureau that we oppose it. On the question of the individual, as I said at the beginning, I have no doubt that an individual might be optimistic enough to think that he will be able to give out the truth as he conceives it to the public, but how any self-respecting man will be able to stay in the position after the experience of, say, six months, I should be interested to see.  Any such man who is not prepared to accept for the President, so far as this country is concerned what is called in reference to the Russian people the Messianic complex must certainly be an extraordinary optimist or extremely subservient, so far as the President is concerned.</P>
    <P>I can understand any man being sufficiently optimistic at the outset to take up this particular work, but I am not interested in that particular side <Col N="1846" /> of the matter.  I am not interested in the individual who is taking over this Bureau; I am interested in the Minister responsible for this particular Department, and I object to the Vote because we have to do with this Government, with its known characteristics, a Government that boasts that it is a Party Government &mdash;as is acknowledged by the man who, I may say even to the President is his best propagandist, the Minister for Industry and Commerce&mdash;which is not fit to be trusted with this power any more than it is fit to be trusted with many of the powers to which Deputy Moore referred.  That really is the gist of my opposition to this.  It is because I do not think that this sub-Department is capable of being used for anything but&mdash;that is putting it a little too strongly because it may be used occasionally for disseminating truth; if we could be sure that all it said was false, we might be able to arrive at the truth, but very often, I have no doubt, it will tell the truth but I am equally convinced that very often it will dole out and will be bound so long as the President is in control of it to dole out propaganda which is Party propaganda or will appear so to the great bulk of the people&mdash;Party propaganda in the narrow sense of the word.  Many people on this side who oppose it know perfectly well what the Government propaganda is worth so far as truth is concerned.  I suggest that it is because the people of this country&mdash;and very quickly, mind you, because it is not so long since the President got into power&mdash;are finding out what both the negative and the positive propaganda of the Government is worth, that this Bureau is called into existence.  It is because the people are finding out that both the attacks of the Government, in the way of propaganda, on their opponents and also, the promises they made, are so much worthless propaganda that this particular sub-Department is called into existence.</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>When we listen for a little while to Deputy O'Sullivan, one can clearly understand what is the whole trouble with the Opposition. The whole trouble is that a Government <Col N="1847" /> other than themselves happens to be in power and that nothing can be trusted to us to be done properly and that the only people who can do anything properly, justly and fairly are themselves.  There is a difference of opinion about that and that difference of opinion was pretty well settled by the country in two different elections and so far as the Deputies on the opposite side are concerned, they will have to put up for another three, four or five years, anyhow, with having a Government such as we have to-day. This Government came into office with a certain programme.  That programme was endorsed by the electorate and we have no apology whatever to make to anybody for pursuing that particular policy.  This debate, however, ranged over Government policy and the speakers on the opposite side were very hard put to it indeed to find an excuse for dealing with the debate in the manner in which they dealt with it.  All sorts of excuses that anybody could see through were put forward for introducing all sorts of irrelevant matters.  It was impossible for the Chair to prevent that from happening, because no sooner was a Deputy held up on one particular point than he immediately got some other excuse for proceeding on another point and he had got half way through it before the Chair or anybody else could see whether there was any relevancy in it or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Sullivan's effort, however, was a masterpiece.  It is because of the personality of the person who is to be in charge of this Bureau that there is objection.  It is not a question of a Department of State being put up or the merits of a certain policy in general but it is the merits of that particular Department because it happens to be directed by somebody to whom Deputies on the opposite side object. Deputy Moore asked that somebody on the opposite benches would speak to this as a matter of principle. One Deputy did and only one&mdash;Deputy MacDermot.  He said that, quite irrespective of the Government in power or of any views he might hold or that any other members with whom he was associated might hold with <Col N="1848" /> regard to the Government, he would oppose it in any case.  That is a point of view that one can understand&mdash;I can, at least.  I am quite willing to admit straight off that it is a department that can very well be abused. But so could practically every other Department of State be abused if you have people in office who are corrupt enough to abuse it.  There is scarcely a single department from which information is not being given out in one way or another to the public which, if inaccurate, could mislead the public. There is hardly a Department of State which, in one way or another, if abused, could not be used for what might be called narrow Party propaganda.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture has officers in different parts of the country representing the Department.  They have to do their best to have the policy of the Department put into operation. They have to appeal to the farmers and others to grow wheat and do a number of other things.  There is no doubt that all those, if they were to be improperly used, could be used for very narrow Party purposes.  All I can say to Deputy MacDermot is that when he objects to this particular Department on principle, because it can be abused by people who are corrupt enough and who are dishonset enough to abuse it, he has no remedy as long as there are dishonest or lying people in existence and as long as such people can by any possible means come to be a Government.</P>
    <P>Listening to Deputies on the opposite benches one would imagine that this was something unique; something that did not exist in any other country; something that was the conception of Fianna Fáil; that it could not possible exist in any other part of the world except such parts as might happen, like here, to have, as they suggest, a corrupt Government.  The fact is that there is scarcely a country in the world that has not such a Department.  I have a long list here. It does not purport to be in any way completely exhaustive.  In that list I find the United States of America to start with.  The United States has a section in the Department of State for <Col N="1849" /> the supply of current information.  The Department of Agriculture has also a special section for publicity.  Then we have Great Britain.  In Great Britain it is not definitely a Department of Publicity but there are Press officers attached to the Foreign Office and the Treasury and to the India Office.  In Germany there is a specific Department of State under a Minister known as the Department of Educational Propaganda and that is probably one of the most active Departments of its kind in the world.  In France there is an Information and Press Section attached to the Department of External Affairs.  Japan has an Information Bureau in its Department of External Affairs.  That exhausts the larger countries.</P>
    <P>Now let us come to the relatively smaller ones.  In the Argentine there is a Section in the Department of External Affairs called the Information Bureau.  In Austria there is a special Commission known as the Federal Propaganda Commission.  In Bulgaria there is a Press director in the Department of External Affairs.  In Denmark there is a Press Bureau in the Department of External Affairs.  In Finland there is a Press Section in the Department of External Affairs.  In Greece there is a Press director in the Department of External Affairs.  In Latvia there is a Press Section in the Department of External Affairs.  In Persia there is a Press Information Section in its Department of External Affairs.  In Czecho-Slovakia there is a Section in its Department of External Affairs for the distribution of political and economic information.  In Turkey there is a Press Information Bureau attached to the Department of External Affairs.  As I have indicated, this list is not exhaustive, but shows that this idea of a Bureau of Information if established here will not be unique and that it supplies a want which has been felt in practically every country in the world.</P>
    <P>There might be some excuse for Deputies opposite talking as they did if they were ignorant of that, but they are not.  I listened to the long speech of Deputy Fitzgerald which suggested <Col N="1850" /> indignation.  It would be interesting to hear what that Deputy said when Minister for External Affairs when he introduced a Vote for a much larger amount for the same purpose that we are introducing it here.  It was not in a period of war.  It was in 1924 when there was peace.  Let us see what that Deputy said who simulated all this indignation and who tried to attribute to me things that he knew could be done with it, because he had done them.  I have a file here which shows how he misused it.  If I were to read through the file, or extracts from it, Deputies would understand that what the Deputy was doing was suggesting to me things which he was capable of and did himself.</P>

      <P>I propose to read what Deputy Fitzgerald, when Minister for External Affairs, said about this particular Department which was in existence at the time.  I shall have to weary the House with it because, in order to contrast the speech which we have listened to this afternoon and the speech on Friday last with this, Deputies should hear the whole of it.</P>
      <P>He said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The Publicity Department has decreased its expenditure by, roughly, one-half.  This work falls into two classes.  One activity of it might be described as a Public Record Office.  It is necessary for this Government, as for every other Government, to be informed as to what is happening in the world, what is being stated in the Press of the world, and in other periodical publications; and for that reason, instead of each Department in the <Col N="1852" /> Government having such a Record Office it is found more efficient and more economical to concentrate that matter in one office.  The work there, then, is to note the Press and other publications of various countries in the world, and to call the attention of each Ministry to such information as may be likely to interest them, and to keep a record and to keep files of any cases of important publications, and to keep a general record of all such matters as may either now or at any time in the future be required to be referred to.  Apart from that we require to have some machinery for conveying information or for rectifying misinformation.  It must be remembered that practically every country does this; and most countries are much better situated for doing it than we are.  To begin with, we are a new country and an unknown quantity in the world. Ireland is not only an unknown quantity in a neutral form, but in a negative form.  We have a definitely anti-Irish Press, particularly in the greatest news distribution centre in the world, namely, London; and we have recognised the fact that for the sake of our commercial relations, and for the sake of our general good name in the world, we do require not to be misled.  Every country has such a Department, but other countries have an advantage that we have not got, and it is this; that the Press of other countries is usually supplied with a certain number of representatives in foreign countries; and the usual system is that the foreign representatives of newspapers who are away from their own country usually get in touch with the political representation in that country, and those journalists act as a channel for information and for correct information concerning their own country in the foreign countries in which they are living.  Our Irish Press does not indulge in such a foreign news service.  I think it has to be generally recognised that our Irish Press depends almost to an exclusive degree upon the London News Agencies.  Therefore it is <Col N="1853" /> necessary to maintain this Department, for some time to come at any rate.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In the early days of our existence this Department had another activity, namely, what you may call pro-State propaganda in this country.  That was a very difficult situation to be faced with, because there was always the question as to whether the information which we put out could be considered as pro-State, or whether it might not be regarded as pro any one shade of opinion in the country. As far as I was concerned, I endeavoured, when we were doing such work, to confine the activities of that Department to the narrowest limits of pro-State propaganda; but I admit that there was very often considerable doubt as to where the pro-State began or ended and where the pro-Party began.  Apart from that there are certain forms of advertisement which every Government has to indulge in.  For instance, during the last year we had to advertise the National Loan.  The publicity work of that was done by this Department. We had also to conduct a certain amount of publicity work for recruitment for the Army.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have given the whole of the statement with reference to the Publicity Department, and Deputies will find it in columns 799-800, Vol. 8 of the Debates.  Anybody who has listened to that statement must find it difficult to understand the statement made just recently and that made on Friday by Deputy Fitzgerald.  As I say, he knew that in every country of the world there is such a Department and he knew full well how necessary such a Department was.  It was peace time at that time. The need for the early pro-State propaganda that was referred to apparently had disappeared.  With that knowledge he comes here and tries, I suggest, to mislead not merely the members of the House, but the public as to the situation.  This Department is a necessary Department.  Every word that was used by Deputy Fitzgerald when he was Minister with reference to the need of it I subscribe to and say it is a fact from my experience.  This nation of ours is being assailed at the <Col N="1854" /> present time from outside and we are trying, in the face of outside attack to change our whole economic life.  To do that, without the nation suffering more than is absolutely necessary, we require the co-operation of our people.  We require that they should understand why certain things are done and that they should get the fullest possible information about the activities of the various Departments in order to save them from being misled by such misrepresentation of these activities as is constantly being put before them.</P>
    <P>I am not going to go into the side issues that have been raised in this debate.  I feel that if I did I would be as guilty as those who abused the privileges of the House by raising these matters in the manner in which they did.  Every one of those points can be met in their appropriate place.  There , however, I think in all fairness one thing to which I should refer and that is another statement made by Deputy Fitzgerald.  He suggested in that  of his of just giving half-truths, that in establishing this Department I was continuing something I had in mind back a long period and that I was about to bring into the office some agent or other who had served my purpose in the past.  He read an extract from a letter which appears in this paper presented to Dáil Eireann entitled: &ldquo;Correspondence from Eamon de Valera and others.&rdquo; He quoted this paragraph of a letter dated 7th September. I admit I wrote it.</P>
    <P>The letter says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I would like to see Seán O'Keeffe for a Press interview.  If you get in touch with him I will see how it can be arranged.  Ask him to send me along leading questions.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There was some suggestion in Deputy Fitzgerald's remarks that this journalist who was referred to here was somehow an agent of propaganda for me.  The director of that Bureau, Mr. Seán O'Keeffe, is a journalist who is known throughout this country and far beyond it.  There is nobody in that profession who will deny for a moment that he is a journalist of ability and repute, and he has never at any time lent himself to anything which would <Col N="1855" /> bring discredit either upon himself or upon the country.  As a journalist at the time, like many other journalists, he tried, on the inspiration of the newspaper for which he was correspondent, to get an interview from me.  The newspaper in question was the <i>Manchester Evening News.</i>  I have here the interview and I am willing that both he and I should be judged on that interview and I am prepared to put it in comparison with anything that emanated from the Department when it was controlled by Deputy Fitzgerald.  I think that it is only right, when there have been suggestions of misuse of that Department attributed in advance to us, that I should read this interview.</P>

      <P>I think Deputy MacDermot should confine himself to standing over his own views.  I will say to him that it is a very dangerous thing to stand over anything Deputy Fitzgerald may suggest.  As regards the expression &ldquo;leading questions,&rdquo; everybody who has been interviewed by Press representatives will understand what it means.  I am sure members on the opposite Benches have been interviewed many a time. These newspaper representatives come to them wishing to get information on certain points and views on certain points and there are leading questions.  In fact, the words were in quotation marks and leading questions meant questions suggesting particular topics and, if you like, even the answers to these particular topics might come along.  This is the interview in question&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important that Deputies should remember the time. It was the 7th September, just before the Provisional Parliament met in <Col N="1857" /> 1922.  The following is the text of the interview:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I asked if he could see any way out through a revision of the proposed Free State Constitution.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I still maintain,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;that the straight, bold course is the best.  Those who try to be too clever end in over-reaching themselves. If you want to arrive at a constitution satisfactory to Irishmen, you must strain the Treaty out of the plain meaning of the terms. If the Treaty is so unsatisfactory that it must be strained, then go honestly about it and get a revision of the Treaty.  It is the best for Ireland, and it is the best for England.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;But if England persists, under threat of war, in holding us to the Treaty, and if the majority of the Irish people choose to accept the Treaty rather than the alternative&mdash; war?</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If that should prove true, then I can only say that, in my opinion, both Ireland and England are making a terrible mistake and will suffer for it.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;For Ireland, the Treaty will mean violent political agitation and turmoil in one form or another for many years to come.  Agitation that will make progress in a cultural or spiritual direction impossible, and progress in a material way more impossible.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;For England, it will mean a continuance of those impossible relations which resulted in the war of the last few years.  An arrangement dictated under threat of war can never be the basis of anything but suspicion and distrust between the two nations, and an everlasting jockeying and intrigue&mdash;one against the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Last December was the time to put the relations between the two countries on a stable basis.  The opportunity was lost then.  It is incomparably more difficult to secure that basis now, but it is not impossible if men of goodwill will set themselves to the task.  For England a treaty entered into by Irishmen <Col N="1858" /> with goodwill would be of more value and give her more real security than all the guarantees she may be able to extract from an unwilling people by force.  For Ireland it would mean internal peace and an opportunity to get on with the work of national regeneration and national reconstruction, for which all the best in Ireland is yearning.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The trouble has been that in the last Dáil there was little attempt to discuss the Treaty on its merits as an effort of statesmanship, or to calculate its bearings on the future. Side issues of a personal and Party character were introduced to obscure the main consideration.  The best case made for the Treaty, from the statesman's standpoint, was that made in the letter which General Smuts wrote to me, as President, about a year ago.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If anything could have converted me to acceptance of the Treaty, that letter would.  Without hesitation, a united Cabinet, however, rejected his recommendations.  The change that took place in the minds of some members of the Cabinet between August and December can be judged from this fact alone.  For Mr. Griffith, as for me, the securing of a united Ireland&mdash;a single State&mdash;was of first importance.  To follow the lines suggested by General Smuts meant that we should first abandon our own proved impregnable position and face the certainty of disruption in our hitherto solid ranks, without any reasonable hope that the objective for which the risks were taken would be reached. Unfortunately Mr. Griffith was later led away by the chimera of the Boundary Commission which he had hoped would take Fermanagh, Tyrone and other areas from the Northern territory and so bring partition to end later, automatically.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;What might have been anticipated happened however.  (This is the 1st September, 1922).  At the first protest from Ulster the English politicians ran away from their pledges given in private and betrayed the Nationalist Irishmen <Col N="1859" /> that trusted them.  These were too much committed by their previous action and could no longer make an effective resistance to the betrayal.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Ulster question is an Irish domestic question and must be settled in Ireland by the representatives of the people concerned.  The problem is so to fix the framework of the relations between Ireland as a whole and England as to provide for the desired settlement between the north and the south being effected within it.  To satisfy the sentiment of the south the sovereignty of the nation as a whole must be safe-guarded. To satisfy the sentiment of the north, at the moment, some connection with the British Empire has to be provided for.  It happens that the condition imposed by the latter largely meets the material demands of the English as well.  The proposal for External Association was, therefore, not a personal whim, but is the solution rigidly imposed by the fundamental political facts, at the moment, unless force or coercion is to be used against the north or against the south.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Treaty means the coercion of the south and the coercion of a large part of the north&mdash;both.  The propertied classes, the manufacturers, the traders, if they were wise, would have opposed this peace by coercion for their interests suffer by the instability of any such dictated peace.  The war on the south has wasted, in a futile attempt to destroy an aspiration that has outlasted the attempts of seven centuries, money and wealth that would have provided for the social and economic needs of all sections of the community, and made the people prosperous and happy.  No one gains by this war&mdash;all lose by it.  If the millions spent in the European War had been devoted to provide for the social wants&mdash;what a different world we would have to-day.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This was the interview that was supposed to paint me as a vile propagandist and was supposed to paint the officer who is appointed as director of that Bureau as capable of this vile <Col N="1860" /> propaganda.  This was published in England.  I have read it at length for the House because it does show that whenever there was a question between this country and Britain and my views at any rate were asked upon it, I did my best to inform the public who were to read it what were the principal facts of the situation.</P>

      <P>Talk about a wall of glass!  It proved again what my attitude was, namely, that I could not prevent this thing which at this particular time I indicated was the danger.  However, I am not going to go into that.  I am not going to get back into any further discussion of the past.  I simply gave this.  I am willing to be judged on it, on this terrible piece of propaganda that was suggested as showing my powers as a propagandist by Deputy Fitzgerald. In principle then I disagree with Deputy MacDermot.  I think my experience is that it is an essential part of State machinery, essential at the present time when we want the public to know the truth, to know the facts, and when we want the public to co-operate with us.  This so-called immoral doctrine that has been suggested was used by Deputy Lemass is a statement of fact&mdash;that an Executive has been chosen by the people to lead them in a certain work and in order that the people may understand that they are being led in that particular work of reconstruction, they want to be able to co-operate by having the facts put to them.  Every Department needs it and this Department, therefore, can with more economy as Deputy Fitzgerald says now that it has been centralised, secure this information so that it can be available for those who seek it and for the people as a whole.  There is another matter to which I should refer. On every occasion the members on the opposite side tried to damage as much <Col N="1861" /> as they can the <i>Irish Press.</i>  We know why.  There is one suggestion which was made, and which is a false suggestion. I do not want to call it any stronger name.  That is that the <i>Irish Press</i> has been subsidised by State moneys.  That is a falsehood.</P>

      <P>None so blind as those who do not want to see.  The capital of the <i>Irish Press</i> was subscribed by this country&mdash;10,000 shareholders in it&mdash;and by friends of Ireland in the United States.  It is they who subscribed the capital.  If the people who subscribed the money in the United States, and got <i>Irish Press</i> bonds for it, care to use those bonds or did care to use those bonds to subsidise the <i>Irish Press</i>, that is their business.  That is their subsidising, and not the subsidising of the State, no matter how some people may twist it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>It has nothing to do with the State.  The State owed that money to those American citizens. They subscribed that money and it was their money that went into the <i>Irish Press</i> and not any State money.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>It was their deliberate will to put it into the <i>Irish Press</i>, and I say again that it is a deliberate falsehood, worthy of those who make it, to suggest that the <i>Irish Press</i> is subsidised from State funds. Still more contemptible is the original suggestion that I was subsidising myself, and putting State moneys into my pocket.  I want every Deputy here and I want the country to realise what the real situation is.  The capital of the <i>Irish Press</i> was subscribed by Irish people in cash and by American <Col N="1862" /> people partly in cash and partly in the bonds which they assigned for that purpose.  It is their money then that is in the <i>Irish Press</i> and to suggest that this State is subsidising the <i>Irish Press</i> is just as untrue as it would have been to say that the United States Government was subsidising us when those same American citizens, when I was over there in 1919 and 1921, made available for our fight here American liberty bonds.  I got American liberty bonds from American citizens.  The capital values of them were redeemed by the Treasury of the United States.  Could it be said that the Treasury of the United States was subsidising us?  It was a friendly Government to England.  Could it be said that because I got American liberty bonds from American citizens the American Treasury was subsidising us?  Of course the American Treasury did not subsidise us.  Individual American citizens put their bonds to the purpose they were entitled to put them to.  They gave me those bonds and it would be as wrong for this State&mdash;more wrong for this State &mdash;to refuse to pay the moneys on those bonds to the <i>Irish Press</i>, when they had been assigned for that purpose, as it would have been for the United States Treasury to refuse to give the money on those bonds to me as trustee at that time, simply because I was doing something which, perhaps, the American Government did not want in any way to be associated with.  I say, therefore, that there is no subsidising of the <i>Irish Press.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the <i>Irish Press</i> being a Party organ there is the usual quibble. What I said was that it was not a Party organ in the sense that it was not under a Party or capable of being controlled by a Party.  The <i>Irish Press</i> is a newspaper owned by the subscribers&mdash;owned by the shareholders. I was, when I was a member of the directorate, Controlling Director of Policy.  That was one of the articles of association.  But the Party as a Party could not control it, and there is no control of that paper by the Party. It was founded with a definite policy and a definite purpose, and it has been constant to that policy and to that <Col N="1863" /> purpose.  I know that the Deputies on the opposite benches dislike that very much, but they will have to put up with it.  There is nothing else I feel called upon to comment upon. The question of the annuities was brought in, and there was a suggestion that I would put forward our view with regard to the annuities.  The members of the opposite benches when they were a Government used State moneys to give their side of the case&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="A Deputy A Deputy">
      <NameTxt>A Deputy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and it was an imperfect statement of it.  I have not got a copy, so I can only venture to give my recollection of the words.  So incomplete was it that the very basis of the British claims was dismissed. First of all the fundamental document was not referred to.  It was not published, and when Mr. Thomas referred to it as the fundamental document was the first time we got it as a whole.  We had to go and search for it in the Departments.  He said&mdash;I am not giving the exact words, but only their meaning as well as I can recollect it&mdash; that this particular original statement was confirmed by documents some time later.  That second document was referred to.  It was referred to in this particular pamphlet which was brought out.  It was sent out at State expense. Lawyers were fed at State expense to give the case.  This confirmatory document was dismissed by saying that it had practically nothing to do with it &mdash;that it had reference to another much smaller and simpler matter, namely the question of income tax.  It is from people who know that such a department existed, from people who have abused it, as I have said, and from people who have used it to give this particular thing here with regard to the annuities, that we have objections raised to our having this Department. I suggest that their own knowledge of how they abused it in their own time is the prime moving purpose in their objections now.  That may be valid. It may be valid in the sense that the fact that they did misuse it proves at any rate that it can be misused.  I <Col N="1864" /> have admitted that.  As I have said, so can practically every other Department of State, if there are people there who have the will and the dishonesty to abuse it.  As a necessary department, just as other departments are necessary, I recommend it to you.</P>
      <P>Those are the actual words in which the second document was referred to: &ldquo;Those clauses accordingly&rdquo; that is the ones having reference to the annuities, &ldquo;represent nothing more than a statement of the dispute as to the right to make income tax deductions.&rdquo; There is somewhere else this other phrase that I have referred to &mdash;that it has nothing whatever to do with it.</P>

      <P>I am rising only for a moment.  A reference was made by Deputy Fitzgerald to the past relations of the President and Mr. O'Keeffe as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;On 7th September, 1922, the President wrote: &lsquo;I would like to see S. O'Keeffe for a Press interview.  If you get in touch with him I will see how it can be arranged.  Ask him to send me along leading questions.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Then, Deputy Fitzgerald comments:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It looks as if the unfortunate people of this country are being asked now to give some unnamed amount&mdash;but more than £1,000 a year &mdash;to provide the President with somebody near-by whom he can have to ask him leading questions all the time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In view of what Deputy Fitzgerald's remark amounted to, I put it to the House whether the reading aloud of that long interview is not something of a character that debars the President from accusing anybody else of misusing the privileges of this House.  He made a statement a moment ago on the subject of the <i>Irish Press.</i>  I am a steady reader of the <i>Irish Press.</i></P>

      <P>As a matter of fact, I always find that reading a newspaper of opposite political opinions to one's own serves better than anything else to confirm one's own political opinions.  I listened, however, with astonishment to the President's statement that that organ is absolutely independent as regards its conduct of policy because if that be so, it appears to me a most extraordinary coincidence <Col N="1866" /> that never once have I seen in its columns the slightest reflection on the wisdom of the Fianna Fáil Government in anything, great or small, since it came into office.  It appears to me that if a newspaper has swallowed as completely as that newspaper has done, the doctrine of the infallibility of a particular Government on all occasions, it is a misuse of words to call it an independent organ of opinion.</P>
      <P>The interview which the President read to us was interesting, and, from a purely selfish and personal point of view, I am not sorry to have heard it. It gives me the opportunity of making this remark to him.  Great objections can be urged, both from the Irish point of view and from the English point of view, to the Treaty and could have been urged at the time but I suggest to him that whatever objections there were to the Treaty fade into insignificance beside the objections there were to proceeding with his plan of seeking something called &ldquo;external association.&rdquo;  I suggest to him that the notion adumbrated in that interview, that external association was something which would have satisfied the sentiment of Northern Ireland, is utterly absurd and that there was no hope whatever of settling Irish affairs on the basis of that idea of external association at that time.  I dare say many of us had alternatives in our minds as preferable to the Treaty.  I myself had.  I would have much preferred to see a system inaugurated of Dominion Home Rule here in Ireland for a period of years, with the understanding that after that period had expired, we should have a free vote on whether we should stay in the Commonwealth or go out of it.</P>

    <P>What, however, is the good of going into all these old matters now?  I suggest to him that a very useful thing which the new Press Bureau might do for him would be to keep him thoroughly informed as to what is taking place in South Africa.  He mentioned the name of General Smuts, and it is worth while recording how completely General Smuts's policy in his own country has been justified by <Col N="1867" /> events and how General Hertzog, who, a few years ago, corresponded to President de Valera, has now come round to General Smuts's point of view, and how Mr. Malan, who, perhaps, might be said to correspond to Mr. George Gilmore or some other extreme Republican leader, has also come round nine-tenths of the way, and how the affairs of South Africa are now in a happier state on the constitutional side than they have been since the Boer War. For heaven's sake, let the Press Bureau inform the President and the country about things like that, that have a real lesson for ourselves.  Instead of running after will o' the wisps, let the Press Bureau induce the President's followers to grasp the fact that it is the reality of independence that matters.</P>

    <P>Pending the introduction of a special Bill to implement the undertaking given to the authorities of University College, Dublin, on behalf of the Executive Council in 1931, and subsequently confirmed by the present Government, the purpose of this Supplementary Estimate is to enable recoupment to be made to the University College of the extra outlay incurred by the college in 1931-32 and 1932-33 by reason of the expansion which has already taken place in the Department of Modern Irish Language and Literature.  The total sum of £2,338 consists of two sums of £625 in respect of the year 1932-33 and a sum of £1,713 in respect of the year 1933-34. <Col N="1873" /> As already indicated, this is a temporary provision made to cover these two years.

      <P>I am not going to discuss whether there has or has not been an improvement in American conditions but at any rate there is no doubt that the falling off in remittances <Col N="1876" /> is entirely due to the financial crisis which arose there early in 1933 and the full effects of which have not yet been removed or relieved.  Accordingly it is felt that some additional relief should be provided to meet the requirements of these special districts to which I have adverted.  Other moneys which had been earmarked for the completion of certain relief works and on the basis of the allocation of which certain works were begun, were utilised to relieve this exceptional passing distress.  In view of that, it has been necessary to submit this additional estimate of £50,000 to allow constructional works which were in hands in December last to be carried through to completion.</P>

      <P>I hope this estimate will be passed with the unanimous support of the House.  I feel that no matter what Government may be in power, for many years to come it will find it necessary to provide relief for many thousands of unemployed.  The number of unemployed is increasing rapidly although the Parliamentary Secretary stated here recently that there had been a progressive decrease. Either the Parliamentary Secretary is not right or the Government Department which issues statistics is wrong. The very week in which the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance suggested that employment was showing a progressive increase, the <i>Irish Press</i>, the <i>Independent</i>, the <i>Cork Examiner</i> and the other daily papers of the country published figures supplied to them by the Department for Industry and Commerce, all going to show that unemployment was increasing and employment was decreasing in this country. The Parliamentary Secretary can easily refer to these figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one matter that has been represented to me in Cork City to which I would like to refer.  I have been told that unfair discrimination has been exercised against ex-National Army men and ex-British service men. These charges have been made and frequently I have investigated them. In many cases I found that the charges were well-founded and in other <Col N="1877" /> cases I found that the individuals were enjoying small pensions.  I do not want to raise any big issue with regard to the persons enjoying pensions, but it does appear to me to be rather unfair to deprive a man of employment at Christmas time or any other period when public moneys are provided to give work to the unemployed simply because he has a small pension.  It is unfair that a pension of 6/- or 8/- a week should be taken into consideration, especially where the individual looking for employment has a wife and five or six children dependent upon him.</P>
    <P>I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to clear the air, to let us have a definite denial or an acceptance of that statement.  I thoroughly understand the difficulty that presents itself to the Department.  I quite appreciate that where there may be employment for 12,000 persons you will have 60,000 applicants.  When you have 60,000 applicants for 30,000 jobs the 30,000 who do not get work are bound to be disappointed and I understand that aspect of the matter fully.  But these complaints have been made to me and I submit to the Parliamentary Secretary that when relief schemes are being put into operation he should see that no undue discrimination is exercised because a man happens to be an ex-National Army man or an ex-British service man.  These people, after all, are our own kith and kin; they are Irish.  They have not been given the equal treatment to which they are entitled.</P>

      <P>This Vote is an ironic commentary on the speeches made here last week by the Minister for Finance and Deputy Hugo Flinn. If one had taken those speeches <Col N="1878" /> seriously one would have expected that far from having a Supplementary Estimate for the relief of unemployment and distress, we would have savings on those already voted, such was the picture of prosperity that both the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary painted for this country.</P>
      <P>I wish to make a few remarks on the point raised by Deputy Anthony with regard to discrimination in the matter of employment and the taking into account of political affiliations in the distribution of relief.  I spend part of my time assuring my constituents that such discrimination does not exist, but I regret to say that my assurances are received with incredulity.  I am willing to believe the statements made here over and over again by representatives of the Government, that they, at any rate, do not wish such discrimination to take place; but I would like to mention one particular matter.</P>
      <P>In a question to-day I elicited the fact that there was a discrepancy between the Government Front Bench and one, at any rate, of their backbenchers&mdash;and I do not imagine it was confined to one&mdash;with regard to the policy to be followed in the matter of recruiting for the new defence force. I suggest there is a similar discrepancy in this matter of allowing political affiliations to count when giving relief. It is deliberately disseminated among the people by the Fianna Fáil clubs throughout the country that the people will not get a fair crack of the whip as regards a chance of relief of one kind or another except by joining a Fianna Fáil Club.  I do not think anyone familiar with the affairs in the country can deny that.  That impression is being deliberately created.  I hope the impression is unfounded, but I am afraid I cannot honestly say any longer that I think it is unfounded. I urge that the Government should endeavour to make it unfounded, as they can do; if they take the trouble to discourage that kind of propaganda by their own Party, they will be doing something to raise the tone of public life.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>No, and I say it quite frankly, because I have never been given sufficient facts, sufficient detailed facts, to present to the Department. When it comes to the point, the complainant always seems to feel that he is prejudicing his own position in the future by going further with it and possibly that he is running into some danger with the people surrounding him.  I put it to the Parliamentary Secretary that he cannot sweep away the whole case by saying there is an absence of specific instances submitted to the Department.  That might be true if there were only just vague, occasional accusations, but there are much more than that.  The number of instances where these complaints are made is so large and widespread that the effect is cumulative and, while my object is not to scourge the Government for what it has done in the past, I do want to put it to them that in the future the chances of discrimination not taking place will be greatly improved if they make all their back-bench followers in the Dáil and their followers in the country co-operate with them in <Col N="1880" /> creating the impression that such distribution of relief should not be affected at all by political affiliations.</P>

      <P>My only regret is that the grant which is suggested is totally inadequate to meet the demands of unemployment at the present moment.  I will be forgiven if I stress Dublin's point of view. Dublin's point of view at the moment is that there are 600 to 700 families under notice of eviction.  Decrees for possession of their little homes have been granted against a number of them in the last month or two.  In those circumstances, and knowing that the majority of those people in respect of whom those decrees have been issued are parents of large families, one is tempted to ask what is to become of them if the relief grant that is given just provides work for them for one month in the year.  Take a man getting three days' work a week at 10/- a day, and getting a month of that last year; when he applies again he is told that his turn has not yet come.  That is not a very bright future for that individual.  I will again put the appeal which I made last year to every member of the Dáil, and ask him, when he is holding his Sunday political meetings, to bring this point home.  I would ask him to appeal to all of his own people to remain in their own town.  By doing so, their own Deputies can raise a <Col N="1881" /> sufficient row in the Dáil to see that their share of the Relief Grant will go to that town.</P>
      <P>What is happening&mdash;and I am sure that every Deputy in Dublin knows it &mdash;is that we have such rather sad and very unfortunate cases as that in which a young man with a young wife and baby will come to Dublin&mdash;by hook or by crook they get to Dublin&mdash; because they read in the newspapers about the prospects of employment here.  When they are here a few days our Medical Officer of Health is called in and he finds that these unfortunate people are housed in some rotten basement that others had been taken out of a few weeks before.  The authorities were not quick enough to close them down and those unfortunate people from the country who come to Dublin in the hope of getting employment find themselves completely stranded.  What I want to get at is this, that the Parliamentary Secretary has knowledge of the amount of the Grant that is to go to each town; therefore, if a number of men leave that town and find, after having tramped to some other town, that the working of the Grant might have given them employment if they remained at home, the relief should follow them into the other district. Everybody knows that for the time being, owing to the temporary position which I hold, the place which I occupy is a semi-public building, and it is no exaggeration to tell you that I have 40, 50 or 60 callers a day.  That is no exaggeration, and if anybody thinks it is I will ask him to sit in my office for one or two days.  Let him select the day himself and come as a surprise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last week, I had brought to my notice several of the type of case that I have mentioned.  One was the case of a fine young man who told me he was from Kildare, with a nice young wife and an almost hungry baby.  His wife was from Kells.  Because he was from Kildare and his wife from Kells the only hope they had in Dublin was to go to the Union.  We have no means of giving them relief.  He had served eight years in the National Army.  I asked him when he got work last, and <Col N="1882" /> he informed me that it was nearly two years since he earned a penny.  I really avail of the opportunity of this Relief Grant to draw attention to these matters, and to express the hope that the Deputies will draw the attention of those unfortunate people in the country to the fact that they should not come to Dublin.  It is unfair; it is really sad to see those people and to know of their sad plight.  I can do very little for them.  I can do just as much as probably any other Deputy in the House, but not more.  Every Deputy in Dublin has had those callers as well as I.  I do not want to say that I am the only one who gets those calls.  Our trouble is that those men come from the country&mdash;this is a matter for the Labour Party, I might say&mdash;and when they get to Dublin if employment is offered at any wage they are prepared to take it.  There are employers willing to avail of the unemployment problem in order to get the cheapest possible labour.  Men have called upon me from other organisations and trade unions, and told me that there are employers offering unfortunate men from the country half the wages that they would pay to semi-skilled labourers in that class of occupation.  Those men feel that they are deprived of the work because the men who come from the country are prepared to work for a very low rate of wages.  The result is that the others are deprived of the employment. I do earnestly appeal to every member of the House to impress upon his people that they have a chance, by staying at home, of getting a little of the Relief Grant.  If the Grant to some particular town was meant to cover 100 unemployed, and if, when the grant is being distributed, 40 out of the 100 are bound to have gone to Dublin or some other town, I say there ought to be a means by which those individuals should have the right to get their share of the Grant sent on to them.</P>
    <P>Things are deplorable; things were never so bad.  I do not wish to talk politics at all; nobody is to take me as talking politics.  Things were never so bad with the unemployed in the City of Dublin.  We have a relief scheme; we have what is known as the Chatham Row relief.  The ratepayers <Col N="1883" /> are splendid.  They are doing everything possible.  Nobody has made any complaint about the £5,500 per week which the Dublin citizens pay for the relief of the unemployed.  They have made no complaint; they have been splendid in that direction.  When one sees the hundreds that are coming into the city, and that are not entitled to any benefits, one must forget politics and make an appeal for those who have left the land or left their own towns in the hope that they are going to get employment here.  My only regret, as I have said before, is that the Grant is inadequate.  We could use the whole of the Grant in Dublin in a couple of weeks.</P>

      <P>I am anxious to call the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary to a few matters that have arisen out of the execution of relief work during the past few months.  I have noticed in certain portions of the area I come from that there was a tendency on the part of comparatively well-off people&mdash;I should say in some cases very well-off people&mdash;to crush in on the works to the exclusion of people who needed employment much more.</P>

      <P>I can be very definite about one or two instances.  About four miles outside Dunmanway a forestry plantation was started some time ago.  As far as I could gather from the newspapers that work was subsidised to some considerable extent out of the Relief Schemes Vote. Seventeen or 18 men are working there, and included in that number was the son of the biggest farmer in the parish of Dunmanway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>He was a farmer with a valuation of £50, who employed a neighbour in the absence of his son. It is probably one of the most scandalous cases I have ever come across.  For the information of the Parliamentary Secretary I want to say that a complaint was made several weeks ago to the Forestry Department <Col N="1884" /> in connection with this matter. I do not know whether that complaint should have been addressed to the Parliamentary Secretary or to the Forestry Department, but certainly the complaint was made to the Forestry Department.  In that work also are a number of other well-off men, the sons of comparatively well-off people&mdash;not to the same extent as the case I have mentioned, which is an outstanding one.  In that district are a number of labourers&mdash;I know some of them quite well&mdash;who have not been able to secure employment, and I should like to have this matter investigated. It is only right that it should be investigated.  I think there are quite a lot of similar cases&mdash;not quite so bad perhaps&mdash;which can be vouched for in some areas in West Cork.  As proof of the fact that I am not talking from hearsay evidence I give that case, and I am prepared to stand over it in every detail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the whole, however, I think that fairly good work has been done in connection with the expenditure of this money.  There were certain difficulties. As was necessary, the Department endeavoured to spread the money over the greatest number of areas possible.  That was inevitable and was perfectly right.  As a consequence certain works received only a very small proportion of what was necessary to have them carried out&mdash; perhaps £40 or £50; just as much money as was needed to start the works.  I was not able to catch very clearly what the Minister for Finance said, in moving this vote, as to how it was intended that this money should be expended.  I should like to suggest that certain valuable and useful works that had been started, that had advanced to a certain extent and were left unfinished because of lack of funds, should be given some further attention and provided with further grants in order to have them completed. I would suggest also that a good many necessary works&mdash;works which I think the Department would agree to be necessary&mdash;in West Cork area, which have not been tackled up to the present owing to the shortage of money to cover the large area, <Col N="1885" /> should be undertaken as soon as possible. Certain minor drainage works could be done there between this and the 31st March in the weather which we have at present, and are likely to have.  I make that suggestion to the Parliamentary Secretary.  On the question of wages my own opinion is what it was when this matter was discussed here.  This is not, perhaps, the place to raise it again, but I mentioned it the last day and do not want it to be said that anything has occurred in the meantime which has made us at this side of the House alter our opinion.  I should like to interest the Parliamentary Secretary in the couple of matters I have mentioned, in the hope that they would be looked into.  I should like to say now that, in spite of what I have stated, I consider that on the whole pretty good work has been done.  Some schemes were carried out in a way that gave general satisfaction, and a lot of employment.</P>

      <P>Mr. MacDermot, speaking on this Vote, said that it is a rather ironical commentary on the many promises made in regard to employment. It is more than an ironical commentary; it is a confession of failure. It is a definite condemnation of the people who believed in the fool promises which were made, and made so plentifully, about the time of the elections.  Deputy Byrne has said that this Vote is not sufficient.  I do not know that that point should be pressed too far, but it could with justice be pressed so far as one could put it against the people who are at present bringing forward this Vote.  I remember that one occasion when a Supplementary Vote of a quarter of a million pounds was introduced around one <Col N="1886" /> Christmas period, the Minister for Finance, as he now is, referred to it as being enough money to give three weeks' employment by way of a Christmas present, and stated that his policy was not to give three weeks' employment on doles or relief schemes, but to give 52 weeks' employment in industry.  If a quarter of a million pounds represents only three weeks' employment what does £50,000 represent? Even the man who cannot add up his own budget figures should be able to tell us that.  I say that argument can be pressed too far, and should not be pressed too far, because the resources of the country have got to be considered.  It is easy to take any of those figures and, taking the number of counties or constituencies, to say: &ldquo;That is only so much per constituency.&rdquo; Each Deputy could say: &ldquo;In my constituency that would not provide for the unemployed for one week.&rdquo;  That has been said on pretty nearly every Vote of a relief type which has been introduced during the past 12 years.  The resources of the country have got to be considered.  They have particularly to be considered by the people who made a failure of the First Loan.  They have got to conserve their resources very much indeed.  Yet, on the other hand, there is a problem.  I will even confine it to the unemployed as considered under the Unemployment Insurance Acts; people who are anxious and willing to work, who cannot get work, who are dependent on work for wages, and dependent on what they can earn through work for what is to keep them alive, are now offered £50,000.  It is not to be forgotten that that is in addition to £350,000 and £150,000&mdash;a grand total of over £500,000.  Again, might I refer to the plans with regard to unemployment that got the Government into power.  Those plans did not promise relief schemes; they promised work.  They did not promise work on relief schemes&mdash;work of a transitory nature; they promised work in industry.  They promised work in industry which was going to be permanent in this country.  They promised work in industrial occupation; once in, a man was going to be in <Col N="1887" /> as long as his industrial life lasted. Industries were going to be firmly seated in this country.  The plan announced that, in a selected number of industries, over 84,000 people &mdash;even the odd hundreds were mentioned&mdash;would get employment.  In the end we are faced with a third Vote for relief schemes.  Surely it is a slight criticism to say that this is an ironical comment on the promises.</P>
      <P>I want to repeat the figures given out from official sources in relation to this matter, because it is the very life of the country that depends upon the knowledge of these figures and an appreciation of what the figures mean.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce when challenged here one evening about industrial occupation said that the best test of employment in the country was the test of the moneys paid into the Unemployment Insurance Fund.  It is easily the best test.  Stamps are affixed for men when in work.  If the number of stamps in any particular year increases, thus increasing the revenue of the Fund, it is a sign that more men have gone into employment, or else that those who were in employment previously have been at work for a greater number of weeks.  The Minister took as his guiding rule for all this that every £4 extra into the Fund meant a person in employment for 50 weeks in the year, and that again is an accurate calculation.  I do not want to say, and I am sure it is not going to be understood that I am saying, that everybody who goes into employment goes in for 50 weeks in the year.  But this is a good basis of comparison.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce told us that the income of the Fund had increased year by year over a number of years and he finally brought us to the point of 1930 and told us that in 1933 the increase in the Fund was £60,000.  By dividing that by the £4, representing a man in employment for 50 weeks in the year, he said that meant 15,000 people in occupation and so it did.  We had analysed later the difference as between 1930 and 1933. The years 1931, 1932 and 1933 form a good basis for comparison because there is no confusing factor, no change <Col N="1888" /> in the contributions.  When these figures were analysed we found that in 1931 the Fund had risen by £45,000.  The present Minister for Industry and Commerce had nothing to do with that.  If we take his division by £4, it meant that 11,000 people had gone into insurable occupation for 50 weeks in the year over and beyond the people in it in 1930.  That was before the present Minister had anything to do with industry.  We had further figures for the year 1932 and they showed an increase.  Mark the difference between the years.  The year 1932 was the great year of industrial development, the year in which there was in fact all the multiplication of tariffs, subsidies, bounties, everything that was to found industry in this country.  All that the Minister could show in that year was an additional 5,600 people in employment.</P>
    <P>It can be said that his plans had not time to develop.  Let us take that as an excuse.  Then we come to the year 1933.  The difference between the year 1932 and the year 1933, on the Minister's own criteria, was an additional 1,500 people.  In two years of the Minister's industrial development schemes, in two years of high tariffs, in two years of bounties and subsidies, of giving Government credit, putting Government funds at the disposal of people, about 7,000 people went into employment.  In the last year before the present Minister had anything to do with industrial development 11,000 people went into occupation.</P>
    <P>Again the excuse might be made that even in 1933 it could be said that the plans for developing industry had not fructified.  That might pass for an excuse were it not for the fact that the Minister had boasted, with regard I suppose to the first dozen of the industrial development schemes that are on, that &ldquo;the job is done.&rdquo; So the job is done, and in the year in which the job was announced to be done 1,500 people went into new occupation.  In the two years leading up to the year in which the boast was made that the job is done less than 7,000 people were put into occupation of an industrial type, whereas in the year before that <Col N="1889" /> Minister had anything to do with industry £45,000 was added to the Fund, equalling 11,000 people put into occupation.</P>
    <P>That is the positive side of the industrial development.  Let us take the negative side.  While the Fund is being built up by contributions paid by those in occupation during the year, it is also drawn on by those who, having been in industry, failed for some reason or another in a particular year to get employment.  Being insured, they are enabled to draw from the Fund as long as their stamps last. I asked a question last week to discover what was the draw on the Fund &mdash;the minus side of industrial occupation. We found that as between 1931 and 1932 the draw on the Fund had increased by nearly £100,000.  In other words, when there were some people going into employment, although not as many as in 1931, there was in 1932, as compared with 1931, something in the region of £90,000 odd extra drawn by those who in that year failed to get employment.</P>
    <P>That shows both sides of the industrial problem.  Fewer people came in, with big tariffs imposed, in the period as to which the Minister said, in relation to six or seven of these schemes, that &ldquo;the job was done.&rdquo;  No pretence that it is impossible to determine when a factory has been erected&mdash; because we are told that some of the factories are extensions and therefore cannot be segregated from the original buildings&mdash;no excuses or glosses of that sort are any good against those figures segregated by the Minister himself; £45,000 increase in the Fund in 1931, 11,000 people put into employment; in the succeeding two years somewhere about 7,000 people went into employment.  In the year 1931 a certain draw is made on the Fund by those who were unable to find occupation and who were insured against not being able to find employment. In the year 1932 the draw on the Fund was nearly £100,000 more.  If that shows healthy industrial development, figures can be made to mean anything.</P>
    <P>While all that is revealed to us through these official figures, there is <Col N="1890" /> the other side&mdash;the non-insurable population of the country; the people who are not in insurable occupations; the people, in other words, who are employed either in domestic service, in agriculture or in horticulture. Where do they come in?  Some weeks ago at a dinner the Minister for Industry and Commerce boasted that we had reached the lowest point with regard to employment; that from this time on there would be a progressive movement.  There has been, but not in the sense he meant.  The unemployment figures have risen every week since then. They now total 96,000. Are they agriculturists?  At least, are they people who were employed on the land, but who can no longer find occupation on the land?  The Minister has provided an Unemployment Assistance Act.  He says it is going to provide for 60,000 people who will not be able to find employment, as they are not insured.  His colleague, the Minister for Education, estimated the figure to be 90,000.  Let it be 60,000 minimum or 90,000, these figures, according to both Ministers, represent people who are not in insurable occupations, and who will not be able to get work.  That is for people apart from the industrial group.  Of course we see it reflected in the home assistance figures, which have risen.  There may be an excuse with regard to the home assistance figures that people are drawing it that should not be allowed to do so, and that people are getting home assistance who should be getting unemployment assistance.  I do not know if that excuse is going to be made.  I do not think there is any other excuse.</P>
    <P>At any rate, the fact is that after two years of intense industrial development, after two years of the new policy, which is supposed to be steadily driving us to more tillage, we find on the one hand, in the Minister's industrial policy, there has been less increase in two years than there was previously in one year, despite the vast scheme of industrial development. As far as the agricultural community is concerned we find the unemployment figures at the moment to be <Col N="1891" /> 96,000.  We find the Minister trying to provide for these&mdash;I presume it is the same group&mdash;by an Unemployment Assistance Act.  His own calculation is that 60,000 people are not insurable. Of the industrial groups who will not be able to find work&mdash;his colleague says they are 90,000&mdash;while they are preparing, home assistance figures have gone up with an enormous bound. I stress again, that the excuse that might have been made, that schemes of industrial development have not yet had time fully to come into play, is negatived by the Minister's statements. He said on an occasion in this House with regard to groups of industries, that his job was done.  He said that at a dinner; he said it in this House, and he said it at meetings outside the House.  His boast was that his job was done.  This is the second year of his great scheme.  He said that 1,500 people were going yearly into employment.  There is one test which the Minister used, to show that everything is rosy or, at any rate, that prospects are bright in this country.  He takes the figures for imported articles, which are at present tariffed here, and says that in such a year we imported goods to the value of £500,000, and last year we only imported goods value £50,000.  He then draws the quick conclusion that we are making up goods value for £450,000, which were previously made abroad and imported. There is no proof that we are doing anything of the sort.  We may not be buying that amount of stuff.  The people may not have the purchasing power to expend on these commodities. If it is said that they are spending the money on articles now made at home, then there is a test that can be called for, and that should be supplied at once.</P>
    <P>The Census of Production is given for various industries, the amount involved, and the net product per worker in the industry.  With regard to confectionery and sugar, the Minister is disposed to rely on it in a great measure.  He says that imports have been cut down from about £500,000 to £30,000 or £40,000.  If £450,000 is spent on sugar and confectionery, which is <Col N="1892" /> supposed to be made here, but which was previously imported, then there ought to be a corresponding rise in those employed in that industry at home.  Do the figures bear out the assertion that there are goods worth nearly £500,000 now being produced here which were previously purchased abroad?  The figures prove nothing of the sort.  The figures can only be made to prove that by assuming that the nett production per head of those employed in this industry has gone from £200 to about £2,000.  That conclusion is ludicrous. It is quite clear that in many industries importation is falling off.  It is undeniable that as a result of high tariffs a certain amount of what was made abroad is being made at home. It is equally undeniable that in the last few years, while the economic war was being waged, the purchasing power of the community had lapsed considerably, and that there was not the money to spend on these articles.</P>
    <P>Merely to say that in one year there was such an importation of certain articles, and in another year so much less importation, does not prove that the difference between the two figures is what is made at home.  In the last two years it goes to prove, as far as this country is concerned, that the same amount of money is not being spent on these articles, but is reserved for something else; that the money is not there to spend, and that there is not the demand at home.  There is no reflection in the figures on those employed in industry to correspond to the difference between what was imported previously and what is now imported.  The purchasing power argument has got to be used in another way.  In a recent speech I noticed that the Minister for Agriculture was boasting about the decrease in the importation of maize.  He drew the conclusion quickly&mdash;and drew the one that was satisfactory to him&mdash;that the same amount of feeding stuff was required, but that maize was being replaced by something produced at home.  The feeding stuff was required for certain purposes, but purposes for which it was previously required, no longer exist. There is not the necessity to purchase the same amount of any type of feeding <Col N="1893" /> stuff.  Is there the same demand for any type of feeding stuff for animals as there was last year, or as there was previously?  We are told there is a plan with regard to agriculture, the same as regards industry.  I want to hear that discussed on very broad lines; details can be filled in afterwards.</P>
    <P>In the year 1931 there was a certain type of farm economy in this country. Certain things were produced out of the earth.  Some of what the earth yielded was eaten at home by human beings, who accounted for a certain amount, and animals accounted for the rest.  Some of the animals fed on what was produced, were consumed at home or used for stock raising purposes.  The rest were exported. The exporting fact meant and could easily be translated into this, that different types of animals represented a certain amount of tillage.  If there are not the same markets, and if there are no alternative markets, then the number of animals bred for use outside this country diminished?  The number of cattle bred in this country for use outside diminished so the acreage that supplied the feeding stuffs for these animals must go down.  We can replace it.  We are going to grow something else; we will grow wheat. I know the argument is that we can supply our own wheat.  Anyone can make a calculation?</P>
    <P>Let us assume that next year we are growing in this country all the wheat that we require for our own needs, and let that be measured out in new tillage.  That is one side of the account.  Take the other side.  We are no longer looking for a market for export.  Therefore, we are no longer looking for an exportable surplus.  Let us take that in relation to live stock. If, for the next ten years, we are only going to breed in this country the number of animals which will be required for human consumption at home or else for breeding purposes for animals for further use at home, how many acres now tilled will go out of cultivation?  Will it, in the end, be more than we will put under the plough because of wheat or anything else that we are going to grow new in this country?  That can best be <Col N="1894" /> summed up as it was summed up here recently.  There are between 10,000,000 and 12,000,000 arable acres in this country.  There was a certain number of these being tilled in the year 1931 under a certain type of farm economy. Supposing this country sets out to get to this point of self-sufficiency and this only; that it will raise in this country only what is required for consumption at home and is not going to look to the exportation of a single animal or a single item of agricultural produce, how many of the 10,000,000 or 12,000,000 arable acres in this country will have to be tilled to supply home needs and not supply anything else? Will it not be at least 1,000,000 acres under what was tilled in 1931, and if it is not that, what is the figure?  How many people are going to be engaged per acre on what is tilled, new or old? Where are the people who are in the country going to find employment? Tillage will certainly decrease under these conditions, and if tillage decreases more people will go out of agricultural employment and if they are looking to get employment in industrial activity in this country they will see their own generation out, and probably another generation will pass, before the change over is accomplished if the rate of speed is going to be even the 5,600 odd that got into industrial employment on the first spurt of activity, the 1,500 that got in on the second burst of activity or the 7,000 odd that got in in the two years; two years so successful that the Minister has got to say at the end of it that the job is done in relation to most of the big industrial groups.</P>
    <P>Surely if there is a plan both of these points of view have been considered. Surely if there is a scheme that is worth calling a scheme, there must have been consideration given to the fact that in the year 1931 or in the year 1932, when the present Government took over, out of every 1,000 people employed in this country 530 were employed in agriculture, and about 100 employed in industry. Surely there must have been some thought given as to what was going to happen to the 530 per thousand employed in agriculture if tillage, in fact, was going to decrease under the <Col N="1895" /> scheme of the Government, and immediately on that there must have been some consideration given to this problem; how are we going to increase the 100 per thousand employed in industry so as to get it up not merely to balance the number that go out of agricultural employment but that will give an opening to the others who are coming on to the labour market year by year.</P>
    <P>Now was there a plan: was there anything to direct activity: was there a scheme which allowed for a decrease in agriculture, or did the scheme envisage an increase in agriculture as well as an increase in industry, and are the results working out according to the scheme?  Can we be told now as to the number of people extra in agricultural employment over and beyond those who were in it in the year 1931?  Can we be told what their hopes are for remaining in agricultural production if the scheme of not aiming at an exportable surplus in any item of agricultural produce is going to be carried out?  Can we be told how long are those transitory arrangements about relief schemes and unemployment assistance going to be necessary? Has any member of the Government, or the Government as a collective group, any idea as to when the country can be shown some increase in agricultural development: some better increase than we have at the moment in industry?  Whatever the figures are&mdash;it is to be presumed that the increase is going to be kept up year by year&mdash;can we get any relationship shown between those figures whatever they are and the number of people, whatever that number may be, who are at the moment unable to get work of any type and who are dependent on the getting of work for the wages which they will exchange for food to enable themselves to live?  The figure may be 96,000, the present total of those who are registered.  The figure may be the 19,000, as the Minister for Agriculture thought it was going to be of those who need not register because they are not in insurable occupation. It may be merely the 60,000 that the <Col N="1896" /> Minister for Industry and Commerce is optimistic to believe in.  Supposing it is even the 60,000, and supposing that there is no further decline in agriculture, what hope has the Minister of speeding up industry in the matters in regard to which he has not yet said that the job is done so as to occupy industry year by year for some years?  What is the number going to be and in what groups of industry are they going to be placed?</P>
    <P>Remember we had it all set out in the plan.  Eighty-four thousand odd were to be put into occupation.  How many of them have gone in: how are the groups working out?  What are the groups in which achievement is superior to the Minister's expectations, if there is any such group? What are the ones in which development is expected on any considerable scale, and has not yet been got on any considerable scale?  If there is a plan, if there is an ordered development, and if there is a working to a goal which has been properly looked to and the means and methods of achieving it have been properly surveyed, it ought to be easy to answer these questions.</P>
    <P>We have asked from time to time where are the factories?  We were told at first that the Minister was in some difficulty because he did not know the difference between a factory and a workshop.  Later, over the festive season, he thought of a better excuse: he could not give those figures because of course some activity was demonstrated by an extension of an existing factory, and therefore he could not point to it as a new factory. Therefore, the figures if they appeared might appear to falsify his statements. Surely it is possible for the Minister in any group of industry&mdash;the one he is fondest of is the sugar confectionery business&mdash;to say there: &ldquo;I have previously announced that the importation of all the articles under this head has gone down by nearly £500,000.  I have drawn the conclusion from that, that the £500,000 worth of goods previously imported are now being made at home.&rdquo;  About £200, let us say, to make the sum easy, used to be regarded as the amount of wealth produced by each worker in that particular <Col N="1897" /> industry.  If we have £500,000 worth of goods now being made here which used to be made abroad, we ought to be able to show so many new people employed in this industry.  Can the Minister show it?  Can he show a quarter of it?  Can he show one-tenth of it?  The last figures we got did not show one-tenth of it.  If he cannot show that increased employment, does he say that a very small increase in employment is responsible for the manufacture at home of nearly half a million pounds' worth of stuff that used to be imported? If he does not say some of these things, what is his last excuse&mdash; or, at least, his latest excuse, because I do not suppose we will get his last excuse to-night&mdash;with regard to industrial development in the country? Remember, in the first half year of the Minister's sway he had 300 factories that he knew of.  He could not state in this House to what groups they belonged.  He could not tell us how many there were in the principal groups.  He could not tell us, in the end, the difference between what he described as a factory and what would otherwise be called by other people a workshop.  He has had two years in which to think over the problem.  He was going to keep a directory and for months he delayed in sending out the ordinary lists of questions which should be answered before the directory could be put together.  Now we find that it is not being done under his auspices but that the firms are doing it themselves, with the view, I suppose, that if it does not bear out what the Minister says he can say that it is not official.  He can say that it is not yet the whole truth, and the whole truth, with regard to these new factories will remain locked in the Minister's heart.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances, of course, we have got to get a Vote like this. £50,000, acording to the view of the Minister for Finance, would mean three days' work for the unemployed.  That is what is to be given at this point.  Is that what was promised?  Is that supposed to be the answer to those people who believed that in certain groups of industries 84,000 odd people were going <Col N="1898" /> to be put into work?  Is it to be merely a relief scheme of a transitory type, the cutting off of corners of roads, the making of pathways and approaches into Land Commission works, certain drainage schemes and so on&mdash;things possibly all good in themselves but clearly lasting only for a season so far as the work is concerned&mdash;is that to be the answer to the people who wanted to be put into industrial occupation of a permanent type and who voted for the Government that promised them that?  It is the best that can be offered at the moment.  I join with Deputy Byrne in welcoming the expenditure of this sum, although I also say that I believe that, with regard to these sums which are being expended year by year, each succeeding year will see less of them expended because the resources of the State cannot be strained beyond a certain point and it is impossible, unless there is better production in the country and a better yield from taxation in the country, to go on supplying all these moneys, necessary as they may be at a particular time unless the end is foreseen. If the end were that this is merely transitory, that there was a good guiding plan, and that there were going to be people put into occupation; that industrial production will improve in the country, and that people would have more money in circulation&mdash;bread often springing from good business activity&mdash;then, it is tolerable.  If, however, it simply means that the plan either never was there or else was hurriedly excogitated at a particular moment, then, of course, this is only leading us further into depression and misery.</P>
    <P>Deputy Byrne said that it would have to be voted this year and for years to come.  There will be a bigger demand for this type of money next year if things continue to get progressively worse next year as they have been getting worse in previous years.  There will be a bigger demand and a bigger necessity for it, but there may not be the same case in supplying it, and it may be that, eventually, the Government will find themselves compelled to stop this sort of relief, and they will <Col N="1899" /> have nothing else to offer instead of it. It is a poor answer, but it is some answer to those who believed in their promises and voted for them on account of those promises; but it is not the answer expected.  It will have to do for the year.  Deputy Byrne's warning will have to be taken that, undoubtedly, in the years ahead the demands will still be there and the necessity will be there.  The only thing that remains to be seen is, will the money be there?  Again I stress that what happened to the Fourth National Loan does not indicate that the money will be there, and certainly it will not be there if the Government insist on pursuing the policy they have been pursuing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that Deputy McGilligan has once again demonstrated very clearly the danger of giving statistics in any quantity to people not capable of understanding them.  Deputy McGilligan appreciated that danger himself when he was Minister for Industry and Commerce&mdash;so clearly that he kept the statistics to himself.  His trouble really arises from the fact that the present Government reversed his policy and decided to make available to all people full information concerning the economic conditions prevailing in the country, and took very special care to insure that the information was accurate.  Deputy McGilligan is able to quote here figures relating to the registration of unemployed, and to draw false conclusions from them.  When he was Minister these figures were not published.  Deputy McGilligan took good care that they were not published and, not merely that, but he adopted very special measures to insure that the figures available in his own Department could not be relied upon as any accurate index of the volume of unemployment in the country.  Deputy McGilligan quoted a lot of figures here this evening, and he endeavoured to draw conclusions from them which showed that he obviously had not even attempted to understand them.  Why do people register for employment at labour <Col N="1900" /> exchanges?  I think most Deputies will agree with me when I say that people register at these exchanges in the hope of getting work, and an increase in the number of registrations at the local employment offices of the Department for Industry and Commerce may be an indication, not of increased unemployment, but of increased expectation of work.  That, in fact, is the explanation of the increased figures.  I notice Deputies opposite smiling.  Let me reinforce my contention.  In the seven years from 1924 to 1931, when Deputy McGilligan was Minister for Industry and Commerce, the number of vacancies filled annually through the labour exchanges averaged about 18,000.  Each year, for these seven years, 18,000 vacancies were filled through the Labour Exchanges.  In the year 1932, 76,000 vacancies were filled in this way and in the year 1933 over 100,000 vacancies were filled.  Do you not think that the significance of these figures should be taken into account when examining the statistics of registered unemployed?  Of what use is it to anybody to register at a labour exchange if there is no prospect of getting work through the exchange and no financial inducement to register?  The number of registered unemployed increases every year between September and December.  The Cumann na nGaedheal Party, or United Ireland Party, as it is now called, its official organ and Deputies of that Party, take good care to quote unemployment figures during that period and to compare one week with the previous week to show that there has been an increase.  In every year there is an increase in unemployment in every country in that period. That is a normal development.  The proper comparison is between the figures for one week last year and the corresponding week this year.  The number of registered unemployed in each week in the September and December period of last year were substantially less than the numbers for the corresponding weeks in the previous year.  The number went up to about 80,000 towards the end of November.  Then it jumped to over 90,000.  Did Deputies opposite take any pains to find out why that <Col N="1901" /> jump of 10,000 should have taken place in the course of a couple of weeks?  Did it mean that 10,000 people had been put out of employment and were coming fresh to the labour exchanges looking for work to replace that which they had lost?  If that was the explanation for that increase of 10,000 in the number of persons unemployed, there would have been a similar increase in the number of persons drawing benefit. But there was no similar increase.  The increase took place entirely in three districts&mdash;the district of Mallow, the district of Thurles, and the district of Tuam.  Why?  Because there was work available in these places in building three of the factories that Deputy McGilligan cannot see&mdash;work for up to 2,000 in each place.  That work was available only through the labour exchanges, in accordance with the often-declared policy of the Government, with the result that everybody desiring to participate in that work had to register at the exchanges.  Those who registered were, in the main, not persons who would be ordinarily seeking industrial employment.  Most of them had been engaged in agriculture and were taking that work because it was available in a season when work on the farm was not pressing.  They are getting the work.  The significance of these figures is that the workers of this country now realise that there is work available through the exchanges. Not 18,000 vacancies per year, but over 100,000 vacancies per year were notified to, and filled through, the employment exchanges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan could, if he had tried, have attached the right significance to the figures made available to him, but he did not try.  He took good care to come to the Dáil, not for the purpose of discussing the unemployment position on an accurate statement of the facts, but for the purpose of misrepresenting the facts.  There is another explanation for the increase in payments from the Unemployment Insurance Fund than that which Deputy McGilligan gave.  There are two policies possible in relation to that Fund, that which the Deputy practised and that which I am practising.  One saves the Fund and the other does not. <Col N="1902" /> I could, to-morrow, give to the Employment Officers in the Department for Industry and Commerce an instruction that, in order to save the Fund, all vacancies were to be filled by people in benefit.  That would take £200,000 or £300,000 a year off that expenditure figure.  If, when a man entitled to benefit became unemployed, the efforts of the Department for Industry and Commerce were concentrated on putting that man into work in preference to the man out of benefit, we would save the Fund and reduce the figure.  But we have given them a contrary instruction.  The instruction which these officers have received is that preference in employment, when it is possible to exercise preference, is to be given to the man who has nothing, to the man who is longest out of work and who has exhausted his claim to benefit.  That means that the demands on the Fund increase but it is, I suggest, a better system than the other and operates to distribute more widely the benefits of the unemployment insurance scheme and of any work made available out of relief votes or other Government measures.  Deputy McGilligan knows that that is the explanation of the increase in expenditure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is.  It shows that more people became entitled to that payment in that year than in the previous year.  Every other figure available supports that contention. The number of unemployment insurance books exchanged and new books issued shows an increase of 45,000 over that of the previous year.  That figure supports my contention.  More people are seeking and getting insurable employment.  The Deputy said that figures can be made to prove anything and he successfully demonstrated the truth of his own contention.  Figures will prove anything if people are prepared to accept, without examination, statements made in this House in the manner in which they have been made by the Deputy.  I suggest to Deputies opposite that instead of swallowing these doctored statistics that are handed out by the propaganda department of their organisation, they should do a little thinking for themselves and be guided by facts as they know them, not by facts as their Party propagandists would present them.  Deputy McGilligan wants to know where are the new factories.  I think it is about time I made some effort to enlighten Deputy McGilligan.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The suggestion that was made about Gallahers was one that I adopted.  The suggestion was made by a member of the Deputy's Party that we should keep it there as a monument and we are keeping it there as a monument, a notification to those who want to come in and to exploit the Irish people, that we are going to work this country for ourselves, that we are going to develop Irish industry under Irish control and with Irish capital, that those who hope by any means to defeat the Government policy in that matter are going themselves to be defeated.  For that purpose we passed the Control of Manufactures Act which the Deputy opposed and now wants to have tightened up.  I have given from time to time the available figures about employment in industry. I gave Deputy Mulcahy figures concerning employment in certain industries in reply to a Parliamentary question last week.  They show an increase in all cases except one or two and in the one or two cases where no increase is shown the decline is rather a matter for congratulation than otherwise. There are certain industries which foster in times of depression and decline in times of prosperity and the decline, in the only cases where there has been a decline in employment is <Col N="1906" /> a decline of that type.  It is an axiom amongst economists, for example, that the consumption of flour goes up when the standard of living goes down and <i>vice versa,</i> that when people can get meat, poultry, eggs and other foods, they eat less bread, and that when they cannot get these other foods they eat more bread.  The consumption of flour has fallen off in this country in the last year by over 300,000 sacks, an indication that the people are eating less bread, because they are getting more meat, more poultry, more eggs and more food of several kinds.</P>
      <P>Deputy McGilligan talked about our purchasing power, and again it was quite obvious that he had not attempted to study the various indices in relation to it.  If anybody wanted to get reliable information as to whether the purchasing power of our people had fallen on the whole and as to the extent that their consumption of essential commodities has been affected, or even their consumption of luxury commodities, where would he go?  He would take the various indices that the Deputy will find, if he tries in every economist's book, in every textbook of political economy for children. The decline in the consumption of flour is an index of improved standards of living.</P>

      <P>I shall deal with the producers in a moment.  The importation of tea went up.  The importation of sugar went up last year as compared with the previous year.  Taking the available figures relating to the output of boot factories, clothing factories and woollen factories, and adding them to the imports statistics available for the year, an increased consumption in all these articles is shown.  The <Col N="1907" /> bank clearances are up.  The volume of currency notes in circulation has increased.  Every available index of economic activity shows increased consumption, an increase in purchases and an increase in purchases for cash.  I heard Senator Sir John Keane, who is not a friend of the Government, a director of the Bank of Ireland, making a public speech some weeks ago in Trinity College&mdash;Deputy's McGilligan's colleague, Deputy Dillon, was present and heard it too&mdash;commenting on the fact that traders and manufacturers from all parts of the country had said to him that their business was good and, more significant than anything else, that their proportion of bad debts was down and their proportion of cash payments up.</P>

      <P>Deputy Brennan talks about the purchasing power of farmers having gone down owing to the fall in prices.  Of course, it has, but that is not confined to this country.  The purchasing power of farmers in every country has gone down.  It has gone down less here than in most countries, as Deputy Brennan or any other Deputy opposite would know if he made any effort to try and find out how things are in other countries in present-day circumstances.  Denmark is often quoted.  The price of Danish butter sold on the export market in recent times was the lowest for 40 years, the lowest recorded since 1894.  In the last <Col N="1908" /> year the Danish Government bought 200,000 head of cattle to destroy them&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in an effort to maintain prices.  Last week the Danish Government published a census of pigs which showed a decrease of 15 per cent. mainly in young breeding sows. The Dutch Government is planning to destroy 200,000 cattle this year in an effort to maintain prices and is adopting other measures in order to keep agricultural produce off the market either by limiting home production or by acquiring that produce for destruction. We have not resorted to that yet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Not yet.  But if agricultural conditions tend in that direction, we will have to do it.  We may make a start in this year.  The start will be along certain lines designed to decrease the volume of production where production is obviously going to be uneconomic in future and, at the same time, to improve the quality of the produce.  If we take steps in that direction this year, I want Deputies to know that we are forced to do so after much stronger countries than ours have been compelled to move in that direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Danish agricultural economy is a much better one than ours.  The main criticism of our predecessors as a Government was that they did not realise the fact that if a period of world depression was to come the agricultural economy permitted by them to exist here was bound to come down under the strain.  They advocated and fostered specialisation in farming and the specialist farmer in all countries has gone to the wall, whether he specialised in cattle, in wheat, in bacon or anything else. When I was in Canada in 1932 they told me that in one province there there were 300,000 farmers being maintained on outdoor relief.  These were specialist farmers, men who had concentrated upon the production of a limited range of products, just as farmers in this country were advised <Col N="1909" /> by the Minister for Agriculture in the Cumann na nGaedheal Government.</P>

He did well to pick upon 1931, the last year of Cumann na nGaedheal term of office, when the acreage under tillage was the lowest ever recorded.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy asked us would we be a million acres lower.  I do not know if he has looked at the figures.  The total acreage then was 1,400,000.  He wants to know, apparently, if we are going down to 400,000 acres.  The fact is that we are going up.  For the first time in 100 years, exclusive of the war years, the acreage under tillage last year was increased. The Deputy now asks us are we going to 400,000 acres.  Apparently he does not understand the position. He mentioned wheat.  It would take 800,000 acres to produce the quantity of wheat we consume, not to mention other products.  We are going to have 60,000 acres additional under beet.</P>

I will ask Deputy Belton, as a man who may be anxious to get at the facts, to work out what it would cost us to build the beet factories under precisely <Col N="1910" /> the same scheme as our predecessors adopted.  That might mean a loss, but under our scheme it is not going to cost £1,000,000 a year, but £600,000, and for that we are going to secure the economic operation of four beet factories.</P>

We are going, not merely to increase the acreage under wheat and beet, but also the acreage under other cereal crops.  We believe that acreage can be increased.  A very large item of our import list that represents grain and other food-stuffs can be replaced by home-grown products and, even if it is necessary for us to reduce our production of cattle and consequently to reduce our consumption of food-stuffs, there will still be many hundreds of thousands of acres of additional tillage in consequence of the substitution of native products for imported articles.</P>

      <P>Whether or not the whole of the £500,000 worth of imports is now represented in production from Irish factories, it is a good thing to have it wiped off the import list.  There was surely little national gain in expending £500,000 buying chocolates and toffees from the supporters of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party in England. Neither did I say that our job is done.  I have said repeatedly that we have barely started.  The task of building up the industrial system here, carrying out a recasting of our economic organisation and repairing the damage done by our predecessors over 10 years is not an easy one.  It will take us some time to accomplish it, but we have got well on the way.  I am glad there are some sounds of approval from the Party opposite.  Usually Deputies there stand up and cheer if they hear of someone losing work.  They groan if they hear of a new factory opening.</P>

      <P>I regret that I have not the benefit of the agricultural address by the Minister for Industry and Commerce but I will reciprocate to him what he said to me when he referred to me as a Deputy who was anxious to get at the truth of his industrial policy.  Even though I will not deal to-night with his attempt at opposition to the motion proposed by me, I hope that I will instruct him a little in the elements of agriculture.  The motion on the Order Paper since 24th March last says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the Dáil condemns the action of the Government in reducing the total of the grants payable on agricultural land.</P>
      <P>When the division on this motion would be taken, I certainly expected a full muster of the Opposition Parties. I also expected that the Labour Party would forget its spurious advocacy of trade unionism and be found to come into the Lobbies with the Opposition Party, but I did not anticipate the <i>volte face</i> of the Government Party.  Since I started to reply to the criticisms of this motion on Friday last, I found&mdash;I do not know whether I can claim the credit for it after my quarter of an hour's speech on Friday last&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The Minister for Industry and Commerce thumped the desk before him and asked where was the money to come from, but I would like to know now from the Minister where they found the £220,000 they dished up on Saturday morning and spread all over the front page for the readers of &ldquo;Truth in the News&rdquo;?</P>

      <P>Perhaps it is a case of a guilty conscience coughing up of its ill-gotten goods.  The Minister for Finance, in the course of his four hours' debate on agriculture, reminded us of stories he had heard in his native city of Belfast.  I told him that I would answer all the queries he put to me and that I hoped he would be here.  I find, however, that he is conspicuous by his absence and the Minister for Industry and Commerce is left to hold the fort with not a solitary man with him and only one lady.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry also that our friend, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, who took over four hours to give us a lecture on agriculture, is also conspicuous by his absence, because I have records here which he would probably accept because they are from an old and cherished friend of his&mdash;Martin's Bank, Limited, Birkenhead.  He told us, in the course of his address against this motion, that cheques <Col N="1915" /> from Martin's Bank, which his dear father drew, brought comfort to many a fisherman's home.  I am sorry that I cannot say that the returns from Martin's Bank, Limited, have brought comfort to any farmer's home.  I will give one case as an example of the whole lot.  A farmer exported 16 cattle at £21 5s. apiece, making a total of £340 which he could have pocketed if it were not for this economic war under which, as we are told by the Minister, England is shivering.  On that consignment of 16 cattle, there were customs dues of £96 15s. 8d.  That is Martin's Bank.  I am not the authority for that.  It is a return from Martin's Bank and surely it will be accepted by those opposite, even though it is a British bank in which their colleagues hold their banking accounts.</P>
      <P>In opening my winding-up address on Friday last, I wanted at the outset to confine this motion within defined limits and not to follow the Ministers who took about a dozen hours rambling around the motion without coming to the kernel of it.  In my speech proposing the motion on 4th October, I said that the land annuities, the R.I.C. pensions and the local loans amounted to over £5,005,000.  I took, for convenience, the figure of £5,000,000 and when that payment was refused by this Government to the British Government, the British Government said they would collect it.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce has told us here that, in effect, what we were proposing was to go around with battering rams and sheriffs to collect £3,000,000 of annuities from the farmers of this country and to export the money to England.  The Minister would not do that.  He would not stand by a policy that would do that.  He would not pay this to England.  I am not disputing his policy because I am not dealing with that policy at the moment but I put it to the Minister that when his Government refused to pay England these £5,000,000, England said she would collect it and I challenge the Minister to deny that England has collected it.</P>

      <P>About three weeks ago, Mr. Thomas, replying to a question in the British House of Commons as to what the British taxpayer had lost by the default of the Free State Government in not paying these £5,000,000, said that by 31st March next, the total default of the Free State Government would be £7,063,000.  &ldquo;By the 13th January of this year,&rdquo; continued Mr. Thomas, &ldquo;we shall have collected in our import duties from Free State produce coming into Britain and Northern Ireland, for revenue purposes&rdquo;&mdash;which I take as meaning the net figure after deducting the cost of collection, because the cost of collection could not go into revenue&mdash;&ldquo;a sum of £6,243,000.&rdquo;  The Minister will surely admit that the difference between £6,243,000 and £7,063,000 was the entire outstanding balance which, according to Britain's bookkeeping, we still owed to Britain.  The Minister would admit that, I am sure, and if not, it is his duty to put up in this House Irish figures to prove what England had <Col N="1917" /> taken from us.  If our Government is not keeping our national book-keeping in a manner which will show what England is extracting from us, they are failing in their duty.

A tariff can only raise the price of goods when it restricts the amount of goods going in to the <Col N="1918" /> market, and according to the law of supply and demand, the price of goods must go up when the supply is restricted.  If we send 40,000 cattle to Great Britain and there is no tariff on them and if England says &ldquo;We will put a tariff on these of £5 a head&rdquo; and we still send 40,000 to England, who pays the tariff?</P>

      <P>I am dealing with the £5,000,000 of annuities going into England. I will deal with the other point later, but let the Minister, if he wants to get at the truth of this, deal with the tariffs that England has put on to collect our annuities.  The contention by him and by the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Hugo Flinn, is that the country that puts on the tariff has to pay for that tariff or pay a portion of that tariff.  The Minister is keen enough to say that it cannot make the consumer of these goods pay any portion of that tariff unless the supply is restricted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am speaking as a man who knows a little about economics. I am speaking as a man who supports protection all the way and the Minister knows that.  I am not admitting that the Minister is right in his reference to what the Cumann na nGaedheal Party preached.  I am not now advocating the traditional policy of the Cumann <Col N="1919" /> na nGaedheal Party or of the Minister's Party and, after all, the traditional economic policy of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party, to which the Minister knows I was opposed, is better than the traditional policy of the Minister's Party.  We do not, however, want to go into that.  I should like this discussion to be carried on in order to get at the truth and at a proper understanding of the issues at stake.  The Minister is keen enough to see the trend of my argument and he wants to divert me from the logical sequence of my argument but he does not want to admit that we, who produce those goods that are sent to Britain, really pay the tariff.  If the Minister for Agriculture were here&mdash;and it is very strange how the Ministers who have the most to say in opposition to this are now conspicuous by their absence &mdash;he would be able to verify this statement of mine, that, when Britain instituted the quota system, by order of Mr. Walter Runciman, on 20th December last, restricting our exports of cattle to Britain by half for the months of January, February and March, the Minister was besieged with applications from all parts of the country to get the cattle out.  It is not the price that is worrying the owners of cattle at the present time but the getting rid of the cattle at any price. The quota system for fat cattle leaves 58 per cent. of the cattle that are fat in this country at present on the feeders' hands without any market for them. England wants only 42 per cent.  If it is an ordinary trade question with England, on the basis that the more supplies you have, the less price you have to pay, according to the law of supply and demand, why does England not throw her ports open for 100 per cent. of our cattle?  She knew she would get them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been attempted to be argued from the Government Benches that the reason Great Britain restricted the importation of cattle into that country during the first quarter of this year was that she wanted to help British farming.  The real fact of the matter, however, was that if she allowed the cattle to go in as they went in last <Col N="1920" /> year, and as they were going in in December, Great Britain would have collected close on £1,000,000 more by way of import duties than she wants to liquidate her entire claim against us.  I have said enough on that point to convince the Minister.  In his absence I say, without any disrespect, that the villain of the whole piece, so far as the local councils are concerned &mdash; the Minister for Local Government&mdash;sent a ukase to the councils two or three months ago pointing out that, in view of the good things that his Government had done for the farmers, the Agricultural Grant this year would be the same as last year, less any deductions that might be necessitated through default in the land annuity payments.  I wonder what brain-wave came over the Minister that he changed his mind on Friday night.  £220,000 more is now coming.  I had dealt with that before the Minister for Local Government came in, and I will not go back on the ground to explain it now. He can read it in the Official Report.</P>
    <P>When the Minister for Local Government came in I was dealing with the payment of the land annuities.  The Minister will agree I am sure that Great Britain has collected all that the Minister's Government defaulted in paying.  The position therefore now is that whether our Government withheld the direct payment to Great Britain or not, Great Britain has got the money&mdash;every penny of it.  What will be due on 31st of March will only exceed what was collected on 13th January by £882,000.  Great Britain has provided for a quota of cattle which could be filled twice over and would be filled more than twice over if the quota were doubled and trebled. The Minister for Agriculture, if he were here, could verify that he is bombarded for licences by Irish cattle owners and traders to fill that quota. That quota from 13th January to 31st March next will be about 110,000 cattle, on which Great Britain will collect approximately £600,000 without any loss to her, because it is simply deducted off the owners of cattle here. Then we have the other commodities on which import duties are imposed going into Great Britain which will <Col N="1921" /> make up the other £200,000.  England, therefore, will balance her accounts by the 31st March next.  We will have paid the cost of collection and indemnified England to the last penny piece.</P>
    <P>This was the kernel of the case made by me on the 4th October in introducing this motion.  Not a solitary Deputy or Minister who spoke from benches opposite attempted to controvert that case, but they will attempt to controvert it at the cross-roads throughout the country by saying: &ldquo;We will not pay these land annuities to Great Britain; we have not paid them and we will not pay them.&rdquo;  But we have paid them and the Minister and his Government know it.  A year ago local authorities saw this position and Minister after Minister got up here&mdash;I will not say intentionally but in effect blackguarded certain Deputies on this side and various county councils for refusing to strike a rate last year.  They tried then to create the impression amongst the poor of the country that these councils were trying to deprive the people of the social services.</P>
    <P>Let us examine the position.  I have been charged with leading the movement that county councils should strike no rates last year.  I plead guilty to that charge and I am proud of it.  The pity of it is that county councils in a body did not stand up to the situation last year.  If they did all this tomfoolery would have been brought to a head long ago.  I never advocated the non-payment of rates.  I do not even advocate the payment of rates if you are able, because if rates or annuities are accepted as due I would make the man pay them.  There is nothing in the plea of &ldquo;Pay if you are able,&rdquo; because if a man owes rates he must have property out of which those rates are issuing.  Therefore, he must be in a position to pay them.  I say, &ldquo;make him pay them if they are legally and morally due.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The position that I have taken up in this matter, and that I still take up, is that £5,000,000 has been extracted out of the agricultural industry and handed over to Great Britain.  What was the liability of agriculture on foot of that payment?  It was a few pounds <Col N="1922" /> less than £3,000,000 for annuities.  That was the direct liability of agriculture and I will give way to any Deputy or Minister of the Government Party who wants to controvert that statement now.  £3,000,000 were due by agriculture. What has agriculture paid? £5,000,000.  In addition to the £3,000,000, the other £2,000,000, extracted out of agriculture normally was collected by national taxation which was brought into the Central Fund, and paid out of it to Britain. Did the Government last year, or since it came into office, while agriculture was paying the entire amount, remit one penny piece of the taxation that was going to produce the £5,000,000 which their predecessors had paid to England?  Not by one penny was there a reduction.  The Government collected the £5,000,000 which was provided year after year for payment to England.  What did they do with it? That is the question.  They collected the money, but a debt for which it was collected was paid direct by agriculture to Great Britain.  The Government here pocketed the money.</P>
    <P>What moral right had the Government, after the farmers of this country had paid the annuities to England, to send out civil bills all over the country demanding payment of the annuities by farmers?  We were told in the course of the debate that the Government had reduced the annuities by half. What half?  If the annuities were reduced by half what we were paying England, was there an arrangement with England, if the economic war was to go on, that she would collect an amount equivalent to half the annuities &mdash;£2,000,000 on our products?  No. She is still collecting the £5,000,000, but our Government decided to try to bluff the people of this country, by saying that they had reduced the annuities by half, by extracting that half from people who have already paid the whole amount.  What, in effect, have they done?  They have imposed new taxation on agriculture, to an amount equivalent to half the annuities.  That is what they have done.  I will make way for any member of the Government Party that cares to get up to controvert my statement.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1923" /> The case made by the Dublin County Council last year was that we are paying the full annuities to England, and in addition paying another £2,000,000, over and above our direct liability.  The Central Fund here got £2,000,000, that had been already collected in taxation. We have a lien on that £2,000,000, which should be offered to the county councils for local budgets, thereby obviating the necessity for any rates on agricultural land.  That is the case we put up; that is the case we fought on, and that is the case in which the Minister for Local Government, on the advice of the Attorney-General, got a mandamus against Dublin County Council.  I challenge the Minister to prove a moral right to demand the striking of rates on agriculture in County Dublin or in any other county, seeing that agriculture had already paid £2,000,000 over its contractual liability.  I will make way for the Minister or for any other member of the Government to make their case. Let them not go down to Macroom to talk about housing, or to the Gloucester Diamond or anywhere else, to describe local authorities as failing in their duty, or endeavouring to starve the poor or to deny maintenance to the infirm, in body or in mind.  We did not do that.  We would not be guilty of doing it.  The Minister and his colleagues were guilty when the Government pocketed £2,000,000 out of the direct taxation which had been collected. Agriculture did not get back that money.  That is really what we were asking for.  Ministers are scarce on the Front Benches now.</P>
    <P>Carry that down to Tipperary and to Waterford where rates are being collected from people who had paid them. What was done?  Some farmers in South Tipperary were left without a chair to sit on on Christmas Day.  These articles were seized at the behest of Ministers for debts they had paid.  I challenge Ministers to contradict that.  Cattle were taken up and sold under police protection, the police force being prostituted for that purpose.  A friend of the Attorney-General was got but he was afraid and was not man enough to <Col N="1924" /> go and bid for the cattle.  A police sergeant was got to bid for them.  We went there, I am proud to say, to try to help the Ministers to sell the cattle. We were brought before the Military Tribunal.  This is the terrible Coercion Act to repeal which the Minister and his colleagues were elected two years ago.  I remember campaigning in the Minister's constituency in North City, and everywhere I went I was met with one demand: &ldquo;Are you for or against the Coercion Act; are you prepared to release the prisoners in Arbour Hill&rdquo;?</P>

We are coming very near the hair shirt, black bread, light beer and skim milk.  Not satisfied with selling the other cattle, more cattle were seized.  They were worth £300, and they were knocked down last Friday at Linehan's pound in Prussia Street, for £31.  The buyer found he had a conscience, because I saw him <Col N="1925" /> later in the day trying to get his money out of the cattle.  He could not get a buyer.  He was left to wallow in his own muck, and that is the place to leave him and the likes of him.  I daresay more cattle will be seized for rates and for annuities by the direct method, although the whole debt has been liquidated already.  We had the Minister for Finance entertaining us for four hours in this debate last week and the week before.</P>
      <P>There is just one important matter that I want to refer to.  It occurs in the speech of the Minister for Finance&mdash;he became very eloquent about this motion&mdash;delivered on Friday last.  He said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Outside observers coming here, after reading the speeches of the Opposition Deputies and the statements made by them, have been greatly surprised at what they have found.  They came expecting to find a land desolate and in decay, a people hopeless and famine-stricken.  Instead, everywhere they have gone they have found signs of prosperity prevailing.  Others who have examined the situation from the statistical point of view have found that the statements made by those who were opposed to the Government were without foundation.  No one will accuse a great English financial periodical like the <i>Economist</i> of being unduly biassed in favour of the present Government. On the contrary, that journal has the reputation of examining and discussing in a judicial spirit, without partisanship or bias, all questions to which its attention is directed.  In its issue of the 17th October last it published a survey of British and foreign banking.  This has relevancy to the interruption of Deputy MacDermot.  In the course of that survey it examined the position of the Irish banks.  This, again, is important in connection with the cry that has gone up that the country is being drained of its wealth under the present Government.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister went on to tell us what an unbiassed, specialist authority the <i>Economist</i> was.  I then rose in my place and said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1926" />&ldquo;Mr. Belton: On a point of order, is not the statement referred to by the Minister the statement of an individual who is paid for his job&mdash;the Irish correspondent of the <i>Economist</i>&mdash;and who is a civil servant, I think, in the Minister's Department?</P>
    <P>Mr. MacEntee: I may say, sir, that so far as Deputy Belton's statement goes, I am convinced that the person who wrote that analysis for the <i>Economist</i> is not a civil servant.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now we will see how far we can rely on the Minister for Finance.  I have here the <i>Economist.</i>  I endorse all that the Minister has said about the <i>Economist:</i> that it is an authority that is accepted everywhere.  The Minister said that he had in his hand the <i>Economist</i> for the 17th October last. I have not in my hand the <i>Economist</i> for the 17th October last, because there was no number of it published on that date, but I have probably what the Minister had intended to refer to, the <i>Economist</i> for the 14th October. The analysis that appears in it of the position of Irish banking is illuminating. The Minister will probably accept it that the amount of notes issued or in circulation is an index of the industrial activity of a country.  He will accept, in other words, the quantity theory of money.  He will also accept this, I am sure: that when money flows in on deposits it is a sign that industry is stagnant.  He will admit this because it is a truism of finance: that when the investments of banks increase and discounts diminish it is a sign that people want to lock up money in State securities, and that banks will not venture money in discounts owing to the uncertainty of industrial and agricultural activity.</P>
    <P>In 1931 the deposits in the Joint Stock Banks of Ireland were £127,000,000; in 1933 they were £142,000,000, which shows that money flowed from industrial activity into deposits.  The note issue in 1931 was £5,850,000; in 1933 it was £5,628,000.  The investments of all banks in 1931 were £67,000,000, and in 1933 £76,000,000.  The discounts and advances of the banks in 1931 amounted to £63,000,000, and in 1933 £60,000,000, or the lowest recorded discounts and <Col N="1927" /> advances since 1910.  The Minister did not disclose these fiugres to us.  I will read the last paragraph in the <i>Economist</i> dealing with this:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;These returns are further valuable as shedding light on the balance of payments of the Irish Free State. Since virtually all monetary transfers to or from the Free State are handled through the banks, who provide out of their own reserves any excess of foreign currency demanded, and conversely use any excess of foreign currency offered to increase their holdings of sterling, the movement of the excess of the banks' external assets over their external liabilities provides an almost exact measure of the net flow of funds into or out of the Free State.  It will be seen that from the first quarter of 1932 to the first quarter of 1933 there was a steady net inflow of funds, amounting to more than £8½ millions.  The Irish balance of payments in 1932 was, therefore, strongly favourable.  The last return shows that this movement has now been reversed, and the general belief is that the outflow has continued in the third quarter.  This outflow is partly due to the direct effects of the economic &lsquo;war&rsquo; upon the balance of payments and partly, no doubt, the political factors.  There is nothing, however, to show that the outflow of 1933 is at a more rapid rate than the inflow of 1932, and, in any case, the accumulated sterling reserves of the Irish banks are so large as to make the financial position of the country immensely strong.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister for Local Government and Public Health is alone on the Government Benches.  I presume he is representing the Minister for Finance. I want to ask him this: What has he to say as regards the strictures of the Minister for Finance in his attempt to refute a statement made by Deputy Brennan when he was speaking in favour of this motion, and when he affirmed that we were living on our capital?  Here is the <i>Economist</i>&mdash;the very number of it&mdash;that the Minister for Finance introduced into this <Col N="1928" /> debate on Friday last to show that we were not living on our capital.  Here it says that we are, that the balance of payments is against us in 1933, out that the strength of the Irish banks leaves them still in a sound position. In other words, the reserves that we have built up here in this country will enable us to weather the storm for some considerable time to come, and it is by drawing on those reserves that the Government is prolonging this economic war which they are not going to win and which, in fact, they are not alone losing but have lost already, for not since it started have they won one battle or one skirmish of that war.  The whole thing they went out to fight for is lost and England is getting it, but still we go on.</P>
    <P>I am very sorry that the Minister for Finance is not here, for, to my mind, the Minister for Finance, who is in control of the finances of the country, and who gets up in this House and attempts to make the case that he has made on this motion, from a financial point of view is a greater danger to the country than the economic war is, because in the last analysis there is no Ministry that carries so much weight in the State as the Ministry of Finance.  If that is sound, the State will stay; if it is unsound the State will fall.  If the Minister for Finance was right in the statements he made here last Friday and on last Wednesday week, and in the implication of those statements, then there is great cause for very serious apprehension as to how the finances of this nation are being handled at the present time.  Here are more banking statistics&mdash;this is from the current number of the <i>Economist,</i> February 17th: Deposits within the Free State were £129,000,000 in 1932.  In 1933 they were £125,000,000. That is, £4,000,000 less&mdash;gone! Deposits elsewhere: £43,000,000 in 1932, and £46,000,000 in 1933, or nearly £47,000,000.  In other words, £4,000,000 have emigrated in 1933.</P>

      <P>I daresay the Minister for Finance would say, as he said in his <Col N="1929" /> Budget speech a year ago, that the financial position of this country is buoyant.  Now, we have deposits&mdash;dead money&mdash;in our banks increasing, and live money, in the shape of discounts and advances to customers, which shows the demand of industry and agriculture, diminishing.  We have the amount of the note circulation diminishing, and, I might add, the turn-over also diminishing&mdash;this is from the pen, I presume, of the same correspondent whom the Minister quoted from the number of <i>The Economist</i> in October last.  When the Minister advances this paper as an authority on the Irish financial situation I am not going to question it.  I take him on his own ground.  Here were the bank clearances in 1932: they were £273,557,000 in 1932, and in 1933 they were £267,000,000&mdash;and this with factories being opened every day.  We were told by the Minister for Finance of the £8,000,000 he had pumped into agriculture above and beyond what the previous Government had done. He told us about all the relief schemes &mdash;the milk scheme, the turf scheme&mdash; and the Minister for Local Government and Public Health knows, if he has studied the elements of finance and currency, that the quickest way to put money in circulation is by Government grants.  That is not productive.  That is not ordinary economic activity.  It is just spoon-feeding by the Government. If we were to withdraw from circulation all that the Minister for Finance claims has been pumping into agriculture and industry in this country, what would be the note circulation?  What would be the bank clearances?  What would be the bank deposits, or the bank discounts and advances to customers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position is appalling, and Ministers must know that it is.  That is why they are trying to camouflage the position and draw on the reserves that have been built up by hard work and thrift in the agricultural industry&mdash;to draw on those reserves on the slippery, slimy pretence that farmers must meet their responsibilities.  I agree that they must meet their responsibilities, but the issue I take with the Minister is that the farmer has met his responsibilities, <Col N="1930" /> and I say that it is nothing short of bare-faced plunder to ask farmers to pay any annuities to our Government while they are paying them to England.  That is a perfectly legitimate and reasonable statement. A man who owes a debt is not asked to pay it more than once.  That debt was collected by the present Government's predecessors in order to pay it to another party.  That other party is now getting it from the same people by the direct method.  What right has our Government to butt in and claim it, or any portion of it?  That is the whole case.  I dare say that to go back to the origin of rating on agricultural land, would be, perhaps, going into realms of research never explored by the Minister or any of his colleagues, but I think it is relevant to this motion, considering the claim made by the Government spokesmen on this motion and on other matters that the Government were giving so much relief to agriculture.  It has been stated on this motion that the Government is giving £1,750,000 in the current year, and the same amount last year.  It is also claimed that it gave £2,200,000 the previous year.  Let us examine those figures.</P>
    <P>What is the origin of the grant in aid of agriculture?  I am sure that the Minister who is administering this matter on behalf of the Government knows that, prior to the Local Government Act, 1898, the landlords paid, roughly, half the rates on agricultural land.  By virtue of that arrangement, the tenant farmers held their land under lease from those landlords. When land purchase was about to be introduced in 1898, what was called an agricultural grant was instituted.  It was measured at half the rate on agricultural land for the year 1898 and amounted, for the Free State area, to about £600,000.  That was half the rate on agricultural land for that year. That grant, given for relief of rates on agricultural land then, was not a relief to the farmer but a relief to the landlord.  The farmer was liable to only half the rate and the landlord was liable to the other half.  The Government, under the land purchase scheme, <Col N="1931" /> took over the landlord's responsibility for his share of half the rate.  Instead of increasing as the rates increased from then onwards, the agricultural grant was standardised at half the rate for 1898.  In 1924, the Government of the Free State discovered that they had surplus moneys derived from tariffs imposed on manufactured goods.  The surplus amounted to £500,000 or £600,000.  It approximated very closely to the amount of the agricultural grant then payable. In view of the fact that Great Britain and Northern Ireland had increased the agricultural grant to three-fourths of the actual rate on agricultural land, the Government here decided to double the agricultural grant.  That accounted for £1,200,000 in relief of rates on agricultural land.</P>
    <P>In 1931, the leader of the then Opposition&mdash;now President de Valera &mdash;spoke from these benches and was supported by the Minister for Local Government in demanding immediate additional relief to the extent of £1,000,000 by way of agricultural grant.  That was the motion which they put forward and I believe it was subsequently defeated.  The former Government introduced in its Budget in May, 1931, an increased grant of £750,000.  To find the money for that, the Government imposed a halfpeany per lb. on sugar and 4d. per gallon on petrol.  According to the records published by the present Government since they came into office, there were 45,000,000 gallons of petrol imported and 4d. per gallon on that amount would come to close on £700,000.  There were roughly 80,000 tons of sugar imported and a halfpenny per lb. on that would yield about £350,000.  That is to say, there was £1,000,000 raised for the purpose of the £750,000 grant. In 1932, when the present Government came into office, they decided to increase the grant by £250,000 but they were really only giving back the amount produced by the taxes imposed by their predecessors to provide the £750,000.  They were only giving to Cæsar the things that were Cæsar's.  That increased the agricultural grant to a few pounds short of <Col N="1932" /> £2,200,000.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce, in speaking against this motion, asked: &ldquo;Where are we to get the money?&rdquo;  I ask, &ldquo;What are you doing with the money which you obtained from the taxation imposed?&rdquo; I challenge the Minister to say that that taxation is not producing the amount I stated.  The Minister's Government have altered the tax of a halfpenny per lb. on sugar to 4d. per lb. on tea.  I challenge him to deny that 4d. per lb. on tea and 4d. per gallon on petrol will not produce £1,000,000.  That being so, what moral authority had they for reducing the grant in aid of agriculture?</P>
    <P>It is no excuse for members of the Government to say: &ldquo;We provided £100,000 for a milk scheme, £250,000 for an unemployment scheme, £2,300,000 for bounties and so much for a wheat scheme.&rdquo;  If we were to follow the Government apologists up that blind alley, what would it mean? It would show that the Government, on their own acknowledgment, have done nothing for the country but, in fact, have extracted out of the agricultural industry, which represents 80 per cent. of the entire industry of the country, £5,000,000, directly, to pay Britain and that they have reduced the price level in this country corresponding to the British tariffs imposed on our goods going into Britain.  They have depressed the price level here.  Then we have enthusiastic Ministers, like the Minister for Industry and Commerce, telling us how he is going to &ldquo;brown&rdquo; the whole country by turning up the grass and producing more crops.  It is a pity that nobody who knows anything about agriculture now adorns the benches opposite.  We have&mdash;I say it without any discourtesy&mdash;only a ploughboy and a milkmaid left.  Their ploughmen have gone.  We are told that we will be compensated for this extraction of our money by beet and wheat schemes.</P>
    <P>As the Minister is here, I wish to put to him a point which has been laboured by the Minister for Finance. He worked out the figure&mdash;this was before the £220,000 of Saturday last was conceded&mdash;of the agricultural <Col N="1933" /> grant for this year at £1,750,000.  He went on then to refer to the figure for 1931-32&mdash;the last year the former administration was in office&mdash;and he pointed out that the net amount of the grant paid that year was £1,812,000&mdash;£60,000 more than the Minister proposes to give the county councils this year.  Of course, the Minister for Finance omitted to say that the amounts owed by defaulting tenant-purchasers in respect of annuities were deducted from the grant of £1,950,000 that nominally was paid to agriculture in 1931-32.  He also omitted to inform the House of this, that even the deductions that were made in that grant in 1931-32. were still a debt due to the county councils, but that the present Government in its Land Bill appropriated, or I might say, misappropriated, these balances that were then due to the county councils.  They misappropriated them for Government revenue when they funded the annuities and they give no definite promise that these moneys when collected will go back to the county councils.  This year, the Minister for Local Government in a circular, advising the county councils of the amount of the grant sent out in January last, reminded them that the total grant payable will be £1,750,000, less any deductions that have to be made for defaults in the land annuities, so that the £1,750,000 is not a net figure.  It is only a nominal figure.  We do not know what the real figure will be.  I should be glad to get an assurance from the Minister for Local Government that it is a net figure and that the £220,000 added to that will give us £1,970,000, an assurance that that £1,970,000 will be a net figure.  That is not the advice we have got so far.</P>
    <P>We were told by the Minister for Finance that out of these grants given by the Government to help agriculture, real agriculture from their point of view, not grass culture, they have provided a bounty or subsidy for wheat growing.  That is true and I hope it will be successful.  It is a very good departure in agriculture.  It is a very desirable direction to give agriculture in this country, but I should like to <Col N="1934" /> have it given on better conditions in order to ensure its success.  I hope that I shall not be taken as too pessimistic when I say that I fear for its success.  We are told that 60,000 acres will be under wheat and will get a subsidy this year.  That 60,000 acres is an increase of 40,000 acres on a couple of years ago, and that 40,000 acres increase means, for a six years' rotation, 240,000 acres increase in tillage.  We are told that this is the alternative agricultural economy to grass, but the sponsors of that new agricultural economy seem to forget this, that these 240,000 acres of new tillage will produce more animal food than when they were growing grass.  What is going to be done with the cattle fed on it? Further, we were told a moment ago by the Minister for Industry and Commerce that the primary object of land cultivation is to provide human food. I agree 100 per cent. with that, but no agricultural economy has yet been devised among tillers of the soil that will produce crops and only such crops as are exclusively human food.  I would put it at a very high estimate when I say that the human food produced, even when beet and wheat are added to the crops on the six years' rotation, would not be more than 20 per cent. of the entire production.  What will be done with the 80 per cent. animal food produced?  Will you feed cattle?  You are faced in the British market with a demand for only 42 per cent. of the present small number of cattle being fed.  There is no market for 58 per cent. of them.  The President was asked the other day to give Government time to discuss that problem and he said it was of no importance or something to that effect.  Where are we travelling?</P>

      <P>I am not discussing the relative merits of their wheat policy or their agricultural economy.  I just made a few remarks about it, remarks of approval, but I referred to it only because the Minister for Finance referred to all that was being done by the present Government to help agriculture and thereby to provide a new revenue to meet the burdens of agriculture. I am sorry I have not by me the circular sent by the Minister to our county council last year and, I presume, to all county councils, in which he referred to all that had been done by the present Government for the benefit of agriculture and that surely they were able to bear a small cut in the grant of £448,000.  I submit that I was not only speaking within the limits of the motion but I was right on top of the subject.  Another benefit given to agriculture which was well laboured by the Minister for Finance was sugar beet culture.  It is extraordinary that the Minister for Finance who, if I remember rightly, introduced the Sugar Bill into this House last year, stated then, that even by reducing the price paid to the grower by 9/- a ton&mdash;the price the grower would get would average £25 per statute acre&mdash;even with that cut, and even by observing the strictest economy in manufacture, the lowest price at which they could possibly expect to produce sugar would be £21 per ton.  Similar sugar can be bought at the port for less than £10 a ton.  A sugar consumption in this country of over 100,000 tons would mean between £1,100,000 and £1,200,000 a year of a loss.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Wheat is in the same category.  It is produced at a loss&mdash;money pumped into it.  The rotation that an increased area under wheat will set going in our agricultural economy can only be kept going through the consumption of the animal food that will be produced in the rotation and, of course, it is <Col N="1936" /> essential to provide manure to keep up the fertility of the soil.  There is no market for our cattle.  Take the grocer.  He must stock certain articles, butter, bacon, sugar and other things, and he might make no profit on them. In fact, he will be very lucky if he will get his own out of them, but still he must stock them.  Perhaps he may retail them at a loss, but still he must have other commodities that will make up for that loss and give him a profit on his whole trading; otherwise he cannot carry on.  If you take all the items in the whole gamut of agriculture there is not a single one that can stand by itself without a subsidy.  I will make way for any Deputy on the Government side who can tell me of one agricultural item that can stand on its own legs without a subsidy. Surely, producing springers and selling them for a quid apiece in Lenehan's Pound is not a profitable transaction. We had an amusing three or four hours from Deputy Flinn.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>He referred in his ponderous manner to certain statistics. He showed to his own satisfaction that the price of certain securities has increased, industrial securities, distributive securities and Government securities.  I am sorry that Deputy Flinn is not here.  I think I may, without any disrespect, call him the Assistant-Minister for Finance.  He and the Minister showed the most complete ignorance of the very elements of finance.  What are the industrial securities that Deputy Flinn boosted here?  Are the industrial securities of which he spoke in relation to industries that are getting no State aid; that are not hot-house plants behind a tariff wall?  I believe they are.  I do not know where he got the distributive securities, but he certainly did not get them from the country shopkeepers.  He quoted 5 per cent. National Loan at 111.  When the British Government was able to rake in some £30,000,000 of Irish money at 3½ per cent. why would not a security at 5 per cent. stand in the market at 111?  This authority on finance, who made his bow to Irish politics by <Col N="1937" /> advocating a no-income tax campaign, has now run away from that position. Is he not aware that when the liquid capital of a country flows into fixed securities it is the surest possible sign that industrial activity is below normal and, because it is below normal, it takes shelter in a fixed security?  If the Deputy wants an authority for that he can refer to Reginald McKenna.</P>
      <P>In his stentorian voice he emphasised that real wages have risen in this country.  Real wages have risen for men in jobs like the Deputy, for men in sheltered positions, because the industry in this country that employs 80 per cent. of the country's population has lost its market; the bottom has fallen out of the price of agriculture.  If a family have only to pay half for its food supply, that is equivalent to half the cost of the food supply of that house being added to the wages of the family.  Real wages have improved for a few people in sheltered occupations, but they have not improved&mdash;in fact, real employment has diminished&mdash; in the industry that hitherto employed 80 per cent, of our population.  Deputy Flinn should know that, because he has been reminded from the Labour Benches often enough about the 24/- a week given to the unemployed in the agricultural industry.  Real wages have risen because of the impoverishment of our most important industry. This great economist, Deputy Flinn, opposed here a motion to give a grant in relief of agriculture equivalent to the grant that his Party inherited when they took office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been alleged against us who move this motion that we are trying to build a case on false promises, false in the sense that we have endeavoured to show that this is the only country in the world in which there is agricultural depression.  Nobody here has attempted to show that, and anybody who would attempt it would be attempting the impossible and would be merely exhibiting his ignorance. Agricultural depression obtains the world over.  The depression was greater last year than the year before, and was greater the year before than in the preceding year.  But agricultural depression in England is not as great <Col N="1938" /> as it was last year.  Prices have increased in England.  To some extent, we share in that increase, but our prices are controlled by general world prices.  Here is what the Ministers opposite have not attempted to disprove, that no matter what the general level of world prices may be, super-imposed on the world depression is the depression caused in this country by the economic war.  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>To-day I asked the Minister for Justice if Mr. W. Convey, of Swinford, County Mayo, had been dismissed by his order from the position of summons server, and if so, what were the grounds for the Minister's action, and whether any complaints were received by the Minister from the Gárda or other persons as to the manner in which Mr. Convey discharged the duties of his position, and if such complaints were made whether Mr. Convey was given an opportunity of answering such complaints. The answer which I received from the Minister for Justice was as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The answer to the first part of the question is in the affirmative. Mr. Convey, while employed as summons server for the County Mayo, identified himself very prominently with politics.  He was warned that such conduct was improper, having regard to his position, and that unless he undertook to cease his political activities there would be no alternative to his removal from office. He definitely declined to give any such undertaking.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I then put a Supplementary Question to the Minister for Justice, and the Minister for Justice made a very strange statement; he said that Mr. Convey was a civil servant&mdash;a parttime civil servant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, however, the Minister may attempt to excuse his conduct in this case, or whatever method he may adopt to palliate his wrongdoing, there is one thing upon which he cannot rely, <Col N="1939" /> and that is that Mr. Convey was or that any summons server is a civil servant.  If they were civil servants they would be recruited under the Civil Service Regulations Act, 1924. That is the Act which regulates the Civil Service.  They have not been recruited under that Act.  On the other hand the summons servers are appointed under Section 44 of the Courts Officers Act, 1926, which says in sub-section (2): &ldquo;Every such summons server shall be appointed by the county registrar with and subject to the approval of the Minister, and shall hold office at the will of and may be removed by the Minister, and shall be paid out of moneys to be provided by the Oireachtas such salaries as the Minister shall with the consent of the Minister for Finance direct.&rdquo; Therefore, those men are not civil servants.  They are not recruited as civil servants are recruited.  They are the nominees of one particular individual in each county&mdash;the county registrar of the county.</P>
    <P>I go on to sub-section (3) which says: &ldquo;Whenever there is in the opinion of the county registrar reason to believe that any such summons server has misconducted himself or displayed gross incapacity in the performance of his duties, the county registrar may suspend such summons server from the performance of his duties for any period or periods not exceeding altogether one month pending the decision of the Minister in the matter.&rdquo;  From that sub-section (3) it is perfectly obvious what the Oireachtas contemplated as the reasons why a process officer should be dismissed&mdash;misconducting himself or displaying gross incapacity in the performance of his duties.  It is not alleged that Mr. Convey in any way misconducted himself.  It is not alleged by the Minister that he showed any incapacity, gross or petty, in the performance of his duties.  I definitely asked the Minister if there were ever any complaints made, and the Minister is silent on the point.  If there is one thing which is perfectly clear, and stands out in this monstrous case of dismissal, it is that the man who <Col N="1940" /> was dismissed by the Minister from this position was a man who filled the post competently and adequately and that no complaint could be made about him.  He was not a civil servant. A summons server is no more a civil servant than, let me say, a national teacher is a civil servant.  A summons server has got just as much right to hold his political views and to give expression to his political views as, let me say, a national teacher&mdash;who holds a much higher and more important position&mdash;has got.  I here challenge the Minister for making this statement that Mr. Convey was a civil servant as an <i>ex postfacto</i> method of endeavouring to justify an action which was entirely unjustifiable.</P>
    <P>I come down to the facts of this particular case, and begin with the month of October, 1933.  In the month of October, 1933, Mr. Convey received a threatening letter, purporting to come from the I.R.A.  He went with that letter to the Gárda barracks.  I presume the Minister has got that letter; I presume the Gárda sent it to him; I presume it is in Convey's file.  There in the Gárda barracks he was told that he was likely to lose his position as summons server.  That is the first intimation he gets.  He gets first a threat, purporting at any rate to come from the I.R.A., and finds just at the same time that there is some movement behind to have him dismissed from his office.  That was in October, 1933.  He is marked out by the I.R.A.  We will just see what happens a little bit later on.  On November 24th, 1933, Convey was summoned by the County Registrar of County Mayo to come to Castlebar in order that he might answer some questions to be put to him by the county registrar.  The county registrar put certain questions to him regarding his activities in connection with the Young Ireland Association.  He was asked to consider the advisability of resigning from the Young Ireland Association, but was asked to take some time to turn the matter over in his mind.  He wrote to the county registrar on the 24th November, 1933, to this effect:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Adverting to your interview with me to-day with reference to <Col N="1941" /> my political activities, in view of the position I hold as civil bill officer I would like to assure you that such activities as I engage in are fully within the law, and that they in no way interfere with me in my discharging of the duties of the aforesaid office.  Should you have any information to the contrary I would be grateful for a reply as to any alleged irregularities in the manner in which I carry out my duties. Without wishing to do any person any injury I can definitely state that there are other individuals in similar positions to me who are much more aggressive politicians than I am.  I hope you will not misunderstand me when I state that I consider it most unfair that an attempt should be made to penalise me because of my political views in the absence of any proven charge of inefficiency as to my discharging of the duties of my office.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Possibly, one may find a little fault with the actual wording of that letter &mdash;the actual English in which it is couched may not be very perfect in some respects&mdash;but it is a fine, straightforward, manly letter.  The man says: &ldquo;I have got my political views and I am entitled to hold my political views. They are not the particular political views of the Minister for Justice, but I am entitled to hold them and I am going to hold them&rdquo;; and he says that it would be most unjust to penalise him for holding, as he is entitled to hold, political views and for giving expression, as he is entitled to give expression, to his political views.  To punish him for the holding of political views is an act of gross injustice and to take away, as have been taken away from him, the emoluments of this office&mdash;it may only be a very small office in the eyes of the Minister but it is an office of very considerable importance to this man&mdash;for no other reason under heaven but that he is a political opponent of the Minister is grossly unjust.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of this to which I must advert.  This man lives in the town of Swinford, in North Mayo, the constituency which the Minister for Justice himself represents <Col N="1942" /> in the Dáil.  He is a political opponent of the Minister for Justice and he makes no secret of it; but in his own constituency, because this man opposed him at the last two elections, the Minister for Justice removes him from office.  It has happened nowhere else but here, this venomous action taken by the Minister for Justice against a particular man whom he personally knows to have been a political opponent of his when he stood for election at the last general election. That, to my mind, adds tremendous gravity to this charge.  To dismiss a man because he holds political views different from the views which are held by the Government in office at the time is a very wrong thing indeed.  It is lowering the whole spirit of public life in this country.  It is bringing into this country what ought not to be in this country and ought not to be in any country.  It is a discreditable and disgraceful spirit to introduce this victimisation of persons because they differ from the Executive that happens to be in power at the present moment, but when we find that the particular man who is picked out to be victimised in this fashion is a man who actively opposed the election of the Minister for Justice, we see another worse and more sinister reason for this venomous action by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Every man in this State has got the right to hold his political views and if any Government is going to drive men out of office, to take away from men their means of livelihood, because they have the hardihood to have their own opinions which do not coincide with the opinions of the Government then in office, we are going to have the very worst possible form of graft in this country.  We are going to have public life in this country dragged down to the very gutter.  That is what I charge the Minister for Justice with doing in this particular case.  Everybody knows that if Convey had been a supporter of the Minister for Justice, if he had been a member of the Fianna Fáil Party, he would be summons server in County Mayo at the present time. Everybody knows that if Convey had been a member of the I.R.A., that body <Col N="1943" /> which threatened him, that body which seemingly set the whole of this in motion, Convey would be summons server in County Mayo at the present time.  But he belonged to neither. He was not Fianna Fáil and he was not I.R.A.  He was opposed to them both, and because he was opposed to them both, his means of livelihood are taken from him.  I have read the section under which that man was employed and there is not a single word in that section which says any single thing about political views or that a man is to hold political views in accordance with political views held by the Government in power at the moment, or else that he is to go.</P>
    <P>That is the principle which I charge the Minister for Justice with introducing into the carrying out of the duties of his post.  He has, in this instance, victimised a man who, admittedly by him, was a man who was carrying out the duties of his post without suspicion, a man who was carrying out the duties of his post perfectly fairly and adequately, a man who challenged an inquiry into the way in which he was carrying them out and who said &ldquo;If there are any complaints that can be brought against me from any single source, let them be brought forward, I am ready to meet them face to face,&rdquo; but the Minister brings nothing against him, the Minister can say nothing against him.  The Minister cannot deny that he was thoroughly and completely efficient in the discharge of his duties and the Minister can say nothing in justification of his attitude except that this man was a political opponent.  Where is there any regulation by which summons servers must be members of the Fianna Fáil Party or go?  That is the very attitude which the Minister is taking up in this matter.  This man has been wronged; a gross injustice has been done to this man.  It may be impossible to do justice to him; it is impossible now to reinstate him because I believe the position has been filled by another man, but, at least, the people of this country can know the way in which the Fianna Fáil Government are acting in office.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1944" /> The people of this country can know, and they will know and appreciate the spirit behind the present administration, and how a man, holding indeed only a little, humble job, can first be attempted to be bullied into deserting his political principles, and when he refuses to be bullied into deserting his political principles, can be victimised and treated with injustice, as he has been treated, but, thank goodness, there are men in this country with the backbone and with the courage of men like Convey.  There are men who are not going to desert their principles because the Minister for Justice threatens them with punishment if they do not, and because he goes further and actually does punish them because they refuse to desert their political principles.  There are men in this country who are willing to suffer persecution at the hands of the Minister for Justice, and the people of this country, I am perfectly satisfied, will admire those men just as every decent man in this country will hate and execrate the action of the Minister in the course he took in dismissing this man.</P>

      <P>I hope I will be able to deal with this matter more effectively and with less noise than the Deputy has introduced into it.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>It has not been brought to my notice.  The other aspect of the matter is that the Deputy may try in some way to differentiate between what is technically known as a civil servant and what is not, but away from that technicality we cannot get in regard to the position of public servants. Whether public servants are selected or elected in conformity with certain regulations affecting technical civil servants or otherwise members of the Civil Service makes very little difference and has, in fact, no effect. If the Deputy's contention is to be <Col N="1945" /> accepted, it means that a large number of court officers are quite free to partake in all sorts of politics, aggressive or otherwise, and that they would be in a position, if they were so inclined, or if they were of that type, to use those positions in a way that would not be just or fair to the people they have to deal with.</P>
      <P>As far back as June, 1932, a circular was issued by the Department of Finance dealing with civil servants. That circular was brought to the notice of the various Departments.  Following that circular from the Department of Finance, circulars were issued by the Minister for Justice at the time to the county registrar in each county pointing out with regard to these public servants that (1) they should maintain a certain reserve in political matters and not put themselves forward on any side; (2) they should refrain from acting on any committee having for its object the promotion or the prevention of the return of a particular candidate or candidates at a Dáil election; (3) they should not support or oppose any candidate or Party by public speaking or writing, and (4) should not take part in any public discussion with regard to the public conduct of Ministers or the policy of the Government.</P>
      <P>All that was dealt with in that circular was what was dictated by the Department of Finance with regard to what the Deputy refers to as civil servants technically&mdash;I say as civil servants.  I do not know whether the Deputy considers that it is very desirable that a court officer in the execution of his duty should go round to houses dressed in a blue shirt, or anything like that.  I do not know whether he thinks it is necessary for a court officer to perform his duties in that way.  We think, at any rate, that it is not desirable, to say the least of it. I should have mentioned that the circular I have referred to was acknowledged by the County Registrar for the County Mayo on 16th June, 1932, as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;I am in receipt of above circular and have given all the officials an opportunity of noting its contents.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to this man Convey, the matter was brought to the notice of my <Col N="1946" /> Department, but not in the way the Deputy suggests, by any threatening letter from the I.R.A. or anything else like that.  I assure the Deputy that this is the first I have heard of that letter and I shall have enquiries made. The matter was brought to the notice of the Department in another way.  In passing, I may assure the Deputy that I never heard of Convey before this complaint was made about him.  He may be what some people may style a &ldquo;big noise&rdquo; in Swinford, but I assure the Deputy I never heard of the man before.  Perhaps, I should have known him in connection with the courts, but I assure the Deputy that I had no particular contact with him.  The complaint was brought to the notice of my Department that he had been acting in this aggressive way in politics.</P>

When that complaint was received, instead of the Department taking up the attitude that this man should be removed from his position, an enquiry was put through to the County Registrar to ascertain what were the activities of this man, and were those activities along the lines of the report received.  That was confirmed.  But, instead of asking that <Col N="1947" /> man to resign or dismissing him from his position, what was done was that when the County Registrar had vouched these facts for himself he was asked to send for Convey, explain the position to him and draw his attention to this circular.  Convey had his choice.  The suggestion has never been made that any man in the Civil Service should change his views.  Every member of the Civil Service can hold his own views.  Convey could hold his own views, and so can any court officer. But public servants, as I stated already, are not entitled to go out aggressively and advocate their views.</P>

The Deputy has referred to the answer he gave.  He stated when interviewed by the County Registrar that he was not prepared to answer at the time.  He went away, and some time afterwards he wrote this letter to the County Registrar to which the Deputy has referred.  I do not object to the tenor of the letter at all.  All I wanted to see in the letter was whether he was going to choose between being a public servant or being simply an advocate of a Party.  He made that choice.  I have no fault to find with him, but, so far as my Department is concerned, that choice ends it.</P>

      <P>The assents and dissents received from the occupiers of lands affected by the River Robe Drainage Scheme are being examined by the Commissioners of Public Works.  It has been found necessary to reissue some of the voting forms for proper completion and to extend to 6th March, 1934, the period for their return.  In the circumstances it is not possible to furnish the information asked for by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>It is evident, however, that the aggregate value of the lands occupied by dissenting occupiers will be less than half the total value of all the lands included in the scheme.</P>
