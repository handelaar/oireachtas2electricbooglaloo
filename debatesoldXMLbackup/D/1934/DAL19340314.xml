The Westmeath County Council were notified in <Col N="697" /> December, 1933, that a grant for the relief of unemployment would be made available for road works in the county and the grant was duly sanctioned on the 20th February last.

    <P>Debate resumed on the following amendment:</P>
    <P>20.  In sub-section (1), line 27, after the word &ldquo;party&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;which aim at overthrowing or changing the Constitution of Saorstát Eireann by force of arms.&rdquo; (Deputy McGilligan).</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment should certainly test the good faith of the Government and offer some kind of touchstone by which we can judge their many professions.  Here is an opportunity for them.  I will admit their acceptance will be only a gesture because there would still <Col N="698" /> remain the administration.  We know how they are capable of administering Acts of Parliament.  It will at least serve, so far as appearances go, to get rid of the extraordinary habit to which I have already referred that the Government has of seeing things through distorted glasses, differently from everybody else.  It will get rid of the appearances at all events&mdash; because the practice will be somewhat different, I fear, even if the amendment is accepted&mdash;of discrimination in favour of illegal armies, and against political organisations.  It will get rid of what is undoubtedly the professed policy of the Government, judging by their actions, of looking upon respect for the law as a crime; while open disrespect, proclaimed disregard for the law, the belonging to associations whose objects are professedly illegal, and whose aims are to be carried out by means of force, are to be treated not merely with a special leniency but even with respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had here various statements regarding the I.R.A.  I think the statement made yesterday by the Minister for Industry and Commerce on this matter, if it means anything at all&mdash;and despite the vigour with which he speaks, I often wonder whether he does mean what he says&mdash;shows that he regards the existence of the I.R.A. as inevitably tending to civil war.  I wonder does that statement represent merely his own personal views&mdash;does it represent even that&mdash; or does it represent the policy of the Party.  I suggest that this Bill and the rejection of this amendment by the Government would openly display all that is meant and clearly meant&mdash; we can gather that from the speech of the President and from the speeches of the Ministers&mdash;is to give some justification for the threat of civil war that the President held out. I know by this time that having had long experience, the President is capable of putting his threats in the form of prophecies.  I suggest that nothing could be more dangerous than that the head of the Government and his various Ministers should continually speak of civil war; especially when they are trying to beat down an <Col N="699" /> organisation that is unarmed, and when they fail to take any effective steps against the terrorism which is spread through the country by those who have arms in their hands, whose constitution is definitely and clearly anti-State, and the basis for the realisation of whose aims is the use of force.  We know the fatal facility, with which the President can give effect and helps to give effect to his doleful prophecies.  But if the House has any respect for itself it ought to see that it does not help the President to save the bankruptcy of his policy and of his Party by threats of civil war; if necessary, I have no doubt, he will try the reality.</P>
    <P>You have, therefore, the threat and we should like to know what the Government's attitude on this matter is&mdash;not merely expressions of opinion as to what one Minister and another Minister thinks&mdash;and what they are going to do.  Are they going to allow what one of their own members confesses is practically inevitably bound to lead to civil war, while they suppress what is essentially a peaceful organisation, a political organisation, an organisation whose aims, whose motives and whose purposes are entirely lawful, praiseworthy and patriotic?  Which is really the attitude of the Party&mdash;the attitude shown in the <i>ipse dixit</i> of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, or the attitude taken up by Deputy Dowdall, who recognises that particular body of the I.R.A. and apparently looks upon it as the flower of Irish manhood?  We know perfectly well which is the real attitude of the Government and something more is necessary than the hasty ill-considered statement of any Minister.  We want to know what steps are being taken, not what words are being used.  I admit that, even if the amendment is accepted, the administration will still be in the hands of that partial Government, but at least even if the acceptance were hypocritical it would show the homage that is due to virtue.  It would at least have that significance. I cannot understand the Minister for Industry and Commerce saying that they got no help from any of those <Col N="700" /> illegal organisations during the last election.  I wonder where he lives! Deputy Dowdall, I have no doubt, is under no delusion as to what help they got, nor would any Deputy from any part of the country be under any doubt that&mdash;apart from the propagandist activity of the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the vagueness of the President&mdash;the principal assistance which they got in bringing about their victory at the last election was from the I.R.A.  That was so in the country districts, and very much so.  There is many a Deputy in this House who is perfectly well aware of that, and the minds of those Deputies are represented by people like Deputy Dowdall rather than by the mere passing statement of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, which means nothing so far as effective action is concerned.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dowdall can get up here, slander by means of questions a body like the Blue Shirts and praise up a body like the I.R.A., thus following the laudable example of his President, who utilises this House to circulate lies about his political opponents.  Deputy Dowdall does not do that; he shelters himself behind a question.  The Minister is probably just a little jealous that any praise for the victory at the last election should go to other than his own propagandist ability.  Therefore, he will deny what the whole country knows to be a fact; he will deny that one of the principal factors and one of the principal forces which led to the victory of the Government at the last election was one of those illegal bodies.</P>
    <P>The Government will take every step to beat down their political opponents.  I ask anybody who has been in this House for the last couple of weeks whether it is not quite clear that their real idea is to attack a political organisation, and that they are not influenced by any fear of the employment of force by the League of Youth movement.  That is absolutely clear.  Their objection is to political opposition, and they are determined to utilise all the machinery of the State, helped by the anti-State machinery as well, to beat down their opponents. Let them at least carry out the pretence, <Col N="701" /> in the acceptance of this amendment, that they are not hand in glove with the I.R.A.; that there are no conferences or anything of that kind between them; that they have done with all that.  Let them carry out that pretence by accepting this amendment. To that limited extent, this amendment should act as an acid test of the sincerity of much of the talk of the Government.  It is a serious matter that in any country, and particularly here, those in a responsible position should bandy about the words &ldquo;civil war&rdquo; and so on, and especially men, who, in the past, have themselves been largely responsible for catastrophies of that kind&mdash;an effort to frighten the people into thinking that if they do not bow to the dictatorship of that particular Party, the ordinary constitutional methods are going to cease.  We know what their attitude, right through, has been to these organisations.  These organisations may be disowned now and then when there is no serious opposition, in the way of another organisation, to the Government but they will still remain the allies of the Government and it is probably largely to placate them that this Bill has been introduced.  Let the Government make it quite clear, at least so far as words and professions go, where they stand in regard to respect for the law.  Political parties are to be suppressed; unauthorised armies are to be encouraged!  Up to the present, that has been the attitude of the Government.</P>

      <P>The amendment before the House is, of course, a frivolous amendment but if Deputies opposite want to discuss it seriously, I suppose we must humour them.  The fact, of course, is that any organisation which has for its object the overthrow of the Constitution of Saorstát Eireann by force of arms is an illegal organisation whether it is uniformed or not and there are a number of Acts on the Statute Book which give the Government adequate powers to deal with possession of firearms or the use of firearms without authority.  This Bill <Col N="702" /> is a Bill designed to prohibit the wearing of uniforms by political parties because the wearing of such uniforms has provoked disorder in this country and in other countries, and may here lead to a much more dangerous situation. I think that these remarks really dispose of the amendment but arising out of the discussion upon it, there are certain other things to be said.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Sullivan talked about people seeing things through distorted glasses.  The Party opposite might just consider for a moment whether that description does not fully apply to themselves.  We had Deputy McGilligan here yesterday asking that nobody should countenance any political Party which tried to achieve its objects by means other than argument and persuasion, speeches to the public and appeals to intelligence.  The obvious question that arises when that statement is made by a Deputy opposite is: &ldquo;Why the Blue Shirts?&rdquo;  Why is it necessary to supplement argument and persuasion and appeals to intelligence by the militarisation of the supporters of that Party?  We had a number of half-hearted attempts to explain the need which the Party opposite felt they had for political uniforms but they were very unconvincing.  If, however, we are now to get from that Party a new policy, such as that enunciated by Deputy McGilligan, we want to know, as we have endeavoured to find out in respect of every declaration of policy that comes from that side of the House, if it has been agreed to by all the others, because Deputy McGilligan's declaration in that regard was in flat contradiction of all the declarations made by other members of that Party during the course of that same debate.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to ensure that political Parties in this country will endeavour to achieve their objects only by methods of argument and persuasion and appeals to intelligence and I suggest to the Party opposite that the sole reason for their trying to regiment their supporters and to put them into uniforms is because they feel that by the argument and persuasion and the appeal to intelligence which they can make, they are not likely to get very far.</P>

      <P>I am afraid I did not catch that.  Deputy MacDermot talked here yesterday about adventitious aids. No doubt they feel the need for such aids in view of the very limited appeal which they could make to the intelligence of the people of this country, the inadequacy of the arguments they could put forward and the inefficacy of the persuasion they could bring to bear on the public, but something more has got to be done than merely securing a general acceptance from all Parties that argument and persuasion are to be the only political weapons recognised.  We have got to get from the Party opposite in particular a more lively sense of their responsibilities.  No doubt some Deputies opposite read the report of a speech made by Deputy McGilligan at Lucan on Sunday last.  I think it is about time that that type of speech ceased to be made in this country and that responsible representatives of the Party opposite endeavoured to dissuade Deputy McGilligan or any other of their colleagues who wanted to speak in that strain from doing so.  Deputy McGilligan talked about this country pilfering the annuities and made a number of similar remarks in the same strain.  I ask them if they can contemplate a member of the Opposition of any other country in the world making a speech like that in similar circumstances?</P>

      <P>We have been told that the Government has discriminated in favour of illegal armies and against political parties.  There are really two statements contained in that sentence. The first is that we have discriminated in favour of illegal armies.  Deputy McGilligan, in the course of his remarks here yesterday, read out a long list of Acts enacted by the Government of which he was a member to deal with the situation that exists in this country&mdash;Firearms Acts, the Treasonable Offences Act, the Offences against the Person Act and Public Safety Acts&mdash;amounting to very nearly a dozen measures.  He did not draw the obvious conclusion from his argument. These Acts were passed by his Government and applied by his Government and, presumably, the fact that the situation which existed then to some extent still exists is an indication of the inefficacy of these Acts in achieving the desired results.  There is a situation here which arises out of our history.  You will not get rid of it by wishing it out of the way.  I think, of course, that it does not help us to get rid of it to have speeches like that we have just heard delivered by Deputy O'Sullivan.  He said that the main reason why Fianna Fáil became a Government was because it received, at the election, the support of the I.R.A.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy certainly implied the existence of an organisation so widespread, so strong, so organised and so efficient that it could operate against all natural laws to secure that result.  That is bunkum. May I point out to the Deputy that at the time he alleges that organisation was able to achieve that result, the Public Safety Act was in operation, the organisation had been banned under that Act, a special force had been recruited by his Government to suppress it, and all the resources of the Government at his command were being used day and night to break up that organisation.  The situation is there.  The various Acts upon the Statute Book have not ended it.  It may be that the policy of the Government is operating to bring that situation to an end.  We believe it is.  Surely, however, it is good policy at this stage, to make sure that it does not get worse.</P>
      <P>So much for that.  If I understand the logic of the arguments we have heard from the benches opposite, it is this: Because an illegal organisation exists, despite the efforts made over a number of years to terminate its existence, therefore the Fine Gael Party must be allowed to have their illegal organisation also; because the I.R.A. are there they must be allowed to build up a military organisation also.  That is the only logical deduction to be made from the arguments they have been using.  It is a rather childish attitude to be adopted by persons who were at one time members of what was supposed to be a responsible Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second horn of the statement made by Deputy O'Sullivan was that we are discriminating against political parties.  They must think that our memories are very short.  The Blue Shirt organisation is now masquerading as a political party it is true, but only for a very short period.  It was not founded as a political party.  It was not organised throughout the country as a political party.  On the contrary, those who brought it into existence and organised it emphasised day after <Col N="706" /> day, and week after week that they were not a political party and had no association with any political party. Again, I want to remind Deputies opposite of what were the precise words used.  I am quoting from an interview published in the Press by General O'Duffy in August last.  It runs as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The National Guard has again been referred to as an adjunct to a political party.  It should be now clear to all who wish to see that we are determined to keep the middle of the road, independent of all parties.  It was under these conditions that I accepted leadership. Those who allege that we are linked up with any political party or group of parties give us credit for very little intelligence.  Even if all the parties combined against us, we will go ahead, a civil, unarmed body with a clearly defined policy to put before the people.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>They are masquerading as a political party now.</P>

      <P>In case, however, it is necessary to underline what I have stated, I would like to read another statement made by General O'Duffy on the 16th August of last year, which, however, is still true to some extent. It runs as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The report of a difference between Mr. Cosgrave and General O'Duffy was ridiculed by General O'Duffy last evening.  There could be no split, he said, where there was no unity.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="707" /> I am not saying that that situation does not continue to operate.  It is quite clear that there is no unity, and that is why we have each member of the Party opposite rising to speak on this Bill and flatly contradicting the speakers that went before them; and when they do not do that they contradict the speeches of their titular leader outside.  Deputy McGilligan spoke to an amendment which asks us to confine the operation of this Bill to organisations which aim at overthrowing or changing the Constitution of Saorstát Eireann by force of arms. He spoke on that amendment in the strain.  I have indicated, asking that only those organisations would be countenanced which confined their operations to argument and persuasion. There is another way of overthrowing the constitutional Government of this State than by force of arms, and that is by the dissemination of subversive propaganda and sedition; and there are methods of supplementing arguments and persuasions which Deputies opposite have resorted to.</P>
    <P>I am going to read the extracts from their official organ which I read yesterday.  Deputies opposite can get them off by heart and repeat them. One quotation reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;But it should not be understood that there is a breach between Mr. Lemass and his leader on this matter.  They are both quite at one.  The policy of both is to make fine-sounding speeches, while at the same time they prostitute the authority received from God to serve the ends of gangsters instead of Government.&rdquo;</P>

They can take this from me, that so long as we are a Government any organisation that sets out to disseminate that type of propaganda is not going to be allowed to operate.  That is sedition.

      <P>The object of the organisation that this Bill is intended primarily to deal with is openly and avowedly to substitute for the democratic <Col N="711" /> institutions that now exist here some new form of constitution about which General O'Duffy learned for the first time when he took a fortnight's trip in the Mediterranean.  The main object of the Bill is to help the Government to preserve order.  I agree fully with the Deputies opposite that it will not be fully effective to that end unless something else goes with it.  I have read with great care the reports of events at meetings where disorder took place and in nine times out of ten that disorder was attributable to the use from platforms by speakers of the Party opposite of the vilest personal abuse against the leader of this Party.</P>

      <P>The Government has been administering justice with an even hand.  It has in every Department of the State, particularly the Department of Justice, been serupulously impartial.  We get allegations of partiality from the Party opposite. <i>An Phoblacht</i> every week is full of similar allegations.  One can perhaps understand the mentality behind the writers in <i>An Phoblacht</i> but it is not so easy to understand the mentality behind the Party opposite.  They come in here alleging that action taken against supporters of their Party for breaking the law is partial action.  I know that some members of the Party opposite have in all their public speeches made it quite clear that they regard themselves as in some way above the law.  They regard the present Government as an accidental product of a democratic system of election; a body that has no moral right to occupy these benches; that we are usurpers, people who have temporarily succeeded in driving the legitimate Government from power. That is their mentality.  That is the mentality that is responsible for the type of speech that we get from Deputies Fitzgerald and Mulcahy.</P>

      <P>Some Deputies opposite have not had time to develop that mentality but they are moving very rapidly in that direction.  It is that mentality which has produced the charges of partiality which are completely unfounded.  In fact, as President de Valera said here, so anxious was the Government to avoid the possibility of that charge being justly levelled against it, so conscious were we of the fact that we constituted the first change of Government in this State, and that every act of ours in the first year or two was going to be a precedent for others, that we leaned backwards until our own supporters at the Party convention accused us of forgiving our enemies and forgetting our friends.  One allegation was as untrue as the other.  It is not always easy in every issue that arises to determine the strict and proper course to take.  But the Government has striven to find that course on every issue and when it has found it it has courageously followed it irrespective of who it offended or who it pleased.</P>
      <P>There is one other thing to which I want to refer.  Deputy McGilligan here yesterday deplored the fact that there were people in the country in possession of arms.  Why has the Party opposite chosen to make heroes of those of its supporters who have been convicted in the courts for having been in the possession of arms?  When members of the Blue Shirt organisation were arrested and convicted for possession of arms they were met on release by the leaders of the organisation and by public processions of bands and parades.  Is that the way to discourage the use of arms in this country?  Not at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The members of the organisation preach one policy here and another policy outside but their real intentions are different from what they preach here.  Their real intentions are shown in these public receptions given to convicted criminals, men who have served sentences in goal for the possession of arms.  They want to encourage in the minds of their supporters the idea that the man who has a gun and who is prepared to use that gun is the best type of member.  That is because <Col N="714" /> in the back of their minds all the time there is the feeling that the opportunity may be for them to get back to power by it.  Deputies MacDermot and Dillon are very innocent people.  They have come recently into Irish polities but they are mixed up with men about whose antecedents they know little. We know a lot.  There was behind the I.R.A. who fought against the Black and Tans a secret organisation.  President de Valera was not a member of that.  I was not a member of it and large numbers of the I.R.A. were not members of it, but it was this secret organisation that largely controlled the policy of the Irish movement for a time.</P>

But they are not.  Certainly we are not taking them at the value they put upon themselves. We are not taking them or any of their associates at their face value.

But for 20 centuries the stomachs of men have been turned by the man who went up to the Temple to pray and praise himself at the same time.  There is something particularly nauseating to me when I hear the Minister for Industry and Commerce with tears in his voice deploring the nasty language that was used about President de Valera.  How natural it is that there should be riot and disturbance at meetings when there is nasty language used about President de Valera.  But hear the Minister for Finance at Mallow:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We will have his name spat upon as the names of Carey, Nagle, Leonard McNally, Pitt and Castlereagh and every other man who betrayed the Irish people.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Wait a while, there are plenty more.  Here is another extract from the Minister for Finance:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Mr. Cosgrave tried unsuccessfully to get members of other Parties to join his Party, but he was unclean and a leper amongst politicians.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Referring to Deputy Cosgrave Mr. MacEntee asked</P>
      <P>&ldquo;if people would have faith in the oath of Judas.  Would they be misled by the pledge of Pitt or the promise of Castlereagh?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The President intervened then to restore good nature and kindness, to promote public order and to prevent outbursts of righteous indignation.  In fact we might take it, it was a précis of his views to assume the habit of St. Francis for politicians.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="717" />&ldquo;It is up to the Government to see that opportunities for free speech are given but the Government cannot possibly make people or causes popular.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Is that the situation?  Perhaps the Attorney-General would favour us with his views when the President of the Executive Council gets up and says to every hooligan and blackguard in the country:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;my poor fellows, I sympathise with you; we do not blame you for what you are doing.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We must return again to the moderation and peace and conciliation of the Minister for Finance who, speaking at Navan, said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Knaves and traitors stand aside, Way for Ireland, Faugh a Ballagh.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then we have the Minister for Finance at Mallow saying:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Deputy MacDermot is one of the old Whig Castle Catholics with his puppy-dogs Belton, Cussen and O'Shaughnessy, arm in arm, breast high for England, every one of them trying to get into the good graces of England.&rdquo;</P>

Every dastardly charge that could be made, the most loathsome charge that could be made on any platform in Ireland&mdash;the charge of being a traitor against this country&mdash; was bandied about by every member of the Fianna Fáil Party all over the country and then we have the Minister getting up weeping crocodile tears over the dreadful language used about the leader of his Party.  Let there be no doubt about it, nobody on these benches desires to see scurrility in public life.  Nobody invokes scurrility against the President or anybody else <Col N="718" /> but when you have filth of that kind coming from the Party opposite there comes a time when it is legitimate to examine the source from which these charges come.  Let me say deliberately that if the charge &ldquo;traitor&rdquo; is made from any gentlemen on those benches, I will examine the source from which it comes and let everyone take notice from the President down to the meanest backbencher&mdash;and some of them are pretty mean on the back benches of Fianna Fáil&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy can get up and quote from my speeches after I have done.  There is a very simple amendment on the Paper here to-day. It is designed to alter this Bill to read in Section 2:</P>
      <P>It shall not be lawful for any person to wear any uniform or badge which is indicative of membership of, affiliation to, or support of a political party or an association ancillary to a political party which aims at overthrowing or changing the Constitution of Saorstát Eireann by force of arms.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce quoted at some length for the purpose of bringing home to this Party a charge of sedition.  It was pointed out to him that the words that he had quoted had been examined by the Attorney-General of the Fianna Fáil Government and had not been found by him to be sedition, but the Minister for Industry and Commerce swept that contention aside and said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I think it is sedition and my influence will carry considerable weight in the counsels of the Government which will be charged with the carrying out of this Act.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What does Deputy Corish, Deputy Davin and the other members of the Labour Party think of that?  The opinion of the Attorney-General is to count for nothing and anything that <Col N="719" /> seems to the Minister for Industry and Commerce to be sedition will be sedition. Any Party which says or does anything which, in the opinion of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, is sedition will be dealt with accordingly. Are these the principles of liberty and democracy for which the Labour Party stand?  That is what they are going to be asked to vote for.</P>
    <P>The only purpose of this amendment is to secure that the Minister's discretion will be limited and that if he proposes to arraign an organisation on the ground that it is seditious and subversive of public order, there will be an obligation on him to prove that that organisation aims at the overthrow of the Constitution by force of arms.  I have no doubt the Labour Party will vote against that amendment and Deputy Corish and Deputy Davin know in their hearts that they are going to do it because their leader has sold out to the Fianna Fáil Party and he has got to do what they tell him to do.</P>

      <P>I have not the least intention.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce proceeded to allege that members of this organisation contradicted one another in one speech after another.  Deputy MacDermot interrupted him with the word &ldquo;quote.&rdquo;  Deputy MacDermot did the Minister too great a credit.  Deputy MacDermot, I imagine, is coming to realise as most of us realise that the Minister is a gentleman who is prepared to say anything, anywhere, anyhow, without any regard to its truth or without any regard to its significance. It is only pretty Fanny's way and we do not expect anything else from him. It is really unkind when the Minister makes one of his more reckless statements <Col N="720" /> to ask him to quote, because he is simply not able to do it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Professor O'Sullivan said here to-day that the I.R.A. played no small part in restoring the Fianna Fáil Government to office in 1933.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce promptly, in his usual way, said that Deputy O'Sullivan had stated something else entirely and then proceeded to disprove it.  He said that Fianna Fáil got into office in 1932 as a result of the support given it by the I.R.A. They did not do any such thing.  They got into office by promising peace. They got into office by promising an end to coercion in this country.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce was shocked at the speech Deputy McGilligan made at Lucan, and said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If I had my way, Parties who allow their members to make speeches of that kind would be made an end of in this country.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the next breath he said that it was <Col N="721" /> highly probable, the Attorney-General notwithstanding, that he would have his way.  How thinks the Labour Party of that?  If they have any reason to criticise the Government trenchantly, if they have any reason to say that the Minister for Industry and Commerce, when he alleges that unemployment is decreasing in this country, is making a fraudulent pretension, is twisting the figures of his Department to make them prove something that is not true, the Minister for Industry and Commerce may think that sedition.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce may think that something that no member of a Party should be allowed to say.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce may go further and say: &ldquo;This allegation is calculated to incite revolution in the land, and the Party that does that will be suppressed and made an end of.&rdquo; There will be no obligation on the Minister for Industry and Commerce to prove that the Labour Party is one which aims at overthrowing or changing the Constitution of Saorstát Eireann by force of arms.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Again and again the line of the Fine Gael Party has been trotted out here by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  General O'Duffy at no time in his life, either when director general of the National Guard or leader of the United Ireland Party, stated that he sanctioned for a single moment the overthrow or the alteration of the Constitution or the institutions of this State by force of arms.  He has said that repeatedly in public and in private&mdash;that nothing would justify any body of people in this country taking up arms against the lawfully constituted Government of the people.</P>

      <P>We want to see Deputy Everett get up here to-day and explain the position of his Party to the House and to the country.  I was saying that General O'Duffy has laid down again and again in public and in private that no body of men in this country has the right to take up arms for the purpose of overthrowing the lawfully constituted Government of the Irish people, and at the present moment the Government seated on those benches is the lawfully constituted Government of this country.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>And the present Government of this country has nothing to fear from this organisation, or any part of this organisation, by way of an armed attempt to overthrow them. We will overthrow that Government by constitutional means.  We will overthrow that Government at the next general election, and they know it. They will postpone the general election as long as they can in order to try and keep their positions, but I am happy&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Do not be so sure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that the volume of public opinion rising in this country now will force them to a general election at no far distant date.  So far as we are concerned the sooner <Col N="723" /> the better.  It is only through that instrument that we propose to overthrow that Government, and it is through that instrument that we are going to overthrow the Government. Mind you, Ministers deplore statements that are made by prominent members of this Party, as being statements made by responsible men calculated to create uneasiness in the public mind.  What are we to say when a Minister of State gets up here and makes a statement which I believe he knows to be untrue, that this organisation is concerned to overthrow the State by force of arms.  He knows that it is untrue.  And bear in mind this is a Minister of Government who has increased the Secret Service Vote to £25,000; who has more spies in his pay to-day than any Government in this country ever had; who has sources of secret information far more numerous than any Government in this country ever had, and he is paying for them.  I have not the slightest doubt he has plenty of spies scattered through our organisation, and the poor fellows are twiddling their thumbs with nothing to do, because the organisation is perfectly open.  If the Attorney-General knows anything that is of a confidential or, criminal or improper character let him get up and say so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="The Attorney-General The Attorney-General">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Your spies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt they are as near General O'Duffy as your money can bring them, and they are welcome.  There is absolutely nothing going on in any department of our organisation to which the Government spies are not heartily welcome, if the poor fellows can get a day's work in coming there.  It will be so many more off the rolls of the unemployed.  If the Minister cannot get employment for them in any other way but as spies on the United Ireland Party they might be very much worse employed, <Col N="724" /> and they are heartily welcome to their day's pay.  Although the Government has a full knowledge of every detail of what is going on every day in our organisation the Minister for Industry and Commerce gets up here, and, speaking as a Minister of the Irish Government, says that our organisation means to overthrow this State by force of arms.  He knows that is not true.  If it were true the insertion of that amendment would not stay his hand in the very least degree.  It is because he knows that it is not true that he will not accept that amendment. He knows that if the burden were placed upon him of proving that our organisation desired to overthrow the institutions of this State by force of arms he could not prove it.  He has had so many tosses and reverses in the High Courts of this country during the last three or four months that he does not want to break any more bones there.  He wants at least to get an instrument sufficiently comprehensive and sufficiently sweeping that even the Fianna Fáil Attorney-General will be able to wield it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far, the legislation of this country has been wielded by the Law Department of the Fianna Fáil Government. They have broken the window, and they have broken the door; they have hit their own supporters and they have jailed their own supporters, but still they cannot get at us, for the very simple reason that we have not broken the law; that we do not believe in breaches of the law and that we do not believe in defiance of the Government, or the courts, or the law. Accordingly, a Bill is drafted which will make it possible to get after the people of this country who stand for the observance of the law, who stand for the maintenance of the law, and who stand for the right of the elected Government of the Irish people to rule this country.  In order to do that they have to draft the Bill which is before us at the present time, and they have to refuse that amendment.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce asked what do you want Blue Shirts for? If your protestations are all true what do you want Blue Shirts for?  I will <Col N="725" /> tell the Minister what we want them for.  We were three or four months going around this country trying to get a hearing from the rowdy elements of the Minister's own supporters.  It could not be done.  Deputy Davin himself admitted that it could not be done.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Until that <i>esprit de corps</i> had been formed, until that organisation had been called into existence, until that evidence of solidarity was brought into the land, the blackguards had their own way, as Deputy Davin said, and now they have not.  Now we can go to any town or city in this State and hold a meeting; hold it peacefully; say what we have to say; allow our supporters to come in and hear it, and quietly disperse.  The Ministers know that.  It is because they know that, and it is because the back benchers of their Party know it, that this Bill is being brought into existence.  This Bill is being brought into existence to destroy the League of Youth, because the back benchers supporting the Minister for Industry and Commerce are afraid of the League of Youth.</P>
      <P>What they are afraid of is that the League of Youth will create a situation wherein they lose their seats and the present Government will go out of office.  The Minister got pious last night and in the course of his piety he announced that it was a source of grief to him that Deputy MacDermot had said that nobody on the Government Benches had ever said there was now no need for the I.R.A.  I think that Deputy MacDermot also said that nobody on the Government Benches had ever said there was now no need for carrying arms except by licence from the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;There is no need for the I.R.A.,&rdquo; said the Minister.  &ldquo;It has been <Col N="726" /> repeatedly pointed out by us that the maintenance and development of that organisation could only have one result, and that was the fomentation of civil war, and that those who were in that organisation, if they had any idea that it could be used for any purpose but for fighting brother-Irishmen, were very foolish.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Is that not a very pious declaration? That is made when it suits the Minister; but Senator Comyn, speaking in the Seanad, in the presence, I think, of the Minister for Justice, struck the table and defied the Minister for Justice to attempt to put an end to the I.R.A.  He said &ldquo;The I.R.A. will be here so long as the Irish people are the Irish people,&rdquo; and he clearly implied that the moth-eaten crew that were sitting on the front bench of the Fianna Fáil Government did not count for a snap of the fingers; that the real power in this land was the headquarters staff of the I.R.A., and that he, Senator Comyn, was very glad to know of it. Somebody must have told Senator Dowdall about the eloquent speech Senator Comyn had made and he sent for his little brother.  Deputy Dowdall&mdash;he is not in his accustomed place&mdash;was put up here yesterday and he says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The I.R.A. had its roots since the Anglo-Normans came to Ireland.  It represented the Irish people. People who went out with masks on their faces were not I.R.A., but only ruffians.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He has the pious bit in at the end, too, but observe this, that Deputy Dowdall says the I.R.A. represent the Irish people.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce says, on the next page:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It has been repeatedly pointed out by us that the maintenance and development of that organisation only could have one result and that was the fomentation of civil war.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Which is Deputy Dowdall right or the Minister for Industry and Commerce? Perhaps Deputy Carty would intervene between them and judge.  Would he say that the I.R.A. ought to be <Col N="727" /> done away with?  Would Deputy Traynor say that the I.R.A. ought to be done away with?  Would Deputy Smith say that the I.R.A. ought to be done away with?  Would Deputy Moylan say that the I.R.A. ought to be done away with?  There is a painful silence&mdash;a most embarrassing silence. What has happened to the Minister's supporters on the back benches?  It is really most distressing&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It is bad enough to have the back benchers letting down the Minister, but let the Minister not start letting down his President or chaos will break out altogether. He was told by the President that examination of the events of 1919, 1920, 1921, 1922 and 1923 was best left to one side; that it could do neither of us any good and that it can revive memories in neither of us that will contribute anything to the solution of our present difficulties, but still I think the Minister, who charges inconsistency on these benches, ought carefully to examine his conscience.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Let him sit quiet for a couple of minutes.  We are face to face with a situation in which the Government of this country have expressed their intention of smashing the constitutional Opposition, if and when it offends the Minister for Industry <Col N="729" /> and Commerce&mdash;and the Attorney-General need not look surprised, as he seems to do at the moment.  He got his walking papers from the Minister who said that, Attorney-General or no Attorney-General, his was the voice that carried in the councils of this Government and that he would see that, whether the Attorney-General thought it sedition or not, the Government would think it sedition.  The Attorney-General has no business intervening; he does not count as much now as a rag doll, so far as the Minister for Industry and Commerce is concerned. This Bill is designed to give the Minister for Industry and Commerce the power to smash his constitutional political opponents, if and when he considers them to be a constitutional menace to the survival of his own Party.  This Party has put down an amendment to take that power from that Government.  The back benchers of Fianna Fáil will vote against this amendment because they want to see the constitutional Opposition to them destroyed.  The Labour Party will vote against this amendment because they have sold their souls to the Fianna Fáil Party for anything they can get out of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>

If I was in the position of the Labour Party I would go down to the Labour Party room and no one would see me in this House or outside it, except when I had to crawl into the Lobby at the tail of my new found masters.  Members of this Party will vote for this amendment because, while they would be prepared, now or any other time, to give any lawfully constituted Government, elected by the Irish people, all the powers they want impartially to preserve law and order in this country, they know that this Bill, without the amendment we propose to insert, is an instrument of tyranny in the hands of a Fianna Fáil Government. We know how the Fianna Fáil Government has used these <Col N="730" /> things in the past.  We have heard from the Minister for Industry and Commerce how these instruments are to be used in the future.  Any man who votes against that amendment is voting for turning this country into a slave country.  We have heard the fable of the fox that lost its tail. He wanted every other fox to do the same.  We know the slave mind that prevails on those benches, and its greatest irritant is that there are not enough men in this country who have that kind of mentality.  Not having that kind of mentality, Fianna Fáil is going to do its best to-day to turn the free men of this country into slaves.</P>

      <P>Very well, Sir.  Deputy Dillon tells us in his speech that the carrying through of this measure, without this particular amendment, will do away with the constitutional Opposition of the Government.  The Bill is intended to do away with the wearing of uniforms and, as far as the Blue Shirt organisation is concerned, to do away with the blue shirts.  After all the speeches that have been made by General O'Duffy, and after all the speeches that have been made by Deputy MacDermot and Deputy Dillon &mdash;and every conceivable type of speech has been made by them in turn&mdash;are we to take it now that there is nothing in their policy and nothing in their opposition except the blue shirt?</P>

      <P>On a point of order, Sir. We are discussing a particular section and a particular amendment which, in effect, seeks to confine the operation of this measure to any organisation designed to overthrow the Government by force of arms.  I submit that Deputy Cleary is addressing this House <Col N="732" /> on general policy&mdash;on General O'Duffy's policy.  I think he ought to confine himself to this amendment, which aims at including the I.R.A. in the Bill.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Neill should have been a little more voluable than he was, when Deputy Dillon was speaking, if he wanted to prevent us talking about the Blue Shirt policy. Deputy Dillon stated that the carrying through of this measure without this particular amendment would do away with all opposition to this Government. Therefore, we are to take it that there is no policy in the Opposition. The Blue Shirt organisation, the U.I.P. organisation, the Cumann na nGaedheal organisation, the Farmers' Party, the Centre Party&mdash; that were all rolled into one&mdash;have no policy whatever, and, immediately that the Blue Shirt organisation goes, all is wiped out.  There will be no policy and nothing left but the bare backs of the poor unfortunate Blue Shirts.  That is a serious statement. The people opposite did not realise it themselves.  I think that if they searched their minds and went even to Deputy Belton he would be able to get some substitute for them other than the Blue Shirts for a policy to go on.  I think it is hard luck on the Opposition, after all the coming together of parties and after all the mergers, that there is nothing left but the Blue Shirts.  I think it is deplorable, and if we were convinced that they were unable to get any policy to go on, I, for one, would not like to see them go out of public life. I would not deprive them of the little joy they get in going around to meetings on Sundays, nor would I deprive them of the joy of the abuse they are anxious to hurl at members of the Front Bench over here.  We would be anxious to keep them in opposition.</P>

      <P>The position is that this Bill has been brought in to ban uniforms in this State.  I think that the Party opposite will have to admit that the organisation to which they belong is not being interfered with.  I understood that the Blue Shirt organisation is a Youth movement, which is only an adjunct of the political Party opposite.  Is there anything at all in the policy of their Party, or in the U.I.P., as it is known, or have they no policy there?  Are they only depending on the Blue Shirt organisation?  They should be able to get away from that statement of Deputy Dillon, and, as the organisation to which they belong is a political organisation, not wearing a uniform, it will not be affected in the slightest degree by this measure without this amendment that is under discussion at the moment.  Besides, there are many members of the Party opposite who have not worn a blue shirt yet.  It will not affect them.  I think the arguments of Deputy Dillon, like all the other arguments over there, are simply a pretence, and they themselves know that their statements are false and not grounded on fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another statement of Deputy Dillon is that the back benchers of Fianna Fáil are anxious to ban the Blue Shirts because our seats are in danger on account of this Blue Shirt organisation. Well, I know my own county very well, and there is nobody in that organisation in my county but was <Col N="734" /> always a most ardent and bitter opponent of ours.  Everyone that is in that organisation down there to-day was an active worker at all the elections over a number of years on behalf of the Opposition Parties, and a very active worker against us.  We knew their strength in times gone by; we know it to-day.  I can assure Deputy Dillon and other Deputies that no matter whether the Blue Shirts are allowed to wear these shirts or not, they are not going to affect the Government in the least or to endanger the seats of any Deputies here.  As I said yesterday, we are going to make a present of every single man in that organisation to them.  It will not affect us.  It will keep our organisation all the cleaner, all the better, and all the stronger by these men who are in the Blue Shirt organisation being in some organisation apart from ours.  They need not worry about the seats of Fianna Fáil back benchers.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon would like to have a long speech about the I.R.A. and the past history of that organisation.  As it had its roots in the past, it should not be apologised for by any members on either side of this House to Deputy Dillon or to Deputy MacDermot either. There was a time in the old days when that organisation was solely depended upon by the national movement in this country.  It cannot be helped that a certain tradition has lived on; and certain men cannot be blamed if they feel that the tradition of the old organisation is being carried on by them to-day.  I should not like that in this debate, or at any time in the future, Deputies on either side of the House should have to apologise at least for the great old past of the I.R.A. to men like Deputy Dillon.  I think it is deplorable sometimes to see a man like Deputy Dillon getting up in this House in the proud position he is able to be in and sneer at men on all sides of the House because of their association in the past with the I.R.A. It speaks badly for public opinion that that should be allowed to go on. It speaks badly for certain Deputies opposite.  I would prefer that that thing should be left out of it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="735" /> For the past week Deputies opposite have been asking: &ldquo;Why do you not ban the I.R.A.?&rdquo;  It has been hurled at the Government Benches.  If the I.R.A. were banned will they say that they will stop militarising their political organisation or that they will give up the Blue Shirts?  Do they hold that the I.R.A. is a bad organisation; that it is wrong to have it in existence? If it is wrong and unlawful to have that organisation in existence why should there be another one in existence? If it is wrong to have the I.R.A. in existence how is it right to create another wrong?  Two wrongs do not make a right.  If their policy is based on one wrong and they want to create another, that is a very poor argument.  That is how they are making their case.  I hold that things would be very much better if they faced up to facts and admitted what they know to be true, that this Bill will not affect the political organisation opposite.  It will affect one thing, and it is a very serious thing so far as Deputies opposite are concerned, and it is the reason for this amendment&mdash;it will enable the Government to rule here more peaceably.  It will enable the Government by ruling more peaceably to go ahead with its policy more effectively and that is the thing Deputies opposite do not want.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon told us that the Government got in on promises.  One of the promises was to give peace to this country.  They gave peace to this country, more than was given for a number of years before.  Deputies opposite know well that it was only when they saw that peace was being given effectively here by the Government without coercion that they set about creating rows, that they started their rowdyism and recruited young men, as Senator Blythe did, to smash to smithereens the I.R.A.  It is because that peace has been effectively given that the Opposition came to the decision that they would bring about a state of affairs by which the Government could not rule.  That is what their efforts have been directed to for a number of months past and they are succeeding very well.  I hold that this <Col N="736" /> Bill being passed without this amendment will strengthen the Government's hands against any organisation that tries to militarise themselves and pretend that they are playing a peaceable game while they are doing the other thing at the same time.</P>

      <P>The speech that we have just listened to from Deputy Cleary is the kind of propaganda speech that is one of the root causes of most of the trouble in this country. A number of people, of irresponsibles, shall I say, have contributed very largely to bringing this country into the state in which we now find it. But, when a responsible citizen of this State, occupying the position of a Deputy in this House, makes a speech of this character, which I know to be the kind of speech which he delivers in the County Mayo and elsewhere from time to time, what can we expect from the persons who are labelled as irresponsibles? The Deputy spoke at some length about the aims and objects of the Blue Shirt organisation.  I have been charged in this House no later than last evening with not being a member of the Blue Shirt organisation. That charge was made by Deputy Davin in support of some of his arguments. Because I am not a member of that organisation, I feel that my contribution to this debate should be more acceptable to Deputy Davin and others like him who profess to respect an unbiased and non-partisan opinion. That is the kind of thing we hear from persons who I thought at one period were intelligent.  Deputy Davin found fault with me because I was not a member of the Blue Shirt organisation. I submit that because of that fact alone, if for no other reason, my views should carry more weight than those of Deputy Davin and his associates who are blinded by prejudice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cleary told the House, having listened to some of the speeches about the organisation, that the U.I.P. felt that if the Blue Shirts were to be disbanded to-morrow they would then have no policy.  With that kind of reasoning that is peculiar to certain people in his own county, the Deputy felt that once the Blue Shirts were disbanded and detached from <Col N="737" /> the U.I.P. that organisation (the U.I.P.) had no policy.  In other words, that their policy was wrapped up in their blue shirts.  I want to suggest in reply that Deputy Cleary's policy is wrapped up in a hair shirt. The hair shirt has been suggested by the President.  I would like to ask Deputy Cleary whether he would prefer a comfortable blue shirt or the discomfort of the hair shirt advocated by the President?</P>
    <P>We had the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who built up in his usual way a very good case here to-day but he built it on a false thesis.  I need hardly point out to this House, composed as it is in the main of intelligent persons&mdash;of course, I except a good many on the Government Benches from that&mdash;but the members of this House know, and the Attorney-General knows and the capable and able lawyers in the Government Party know very well that on a false premises and on a false thesis one can build up a good case.  We had the Minister for Industry and Commerce telling us that there was a good deal of false propaganda, or what he classed as false propaganda, issued and published by certain organisations in this country and he went on to build up a great case against the Blue Shirt organisation, all the time forgetting&mdash;and mind you I am quite detached from these organisations&mdash; that since the establishment of that organisation the leaders have proclaimed in public and private that they desire to achieve their ends by ordinary constitutional methods and means.</P>
    <P>Side by side with all that, you had read out last night some of the official documents issued by the I.R.A., for which Deputy Cleary pretends to have such great respect.  I do not disrespect the old I.R.A., but I have the most utter contempt for what is called the new I.R.A.  I have utter contempt for the assassin and utter contempt for the bully.  The bully and the assassin are a type which I do know has become more numerous in this country since the advent of Fianna Fáil into office and power, more numerous than it has ever been before.  In the old I.R.A. <Col N="738" /> there were men who were prepared to take their lives in their hands.  And at least they went out against the other fellow who was armed.  But the new I.R.A., the people who are giving your Government support are the cowardly bullies and blackguards who come along with the revolver&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Didn't I?  We had Deputy Davin talking here yesterday evening.  He deprecated my defence, if you like, of the organisation known as the Blue Shirt or Youth movement. He suggested rather humorously in his speech that I was the big drummer of the Blue Shirt band.  I always enjoy a humorous speech.  I am always rather intrigued, to use a word in common use, by a humorous speech but I do feel that that was in reply to a stricture of mine on one occasion when I described the whole of that Party as the tin whistlers in the Fianna Fáil Party and the weakest and the most anaemic whistler in the whole band was Deputy Davin.  I find that state of things again in evidence this evening. In discussing a motion of this kind of such moment and importance to the ordinary working class people in this country, a very large number of whom are to be found in the Blue Shirt organisation and a very large number of whom are to be found in the ranks of the Fianna Fáil organisation, we have not even one member of the Labour Party present.  Some time ago when I interjected that we had not one member present I corrected myself immediately afterwards by saying that there was at least one, namely the Deputy from Wicklow, Deputy Everett. I am reminded of the song &ldquo;The last rose of summer left blooming alone.&rdquo; The one member present out of that virile strong Party is&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am reminded by one of the most humorous back benchers of the Fianna Fáil Party of the Vale of Avoca.  Let me now say that when I am reminded that one member of the Labour Party was present I am also reminded of another famous line&mdash;&ldquo;The barque was still there but the waters were gone.&rdquo;  The Minister for Industry and Commerce spoke here at some length this evening with the usual vehemence and the usual style of Sunday morning Hyde Park oratory. He thumped with his fist on the desk and told us we were heading for a dictatorship or that we would enter into a dictatorship or that it would lead to a dictatorship if General O'Duffy were allowed to organise along the peaceful lines on which he is organising.  He read into the method and organisation of General O'Duffy something that General O'Duffy has always controverted and contradicted on all occasions.  We have heard Deputy Davin and Deputy Norton also claiming that if the Blue Shirt organisation were allowed to develop along constitutional lines&mdash;because nobody has suggested that this organisation is armed or that it has ever been armed&mdash;that General O'Duffy might at one time become a dictator in this country.  I want to proclaim here and now, much as I dislike dictatorship, and I have devoted a good portion of my life proclaiming against these things, and I pride myself on being a democrat since I came to the use of reason, I would much prefer a dictatorship by General O'Duffy to the dictatorship of the mob, the mob dictatorship which we are experiencing at the present moment.</P>

      <P>I do not translate that word &ldquo;mob&rdquo; in the same way as Deputies on the other side of the House do.  I never confused the word &ldquo;mob&rdquo; with democrats.  You have. We heard read out last evening an extract from a propaganda journal issued by the U.I.P. Other extracts were read out this evening from the <Col N="740" /> same paper by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  He talks about vile abuse and all that kind of thing. I deprecate that kind of abuse or the use of that kind of language no matter from what side it may come.  But I would like to face up to the facts as I find them.  We have heard for the past week a good deal about sedition from the members of the Government. We heard sedition preached long before they came into office, but I would prefer to draw the cloak of charity over those things and to forget the past.  We are frequently reminded in this House about the things that happened in 1922 and 1923.  I have on occasions stood up in this House and asked Deputies opposite to try and forget that unfortunate period in Irish history.  If we did forget that we would be doing something better for the country than we are doing at the present moment.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce spoke about public receptions being given to persons who have broken the law.  Surely the Minister must be very forgetful if he cannot remember that in his own time public receptions, bands and banners were brought out to meet prisoners who were interned or sent to jail for certain offences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bands and banners were paraded. These bands and banners were paraded by members of the Government Party.  If the Minister for Justice wants to know the occasion on which these bands and banners were produced, I can mention the occasion on which he and other Ministers associated with him went up to Arbour Hill and to other prisons situated here in Dublin and released prisoners.  I agree that it was a very fine gesture and that in certain circumstances it was a gesture which would be appreciated by the persons who were imprisoned and were subsequently released, a gesture that would connote something to their followers in the country and, indeed, to all persons who had any hope at all that it would lead to a better state of affairs.  But what do we find?  We have found within recent months attacks made on respectable, law-abiding citizens in <Col N="741" /> Cork City and County.  One of these resulted in the death of the person assaulted.  This amendment simply asks you to include certain societies and organisations which aim at overthrowing or changing the Constitution of Saorstát Eireann by force of arms, within the ambit of this section.  Is there any reason in the world why the Government should not accept that amendment?  Personally, I cannot see any reason and I am not attached to any Party in this House.  I cannot see any reason why the Minister should not accept that and I will give this promise to the Minister.  If he accepts that amendment he can rely upon me at any time to support him in anything that aims at good government or better government.  If he accepts the amendment I will take any and every risk&mdash;and this offer is honestly made&mdash;to see that his Government is supported in the carrying out of that particular section of this Act.</P>
    <P>I do not, on account of the short time that is left, want to prolong the discussion any further but I do seriously suggest to the Minister that there is nothing in this amendment about which anybody need have any fears, except those persons who are prepared to support organisations which aim at overthrowing or changing the Constitution of Saorstát Eireann by force of arms.  Now that two or three members of the Labour Party are present I would put this question to them: Do you agree that it is a good thing to insert in this Bill, with all its defects and faults, if we are to preserve the freedom that has been won by constitutional agitation, the words in the amendment: &ldquo;organisations which aim at overthrowing or changing the Constitution of Saorstát Eireann by force of arms&rdquo;?  That is a simple and plain proposition demanding a simple and plain answer. If the Labour Party stand for any organisation which aims at overthrowing or changing the Constitution of Saorstát Eireann by force of arms, let them, by all means, vote against that amendment, but if they believe that once having established a Parliament in this country, established a <Col N="742" /> Free State, we are able to achieve most of the things we want at any rate by constitutional methods, by the use of the ballot box, they have to choose between that and the use of the bullet.  Which are they going to choose?  I suggest to the Labour Party that they ought to vote, as I intend to vote, for the inclusion of these words in the section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not intervene in this debate at this stage, only that last night and to-day the Minister for Industry and Commerce quoted certain things that were written and&mdash;at least, as far as the portions of them were concerned of which I was the writer&mdash; he applied the word &ldquo;seditious&rdquo; to certain of these things.  I object to that strongly for two reasons, (1) because as far as my action is concerned I consistently abhor sedition; and (2) because I think that in purporting to refute the doctrine I propounded, the Minister indicated clearly that he has a conception of Government and State which can only interpret itself in the form of tyranny. Last night I heard him read out a certain thing and, when I heard it, I thought it was a quotation from something I had written.  I confirmed that afterwards when I went up to the Official Reporters and obtained the quotation, which was as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If the Government misuses its power so that it injures rather than promotes the common good, then it may be that it can put laws on the statute book declaring it sedition to point out that fact, but it will still remain that the Government and not its critics is the party guilty of sedition.  The Government has received its authority for the purpose of promoting the common good. In so far as its power is used for that end it has the right to expect our loyal obedience to its laws but in so far as it departs from that end its ordinances have not the sanction of authority.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy MacDermot yesterday suggested that that was possibly a truism or that it was being distorted.  I would have thought it was a truism that the Government might have accepted, but the Minister for Industry and Commerce <Col N="743" /> worked himself into a frenzy in denouncing as appallingly immoral and seditious the doctrine I put forward there.  That is the doctrine that in spite of any legislation this Government may bring in I am going to stand by, but, although my conscience must be bound to a point by the civil laws, there are certain points it is not going to bind me to.  The actual doctrine I put forward there was that in respect to certain points it was possible for a Government to be guilty of sedition. My own personal opinion is that this present Government has been consistently guilty of sedition, but the Minister for Industry and Commerce seems to imply that to state that the Government can be guilty of sedition is in itself sedition.  If I am sinning in that respect I am sinning in very good company.  As a matter of fact, when I wrote that it was really a resumé from a section of St. Thomas's <i>Secunda Secundx,</i> Question 42, Article 2.  In writing that, I may say that I carefully soft-pedalled a certain aspect.  Having postulated the possibility of the Government using its power, not for the common good, I merely said that in so far as it departs from that end its ordinances have not the sanction of authority.  If I quoted directly I would have said: &ldquo;A tyrannical Government is not just, because it is directed not to the common good, but to the private good of the ruler, as the philosopher states; consequently there is no sedition in disturbing a Government of this kind, unless, indeed, the tyrant's rule be disturbed so inordinately that his subjects suffer greater harm from the consequent disturbance than from the tyrant's government.  Indeed, it is the tyrant rather that is guilty of sedition, since he encourages discord and sedition amongst his subjects, that he may lord over them more securely; for this is tyranny, being conducive to the private good of the ruler and to the injury of the multitude.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>No, I modified the end for this reason; the Government <Col N="744" /> is consistently saying that the Blue Shirt movement is aiming at a dictatorship. Now with the historical formation of our people I could conceive it quite possible that the natural tendency would be towards something that I would consider a dictatorship.  consequently, I think it is desirable to consistently point out to the people of this country that there must be a limit to State action.  At the same time, if the Minister for Industry and Commerce had cared to quote from other places he could have done so.  The very organ that he was quoting from has pointed out that it is necessary for the people, in the interests of general good order, even to put up with a certain amount of injustice.  I stated something there which is completely irrefutable.  It worked the Minister for Industry and Commerce into a state of frenzy.  I will give one or two other quotations in support of my thesis. &ldquo;Governments should moreover be administered for the well-being of the citizens, because they who govern others possess authority solely for the welfare of the State.&rdquo;  The Minister for Industry and Commerce was very angry at the suggestion that the Government could overstep the limit of its authority.  This Government, to my mind, is consistently overstepping it both by action and inaction. &ldquo;Furthermore, the civil power must not be subservient to the advantage of any one individual, or of some few persons.&rdquo;  The present Government has brought in the Seventeenth Amendment to the Constitution, which declares formally that organisations that either by end or by method fulfil certain conditions, which are abundantly fulfilled by the I.R.A., are unlawful, and the Government will not apply that law against them.  The civil power in this country is clearly subservient to the advantage of one individual or of some few persons.  It is seditious&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>It seems to me perfectly clear that we have been trying, in promoting our organisation, to curb the licence of our rulers.  It is perfectly clear from the speech or speeches of the Minister for Industry and Commerce that he objects strongly to any curbing of the licence of the Government. I certainly would object to any attempt to curb the legitimate action of the Government, but I maintain as a citizen that I certainly must do my best to curb the licence of the Government, which it exercises both in action and in inaction.  It declared a perfectly lawful association unlawful.  In doing that it was actually breaking the law, I think quite clearly, although the law does not provide any means of bringing them to book for it.</P>
    <P>Again quoting from the Encyclical &ldquo;Libertas&rdquo;: &ldquo;For the right to command and to require obedience exists only so far as it is in accordance with the authority of God and is within the measure that He has laid down.&rdquo;  The Minister for Industry and Commerce in his speeches clearly laid it down that there must be no measure and no limit put to the authority of the Government.  I intervene solely for the purpose of standing over what I wrote.  The most outstanding thing in this debate&mdash;and it has come out in other directions, too &mdash;is that the Minister for Industry and Commerce and his colleagues think that the Government of this country <Col N="746" /> must be absolute to the very extremist degree; that we are to be completely the creatures of the Government; that we are not to exercise any liberty at all, which means that no moral laws can operate amongst us; that we are to be merely serfs under organised control at the whim of the present Government. When it is pointed out to him that the Attorney-General, quite rightly, had allowed those things to pass, because they could not, under a proper conception by any right-minded person, be declared to be seditious, the Minister gets up and says in effect that he is the man with authority in the Government&mdash;not the Attorney-General&mdash;and that he is going to use his authority in complete defiance of a higher authority; to use the weapons of Government so as to exercise still greater tyranny against the people of this country.  Again, to quote from the same article of St. Thomas: &ldquo;Those, however, who defend the common good and withstand the seditious party&rdquo;&mdash; at the present moment this Government is the seditious party&mdash;&ldquo;are not themselves seditious, even as neither is a man to be called quarrelsome because he defends himself.&rdquo;  We are declared to be seditious because we point out that the Government is seditious; even though we point it out in the interests of the common good in this country.  Moreover, the crime held against the Blue Shirts, and against us in promoting the Blue Shirts, is that when the Government departed from its functions and allowed their blackguard supporters to break the law and interfere with the civil rights of the people of this country and with their security of life, the Blue Shirts came together to fulfil the functions that the Government had refused to fulfil.  Consequently, the Government is angered and it says that we are seditious, and that we are quarrelsome people because we defend ourselves.</P>
    <P>One of the most ominous things in the debate is that the Minister has revealed himself as a man incapable of thinking on any other lines than as a tyrant.  His whole point of view in <Col N="747" /> this matter, as indicated by him, means that the Government in which he is an important figure&mdash;no doubt he agrees with the other members of the Executive Council&mdash;with the ideas that it has, can only interpret its action in this country in a tyrannical way.  In doing that it is bound to promote disorder. It has done it negatively by fostering and by giving rights to certain unlawful associations&mdash;criminal associations in this country&mdash;which it denies to other people.  I pointed out on a previous occasion that though the ordinary citizen in this country has no right to possess arms unless he has a permit, the President himself got up and said that as far as the blackguards who are out to overthrow the Government of this country by force of arms are concerned he has no intention of trying to take their arms from them. As far as the law abiding citizens were concerned the law was to be made operative against them.  We have a Government whose whole conception of its functions can only be interpreted in the form of tyranny.  We have a contemptible slavish Labour Party who go in and vote for a Bill which the conscience of every one of them must know is for no other purpose whatever than to allow the Government to continue more effectively than it has previously done the prostitution of its authority in this country, and in doing so bring authority into contempt, and revive in the worst form the very worst features of our history, while it is inevitably tending to destroy in us that proper sense of respect and veneration for authority which we should have.  In the <i>United Irishman,</i> in so far as I am responsible for writings there, I have consistently tried to inculcate amongst our young people a realisation that we must respect all authorities.  I have also consistently said that the legitimate authority in this country is the present Government sitting on the benches opposite.  I put a limit to that, and say that when they act against the common good and against the interests of the people they are not acting with authority at all; they are merely acting as tyrants in this country.  It <Col N="748" /> should be pointed out to the people as frequently as possible that that is so, in order that the people may still be able to remember that they ought to have a respect for legitimate authority.</P>

      <P>They say that the devil can quote Scripture to suit himself, and we have the spectacle of Deputy Fitzgerald relying on St. Thomas to justify something which he published in his paper and to justify the remarks he has just made, which are but a repetition of the speeches he has made frequently in this House.  I did not intend to intervene at all or to take up any time on this amendment, but the Minister for Industry and Commerce quoted certain passages from the organ of the United Ireland Party and described them as seditious. Deputy O'Higgins challenged that I had been responsible for passing those passages and that, consequently, it must be taken that my view was that they were not seditious.  I am afraid that that is not so at all.  I did, for some time, have a look at the <i>United Irishman</i> with a view to seeing whether an application should be made to the Military Tribunal to declare it to be seditious.  These particular numbers, I think, I did in fact look at, and the fact that I let them through and did not make any application should be taken, I think, as rather indicating that I am not as tyrannical and that I have not strained the law against the Opposition Party than that anything I let through should not have been made a reason for suppressing the paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am being eternally attacked here for not being impartial.  It was not, apparently, known to the Opposition Party for some time that I did look at the paper, and I ask any fair-minded man to take up numbers of the <i>United Irishman,</i> since it came into being, and to say whether the fact that I let that paper go through is not a clear testimony to my fairness and impartiality to the Opposition.  Only one number of that paper did I ask the Military Tribunal to deal with, and when I indicated certain passages, in a hurried glance through the paper, Deputy Fitzgerald came in here and took advantage of the privileges of this <Col N="749" /> House to put these passages on the records of the House.  I do suggest to Deputy Fitzgerald that it could not be argued for two minutes that in respect of the passage which the Minister for Industry and Commerce read, as to the charge of this Government being a gangster Government, I would not have been justified in having the issue which contained that charge suppressed and in charging the man who wrote it with sedition.  I say now that, in my opinion, that remark was seditious, and I suppose that, having said that, I shall have to give some explanation as to why I did not charge anybody in respect of it.  The reason is that anybody who has read the papers&mdash;and not alone the <i>United Irishman</i> but other papers which have come under my review&mdash;will say that I have not strained the law with regard to seditious libel and that statements have appeared in papers of various kinds in respect of which I could, if I wished, have easily made out a very strong case&mdash;perhaps not strong enough to convince a court but, in my opinion, a case that any lawyer would be justified in presenting before the Military Tribunal or any other court&mdash; against the writers or with the papers.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons why I have been so lenient in that regard is that this House itself has been made, in my opinion, a platform for statements which are seditious and which, in my opinion, are responsible for a good deal of the trouble in the country.  I hesitated to deal with this paper for the reason that, by the law, the statements of Deputies in this House are privileged, and it was here in this House that the phrase &ldquo;gangster Government&rdquo; was used by a Deputy.</P>

      <P>That statement appeared in the daily papers.  In dealing with the various cases which come before me from time to time, I have to exercise my judgment as to whether it is proper to bring certain people before the court or not.  I detest bringing people before the court for any crime, and I hesitate always as to whether I will bring proceedings. When I find that a Deputy can come in here and use the privileges of this House to make the statement that this is a &ldquo;gangster Government,&rdquo; it seems to me that I am justified in not proceeding. That may possibly not be a defence to my inaction, but it certainly should have been borne in mind by Deputies who have charged me from time to time with partiality and with straining the law against them.</P>
      <P>To come for a moment to the subject of this amendment, perhaps it will follow from what I have said, that I should say something with regard to this Bill and its intentions.  I feel myself&mdash;and I am in a position, I suppose, better than most Deputies in the House to judge&mdash;that we are in a very dangerous situation in this country at the moment.  I do not want to make any scare statements or to say anything that will stir up feeling.  I have steadfastly avoided, since I came into this House, saying anything that would arouse or add to the hatred or bitterness between the two sides of this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Attorney-General</NameTxt>
      <P>I have done that partly because of the position I hold and partly because I have felt that, with the high state of tension in the country between the followers of our two Parties, it is extremely dangerous for people in responsible positions to use language which is likely to increase their hatred of each other.  I find that, at the present time, meetings all over the country are undoubtedly being disturbed, and while I believe that this Bill is necessary, I believe, for various reasons which I gave on Second Reading, and which I am not going to give again, that the wearing of a blue shirt is provocative, that it holds dangers to the institutions <Col N="751" /> of the State, and that if we are going to prevent the developments which followed its introduction in other countries, we must step in and prohibit it, but, at the same time, I am not going to deny at all that the Opposition have a genuine grievance about the way they are dealt with at meetings.  I would remind Deputy Fitzgerald and some of the other Deputies that Deputy Costello and Deputy Anthony both admitted that the I.R.A. are not the cause of the trouble at meetings.  They both said here that they believed that the I.R.A., as an organisation, are not responsible for the trouble at meetings.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Attorney-General</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I can say ditto to that, but there are, unfortunately, throughout the country, a number of people who are hotheaded and who are stirred&mdash;despite what Deputy Dillon may say, by way of retort and in pointing to what has been said from these benches&mdash;by people like Senator MacLaughlin and others who, at meetings, use terms and phrases which are calculated to inflame hatred and to inflame bitterness and to inflame the crowd&mdash;call them a mob, or whatever you like&mdash;to a degree in which they lose control of themselves.  I do think&mdash;I suppose it is too late in the day to try to pour oil on troubled waters in this country&mdash;that, Blue Shirt or no Blue Shirt Bill, if there is not some attempt to restrain the language used from platforms, we are going to have a steadily developing state of things here in which public meetings would become impossible. After all, it cannot be denied that we have put the forces of the State at the disposal of the Opposition, and even if they say that we did not do so since General O'Duffy went out, we did it while he was here.  It is admitted that he had those forces at his disposal.  We cannot do more than go a certain distance; we cannot cover the whole country with forces ample to protect people from the violence of bitter opponents.  I would suggest to the Opposition in the House here that a great deal of the trouble in the <Col N="752" /> country is due to the violence of language indulged in in this House.</P>

      <P>The Deputy thinks that he is entitled to quote the Bible for us.  He read a passage from St. Thomas which, he says, justifies what he said in his paper.  It seems to me to refer to a wholly different set of circumstances than those existing here. It was written at a time when the type of Government we have here was not in existence&mdash;this Government which, as he says, is seditious.  I suppose he is delighted with himself to be able to say that a Government can be seditious.</P>

      <P>If this Government is acting wrongly, surely there is the method of the ballot box by which to get rid of it, and surely they can wait for one, two or three years.  A great deal of trouble could have been avoided if the Government had been allowed to do what it considered best in the common interests of the country.  Deputy Fitzgerald admits that Acts which are for the common good are binding on everybody, but he sets himself up week by week in his paper and day by day here in the Dáil to be the judge of what is for the common good.  He has used his paper and he has used this House as a platform for telling the people that, in his opinion, the measures introduced here are contrary to the truth&mdash;I think that is one of the phrases he used.  He charges us with having no moral authority for certain measures.  He is the judge.  I think there are in this country persons who are charged with the guidance of the people on matters of morals and matters of theology. Why Deputy Fitzgerald should arrogate to himself the right to be the dictator, I cannot see.</P>

      <P>Using the word in its strict sense, I fail to see that he is entitled to say whether a <Col N="753" /> particular action taken by this Government is contrary to the common good or is binding on conscience.  That is what he sets himself up as being entitled to do.  I do not want to indulge in any heated interchange with him at all, but I say that, in my opinion, there is a state of things developing in the country which is becoming very serious.  I have papers here that I received to-day about a meeting down the country in which language is alleged to have been used by a Blue Shirt&mdash;whether used or not I am not going to say at the moment, because it will probably be a matter to be tested in the courts afterwards&mdash;but as a result of it a riot broke out in which everything that could possibly be seized on by a number of people, numbering some thousands I understand, was seized upon and used, and a desperate state of things arose. Thank goodness nobody was killed, but we will reach the state of things eventually in which somebody will be killed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I appeal to the Opposition I also appeal to the people who are supposed to be supporting us.  I intend, so far as I am able, to see that the right of freedom from interruption at public meetings will be given to everybody. I have had very strong views myself as to the actions of the Opposition and as to what could be said about them.  I have refrained from saying them because I feel they would stir up feelings in the country and I feel myself that this state of things should not be allowed to continue and that the Opposition in this country ought to be allowed freely to express their views.  I do not care how strong their views are.  I think it would be much better for everybody concerned if the people who allege that the Opposition are traitors would drop that charge and allow the Opposition here to make their speeches.  Let them think what they like about what is said.  Let them stay away from their meetings.  No good end is being served by having a state of things develop here by which one Party is to be dubbed traitors and the other Party to be regarded as the custodians of everything that is patriotic and national. <Col N="754" /> If the good sense of the people does not make sure that that does not happen, I am afraid we are going to have a state of affairs in which democratic institutions will be only a name.  I fear it myself because I see papers coming in every day in which 20 or 30 people are charged with breaking up meetings, disturbing meetings, raiding houses, firing into halls and beating Blue Shirts and all the rest of it. Cannot they let us deal with the Blue Shirts?  We are trying to deal with them in this Bill.  I deprecate and deplore as heartily as I can the efforts of those gentlemen who have violently assaulted meetings of people dressed in blue shirts.  As long as the law allows them to gather in blue shirts they ought to be left alone and it would serve our Party and our people much better if they were left alone.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">

      <P>Deputy Fitzgerald this evening was in rather pontifical mood. He started off, in the language to which we are accustomed from Deputy Fitzgerald, and proceeded to set himself up as the sole judge of what was correct moral conduct and what was incorrect moral conduct from a Governmental point of view, and to set himself up as a censor as to when the Government was acting legally and when it was acting illegally.  The whole burden of his speech was the clearest possible indication that he wanted to regard himself as a person who was entitled to decide in his own way and in his own mind when he would respect the laws of this State and when he would decline to respect them.  The end of the argument is government option, obedience by option.  If a Deputy is entitled to postulate that, and to act in accordance with that view, every person in the country is entitled to say: &ldquo;There is a certain law which I do not feel called upon to obey and I will break that law.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Fitzgerald says that you ought to have an option as to what law you will respect and what law you will disrespect; as to when you will obey the Government and when you will not obey it.  We have all this from the Front Bench of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party after all the protestations <Col N="755" /> we have had from that Party that it is standing for liberty and democracy. Can you have any liberty or democracy where every citizen is going to set himself up as the sole judge, in respect of himself, as to whether he will obey or refuse to obey the law?  If every citizen is to become a law unto himself there is no such thing as liberty or democracy as we know it.  If that position should be allowed to develop here, it is good-bye to democratic institutions and liberty in this country.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzgerald proceeded to quote from a Papal Encyclical&mdash;not merely to quote from it but he proceeded to twist and pervert it.  One would imagine from the quotations and from the meanings he purported to attach to them that a Papal Encyclical was written in order to justify the wearing of blue shirts.  The whole purpose of his quotations was to show that many years ago His Holiness the Pope wrote a Papal Encyclical justifying the wearing of blue shirts in the Saorstát in the year 1934.  Is not that the most arrant nonsense that ever anybody tried to pass over on intelligent Deputies in this House?  Not content with twisting and perverting the Encyclical, he went on to quote St. Thomas Aquinas and one would imagine that St. Thomas Aquinas was specially charged with the responsibility of justifying the wearing of blue shirts in the Irish Free State in 1934. Is not that nonsense?  Is not that mere hypocrisy?  Does it not clearly show the extent to which the Deputy is prepared to go in order to try to justify a new political development which cannot be justified on any ground, except on the ground of a warped outlook towards democracy and on a twisting and perversion of quotations from the writings of people at a time when blue shirts in the Free State were never thought of?</P>
    <P>This is a new role for Deputy Fitzgerald. It is not quite a consistent role for him.  His whole attitude in this House is the attitude of a person who is impatient with democracy.  It is not good enough for Deputy Fitzgerald. It was a lovely instrument for <Col N="756" /> ten years, so long as Deputy Fitzgerald sat on the Government Benches with a Ministerial title; but, once the flood-tide of public opinion showed itself against the Deputy and swept him from here over there, the Deputy had no use for modern democratic methods, and his leader outside has no use for this un-Irish Parliamentary system and it must be replaced.</P>
    <P>The whole speech of Deputy Fitzgerald was quite in conformity with the views expressed by his leader outside. I do not say that people on other benches in that Party share their views.  As the Minister for Industry and Commerce said earlier, there is in the Party an inner circle, an I.R.B. of the Fine Gael Party, and that is the group which decides the policy of the Party.  The policy of that group has not, if the utterances of the leaders are to be taken at their face value, a democratic outlook so far as Governmental institutions here are concerned.</P>
    <P>The Papal Encyclical has been quoted here.  There was very little of the Papal Encyclical quoted, in its economic and social aspects, during the ten years they sat on those benches.  The Papal Encyclical was carefully locked up in a press which was never opened during those ten years.  Now it is produced here twisted, distorted and altered, in order to pretend that there is Pontifical authority for the wearing of blue shirts in 1934.  As I said, it is not a new attitude for the Cumann na nGaedheal Party.  At one time, they published a newspaper called the <i>Star.</i>  Far from being in the ascendant, it only lived a short time and then descended.  Before it went out of existence, in any case, there was an article published in that paper, the author of which was publicly stated to be the then Minister for Finance, now Senator Blythe.  The purpose of that article was to postulate this kind of philosophy&mdash;that the Army ought to have a choice as to whether or not, and in what circumstances, it would serve a new Government. Is it not sedition and mutiny of the worst possible kind to suggest that the Army ought to be given a choice as to whether it would serve a new Government and in what circumstances <Col N="757" /> it would serve a new Government? That article, which was published in the Cumann na nGaedheal paper of the period, was never repudiated; and even the person who was credited with being its author never repudiated that he was the author of the article.  The philosophy of that article was quite in line with Deputy Fitzgerald's attitude to-day.  The article contained the view: &ldquo;Let the Army decide whether they will serve the Government.&rdquo; Deputy Fitzgerald's argument to-day was: &ldquo;Let me decide in what circumstances I shall obey the laws of this country and when I shall respect those laws.&rdquo;  Is not that the attitude of an egotist, or a person who wants always to be in the position of the law maker and, when he happens to be in the position of one who is obliged to respect the law, objects to the law simply because he has not the administration of the law himself?  The whole attitude of Deputy Fitzgerald to-day was the attitude of one who wanted every citizen in the country to be a law unto himself and to decide for himself when and in what circumstances he would respect the laws.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzgerald's speech has a curious interest for Deputy Anthony, who spoke before him.  Deputy Anthony told us that he stood for constitutional government and constitutional development; that he stood for the rights of democracy and for government by the ballot-box instead of by the gun and the bullet.  Does Deputy Anthony agree with the mentality of Deputy Fitzgerald, that everybody is to be a law unto himself and to decide in what circumstances he will respect the law?</P>

      <P>Deputy Anthony said that he stood for government by the ballot box instead of government by the gun.  Every member of the Labour Party stands for the same kind of government.  I do not point to Deputy Anthony as an assessor yet and I wonder if he would let me make my own case.  Every member of the Labour Party stands for democratic rule, for democratic government, for government by the ballot box instead of government by the gun and the bullet, and it is because I stand for democratic government that I do not want to see developed here again militaristic politics which would result in making this country an armed camp and would provide a short bridge towards civil war.  Unless there are definite steps taken to curb the new orientation which is developing here in respect of political parties there seems to me the possibility of making the country an armed camp and taking the shortest possible step towards civil war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want a civil war situation developing in this country.  One civil war in the country is enough in the life time of the present generation, and I do not want to see civil war develop again.  There is no man in this country wants civil war.  There is no woman in this country wants to see civil war again, and no matter what differences divide one Party from another, there ought to be at least general agreement that every Party in the State would unite to save this country from the disgrace and the humiliation of another civil war.  So far as the Labour Party are concerned, any efforts it could make it would be only too willing to make to restore here such peaceful conditions as to make civil war impossible. If civil war in this country <Col N="760" /> develops the strength of one political Party as compared with another would be a matter of small concern.  The difference between one political Party and another political Party would be a matter of small concern if civil war developed in this country.  If it did develop it would be another blood bath, another competition in murders and another competition in executions. There is no decent Irishman who wants to see that situation develop in this country.</P>
    <P>Deputy Anthony asks does the Labour Party stand for constitutional development and for government by the ballot box.  Of course, the Labour Party stands for government by the ballot box and its support of this Bill is because of the fact that it stands for constitutional government by the ballot box.  Deputy Anthony reading this amendment reads into it a meaning which it has not got.  The Deputy shows himself a much simpler man than I ever thought he was.  Deputy Anthony wants to interject amendment 20 into this Bill.  The Bill will then read: &ldquo;It shall not be lawful for any person to wear any uniform or badge which is indicative of membership of, or affiliation to, or support of a political party which aims at overthrowing or changing the Constitution of Saorstát Eireann by force of arms...&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I submit that &ldquo;badge&rdquo; might mean the wearing of a trade union badge.

Now I would ask Deputy Anthony to come to the same point and to get legal advice. Deputy Anthony says that if I read the section it may be found to mean that a person may be prohibited from wearing a trade union badge.  But if the Deputy reads sub-section (2) of Section 2 and reads amendment 18 which deletes the words &ldquo;or badge,&rdquo; there is no penalty at all attached to the wearing of a trade union badge.</P>

We had a definite indication from the speech of Deputy Anthony that the Bill with this amendment inserted will make it lawful for political parties to wear uniforms in future.  I say the Government would be extremely ill-advised if it were to permit the wearing of uniforms no matter of what colour.  If members of the Fine Gael Party are entitled to wear uniforms, then members of the Fianna Fáil Party are likewise <Col N="765" /> entitled to wear uniforms.  Members of the Labour Party would be entitled to wear uniforms.  Deputy Kent would be entitled to put a uniform on his legionaries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Before these disorderly interruptions started, I was referring to the fact that this Bill, if passed in the way in which Deputy Anthony wants it passed, will make legal the wearing of uniforms.  It will enable every political party in the State to equip its followers with uniforms and to equip them with the lethal weapons which have been a prominent feature amongst the uniformed parties which exist in the State to-day.  I do not want that situation to continue. Nobody with any sense of sanity wants that situation to continue, because everybody will realise that if every Party is to equip its followers on a military basis of that kind and have them officered on the military basis that exists to-day, then it is only a short step from that situation to a civil war situation, a situation which Deputies would very much deplore.  That situation will inevitably mean civil war with all the terrible consequences that flow from civil war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am opposed to the amendment which Deputy Anthony supported, because it will make possible the wearing of uniforms by political parties in the State.  I venture to suggest that Deputy Anthony is not really in favour of the wearing of uniforms by parties in the State, because Deputy Anthony ought to know, and I believe he does know, that the wearing of uniforms is the first step towards making the country an armed camp, and that it is only a short step from that to civil war. Why is it necessary that there should be any question of wearing uniforms by the Party opposite?  They were elected a Government for ten years without uniforms.  For ten years they were able to secure sufficient votes to elect them as a Government without going into uniform at all.  Clearly, therefore, uniforms were not in any sense necessary to their political success.  As a matter of fact they <Col N="767" /> should get rid of the uniform, because since they have adopted it they have been most unsuccessful in wooing the electors.  Even from a political point of view, they might well consider disposing of the uniform and getting back to the civilian politics which we knew before the uniform made its appearance. Deputy Anthony suggested that the Labour Party do not stand for democratic government.  It does stand for democratic government, and because it does, it wants to make sure that no party will be allowed to give its political organisation a military bent, which must inevitably lead, if it is allowed to go on, to other parties taking a similar bent.</P>

I would suggest to <Col N="768" /> the Party opposite&mdash;and I am sure many of them can see no advantage in the wearing of a uniform; in fact, I think many of them can see definite disadvantages and dangers in it&mdash;that they should try some <i>via media</i> for preserving public order at public meetings other than militarising a political Party in the way they are doing to-day.  If the Party opposite are satisfied by guarantee of a fair and undisturbed hearing at public meetings, then there should be no necessity for the continuance of the wearing of uniform by their supporters, once that guarantee is made effective in respect of their political meetings.  So far as this Party is concerned, it would stand at any time for ensuring to any other Party in the State the right to a fair hearing at public meetings, but there is no reason why we should militarise our politics in this country simply because, for the time being at all events, there has been disorder and strife at public meetings.  Deputy MacDermot, in the course of his speech yesterday, adopted a line which I thought was rather conciliatory. I thought at one stage it gave some hope that it might be possible to secure co-operation on the basis of all Parties in the State uniting to make sure that there would be no interference with public meetings in the future. I think that is a desirable state of affairs to create.  I think no time should be lost in making an effort to get agreement by all parties in the State on the best means of preserving order at public meetings, but I do not think it is in any way necessary to continue this militarised type of politics which we have to-day in order to ensure a fair hearing at public meetings.  I regard this Bill as an effort to stamp out here the growth of a military movement which is a menace to this country, as it proved to be a menace in other countries.  We had an innocent-looking Black Shirt movement in Italy, and we have to-day terrible tyranny against the working-class people of that country.  Deputy Dillon looks astonished.</P>

      <P>We will have a translation of that, Sir.  We have seen, in those two countries, innocent-looking uniformed movements developing to such a stage that eventually they swept out of existence the democratic institutions of those countries, and established dictatorships.  The Dictators became&mdash;as Dictators inevitably are&mdash; just tyrants; the privilege of the plain people being to render homage to them and to endure the tyrannies they liked to visit upon them.

Deputy Anthony comes along now to express considerable doubt as to why the Labour Party should seek to <Col N="771" /> eliminate the wearing of uniform in this country.  Deputy Anthony might recollect that the Labour Government in Denmark has found it necessary to prohibit certain uniforms there.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The question we have to ask ourselves is whether we are going to permit here the development of a uniformed movement such as had such serious consequences to democratic institutions in other countries.  Nobody with any regard for the preservation of a democratic system of government would permit the development of a uniformed movement in this country no matter what political label it has around its neck.  It is because the Labour Party do not want to see the development of that movement, because they want to preserve democratic government in this country, because they want to ensure to all parties the rights of fair hearing at public meetings, that we are supporting the passage of this Bill, and are opposed to the amendment which Deputy Anthony has supported in connection with this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There ought to be no occasion whatever to clothe their followers in uniforms in order to ensure fair play at public meetings.  If the Opposition are serious in their contention that the <Col N="772" /> development of the Blue Shirt movement was to ensure peace at public meetings, then they ought to consider at the earliest possible moment whether it is not possible, by co-operation amongst all parties in the State, to secure a fair hearing without permitting the growth here of a military movement which will be as dangerous in this country as it has proved in other countries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>We have listened to the speech of Deputy Norton.  So far as I am personally concerned I do not care what colour shirt a man has if he is a law-abiding citizen of the State. That is the important thing.  One would imagine from the speeches made from the Government Benches and the Labour Benches that we on this side of the House are out for civil war.  I had some experience of the civil war.  I had experience of my house being attacked with an armoured car and bombs for three hours and ten minutes, while my wife and children were in it. I am not one of those who want to create that position in this country again.  I do not know what was the idea of the attack on my house, or what was to be gained by it.  Probably the people who were responsible for it know something better now.  One would imagine that this hooliganism at public meetings began with the starting of the Blue Shirts.  I challenge anybody in this House, or outside it, to say that I ever tried to create friction between the different parties in this country. My aim and ambition all the time was to create a better feeling and to try to see that every party got a fair hearing. I challenge anybody to say that I ever did otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Centre Party was holding a meeting in Macroom on one occasion. I was not on the platform, but Dan Vaughan was there and he has as good a record as anybody in the country. I am sure that will be admitted by Deputies on all sides.  He was speaking to his constituents while I was in the crowd.  Interruptions started and an attempt was made to deprive him of the right of addressing his constituents. The interrupters were a <Col N="773" /> certain distance away from me and I happened to have false teeth at the time.  I said to myself: &ldquo;This is looking a bit dangerous; I had better get out of my false teeth,&rdquo; and I put them into my pocket.  These bullies came to where I was and the order was given to clear the Square.  I caught one of the interrupters by the shoulder and I asked him if everybody had not the right to express his opinions.</P>
    <P>I will not go as far as Deputy O'Dowd went when he said that he would allow a person to preach that there was no God.  I would not be a party to that. I got hold of one of the men and pushed him out of the crowd who were scrapping all round me.  An attempt was made to strike him but I kept my hand up in order to prevent him being struck and as I was doing so, one of the people, a county councillor, who acted afterwards as agent for Fianna Fáil at the election, gave me two pucks in the jaw.  I did not retaliate and I kept my prisoner because I was brought up in a pub and I more or less treated it as a public house row.  I did not strike him but that was not because I was not able.  I am, and I am prepared to meet him any day in the week anywhere he likes.</P>
    <P>That was the position that was created at that meeting.  The only shirts that were there on that occasion were ordinary shirts and yet a determined attempt was made to prevent Dan Vaughan and others associated with him from addressing the people. Last September, Deputy Dillon and some others went to Macroom to address a meeting.  They were on the platform and I was in the crowd.  An attempt was made to smash up that meeting&mdash;an organised attempt because I can prove that, on the day before, a certain person who took part in that attempt said &ldquo;We are going to smash up that meeting&rdquo; but they did not succeed.  I did not interfere for a long time.  There was scrapping going on all around the place and I think the Guards had to draw their batons. There were no Shirts there on that occasion.  One of these gentlemen went on the platform and pushed back the speaker&mdash;I do not know whether it was Deputy Dillon or Deputy <Col N="774" /> O'Donovan&mdash;and then, somebody came along and treated him like a child, asking him to get out of the way.</P>
    <P>There was no force used against him on that occasion.  About the same time, there was some interruption not very far from me.  I went towards the people involved and I saw a fellow being pushed out by four or five young men.  I said to the young men &ldquo;Let him alone; I will get him away,&rdquo; and I got him out of the crowd.  I did everything I possibly could to prevent any trouble at those meetings and I challenge anybody on the opposite benches to contradict me.  Attempts have been made to throw the responsibility for all the disturbance on the people on these benches.  We have no responsibility for that trouble.  We were told to-day by the Minister for Industry and Commerce that we were squealing.  We are not squealing and we do not want any privileges except the privileges we are entitled to under the Constitution of this State&mdash;the right to address our people in an orderly manner.  There is nothing unreasonable about that.  We are looking for nothing more and nothing less and we are prepared to give that privilege to everybody who is opposed to us.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice speaking last week on this Bill, said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;There is no doubt that the presence of blue shirts and berets at meetings is a source of irritation to the majority of the people, and is mainly the cause of reviving bitterness and provoking disorder generally.&rsquo;</P>
    <P>Mr. MacDermot: Who said that? Whom is it from?</P>
    <P>Mr. Ruttledge: That is my information, my police information.</P>
    <P>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney: What police?</P>
    <P>Mr. Ruttledge: I am not going to disclose that.  Again, we have:</P>
    <P>&lsquo;The display of blue shirts at such meetings certainly militates against the public peace.&rsquo;</P>
    <P>&lsquo;The organised exhibition of blue shirts and berets will doubtlessly continue to compromise the public peace and further embitter the already strained relations <Col N="775" /> between the association and other groups.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He continued in that strain.  It is not necessary for me to read the whole of the statement, but the debate continued:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Mr. MacDermot: Where was that?</P>
    <P>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney: Another anonymous contribution.</P>
    <P>Professor O'Sullivan: It is not a contribution at all.</P>
    <P>Mr. MacDermot: Where was that?</P>
    <P>Mr. Ruttledge: I am not prepared to state where it was.</P>
    <P>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney: I thought so.</P>
    <P>Mr. Ruttledge: I am prepared to inform Deputy MacDermot, who has raised this question, and I will show him this report.</P>
    <P>Professor O'Sullivan: The House wants it, not one Deputy.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Later on, the President, in the course of the debate, said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I said at the Ard Fheis that no matter who in this State committed an offence against the law the Executive would be forced to arrest him and that there could be no choosing of persons in it.  The Deputies on the other side who are promoting disturbances by their Blue Shirt organisation, who are promoting breaches of the law&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>Mr. MacDermot: That is not true.</P>
    <P>Deputies: Where?</P>
    <P>The President: Everywhere.</P>
    <P>Mr. O'Leary: Where?</P>
    <P>Mr. Bennett: Arrest any man who does.</P>
    <P>The President: I am perfectly certain that the Minister for Justice, when he is replying, will be able to give you a number of instances.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What happened?  The closure was moved and the Minister for Justice did not give the information.  With regard to the Blue Shirts, we are accused of organising to overthrow the Government of this State by physical force.  I will read a statement of the President during that debate.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="776" />&ldquo;Where defence ends and aggression begins is a very difficult question and what Deputies by their organisation of this movement are doing is creating eternally for us here the problems of disarmament which, internationally, are puzzling the wisest minds of the world.  What is the reason for nations arming?  Not one of them will say that they are out to attack; everyone of them will say that they are arming for security and to preserve their rights.  That is the basis also of the Blue Shirts&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>Mr. MacDermot: We are not arming.</P>
    <P>The President: You are, and the Deputy knows it as well as I do.</P>
    <P>Mr. MacDermot: We are not arming.</P>
    <P>Mr. Brennan: You know that is wrong.</P>
    <P>The President: The Deputy knows as well as I do that arms are available, if they want them.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This amendment of ours is an answer to the President, and it shows our sincerity.  There is no harm in reading for the House once more the sub-section with the addition of the amendment:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It shall not be lawful for any person to wear any uniform or badge which is indicative of membership of, affiliation to, or support of a political party or an association ancillary to a political party which aims at overthrowing or changing the Constitution of Saorstát Eireann by force of arms.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Will anybody deny that that proves our sincerity with regard to arms?  We are out for one principle&mdash;the principle that the majority of the people of this country, and no others, have the right to rule.</P>
    <Speaker pid="StephenJordan" hpid="Mr. Jordan Mr. Jordan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jordan</NameTxt>
      <P>Since this debate started, both on the Bill itself and on the different amendments that have come before the House, I have sat here patiently listening to the speeches of Opposition Deputies, and the one note in all the speeches was that all the models of perfection in this country belong to the Blue Shirt organisation and all the blackguards to the other <Col N="777" /> different organisations&mdash;Fianna Fáil, Labour, I.R.A. and so on.  All the pronouncements that I heard from the different Deputies who spoke were tantamount to describing the rest of the people of Ireland as blackguards, and their every act as the act of criminals.  To my mind, it is a pity that the privileges of this House allow such statements to be made at all, because when these reports appear in the daily papers of the country&mdash;and, of course, the Deputies from the different counties will take good care that, for the sake of propaganda, their speeches will appear in the local papers, the different blue-rags, if I can describe them as such, and some of them have been very blue for the last few weeks, anyhow&mdash;the general public reading them, particularly in the local papers, would be inclined to think that this country was full of crime.</P>
      <P>I heard a Deputy from Galway yesterday, a prominent Blue Shirt man there, talk about what were probably some real grievances, with a fair amount of imaginary grievances against the members of the Blue Shirt organisation in that county.  He cited quite an amount of crime.  He described it as such.  There may be ordinary tiffs in a country village. There may be ordinary tiffs at a fair if you like, when the condition of people, some time in the evening, is not quite what it might be in the morning&mdash;as bad as the fairs are&mdash;and because there is some little &ldquo;scrap,&rdquo; or an attempt at a &ldquo;scrap,&rdquo; the Blue Shirt organisation in that county are so anxious to further their movement, if a man gets beaten, even in a fair &ldquo;do,&rdquo; if you like, and he happens to be a Blue Shirt, it is described as a crime.  It is referred to from every platform in the country.  I would respectfully ask contradiction from some of the leading lights of the Blue Shirt organisation that I see in the House at the moment, if I am not stating what is true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had, I believe, what you might call one invasion of the Blue Shirts in Galway, and that was at a very recent meeting.  I think it was last Sunday week.  All the leading lights of the organisation were there&mdash;Deputies of <Col N="778" /> this House and, as I understand, the man, ex-Commissioner O'Duffy&mdash;Mr. O'Duffy or Eoin O'Duffy, if you like, as far as I am concerned, but certainly not General, except a general nuisance, as far as I see.  That meeting was referred to by Deputy Brodrick.  One of the statements he made was that the Guards had to protect the railway line, lest it should be torn up by the people in County Galway, with inevitable result of loss of life.  Possibly that railway line was protected. Possibly roads were protected, but if they were protected, it was because, in the opinion of the Chief Superintendent of the Gárda Síochána in County Galway, it was necessary to do so, in order, I suppose, to keep an indignant public&mdash;not any particular organisation or organisations in Galway, as far as I know&mdash;from interfering with this meeting.  That might be it, but if the Guards did their duty in protecting the roads and protecting the railway line, was it not a slight exaggeration for Deputy Brodrick to say here that they did it because of the fact&mdash;it was not a suspicion at all, but a fact&mdash;that members of some organisation or some of the general public in Galway would reef the railway line, and that the railway authorities would be so negligent of their business that they would run the train and that lives would be lost?  I do not approve of such an exaggeration by any Deputy for the purpose of furthering the Blue Shirt organisation either in Galway or elsewhere.  The reason I make any reference to it at all is that I am a Deputy from that county, and I deny the right of any Deputy in the House, even though he is privileged in the House, or outside it, to try to point to Galway in that fashion.</P>
    <P>I deny the right of Deputy Dillon or Deputy O'Higgins or Deputy Brodrick or anybody else to describe the people of Galway as blackguards.  We are not all models of perfection in Galway, but when these Deputies come to Galway to address meetings, if they were a little bit more mild in their statements they might get reasonable people to listen to them; but when they come into the city or the county or into any <Col N="779" /> town in it and give us no talk about the policy of their organisation, if they have a policy, but give personal abuse of the people in our organisation, and give such abuse and criticism that it would take nearly a saint to stand, it is very little wonder that some people try to keep them in their places by what they describe as blackguardly interruption.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon was not heard of, as far as I know, in 1923&mdash;at any rate in the political life of this country.  If there is one man in this House who knows what blackguardism went on at that time from the then &ldquo;Staters&rdquo; of this country, I know it anyhow.  I know it, certainly, but I will leave it at that.  I did not rise to make any reference to what occurred in 1923, or to what is being done by the members of the Blue Shirt organisation in Galway. What I do object to is that any Deputy in this House, no matter what county he comes from, should describe Galway, anyway, as a county that commits crime and commits nothing but crimes such as invading the houses of members of the Blue Shirts, beating up Blue Shirts, and firing into houses, in the way Deputy Brodrick described here yesterday.  The ordinary courts in Galway, as far as I know, have only the most trifling cases to deal with.  In the town I come from the District Court is not even held regularly, and the Circuit Court has only very nominal cases to deal with. If anybody doubts that, he can discuss it with the members of the legal profession on both sides of the House who have to do with Galway, and he will be told that trade, from the point of view of the legal profession, is very bad.  I remember when we used to see them falling over one another in Galway, there was so much doing in the way of crime.  Now there is nothing doing, and the country is so crimeless that the Circuit Courts have only very ordinary cases to deal with, and some of the District Courts are not held regularly because the county is comparatively free from crime.</P>
    <P>That is the sole purpose I had in rising to contribute to this debate at all, except to say that I welcome the <Col N="780" /> Bill.  The one reason for which I welcome it is that it will be a source of economy to every county in Ireland, because when the blue shirts are left in the lockers at home these people can appear like ordinary civilians.  They will not be hurting the eyes of their political opponents.  They will not be masquerading as models of perfection and heroes of the hour.  I may tell you that it is not so long ago since some of them would not put any shirt on if it came to &ldquo;scrapping.&rdquo; There are a lot of them who, when men were wanted to fight in this country, were not to be had.  The Bill will serve one good purpose, and that is that it will leave the Guards in their stations and the military in their different barracks.  It will allow the politicians to go around and talk as much as they like in a constitutional way if they have a policy to put forward, and the few Guards in a town will be well able to keep order, because there will be no Blue Shirts to hurt the eyes of the peaceful citizens.</P>

      <P>The fact remains that we have here a Bill which is defended from the Government Front Bench and the only defence put up by any Government speaker from that Front Bench is that either now or at some future date the Blue Shirt organisation <Col N="781" /> would resort to arms.  Is not that the only case made to-day or last week or at the time of the ban&mdash;the suspicion, if not the charge, that at some future date the Blue Shirt organisation would resort to unconstitutional action?  Is not that the only justification advanced for the Bill, or is it admitted that it is a Bill to deprive the citizen of the right to resort to constitutional action?  Flabby and all as it was, the only case that it was attempted to make was that the Blue Shirt organisation might at some time resort to unconstitutional action, to military effort, to an effort to overthrow the State or the Government of the State by force of arms.  Heads are wagging now, but the heads did not wag when you were making that assertion. The heads did not wag when you were making a laboured attempt to demonstrate that we were an armed organisation.</P>

      <P>Not to eat his words. What the Deputy said is correct in so far as that was one ground given when the Bill was introduced.  But the Deputy is equally incorrect when he stated that that was the only ground.

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am attempting to follow the Minister and his colleagues in the circular strides they are taking in defence of the Bill.  The same confession of shiftiness that the Minister has just made is an open confession of the lack of punch behind this Bill and the absence of any necessity for the Bill.  According to the Minister the first ground on which the Bill was introduced was that, either now or at some future date, the Blue Shirt <Col N="782" /> organisation might develop into an armed or a military organisation aimed at the overthrowing of the State or the Government of the State by force of arms.  Having heard that case made in the early stages of the Bill, and in order to call that bluff, and see how much sincerity was behind that assertion, we put down an amendment here to extend the operations of this Bill to any organisation aiming at the overthrow of the State by force of arms.  What is the reply from the Government Benches?  &ldquo;No, we will not have that; we will not extend the scope of the Bill to include any organisation aiming at overthrowing the State by force of arms.&rdquo;  Does that not let the cat out of the bag?  Does it not show that the first ground the Minister stood upon has slipped from under his feet; that it was not an honest ground?  What is the objection?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If you fear the militaristic, as you call it, nature of this movement or tendency in the movement, if you fear all the things that have been thrown up in this House&mdash;a <i>coup d'état</i>, or an armed attempt to overthrow the State&mdash;then, why do you not accept the amendment and apply your Bill to any organisation aiming by force of arms to overthrow the State or the Government of the State?  What is the reason it is not done?  Because you would embarrass your own allies; because you would embarrass the only men who do carry guns, and say openly and bravely that they carry these to overthrow the State.  We stand against that kind of thing.  If we stood for it we would not be afraid to say that we stood for it.  We stand absolutely against any form of unconstitutional action.  We stand absolutely against any citizens, whether in blue or white shirts or no shirts, carrying arms in defiance of the laws of the State, no matter who makes them.  Is it not demonstrated that, in fact, this Bill was not aimed at the Blue Shirt movement because you thought it would resort to arms, but, in fact, that it was aimed at the Blue Shirt movement because that movement is politically embarrassing to you and because that movement is carrying on, and has <Col N="783" /> grown to the extent it has grown, and will sweep the Fianna Fáil Party out of the Government of this country by constitutional means?  It is because of that that this Bill is brought in, to impede and hamper it and try to put the pivotal men behind prison bars or, if not, to humiliate them.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce asked a question on two occasions which was answered clearly and without any ambiguity before ever he asked it.  He asked in a challenging way: &ldquo;Why do you wear blue shirts?&rdquo; One answer was given to him very early in the debate, the first and obvious answer.  We wore blue shirts because when the A.C.A. first came into being we had the inspectors and police officers of the Minister calling on every known member of the A.C.A. by day and night.  They asked these people: &ldquo;Why do you belong to the A.C.A.; does your friend round the corner; how many A.C.A. are in the parish, and who are they?&rdquo;  These men came to the headquarters of the organisation for instructions and advice and they were told: &ldquo;Every time a policeman asks you are you in the A.C.A. tell him that you are; if they want any information as to your strength or distribution, or the names of members, give them all the information; and, further, tell the police that it would be simpler if they would come to headquarters in Dublin in a courteous way and ask for the full roll of members in every parish.&rdquo;  But this inquisition was carried on.  In order to stop that kind of thing we put badges on the coats of our members so that men walking about in their different areas would proclaim to everybody, police and others, that they were members of the A.C.A.  Then there was a house burned in Dublin and in the ruins of that house there were something like 1,000 A.C.A. badges that were never manufactured by the firms supplying us with badges, as far as we could ascertain.  The only guess we could make as to how those badges came to be there was that some organisation planned the carrying out of some stunt with our badges in their coats.  There may be <Col N="784" /> other explanations as to how those badges came to be in the ruins of that house, but the fact remains that they were there.  There were stunts carried out in this country by men wearing A.C.A. badges who were never members of the A.C.A.  For that and other reasons, in order to check any suggestions that rowdyism at meetings was brought about by our members, in order to clearly identify each of our members in the eyes of every citizen, we adopted the blue shirt.  It made it easier for anyone to recognise the members of our organisation.  In order to keep the organisation more in the light of day than it had been previously, and in order, if you like, to facilitate the Minister's police in knowing who are members and who are not we adopted the blue shirt.</P>

To return to the point with which I was dealing, having adopted the blue shirt we then found that it was a great political asset, that our members doubled every week.  We found it was the greatest political asset that we ever stumbled on.  It was because the gunmen realised that and it was because it was the big factor in the rapidly increasing numbers of our organisation that we have this Bill to ban the Blue Shirts.</P>

      <P>On the Report Stage, we have now got this measure passed through the Committee Stage, with the extreme limitation that has been put on discussion and we have now before us the results of the minds of this democratic Assembly working, as they have been allowed to work, with this, the latest of the coercion measures.  I should like to call attention to the position in which certain sections have been left by the fact that discussion on Committee Stage of certain amendments was precluded. Under Section 4, the Executive Council <Col N="791" /> have power, by Order, to declare that any association is a political party within the meaning of this Act. To-day, we have the exposure of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, indicating that so far as he was concerned, there were certain things which an Attorney-General might have passed as not being seditious but which he considered seditious.  That is the political mind that is going to rule hereafter and it is that political mind that is going to rule on the Executive Council when it is going to proclaim an association as being a political party, within the meaning of the Act. Trade unions can rest secure in the promise that Deputy Norton and Deputy Davin have got from the present Government as to what they intend to do when operating their political minds on any association of persons which they may want to make a political association, whether it is or not, for the purpose of manufacturing the various crimes that are newly made under this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under Section 5, the Chief Superintendent in charge of any area in the country may, by proclamation, prohibit the wearing of certain badges.  He can prohibit the wearing of trade union badges.  The chief superintendents of the country are under the control of the Minister for Justice but they possibly will not be under his control after this measure has passed, because the Minister for Industry and Commerce has shown that he wants to be the dictator.  He wants to be the little Napoleon and he wants to be able to declare seditious, matters which even the Attorney-General, with his crimes of sedition before the Military Tribunal, could not declare as seditious. There was an amendment with regard to this section that, after an Order was made by the Executive Council, it would, first of all, give the particulars on which the Executive Council formed its opinion that a particular association was what they declared it to be, and, secondly, that that Order of the Executive Council would lie upon the Table of the House and would be published in <i>Iris <Col N="792" /> Oifigiúil</i> for a certain period before any action could be taken on it.  Of course, there is no discussion allowed on that, because, clearly, that would enable people to raise the scandalous conduct of the present Executive Council in relation to a man whom they have jailed and in relation to the issuing of an Order while he was away from town and about which he had no knowledge and, therefore, could not take any action under it before the time of his arrest, leading to his jailing.</P>
    <P>Trade unionists ought to rest very safe in their beds at night under the protection of Deputies Norton and Davin, even though Section 8 still stays in the Bill:</P>
    <P>Any assembly of persons-</P>
    <P>and they may be trade unionists&mdash;</P>
    <P>who are or some of whom are committing an offence&mdash;</P>
    <P>and the offence may be the wearing of their trade union badge&mdash;</P>
    <P>under any section of this Act may be dispersed by force by members of the Gárda Síochána or of the defence forces of Saorstát Eireann.</P>
    <P>There was an amendment put down to call attention to the wide powers that were there given, an amendment which would have limited this dispersal by force power until such time as orders had been given and had been given by people of responsibility&mdash;an officer of the defence forces not below the rank of captain, or an officer of the Gárda not below the rank of inspector, but the section remains as it was.  Sub-section (2) also remains as it was:</P>
    <P>Save where the giving of any warning is not reasonably practicable, it shall not be lawful to disperse an assembly of persons by force under this section without giving to such assembly, in such manner and so far as may reasonably be possible in the circumstances of the case, warning of the intention to effect such dispersal.</P>
    <P>Some of Deputy Davin's trade unionists, meeting with badges on, might find a private in the Army or an ordinary member of the Gárda Síochána, making <Col N="793" /> up his mind to disperse by force, and to call on others to assist him, those people, because he considered that they were committing an offence, and he might do that without warning if he considers that the circumstances did not reasonably permit him to give warning of the projected dispersal.  Deputy Davin laughs at the prospect.</P>

      <P>It is to these hypotheses that the guilty conscience flies.  Deputy Davin is faced with this measure, and he accepts that an ordinary member of the Gárda, or an ordinary private in the Army, may issue orders for the dispersal of a crowd, and there need be no warning given of that intended dispersal, if that member of the Gárda, or that member of the Defence Forces, believes that it is not reasonably practicable to give such warning.  The Deputy accepts that.  Finally&mdash;and it is a good thing, I suppose, that one legal member of the Front Bench has departed leaving another behind him&mdash;we have the section which prohibits a particular section of the Courts of Justice Act from operating, and instead, there is put in, that a person who is arrested by anybody for committing an offence under this may, as soon as practicable, be brought before a Justice of the District Court.  There is no limit of hours put on that time.  That person may be detained for a great length <Col N="794" /> of time, so long as there can be an argument founded that it was as soon afterwards as practicable&mdash;and Deputies are going to allow that.  A District Justice is to hear the offences, and there is a special prohibition of any appeal.  The legal member who has absented himself said that, after all, appeals were a mere waste of time. It would be great to hear the Attorney-General on that statement, that appeals are a waste of time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>It would almost be better to have no trial at all.  Why have even one?  It is almost a waste of time.  Look at the trouble the Government are going to be put to because, as soon as practicable, they must bring a man before a District Justice and charge him, and the offence, remember, may be that of wearing a trade union badge, or it may be of belonging to a particular association of a business purpose which has been declared by the Executive Council to be a political association for the purpose of the Act.  Finally, there was an amendment put down to ensure that, whatever were the offences under this, at any rate one piece of camouflage might have been exposed, and one obvious piece of trickery that is going to be attempted might have been stopped.  Once that Bill is passed, does anybody believe that there are going to be offences brought before a District Justice?  There is an easy way of not bringing them before a District Justice.  A mere signature of the Minister, a mere certificate of a Minister that he believes&mdash;and he cannot be questioned on his belief&mdash; that any of the offences committed under this Act are committed for the purpose of impeding the course of justice, will be sufficient, and every one of these offences becomes an offence triable by the Military Tribunal. Deputies opposite were terribly afraid of the Military Tribunal when the Act that brought it into being was introduced in 1931.  They do not seem to be apprehensive at all at having a series of crimes manufactured and left open for translation to the Military Tribunal.  That is the measure we now <Col N="795" /> have.  I assert here that the bringing of the District Justice and the District Courts into this is a piece of humbug.  There is only one thing meant about the District Justice, and that is to put down a certain procedure in order to give the Military Tribunal this footing and to give the Constitution (Amendment) (No. 17) Act this footing, because the moment people are detailed to be brought before a District Justice, at that point the Administration can come in, and is bound to come in, and say that this is not a charge that is proper to go before a District Justice, that they will get this case transferred to the Military Tribunal.  Then, on the production of a certificate from the Minister that the offence, whatever it be, has been committed for the purpose of impeding the course of justice, that case goes before that Tribunal.  There is no right of appeal, and this, although it sets out not to have anything to do with that Tribunal, in fact is intended to be operated by that Tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce to-night broke a little bit further through the fog that the rest have tried to surround this measure with.  He criticised as being, I think, seditious, a speech I made at Lucan recently.  It should be pointed out, and I presume it has been pointed out already, that nobody who spoke at that meeting wore a blue shirt, that no offence under this Act, when it becomes an Act, was committed there; but there was an offence against the Government because there was criticism of them. There is the offence&mdash;that any member of a political party, availing himself of his opportunities for criticism, should dare to utilise them.  There was the offence that is always committed under those circumstances, the offence that is bound to be committed increasingly as the blunders of the Government continue to give an opportunity for criticism and for punishing criticism. The Minister wants that sort of speech suppressed, and it is going to be suppressed, he says, under this measure. Deputy Norton had a battle royal here one night with the &ldquo;Minister for Unemployment&rdquo; in relation to wage <Col N="796" /> cutting.  Wage slashing, I think, was the Deputy's word.  I do not know whether he and his Party have been slashed into submission since then. Supposing the Deputy got up at a trade union meeting to make the same comments that he made in this House on that occasion, all that is required is a proclamation from the Minister for Industry and Commerce, or if he can get the Executive Council to agree to whatever is operating in his mind and immediately Deputy Norton becomes chargeable at any rate with an offence under this Act.  He need not pride himself that he will be brought before a District Justice and before a man trained to evaluate facts and weigh up what an offence is, because only a slight turn of the hand is all that is necessary to bring him up to a military barracks and have him brought before the Military Tribunal for criticising the Minister for cutting wages to the 22/- a week point.  Does Deputy Norton believe that the Government is not going to do that?  Remember, that Act is not temporary.</P>

We were told that that was not for a limited period, that it was going on for all time, that it could be used in a blackguardly way.  Is there no fear of that being the case here?  Do they think it is right, in relation to the circumstances of the country at this moment, to take one instance, that a simple policeman in this country should have power to use force to disperse a meeting, or to get a crowd of other policemen to disperse a meeting, without giving notice?  Do the Deputies believe that that is the proper way of safeguarding democratic rights in this country?  Is that the power they are going to entrust to the police in this country?  Is that the power they are going to entrust to a Minister who expressed himself and exposed himself as the Minister for Industry and Commerce did to-day when he said that he wants to suppress the speeches of political opponents, whether their speeches are speeches that would be offences under the Act or simply because they are speeches criticising him?</P>

The Deputy is not being criticised except in so far as he follows them.  That was quoted to-day as an example of what ought to be put down, and I think the Minister went so far as to say that he would see that they would put it down.  Deputy Norton is in favour at the moment.  If one got back to that November night when he and the Parliamentary Secretary staged their argument as to what would be for the interests of the workers of the country, and all that kind of nonsensical stuff that he put up that night in an attempt to justify himself before his constituents&mdash;all that can be argued against him.</P>

Will he go down to whatever group of Labour people stands at the local elections and say: &ldquo;We brought this to safeguard your rights; we allow an ordinary policeman to disperse any group of you by force if you wear trade union badges; we allow you to be brought before the Military Tribunal; we give you no right of appeal; we avoid the circumstances of the law in having you brought before even a District Justice to be transferred to <Col N="799" /> the Military Tribunal under a certain authority; you may be brought before it possibly by an order made secretly by the Government and not published until you are arrested&rdquo;?

      <P>I was hoping that either Deputy Norton or Deputy Davin would have given us some further information why the amendments which stood in their names were withdrawn. I want to ask Deputy Davin or Deputy Norton what has happened to make the Labour Party accept for the first time in this House an assurance from the present or any other Government of their intentions and to be satisfied with that.  I have heard Deputy Davin and other members of the Labour Party and former leaders of the Labour Party thunder against the suggestion coming from Ministers in this House that although so-and-so was in the Bill it was not the intention of the Government to do so-and-so.  Deputy Davin in those days, and, if I am not mistaken, even Deputy Norton some years ago, and certainly Senator Johnson and Mr. T.J. O'Connell, when leaders of the Labour Party, refused, and to my mind quite rightly refused, to accept any such guarantee from Ministers.  I remember Deputy Davin pointing out here, in very forcible language, when the Public Safety Act was introduced, that it was not the intention of the Government that mattered, but what was in the Act; that once it went down in black and white it ought to be enforced if you were going to have the law enforced as it should be.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely, even Deputy Davin is not going to deny that every member of the Labour Party refused on several occasions to accept the intentions of Ministers, and very properly referred Ministers to the fact that it was not their word that counted but what was in the Act; that when it became an Act it was not for the Minister or the Government as a whole to interpret the Act.  The Deputy <Col N="800" /> knows that well.  If Deputy Davin or Deputy Norton is satisfied that this Bill may not be used against trade unions, certainly I am not satisfied. Does not the Deputy know well how much the promises of the Minister for Finance, before he became Minister, with reference to the national teachers were worth?  Does he not know very well that the promises of the present Government as to what they were going to do for unemployment and for wage conditions were never kept?  Why are they satisfied now?  Why is the Deputy satisfied that this Bill is not going to be used against trade unions?</P>
      <P>Why did the Party agree to have sections in the Bill such as those used against a body, which is largely composed, perhaps to the extent of 70 per cent., of working men and women in this country?  Certainly I can speak for my own constituency, and say that many of them are members of a trade union, many of them are members of the union of which Deputy Norton is general secretary, and many of them members of Deputy Davin's union. They are to be victimised because they are exercising their right to go into a political party and take part in the legitimate activities of that party.  I must confess that I find it almost impossible to understand the attitude of the Labour Party towards this measure.  I must confess, and I am sure the members of that Party will themselves confess, that they have completely changed their attitude on most things in this House.  I am afraid they have never gone so far from what the Party always stood for, and, in my opinion, properly stood for, as they have on this occasion.  I want Deputy Norton or Deputy Davin to tell us what assurances they have from the Government, why they are satisfied with those assurances, and whether the T.U.C. is going to be satisfied with this matter.  If we heard a little more on that subject we would know where we are.</P>

      <P>Deputy Morrissey was absent from the House when, at the end of the speech of Deputy O'Higgins, who is one of the responsible leaders of the Blue Shirt organisation, I asked <Col N="801" /> him whether he would be prepared to recommend the members of his organisation to discard their blue shirts and blue blouses if the Government accepted the amendment which was on the Order Paper in his name.  Was the Deputy here when Deputy O'Higgins refused to give that assurance, proving quite conclusively that those on the opposite benches do not want peace at any price?  As he said, they have their blue shirts, and they will have their blue shirts whether this Bill is passed or not.  That is a typical example of the mentality of the people on those benches and shows quite conclusively that Deputy Fitzgerald is not the only Deputy on those benches who is prepared to ignore the law, if it suits him to do so.  Deputy Morrissey knows quite well, as a man who was a member of a trade union, that in what he said here just now he was misrepresenting the meaning of this measure.  I do not say that he was doing it deliberately. He is apparently unconscious of the fact that amendment 18 was carried which makes it impossible for the things which he suggested to be done when the Bill becomes law.</P>

      <P>I just wish to draw attention to Section 7 (1) of this Bill. This section places the Press of this country in an extremely difficult position and amendment 77a does not in any way case the responsibilities of newspaper owners in this country with regard to the matter published in their newspapers.  The section reads:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  It shall not be lawful for any person to publish any statement in writing, or any painting, drawing, photograph, or other picture or pictorial representation which directly or indirectly incities to, encourages, or condones the commission of offences or any particular offence under this Act or any section thereof.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(3)  Every person who shall publish any statement, picture, or pictorial <Col N="803" /> representation in contravention of this section shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to a fine not exceeding one hundred pounds.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It will be exceedingly difficult for proprietors of newspapers so to manage their affairs as to prevent certain matters creeping into their newspapers on occasion, which may, in the opinion of the Minister, bear this interpretation and which may bring them in conflict with this particular Bill.  I admit that in sub-section (4) it is stated that it shall be a good defence to such charge for such person to prove that the said statement was privileged by virtue of Section 3 or Section 4 of the Law of Libel Amendment Act, 1888. But Section 4 of that particular Act only relates to certain organisations, certain societies and certain statutory bodies.  There are a number of associations in this country which are not covered by Section 4 of the Law of Libel Amendment Act, 1888.  It may happen that a newspaper reporting a meeting of such organisation not expressly covered by Section 4 of this particular Act may in such report include speeches or addresses delivered by members of that particular organisation which, in the opinion of the Minister, may bear a certain political complexion and make them liable for a penalty under sub-section (3) of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Then take the case of advertisements. As the Attorney-General knows very well, advertisements are the main source of revenue of many newspapers.  In many newspapers, indeed in the overwhelming majority, the advertisements represent the main part of the revenue.  Now an advertisement may be published which may bear some symbol which, again, may be interpreted by the Minister as having a particular complexion of some political society or political organisation.  In such cases the unfortunate newspaper proprietor will be liable to the extraordinary penalty imposed by sub-section (3) of Section 7 of this Bill.  For instance, a photograph <Col N="804" /> dealing with a cattle show society may be published in a newspaper away down the country. Probably a member of the committee of that society may be wearing on his person some badge, token or symbol of some political organisation or association of which he is a member.  The unfortunate newspaper owner must examine that photograph with microscopic care in order to make sure that no individual included in that photograph bears on his person any symbol, badge or token which may have some political significance. Surely the section is loosely drafted.  I imagine the Minister when he was drafting this particular section did not realise the actual consequences of it, or the position in which he is going to place newspaper proprietors throughout the country.  The section gives the Minister the widest possible discretion and it completely and absolutely destroys any freedom which newspaper owners enjoy in this country at the moment.</P>
    <P>In other sections of the Bill it is clearly the intention of the Minister to destroy individual freedom, but this particular section destroys the freedom which the Press in this country has hitherto enjoyed, a freedom which the Press did not abuse, freedom which, even in the days when the British were in control of this country, they never dreamt of abusing.  There was hitherto no legislation which imposed such penalties as this Bill imposes.  I admit that the law of libel does give certain privileges to newspapers.  But the Attorney-General knows perfectly well that there are many reports of meetings published in newspapers to which the privilege extended to them by this section of the Law of Libel Amendment Act does not apply.  In future if such reports be published they can only be published at the risk of the newspaper owner, who has absolutely no safeguard whatever.  It is absolutely essential if there is to be a proper circulation of news in this country that newspaper owners should have certain discretion as to the matter which they will publish in their papers.</P>
    <P>This section really means that newspaper <Col N="805" /> owners in the future will be prohibited from publishing reports of certain societies and associations altogether. It is necessary that the proceedings of agricultural societies in this country should be published in full, particularly in papers with a big rural circulation.  In future no paper dare publish a report of such a meeting without a certainty of making itself liable to the fine mentioned in sub-section (3) of Section 7.  There is grave risk in publishing reports of such meetings.  It is inevitable that in discussions on agricultural matters there will be a number of political references. That is inevitable, and the Attorney-General knows it well.  And many political references which may be made at such meetings may bear an interpretation which can be interpreted as bringing the newspaper owner within the terms of this particular section.  I think it is a most extraordinary section.  I do not know whether the Attorney-General or the Minister for Justice fully realises the interpretation of this section which is in keeping with the other sections of the Bill.  It will have the effect of muzzling the Press completely in this country and, as well as muzzling the Press, muzzling the individual.</P>

      <P>I would like to call attention to Section 4.  As I see it, apparently the orders of the Executive Council are to come into force forthwith. I suggest to the Government that nothing will bring the law into such disrespect as leaving people in the position that they do not know when they are breaking the law.  I urge very strongly on the Government that there ought to be some time limit which would leave the ordinary citizen in no doubt as to whether he was inside or outside the law.  We have heard a great deal about people who do not intend to keep the law, but I would like to urge upon the Government that this is an extraordinary state of affairs.  There appears to be no time limit during which the ordinary citizen can ascertain for himself whether he is inside or outside the law.  That certainly marks a novel procedure in legislation.</P>

      <P>The Ceann Comhairle seems to have his eyes on the front benches.  However, with regard to keeping within the law, I do not think the Blue Shirt organisation will be very particular.  They have not shown themselves very particular up to the present.  Deputy Brodrick last night referred to incidents in County Galway. What I have to say in reference to this Bill concerns County Galway only. The Deputy said two members of the Fianna Fáil Party led a party of I.R.A. into Loughrea to take part in a dispute over the appointment of a doctor.  The statement is party true and partly untrue.  They did lead a party of men, but they were not a party of I.R.A.  I think it was particularly unfortunate for Deputy Brodrick to mention that incident, because the men who went into Loughrea went in to support the law as it has been put into operation in connection with the appointment of a doctor by the Local Appointments Commission.  The members of the Blue Shirt organisation have been opposed to what the Local Appointments Commission did in accordance with the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One assertion has run through all the speeches of the Opposition on this Bill. It was this, that all the villainy was on our side and all the virtue was on theirs.  It was because of that statement that I have intervened in the debate.  Examined in the light of certain happenings in County Galway, that is not on the face of it true.  There were two cases of manslaughter which can be laid at the doors of the Blue Shirts.  In one case persons were found guilty and sentenced and the evidence proved conclusively that they were Blue Shirts.  At all events, the man killed was a Fianna Fáil supporter.  I did not intend to go into details, but as there has been a laugh about it I will say it was a most brutal thing.  The man was struck from behind with a stone and then kicked and stabbed to death.  He got a most awful death. <Col N="807" /> Two heroes with knives and stones did that to one unarmed man.  There was another case in which four persons, known to be members of the Blue Shirts, beat a man so badly that he died as a result.</P>

      <P>I wish to call attention to Sections 10 and 12 because they are sections which should not be contained in any Bill.  This is not a Bill that even purports to deal with anything that is in any way morally wrong.  This Bill is creating an entirely new offence.  It is making a thing which is not morally wrong, a crime. It is going further.  A thing which is the right thing to do, not merely justifiable but highly proper and correct, is being made a crime, or they are purporting to make it a crime.  Wait until we see how persons who have done nothing morally wrong, who have done not only what is not morally wrong, <Col N="810" /> but who have done what is not merely justifiable but what is socially proper, and what could be described as edifying conduct, are to be treated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under Section 10 they can be arrested without a warrant of any kind for wearing a badge.  I have got a badge up at the present moment.  When this Bill becomes law any police officer can make a proclamation and this will have become a criminal offence.  You can be arrested for that.  If you are suspected of owning a badge you can be arrested without any warrant.  You can be removed and detained in custody in any prison, station of the Gárda Síochána or other place authorised by law for the detention in custody of persons awaiting trial.  Then Section 19 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1928 shall not apply &ldquo;in respect of any person arrested under this section and in lieu thereof it is hereby enacted that every person so arrested shall, as soon as may be practicable, be brought before a Justice of the District Court.&rdquo; The most serious crimes in this country are bailable crimes but this is not.  A man may be charged with an offence. He can be brought before a Peace Commissioner and he can be let out on bail but the terrible offence of having had, at some time, in your possession a little badge is so shocking or dangerous that a Peace Commissioner will not be allowed to take bail from you and you will have to be kept there until a District Justice is got.  You can be confined in a barracks or in a prison for a week or a fortnight, not admitted to bail but kept there in custody and that for an offence which is not in itself morally wrong.  Why this great departure?  Theoretically, at any rate, even in a charge of murder, a man can be admitted to bail but here because you own a little badge you become such an awfully dangerous person that you cannot be admitted to bail.  The whole procedure of the courts, the ordinary civil law is to be set aside, not to deal with cases of violence, not to deal with cases of moral wrongdoing, not to deal with cases which in themselves have the brand of moral turpitude upon them, but here for belonging to a political association <Col N="811" /> which is unpopular with the Government you can be put into prison and kept in prison.</P>
    <P>Then we come to the District Justice. Why is the right of appeal being taken away?  These are criminal proceedings. Why is the right of appeal taken away?  It is given in other circumstances. Everybody knows, certainly any lawyer knows or ought to know, what is the history of the right of appeal.  We know that for a considerable time there was no appeal from the magistrates except in certain cases, that that was considered to be completely wrong, and that then an appeal was given in every case.  Here you are going right backward.  You are taking away the right of appeal.  What is the argument put forward for that?  &ldquo;Oh, we do not like the courts.&rdquo;  The courts administer the law.  The present Government does not like the law administered correctly.  The courts are there to perform the first function of a court.  The courts are to stand between the liberty of the subject and the tyranny of the Executive. For that reason, the courts are, as far as the Front Bench can manage it, to be completely swept away.  The courts are to be swept away and the great barrier which we have in our Constitution, that there will be independent judges to see that the individual citizen is not trampled upon by a tyrannical Executive, is to be taken away.</P>
    <P>They hate the idea that the courts should intervene.  The Executive is not to be trammelled or bound in any way by the law.  The Executive is above the law.  The Executive will be a law unto themselves, and if the courts intervene, well then the courts are really shocking and horrible things in intervening to save the liberty of the subject.  Our judges have been made irremovable in order that they will stand between the citizen and the tyranny of an Executive.  That is what the judges were made irremovable for. At one time they were not irremovable. They could be removed at the pleasure of the Executive, and all confidence in the administration of justice was completely <Col N="812" /> gone.  Now we have judges that are irremovable by the Executive, and their jurisdiction is to be taken away from them as far as this Government can do it, because they are likely to stand between the citizen and the Executive and breaches of the law, known breaches of the law&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If I am not making myself clear to the Attorney-General, I am perfectly indifferent as to whether I make myself clear to him, but it does not interest me, but it does interest me to make myself clear to every ordinary Deputy in this House. This right of appeal is to be taken away.  Why?  What is the reason? The reason that is to be given is this: that the courts protect the individual and that the Executive is of the opinion that the individual should not be protected by the law.  The law is to be no longer a shield for the individual who is politically opposed to the present Government.  That is the object in taking away the right of appeal, that and no other.  You have got here a thing not wrong in itself, but a thing which is made fantastically illegal.  You have got a drastic method of procedure embodied in this Bill which is not to be found in the procedure adopted against persons who have committed crimes of the greatest moral turpitude, and the House, without the possibility of amendment, is asked to pass this Bill.  You may do it, but you are certainly putting a stain upon yourselves, which possibly would <Col N="813" /> not matter, if you were not also putting a stain upon this House as a branch of the legislative assembly of this country.</P>

I can quite understand Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney raising the question of there being no appeal.  I can quite see that there is an argument in favour of there being a right of appeal.  What I wished to draw Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney's attention to was that he was making an indirect attack upon the District Justices, and I wanted to know whether he realised what he was doing.  Apparently he did not realise it, or he is quite regardless of the effect of the words which he used.  The charges to be brought before District Justices under this Act will be of the simplest possible character&mdash;questions of fact.  Why the Deputy should work himself up to such a fury because there will not be another trial of a matter which is merely a question of fact I cannot say.  One might pay more attention to his argument if he did not preface it by the suggestion that any of those offences will not be moral offences once this Bill is through.  He repeated the argument of Deputy Desmond Fitzgerald that it would be quite morally forgivable to break this law, and that those crimes are manufactured crimes.</P>

      <P>I have already referred to the Cronin case. In the case of Commandant Cronin there was never any plea whatever in regard to time, so far as I read the account of his case.  He made no suggestion that he was misled by anything that appeared in the <i>Irish Press</i>, nor did he plead that it was unfair that he should be taken unawares and charged with this offence, or that he was prepared to leave this association.</P>

      <P>A great deal was said about the <i>Irish Press</i> and the publication in the <i>Irish Press</i>, but when Commandant Cronin went into the box he never suggested that he saw the announcement in the <i>Irish Press.</i> The whole use of the <i>Irish Press</i> incident was a mere piece of political propaganda, and was quite dishonest from start to finish.  That one incident <Col N="815" /> surely is not enough on which to base any case that an unfair advantage will be taken of any persons by their being charged under an order of the existence of which they were not aware. Deputy Dockrell can rest assured that there will be no advantage taken of people who can genuinely say that they were not aware of any order having been made&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In the minute available I want to say that we again had Deputy McGilligan and Deputy Morrissey posing as advisers to the trade union movement.  Deputy McGilligan was wonderfully concerned that trade unions would not have the right to wear badges.  The Deputy is a member of a party which is concerned with taking away not merely the right to wear a badge but with taking away from the workers the right even to withdraw labour in the event of a strike.  The Deputy is concerned about badges.  He would have them retain their badge, but he would take away from them the rights they had for hundreds of years.  That is the kind of solicitude which Deputy McGilligan has for the trade union movement.  Deputy Morrissey comes <Col N="818" /> along to advise the trade union movement as well.  Deputy Morrissey was a member of a trade union up to a few years ago.  I am sorry that he has left the House.  I do not think he is a member of a trade union now.  If he is, I should like to know what union he is a member of.  I should like to know from Deputy Morrissey whether he is speaking for the trade union movement or whether we are.  The clear purpose of their speeches was to try to get us to pull the Cumann na nGaedheal chestnuts out of the fire. That is not happening.  Not even Deputy McGilligan's rhetorical acrobatics here this evening will induce us to do it.  Here we get Deputy McGilligan, a member of the Party that wants to withdraw the right of the workers to strike, and Deputy Morrissey, who, so far as I know, is a non-trade unionist, purporting to advise trade unionists.</P>

      <P>At this stage of the Bill it is, perhaps, too much to hope that anything very new can be said. But the two features of the debate, so far, that have struck me most foreibly have been the complete failure of the Government to show, otherwise than by bare assertion, that there was any danger in the Blue Shirt movement, or anything improper about the Blue Shirt organisation; and their equal <Col N="821" /> failure to show that there was not in existence a state of things for which the Blue Shirt movement was required as an antidote.  I opened this debate on as conciliatory a tone as I possibly could, and I made a speech that was almost as much a speech against militarism in general as against this actual Bill.  Let me say that I do not think that if the Government wanted to promote militarism in this country they could do a better stroke for that cause than by bringing in this Bill and forcing it through the House in the way they are doing.  There has been no response from the Government side to the attempt to deal with this subject in a reasonable and conciliatory manner. The Deputy who immediately followed me in the debate had hardly got on his legs when, without a scintilla of evidence or even the pretence of a scintilla of evidence, he proceeded to make the offensive accusation that this Party was receiving or seeking financial assistance from known enemies of this country.  That was the immediate reaction of, I presume, a typical member of the Party opposite to the attempt to deal with this subject in a conciliatory way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following him, we had the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  So far as I could make out, the Minister rested his case on two things.  One was, that a certain amount of strong language had been used in the course of controversy by the supporters of the United Ireland Party.  What does that teach us?  How much importance attaches to that fact?  Do we not all know that violent language is used on both sides in politics and indeed in the politics of every country; that there is violent language used which, in our cool senses, we would much rather had not been used.  I venture to say, and I venture to say it confidently, that for every ounce of abusive or scurrilous language that has proceeded from the United Ireland Party there has been at least a hundred-weight of such abuse from its opponents.  If we want to accomplish anything in the way of conciliation and co-operation, it is not a good plan to go back and examine old files and work ourselves up into a fury because <Col N="822" /> of language that had been used which appears to us to have been unnecessarily offensive.  As far as I could make out, the Minister for Industry and Commerce took that line for the express purpose of preventing himself from getting into a reasonable frame of mind.  He did not wish to be in a reasonable frame of mind.  Then, in the absence of any evidence to show that, on the surface, the Blue Shirt organisation was an improper one, he proceeded to suggest that there were at the back of it a group of designing men who were hoodwinking and deceiving such persons as Deputy Dillon and myself, men whom those on the Fianna Fáil Benches knew better than we did, and of whose career they took an unfavourable and sinister view.  I do not know why it is that when the special kind of history in Irish politics, which is usually described as &ldquo;having a national record&rdquo; belongs to somebody of the Fianna Fáil Party, it is a thing to be lauded to the skies, and furthermore, if there are any of us who are without the special kind of history for which they have endeavoured to monopolise the term &ldquo;national record&rdquo; they do not hesitate to reproach us for it.  Yet, when they are referring to members of our Party who have that national record, they at once suggest that there is something in that record which makes these people dangerous and sinister.</P>
    <P>Now, this is all absolute humbug about the alleged dangers lurking in the background in connection with the Blue Shirts.  The vast majority of the members of that organisation came into it since the Party merger, and since whatever Fascist atmosphere, rightly or wrongly, may have been attributed to it before that merger, has been dissipated.</P>
    <P>The rank and file of the League of Youth through the country are quite correctly described by General O'Duffy as the cream of the young men in this country.  You have only to see them, to talk to them, to move among them to know that they are a thoroughly decent crowd in every possible way.  I am quite certain that when the VicePresident on that day to which I <Col N="823" /> referred a week or two ago in this House drove past 1,000 or 1,500 of them on the road outside Kildare he must have been struck by that fact; and he must have been struck by the fact that he was accorded a very different kind of reception, that he met with a very different spirit and very different manners from what, say, Deputy Cosgrave or myself would expect to meet with if we drove through a Fianna Fáil meeting and along a procession of a mile or so of Fianna Fáil supporters.  In season and out of season, those young men, who are already drawn from the type that is the community's backbone, and that is the most law-abiding part of the community, are having preached to them the doctrines of obedience to law, of love of law and the preservation of the liberty of the individual citizen.</P>
    <P>If there were a group of gangsters in the background, as the Minister for Industry and Commerce suggests, they could not possibly afford to sit still and to see the young men being encouraged and educated along the lines on which they are being encouraged and educated.  I do not hesitate to say that if there were a group of designing men, if there were some scoundrels who were hoping some day to use that organisation for the overthrow of the institutions of this State they would find that if they attempted to use the League of Youth for that purpose the instrument would break in their hands.  But there is no such group.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon and myself may be referred to by Ministers as innocent babies, but we are not completely devoid of common sense or perspicacity. I will frankly admit that we did not come into the merger, which included the National Guard, without some hesitation and doubts.  With regard to the whole of that Youth movement, from the very day of the merger onwards, things could not possibly have proceeded better from our point of view.  If we had suspicions at any time as to the direction that movement might take, those suspicions have been completely scattered. There is not a single meeting that we <Col N="824" /> go to down the country, and we go to them week after week, meeting those young men and talking with those young men, that we do not come away more confident, more satisfied with and more proud of the Youth movement behind the U.I.P. than before we went down.</P>
    <P>It it were the desire of the Government to create a military spirit in the ranks of those young men, if they really believed that there was a group of designing men who were seeking to gain power over those young men, they could not have done better than bring in this Bill if they wanted to give those men an opportunity for getting more power than they had before.  This Bill might certainly be designed to divert the young men from peaceable ideas and to attract them to the more bellicose of their leaders rather than to the more peaceable of their leaders.  I am quite satisfied that if that is the design of the Government, the design will fail.  I do not hesitate to answer the hypothetical question about what will happen if this Bill passes into law. I do not believe this Bill will pass into law.  I believe that by the time this Bill can reach the Statute Book the Government opposite will be out of office.  If this Bill does pass into law, or any other Bill that does not impose upon our people the duty of doing something that is definitely against the laws of morality, then the law will be obeyed, however tyrannical, however unjust, however unreasonable.</P>
    <P>I want to ask the House to consider what it is exactly that the Government have offered us if we consent to drop what is called the uniform.  They have offered us nothing whatsoever except the <i>status quo ante.</i>  They have offered us nothing except to go back to the state of things before the Blue Shirt organisation became a power in the land.  They have asked us, in other words, to hand ourselves over to them and to rely upon them to do something which, in the past, they disastrously failed to do.  They ask us to rely upon them to take a tone about politics in this country and about the Opposition which, in fact, they have never yet taken.  I suppose they ask <Col N="825" /> us to rely upon them to take a line with regard to illegal organisations such as the I.R.A., which, in fact, they have never yet taken.  How can we place that reliance upon them?  They are speaking with two voices at this present moment.  Several of them have got up and denounced ordinary political speeches by the Opposition as if they were treasonable and seditious because they criticised Ministers; as if they were treasonable and seditious, because we believe that the so-called economic war with England is a humbug and the private war of the President.</P>
    <P>That is the line they have taken in the past, and that is the line they are taking in the present.  What reason have we to expect that that will not be the line they will take in the future?  As long as they take that line, they may send what police or troops they like to our meetings, but, nevertheless, they will not be complying with the spirit of democracy, with the spirit of liberty.  They will be hoping that people will think of us as a despicable crowd who have to be protected from the fury of the multitude by Government forces, when, in point of fact, any bitterness of feeling that exists against the Opposition exists only amongst a minority and a small minority and is due entirely to the kind of language that the Government think themselves entitled to use and do use up and down the country every second day.</P>
    <P>What about the I.R.A. or any other illegal organisation?  Have the Government reached a clear and positive attitude with regard to the I.R.A. now?  How can we think they have? How many back benchers would be prepared to go as far as the Minister for Industry and Commerce went?  I have listened attentively to every utterance connected with the I.R.A. that has been made in the House since I became a member and I say this quite confidently, that until the Minister for Industry and Commerce spoke on the subject yesterday, nobody has said that the I.R.A. is an organisation which ought not to exist.  The President indeed has said that they ought not to possess arms, that they <Col N="826" /> ought not to use arms and so forth. But nobody had the courage to say before that the organisation ought not to exist and I am very glad that, at any rate, this debate has elicited that utterance.  I think it was worth while to get it.  Little as it may count in practice, I am glad to have it stated, and on the records of the House, by a responsible Minister.</P>
    <P>But in this very same debate, I need not remind the House, we had a back bencher, a member of that Party, saying that the I.R.A. represented the Irish people.  As I pointed out already, we had a speech on the same lines by Senator Comyn in the Seanad not long ago.  We had a Deputy in this House saying, in the presence of the President of the Executive Council, that the I.R.A. were the real people who should be in control of this House and of this country.  And then Ministers, whose conscience is so strict and so scrupulous about the necessity of Front Bench members of the Opposition repudiating immediately anything improper that is said by their supporters, never repudiate a statement by one of their own Deputies in this House.  Not one of them rose to repudiate any of the statements of this kind made by their own Deputies in the House in the presence of the President of the Executive Council.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that the I.R.A. is a very numerous body or that standing alone it would be a body of any importance.  But it is made important by the fact of its alliance with the rank and file of Fianna Fáil and only by reason of that alliance.  That alliance is a reality and nobody who knows this country can doubt that it is a reality. I know that to some extent it is beneath the surface, but it is there, and the Government got their power to a large extent owing to that alliance and to the sort of atmosphere which that alliance has served to create throughout the country districts. Why is it that throughout the Government's operations under the Public Safety Act they have not yet declared that the I.R.A. is an illegal organisation under that Act?  Why? I cannot imagine any reason.  It <Col N="827" /> appears to me if they wish to make a beginning and get rid of militarism in this country the very first step they should take should be that.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce says it is an illegal organisation.  Very well, then, why not declare it so?  Of course, it is an illegal organisation, but why not declare it so at the time when you are straining the Act to declare illegal organisations which have nothing militaristic in their objects or methods?  On that point alone there is a lack of sincerity in the Government's record which makes it impossible for us to trust them in the simple way in which they ask us by dropping our uniforms and going back to the old position before the Blue Shirt organisation existed.</P>
    <P>In a sense, the importance of this Bill can be overrated even though it does pass.  I do not believe for a minute that if we dropped the blue shirts to-morrow we would go back very far from the stage we have now reached of being able to uphold the rights of the citizens in this country which were not upheld until the League of Youth and its predecessors proved their strength.  But we choose to decide for ourselves whether we will clothe our young men in blue shirts or not.  We will decide that for ourselves.  If the time comes when we consider that that is in any way dangerous we will not hesitate to act accordingly.  But we consider that we are very much better and very much more sincere judges of that subject than are the Government.</P>
    <P>As I said yesterday, romance and glamour have always, or nearly always, been enlisted in this country on the side of law breaking.  We are trying to teach the young people that it is more romantic and more noble to defend the laws and to help the weak individual against the bullies, whether they are bullies in masks or not in masks, or whether they are bullies by daylight or bullies by night.  And if it helps us in that endeavour to have blue shirts we will have blue shirts and no apologies to make for them.  There is one very great difference that nobody can deny between our young men and the young <Col N="828" /> men either of the I.R.A. or the Fianna Fáil Party.  That difference is that we can control them.  They do not go out and interfere with Fianna Fáil meetings. They do not go out and commit raids and outrages.  If they ever had any impulse to do it, and they have not, they would be taught not to do it. I have heard myself on various occasions General O'Duffy&mdash;the much-abused General O'Duffy, the bugbear of the Deputies opposite&mdash;preach to these young men that if they found themselves at a Fianna Fáil meeting with interruptions going on it was their duty to discourage these interruptions just as at their own meetings. That is democracy and that is liberty, and it is for that we stand.</P>
    <P>The Government invite us not to rely upon ourselves.  They invite us to trust to them.  They consider that we are officious in preaching reverence for law and order and in encouraging our young men to take an active part in preserving law and order.  They ask us to throw over every appearance of militarism, however innocent.  I think the proper answer to that is similar to the answer which was made in France to people who wished to abolish capital punishment: &ldquo;Que messieurs les assassins commencent,&rdquo;&ldquo;Let the assassins commence,&rdquo; let the murderers abolish capital punishment first and then the law will abolish it afterwards.  Let militarism be dropped by those in whose hands militarism is a danger and then we will talk.  Let the Government give any evidence worth a snap of our fingers of sincerity in this matter, of a desire to co-operate in this matter, of a spirit of conciliation in this matter, and then we will talk.  Meanwhile, we are not going to be humbugged.</P>

      <P>Deputy MacDermot in the body of his speech tried to create the impression that his speech was a conciliatory one, but certain statements have been made by him which cannot certainly lead to conciliation. We heard a lot of criticism from time to time when we were in Opposition about power outside this House.  We have heard from Deputy MacDermot to-night&mdash;we were told&mdash;<Col N="829" /> that this Bill is not going to become law: that we will be out of office before it can.  What is Deputy MacDermot hinting at?  Is Deputy MacDermot hinting at what General O'Duffy said when this Bill was introduced, when he more or less ordered the Seanad to hold it up?  Is that the suggestion made to-night when we talk glibly about democratic assemblies and democratic rights?  Is this House not democratically elected and selected?  Is this House not the more democratic of the two assemblies that constitute the Oireachtas?  We have been told to-night, in spite of all that glib talk about democratic rights, that this Bill is going to be held up.  And not only that.  There is a certain reservation in Deputy MacDermot's statement about this Bill that if it became law, perhaps not being a really moral law there would then be the question of obeying it.</P>

Deputy Dillon may laugh.  I do not suggest by any means that Deputy Dillon is the lay theologian.  I was not referring to him.  I was referring to Deputy Fitzgerald.</P>

We have been taunted again to-night by Deputy MacDermot as having made no case for this Bill.  I do not know what Deputy MacDermot means by making a case for the Bill.  Deputy MacDermot should have appreciated my difficulty on the Second Reading when I made certain quotations here from reports.  I offered to show these reports to Deputy MacDermot and they are available for him still.  Any reasonable Opposition Deputy can understand the difficulty, when I am asked whether these things happened &mdash;he can understand how difficult it is to show these things to the House. There are obvious difficulties in the way.  As to the reports that I quoted, I pointed out that they indicated that disorders arose from the Blue Shirts attending these meetings.  I indicated that from these reports which I quoted at the time.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Higgins to-night raised the point that the only case we were making was that these people were likely to arm.  I said that was one of the grounds, that they had all the appearance of a militaristic body, and no matter how they might ask us to shut our eyes to what happened in other countries, the fact is that we could not but see they were copying what went on in other countries and we could not help seeing that their organisation was developing along the lines of organisations in other countries.</P>

I submit that in all of these debates no case has been made for the retention of the uniforms.  I do not want at this stage to go over all the ground which has been traversed on Second Reading, and repeated <i>ad nauseam</i> on the Committee Stage, but not a single reason that could convince anybody was put forward except this; that they had to come in, because the Government were not able to govern.  Let us take that assumption and I say it was the only argument which had any weight or conviction in it.  Perhaps this Government has not been able to govern in what one would call quite a completely satisfactory way but I would like to know what Governments have succeeded in governing with complete satisfaction to every citizen.  A lot of point has been made about our giving complete scope to the I.R.A. That has been dealt with by the President on a few occasions when he stated what our attitude was when we came into this House and when we became a Government here.  Our chief desire was that we might be able to carry on in this country as we always believed we could, without coercion Acts and we thought that that would be a policy that would pay best in the end. For over a year afterwards I think you had more comparative peace and you had less crime in the country than you had in the ten years before that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In dealing for a moment with the question of the I.R.A. let us remember that you people over there did all you could to end that problem.  When we came into office you had on the Statute Book in operation the Constitution Seventeenth Amendment Act which gave you unlimited powers to deal with the problem.  In that connection there was some criticism to-night about there being no right of appeal from a conviction for offences for what might be treated as minor offences, and for which there were certain fixed penalties but you had the power of life and death and you left no appeal from <Col N="837" /> that.  Despite all that, the problem was there when we came in here as a Government.  Complaint has been made and we are often taunted about it here, that we are not able to deal with the question of crime in the country. I want Deputies at least to be honest and fair and to consider the number of crimes that were committed during the time they were in office and the number of people apprehended and brought to justice and compare that with the number of crimes since we came into office.  During your time in office you asserted that you were governing the people, that you were able to govern and that you were able to eliminate crime in this country during that period.</P>
    <P>Were you able to say to yourselves: &ldquo;We have cleared this country of all crime and we have now established absolute freedom and liberty for all peaceful citizens in the country&rdquo;?  I mean freedom and liberty in the sense of their homes, and their individual liberty to go about their ordinary avocations without being molested. Could any Deputy or any ex-member of the Cumann na nGaedheal Government say that?  I submit they could not.  All you have to do to get an answer to that is to go back over the number of crimes and the number of undetected crimes that occurred during the ten-year period you were in office and compare them, in their seriousness and in the number of detections, with what has happened since we came into office.  We have contended that in dealing with the problem, which was there, we were getting to a position where we would be able satisfactorily to adjust it without resort to coercion.  I believe that we could have secured that position were it not for the rise in this country of what was regarded and what we regarded as another militaristic body.  You know that if there is one militaristic body in the country, and there is also another in existence&mdash; be it small or large&mdash;one will increase with the other.  One is watching the other.  One is trying to gain strength to catch up with the other.  One militaristic force inevitably gives more strength to the other.</P>

      <P>It is not a question of dealing with the easiest.  It is simply a question of saying to a political Party: &ldquo;Are you prepared to carry out your programme on political lines, or do you want, as an adjunct, a militaristic organisation to assist you?&rdquo;  That is the position.  There is no necessity for either the I.R.A. or this organisation&mdash;the League of Youth or whatever it is now.  There is no necessity for either of them.  We have done our best to try to preserve freedom of speech in the country. General O'Duffy, when he was in charge of the Gárda, knew that everything that possibly could be done was done by him and under his orders to try to preserve peace in the country. I am continually getting taunted from the other side of the House about interference with the police in the carrying out of their duties.  I say that those taunts are baseless and unfounded.  Instructions have been given to the police to take at all times every necessary step to ensure freedom of speech to the people of this country. That policy is being adhered to, and that policy will be adhered to.  If that policy is carried out there is no necessity for any people to take on themselves police duties.  There is no necessity for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have not yet got an answer from the Opposition to the question as to whether, if they were in power, they would permit us to start here a body on semi-military lines, taking it in its mildest form, to take to ourselves police duties.  Would they allow people to go out armed with bludgeons and batons, which would inevitably lead to the using of more lethal weapons? Some of the batons I have seen, even Deputies opposite would admit, were capable of taking human life.  There is no question about that.  Used in a <Col N="839" /> certain way, any of those weapons could take human life.  Suppose that lives get lost in that way, are you not going to get to a position where people are going to take stronger lethal weapons to answer those?  You will have a position where you will have bodies scattered about the country, claiming the right to use lethal weapons, and always being able to put up some case about using them in self-defence. People may be killed.  What position have you then?  You will have bitterness in that area, and it is only a question of time until reprisals take place.  Before people could see where they are leading to there would be in this country a civil war again. There is no question about that.  I should like Deputies to realise, no matter how they may criticise this Bill, that it is not directed against a political Party.  This Bill is directed against what we regard as a military organisation.  We cannot help seeing what happened in other countries.  We cannot help seeing that you have adopted here the same methods as were adopted there.  We cannot help seeing that in this country since those Blue Shirts have paraded in the country a good deal of bitterness has been created, and considerable disorder has arisen at public meetings.</P>

      <P>Is it not a dangerous idea to try to get into the heads of people outside, who are in this organisation that the Bill is intended to affect at the moment?  Other organisations may be affected if they come within its scope in the future.  Is this not something that people should be very careful about at the present time?  Whether we like it or not there is a tension in the country; there is a state of affairs in the country which is not satisfactory to anybody.  There is a state of affairs in the country that might very easily be brought to a critical and severe pass.  So far as the provisions of the Bill are concerned nobody can complain that it imposes very severe penalties.  Complaint has been made here that an opportunity has not been given for an adequate discussion on the Committee Stage.  I do not know whether reference to that matter is relevant on this stage.  If that is so, it is not our fault.  If so much time had not been taken up there could have been sufficient consideration of those amendments on the Committee Stage.  In any case I can assure Deputies that those amendments will be considered by the Executive Council before this Bill goes to the Seanad.  A lot of criticism has been made about the powers given to the police under Section 5.  I had not an opportunity on the Committee Stage to reply to that.  The powers given to the police under Section 5, as I admitted on the Second Stage, are very wide, but I also pointed out, on Second Reading, so were the powers that were given under <Col N="841" /> the Seventeenth Amendment Act. Under that Act, every member of the Executive Council, and every member of this House, could be landed down in the College Street Station by the police and detained there for a certain time. The police get these powers but the police do not use these powers in that way, unless you want to suggest that police forces are corrupt or in some other way, are not people who will carry out their duties properly and in a sensible way.  If you admit that they will carry out their duties in a sensible way, you cannot be anticipating all the extraordinary things that you were anticipating.</P>

      <P>I waited until this stage of the Bill to express my views in connection with it, in order that I might hear, if possible, what the back <Col N="843" /> benchers of Fianna Fáil might have to say.  Before I go on to say what I had hoped for and expected from the Fianna Fáil back benchers, I must refer to some of the matters mentioned by the Minister for Justice.  Does the Minister for Justice expect anybody to believe him when he says that this Bill is directed not against a political Party, but against a military organisation? Is not the Bill, on the face of it, directed against a political organisation and not against a military organisation? Has not the Dáil and the Government, by its majority to-day, refused an amendment which might have led us to believe that the Minister for Justice was serious when he said that they are not working against a political organisation?  When there was an amendment down to bring the operations of the Bill against a Party whose aims were to subvert the State by force of arms, that amendment, with the aid of the Minister for Justice and his Party, was refused by the House.  Does the Minister now expect us to believe, for one moment, that the Bill is directed against military organisations instead of political organisations?  Is it not, on the face of it, directed against one political organisation&mdash;our political organisation?</P>
      <P>I was going to say that I waited until the last stage of the Bill to speak, excepting to hear something from persons on the other side of the House&mdash;from whom, perhaps, I was foolish to hope for something&mdash;because there are many persons on that side of the House whom I have known for a number of years.  I knew them in other days, and in spite of different political affiliations in the last ten or 12 years, there are many of them for whom I have a sort of kindly feeling, because of old associations.</P>

I would ask you, Sir, kindly to see that Deputies do not interrupt me unnecessarily.  I am not going to take any statement from any Deputy on that side of the House without having some foundation for it substantiated by documents.  If I ask about the money, then I want to see the bank accounts, the cheque vouchers in the bank and so on.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasPatrickDowdall" hpid="Mr. Dowdall Mr. Dowdall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowdall</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, Sir, I am coming to that now.  One of the remarks passed by Deputies on the opposite side was: &ldquo;Are we to be blamed for wishing to be successful?&rdquo;  Certainly not. They are not to be blamed for wishing to be successful.  But the end does not justify the means and, certainly, I consider that the Blue Shirt organisation is not a justifiable means of getting themselves returned to power.  I am very anxious not to say or to do anything that will in any way cause bad feelings.  I think we have quite sufficient of that already, and anything <Col N="847" /> that I say is said in the best interests of the country and of all Parties. Deputy Lynch, speaking a while ago, referred to other days.  Now, it is very important that Deputies on both sides of the House, Deputies who were companions like Deputy Corry and some of the other Deputies here, should have a regard for one another.  There are some of the Deputies in the Opposition on whom I cast a certain amount of blame, but there are some of them, like Deputy Lynch, for whom I have a very high regard.  As I was saying, Deputy Lynch referred to other days.  There is a saying that &ldquo;Conscience doth make cowards of us all.&rdquo;  I wonder if that be true.  Do the members of the Opposition, like Deputy Lynch and some of the others, who were with our friends here in Belfast jail and other jails, ever, during the silent watches of the night, find the still small voice of conscience touching any slumbering chords of memory that will bring them back to the high and noble purpose that actuated them when they were fighting for the good of their Motherland? There is no question that all this lip talk about Youth movements and all that sort of thing is not worth a row of pins if it is not backed up by something more solid.  There are some things in this Bill with which I am not quite in agreement&mdash;things that I think the Bill would be better without&mdash;but the Minister for Justice and the Attorney-General are better judges than I am, and when they decide to keep those things in the Bill I think they are the best judges.  I ask the members of the Opposition to bear in mind what the Minister for Justice has referred to and what has been referred to here in the course of this debate, that we are leading to a state of civil war and that any political Party which organises a uniformed body to support them, like what you have on the Continent and what was strongly objected to in England, is contributing towards such a condition of things.  I can refer Deputies to one of the issues of the <i>Manchester Guardian</i> and it will give them a very different idea.  I feel that all the simulated indignation and pretended anger of the Deputies opposite <Col N="848" /> is not at all so much because they are against the Bill as because their bluff has been called, and I hope the Bill will pass.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Sometimes one feels in this House that Deputies do not realise entirely what is going on outside, and I would ask the House to take heed of the very serious warning and the very serious speech made by the Minister for Justice just eight minutes ago.  He said that there is a tension outside, an atmosphere, that is not satisfactory to anyone. That is true, not so much the political atmosphere as the atmosphere of unrest amongst the tenement dwellers and the unemployed who are living on doles.  They are wondering when the time is to come when this House will stop talking politics and get down to the things that count. There are 6,000 families in Dublin to-day on relief, at an average of 15/- a week given to them by the ratepayers of the City of Dublin, and not by the Government.  Within the past couple of weeks, in order to assist the Government, another authority, of which I am a member, recognising the difficulty, put on 1,200 workingmen on a building scheme on the outskirts of the city in order to help you in your duties.  Then, we come along and we find this House, I will not say wasting, but on the border of wasting six days in discussing a Bill whether one side is to carry arms and throw stones and bottles at speakers at public meetings, which they did at Mrs. Collins-O'Driscoll 12 months ago, and whether the other side were to be in uniform and carry a baton or stick to protect themselves. I must certainly say that without that body of young men free speech would be denied to us.  In Dublin City within the past two years there was no hope of any candidate on one side getting a hearing.  He got no opportunity of making his voice heard.  I ask the House again to heed the warning given by the Minister.  Dublin is in a state of unrest.  The people in the tenements who are getting served with pink pieces of paper from their landlords, <Col N="849" /> who say they want their rooms or their rent, are in a state of unrest. These people say: &ldquo;We will not be put out of our homes; we will not allow our children to be thrown in the gutter; we are not content to wait any longer and live on the miserable dole we get.&rdquo;  I appeal again to the House to settle this question.  In some days 100 cases are brought to my notice and they use language like this: &ldquo;Around the corner, over there; what the hell are they talking about?  Give us work, not doles.&rdquo;  I invite any Deputy to go down to the police court.  The Minister will find that there are 700 or 800 decrees for possession against unemployed workmen in this city of ours.  I warn the House that there is real tension outside.</P>

      <P>Hearing so many different appeals from the opposite benches during the last few weeks and particularly the appeal that was made by Deputy Lynch to-night, I begin to wonder why we did not hear that sort of appeal from Deputy Lynch while the 19 or 20 coercion Bills were passing through this House during the last ten or 12 years.  In those years the Deputy saw one-time comrades of his in Belfast jail, getting arrested, kicked around the country, thrown into jail, let out, thrown in again and out again. Deputy Lynch was here all the time while these Acts were being passed. We also heard Deputy MacDermot talking about freedom of speech and law and order and decency.  Is it freedom of speech Deputies opposite want, or is it licence?</P>

What would be his attitude at public meetings where he heard the President of this State alluded to as the Pigott of 1933 and that from the platform by some little pup who was stuck under the bed from 1916 to 1931 and who then came out of it to tell this House that he would neither take off his hat to the &ldquo;Soldiers' Song,&rdquo; nor kow-tow to the flag?  That is the type of thing Deputy Dillon told us and here to-night he said that the Blue Shirts were formed for the purpose of protecting public meetings.

Anywhere I was present when any individual in the crowd attempted to interrupt an Opposition speaker, I stopped him at once. There was very little of that in my constituency.  During the last two years it has crept in with the Army Comrades and the Blue Shirts; they have been practically the whole cause of it.  There are individuals going around the country making filthy political speeches, just the kind of dirt that the country sank to in 1914 and that Sinn Fein put an end to.</P>
