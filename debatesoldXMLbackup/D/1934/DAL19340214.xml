      <P>The Deputy has in mind, presumably, the difficulties which have arisen in matters of security and legal costs in connection with advances being made by local authorities under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts to farmers in occupation of Land Commission holdings.  I am advised that these difficulties can be overcome by amendment of these Acts, and proposals are under consideration for an Amending Bill which I hope to be in a position to introduce early in this session.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he is aware that Mr. Robert Ely, Moymar, Moyne, Templemore, Co. Tipperary, has reconstructed his house under the terms of the Housing (Financial and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1932, and claims a grant of £40 in respect thereof; whether he is further aware that an inspector passed the construction as having reached a stage that entitled the owner to payment of half the grant in October, 1933: whether he is further aware that notwithstanding several applications from the owner neither the grant nor any portion <Col N="1346" /> thereof has been paid to date, and whether, in view of these facts, he will see that the grant is paid forthwith.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Robert Ely's application was investigated by one of the Department's inspectors in October last.  A specification and estimate of the cost of the work and a certificate that the house was capable of reconstruction were prepared by him.  In November last the applicant furnished the necessary documents as to valuation, etc., showing that his application came within the requirements of the Act.  A certificate for payment of an instalment amounting to half the grant has been issued by the inspector.  A form of claim has been sent to the applicant and on its return to the Department, duly completed, payment of the instalment will be made.</P>

      <P>Customs duty is not chargeable on compression joints as such.  There is a Customs duty chargeable at the rate of 50 per cent. ad valorem (33½ per cent. preferential rate) on any of the following articles made wholly or mainly of brass, bronze or gun-metal, or a combination of any of those metals:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Couplings, joints, and other similar fittings which, in the opinion of the Revenue Commissioners, are designed, constructed, and intended for use in connection with tubes or pipes and bear any external screwthreading and are of an external diameter, at any such screw-threading, not exceeding one and one-half inches.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Any of the articles mentioned in the Deputy's question and which come within this definition are liable to Customs duty at the rate specified.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is yet in a position to state when the Unemployment Assistance Act, 1933, will be put into operation and when payments to unemployed persons under the Act are likely to be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Unemployment Assistance Act can be put into operation, it is necessary to provide suitable offices at various centres and to arrange for their equipment and staffing, and large quantities of forms have to be prepared and printed.  The staff of my Department are endeavouring to have all the necessary arrangements completed at the earliest possible date and I hope to be able to appoint the 1st March next as the date from which so much of the Act as authorises persons to apply for qualification certificates will come into operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The taking of applications for qualification certificates, and the issue or refusal of such certificates, necessarily preliminary to the payment of unemployment <Col N="1350" /> assistance, will be a task of considerable dimensions, and I hope that the progress of this work will enable me to appoint an early date in April as the date from which so much of the Act as authorises persons to apply for unemployment assistance will come into operation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he is aware that formerly Donegal cured herrings secured a ready market in Germany and Poland, and that now, owing to the prohibitive tariff imposed by those countries on herrings, there is no sale in those countries for herrings, and whether, in view of the preferential treatment accorded German and Polish products by the Government, any attempt has been made to secure reciprocal treatment for Donegal cured herrings, and if not, if he will state whether there is any prospect of such agreement being reached.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to inform the Deputy, in the first place, that neither German nor Polish goods of any kind enjoy preferential treatment on entry into the Saorstát.  The possibility of securing more favourable entry, so far as duties are concerned for Saorstát herrings into Germany, Poland and other countries has been carefully considered and the Deputy may rest assurred that no opportunity of improving the position will be lost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1351" /> In the case of Germany, the position has not changed from what it was in November, 1932, when the President, in reply to a question from the Deputy, stated that, owing to distress in the German fishing industry, the duty on imported herrings had been substantially increased with a view to protecting the home industry.  The prospects of having the position altered in favour of Saorstát herrings are not good at the moment but every effort will continue to be made in the direction of obtaining, if possible, some easement from the present high duties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Census of Production Reports published by my Department must be regarded as the normal source of information relating to the number of concerns and the number of persons employed in any industry, as well as other details relating to Saorstát industries.  It is difficult and in many cases impossible to give information by way of Parliamentary reply or otherwise in advance of the completion of the official inquiries which precede the issue <Col N="1352" /> of Census of Production Reports, and I wish it to be understood that ordinarily I will not attempt it.  I have decided, after considerable hesitation, to give the Deputy the information he requires in relation to such of the industries mentioned in the question for which comparable figures for the different dates are available.  This information is not available for the industries at 7, 11 and 13 of the question as it was collected on a different basis for 1933 than in previous years.  As regards item No.  12, I would refer the Deputy to my reply to his question of January 31st, 1934.  In respect to the remaining industries the following is the information:&mdash;</P>

      <P>So far as brush-making is concerned, the figures for 1931 included concerns and persons employed in the making of brush stocks.  These firms and persons were not included in the 1933 figures.  In the case of wholesale clothing, waterproofs and women's light clothing were not included in the 1933 figures but were in the 1931 figures.  Again, I want to say that it is undesirable that information should be given in advance of the official returns because discrepancies of <Col N="1353" /> the kind I have mentioned may give rise to misunderstanding, and it is only when the full information is available that reliable information can be given in any case.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that there may be some difference in the case of wholesale clothing, but I did not ask that in my supplementary question. I asked about brush-making and furniture.  Will the Minister say if he is able to tell us how many persons are employed in these particular cases? Would he not tell us how many firms are included in that particular return and then add anything that he wishes to say by way of explanation?  Where is the difficulty about that, and what is the difference between it and the others?</P>

      <P>The only difference is the absence of information which would enable the reliable figures to be given at this stage.  There are items included in 1931 that were not included in 1933.  I could not give the Deputy the items, but mattresses were one item not included in 1933.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>According to the information at my disposal the prices of Perennial and Italian Ryegrass seeds show an increase of approximately 100 per cent. over last year's prices.  This increase exists not only in the Saorstát but also in Great Britain, Northern Ireland and other countries, and is mainly due to the shortage of the crop in 1933.</P>
      <P>The duty of 2/- per cwt was imposed with a view to encouraging and extending the production and machining of Ryegrass seeds in the Saorstát.  Hitherto the bulk of such seeds grown here were exported in the rough, uncleaned condition, while the greater portion of the home requirements of Ryegrass seeds was imported in the machined state.</P>
      <P>Following the imposition of the duty this machining is being carried out in the Saorstát, and at present there are ample stocks of home-machined Perennial and Italian Ryegrass seeds available.  The removal of the import duty would not, therefore, materially affect prices in the home market.</P>

      <P>I may point out that the licences for the export of fat cattle are now being issued to feeders only, and that the allocation of the licences is based on the recent census figures certified by the Department's inspectors.

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  In this Resolution&mdash;</P>
      <P>the expression &ldquo;preferential rate&rdquo; means a rate of the duty less than the normal rate of the duty in respect of which the expression is used; references to a country to which a preferential rate applies shall be construed as referring to a country articles imported from which are chargeable with the relevant duty at such preferential rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  Where a duty of customs, imposed by an Act, resolution, or order passed or made before the passing of the Act giving effect to this Resolution, <Col N="1362" /> is chargeable at a preferential rate in respect of articles imported from particular countries, the Executive Council may by order do all or any of the following things in respect of articles chargeable with such duty and imported into Saorstát Eireann on or after a specified date not prior to the date of such order, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  vary (whether by addition, omission, or otherwise) the countries to which such preferential rate applies;</P>
    <P>(b)  restrict such preferential rate to articles in respect of which a specified percentage of added value arises from manufacture in a country to which such preferential rate applies, and for that purpose vary any such restriction existing by virtue of any Act, resolution, or order passed or made before the passing of the said Act giving effect to this Resolution;</P>
    <P>(c)  restrict such preferential rate to articles imported directly or by a specified route from a country to which such preferential rate applies.</P>
    <P>(3)  Where a duty of customs is imposed after the passing of the Act giving effect to this Resolution and the Act, resolution, or order imposing such duty appoints a particular rate of such duty to be the preferential rate thereof for the purposes of the said Act giving effect as aforesaid, the Executive Council may by order do all or any of the following things in respect of articles chargeable with such duty and imported into Saorstát Eireann on or after a specified date not prior to the date of such order, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  appoint the countries to which such preferential rate shall apply:</P>
    <P>(b)  vary (whether by addition, omission, or otherwise) the countries to which such preferential rate for the time being applies:</P>
    <P>(c)  restrict such preferential rate to articles in respect of which a specified percentage of added <Col N="1363" /> value arises from manufacture in a country to which such preferential rate applies;</P>
    <P>(d)  restrict such preferential rate to articles imported directly or by a specified route from a country to which such preferential rate applies.</P>
    <P>(4)  The Executive Council may at any time by order amend or revoke, in respect of articles imported into Saorstát Eireann on or after a specified date not prior to the date of such order, an order previously made under the Act giving effect to this Resolution, including an order amending a previous order.</P>
    <P>It is necessary, under Standing Orders, that this Financial Resolution should be adopted by the Committee on Finance and reported before the Customs Duties (Preferential Rates) Bill, which is the next item on the Order Paper, is introduced.  It is, of course, open to the Dáil to debate the principle of the Bill on the Resolution, but the House will recollect that when a Financial Resolution amending the Emergency Imposition of Duties Act, 1932, was moved, the Committee on Finance did not discuss the subject of the Resolution but postponed it to the Second Reading of the Bill.  I may say that the Resolution recites briefly the terms of Sections 2, 3 and 4 of the proposed Bill, which deal respectively with (1) the variation of applicability of existing preferential rates of customs duties; (2) the appointment and application of preferential rates to future customs duties, and (3) the amendment and revocation of orders made under the Act.  It is not possible to say at this Stage what the likely effect of review will be.  That will, of course, depend upon the extent to which it may be found necessary to avail of the powers provided in the Bill.  The only direct charge which will fall on the Exchequer under the Bill, apart from such normal charges as those for stationery, printing and publication of orders, will be in respect of such additional staff as may be required in the Department of Industry and Commerce and the Office of the Revenue Commissioners.  The <Col N="1364" /> computation of that amount depends also upon the use which will be made of the powers which the Bill proposes to confer.  I do not think I have anything to add which at this Stage would assist the House.  I would suggest that, as on the previous occasion, the Resolution might be accepted so that leave to introduce the Bill might be given in due course.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This has only just been circulated, and I have been unable to read it very carefully, but we have most favoured nation arrangements with a number of countries, and under that arrangement, if any country has any preference it applies to the others, especially in relation to Imperial preference.  I am not quite sure how this is going to work in relation to this matter, but it seems to me that this means that in the case of each individual country or item from that country, a special arrangement has to be made with regard to it.  The ordinary system is that when a change in the minimum is made in relation to any goods, it applies to all the people who are affected by the most favoured nation clause.  Could the Minister tell us how this is going to operate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>The Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should say, perhaps, that any country that is <Col N="1365" /> entitled to receive most favoured nation treatment from us would continue to receive it, and if the benefit of a preferential rate is extended to any country, it will apply to all countries entitled to receive it, so long as these agreements remain in existence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the intention with regard to this to vary what is called Imperial preference?  That is the idea because, from what the Minister says, if any country is receiving most favoured nation treatment, and a further advantage is given to one, it must spread to all.  I take it then that the purpose of this Financial Resolution and of the Bill is to vary Imperial preference solely?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is, no doubt, aware that this is the only nation in the Commonwealth which extends the benefit of every Imperial Preference rate automatically to all the others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood from the Ottawa Conference report that quite a number of concessions were granted by various countries to other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>But not generally extended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I think fairly generally extended, and much more extended, I think, in so far as reference to goods is concerned than in our case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>When I say not generally extended, it is quite clear that there is no most favoured nation treatment in operation between members of the Commonwealth.  This is the only country which, in fact, extends it to all the others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>My recollection is that in one particular case we gave a preference on a large number of items and received a preference, or a promise of preference, in respect of three.  That is not the point I am at.  The point I am at is that while we may give a lot of paper preferences, the question as to what the actual preferences are and what they amount to is another matter altogether.  Our paper qualifications may be perfect from the point <Col N="1366" /> of view expressed by the Minister, but very imperfect so far as practice is concerned.  The Minister knows quite well what I mean.  Is this a variation of Imperial preference?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister give us some information as to what extent, outside of that, such variations are intended?  I take it that such an item as coal would be involved in this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no preferential duty on coal.  The Deputy will recollect the discussion we had on the report of the Ottawa Conference which was submitted to the House.  At that stage and at the Conference, we intimated that the practice of extending generally to all Commonwealth countries the benefit of a preferential rate adopted by us was going to terminate so far as we were concerned, as we were the only Commonwealth country adopting that practice, and that, in future, we would grant preferential treatment only to specific countries where definite commitments to give such treatment had been entered into.  In so far as we are terminating that automatic preference to Commonwealth countries, it can be said that Imperial preference is disappearing.  This is the last place in which it has survived.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>It has survived on paper very largely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In reality and, very definitely, in reality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister give us some information about the items?  Surely to goodness our trade with South Africa is negligible, and whatever advantages we give there come down to a question of pounds, shillings and pence, and it is a negligible amount.  Similarly, with regard to Australia and similarly with regard to Canada.  The balance of trade, so far as many of these countries are concerned, is altogether in their favour even though those are negligible <Col N="1367" /> amounts.  I suppose the Minister knows pretty well what I am driving at?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not quite clear yet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I will put it quite plainly and distinctly.  If this is a power which is to be exercised by two, let us say, friendly or unfriendly Governments operating at a distance of 150 or 200 miles&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and making their minds clear on one item only&mdash;how one can hit the other&mdash;we are wasting time. What we want is trade.  The Minister will accept that.  What they must want is trade, because it is a characteristic of their history and their tradition and everything else.  Are we simply going to sit down and say: &ldquo;How can we hit any one of these particular items regardless of the consequences?&rdquo;  If we do, it is not going to end in satisfactory trade relations.  After all, the bulk of our trade is still there, and if this is going to mean simply an arbitrary imposition of 5 per cent., 10 per cent., 15 per cent. or 20 per cent. additional in respect of the trade from one country, then I say that is bad business.  Even on this question, supposing we exclude all the others, is there going to be no such thing as a business talk about it before it is done, or are we going to have the damage first and clear up the mess afterwards?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite clear that the Deputy misunderstands the purpose of the Bill.  In so far as it has been decided to withdraw the preference heretofore extended to British goods, because of the situation existing between the two countries, that has been done.  It has been done by the machinery of emergency orders or by the imposition of special duties on these goods.  This Bill has no bearing on that situation.  It is designed to end the anomalous position in which this country, the only one in the Commonwealth, was required by law to extend automatically to every Commonwealth country the preferences given by it to any one of these countries.  We have <Col N="1368" /> not been able to arrange treaties on a most favoured Commonwealth nation basis with any other Commonwealth country, with one exception.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Which one?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Dominion of Canada.  On that account we are terminating the legal position which required us to give that automatic preference in accordance with the announced intention of the Government, and the practice of other Commonwealth Governments.  The Bill; of course, also gives power to extend the benefit of preferential rates to non-Commonwealth countries if agreements are entered into with these countries which involve such action on our part, and if such action appears to be in our interest.  In other words, we are taking, in relation to the preferential rates of duty in operation, the same powers as other Governments have.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I would take it from what the Minister for Finance said that, so far as this Bill is concerned, it does not really change the position in relation to any non-Commonwealth country.  Our relations with other countries are divided into two classes &mdash;members of the Commonwealth and non-members of the Commonwealth. So far as non-members are concerned, in respect of practically everyone with whom we do any business, we have a most favoured nation agreement.</P>

    <P>That, as regards any Act of the present Session to amend the Acquisition of Land (Allotments) Act, 1926, for the purpose of facilitating the provision of allotments for unemployed persons, to authorise the making of grants out of public moneys for the like purpose, to amend the said Act in other respects, and to make provision for other matters connected with the <Col N="1371" /> matters aforesaid, it is expedient to authorise the payment out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas of any grants made and any other expenses incurred (being expenses which are required by such Act to be paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas) in carrying such Act into effect.</P>

    <P>These two amendments are put down for the purpose of finding out who are the third class of unemployed in the country for whom this Bill is intended to make provision.  We know already that there are 94,000 people drawing unemployment insurance under the <Col N="1372" /> Unemployment Insurance Acts, and from 60,000 to 90,000 for whom the Minister is making preparations to give doles during next year; but who are the third class, the other people in addition to those I have mentioned?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Possibly that is a little bit of a forecast.  I do not think the Minister for Agriculture's draft has gone to that point yet.  Would the Minister tell us who the third class are, and what are the prescribed conditions he intends to lay down to make people eligible for these grants in relation to allotments other than the two classes referred to in paragraphs (a) and (b)?</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not know whether the Unemployment Assistance Act will be in operation before this measure, and we may have to deal with the unemployed by regulations under it before the Unemployment Assistance Act comes into force.  In the second place, it is possible that for some technical reason people might be prevented from enjoying the provisions of this Act through being employed casually for two or three days at the time the allotments were being allotted.  It is considered necessary to have power to prescribe regulations with regard to people who give casual labour one day a week, or maybe two or three days, at the time a particular allotment is made, and who, perhaps, had not done so for months before or for months afterwards.  The paragraph in the sub-section is intended to cover such contingencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's explanation with regard to the second class of persons is that this Act is intended to deal with people who will be entitled to assistance under the Unemployment Assistance Act, but who may not be in receipt of such assistance owing to some delay on the Minister's part.  If that is all that is in question it could be met by amending the paragraph: by making it read, a person in receipt of a certificate in relation to unemployment assistance whether he is enjoying relief or not, or even to meet temporary circumstances. <Col N="1373" /> An amendment to that effect could be moved on Report.  There may be people who would be prevented from benefit under paragraph (b) because they were employed casually for a few days a week.  I would remind the Minister that the test under the Unemployment Assistance Act is not the number of days employed, but the amount earned.  Is it the Minister's proposal that even although a person is in receipt of so much money as would disentitle him to assistance under the Unemployment Assistance Act, such a person is to get the benefit of the provisions of this Act?  If so, let him extend the whole thing, say what is to be the minimum scale of income in a particular week which will deprive a person of an allotment.  Let us get some test fixed.  That is why I put down these amendments: to find out what is in the Minister's mind with regard to conditions, and how they were going to be prescribed.</P>
      <P>The prescribed conditions are going to be laid down by order.  They may be changed from time to time, changed, for instance, to suit the whims of a needy part of the electorate of a particular constituency round about, say, a critical period of the year.  It is undesirable that such power to shift backwards and forwards should be given in regard to what is a public health matter: that there should be power to make such a change just at the will of a Minister, a change made by order, not published to this House and not open to the criticism of the House, and again capable of change when a particular period had passed. I ask the Minister either to agree to delete paragraph (c) with which, of course, sub-section (2) falls, or else agree that the Order will be of the type of Order that is laid on the Table of the two Houses to be nullified by an adverse vote, but without having any effect upon what happened in the meantime.  That, at any rate, will give the House notice, and will enable criticism to be passed in a matter which is eminently open to criticism if it is abused.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (1) (b), line 58, before the word &ldquo;seeds&rdquo; to insert the word &ldquo;vegetable.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not sure that it is necessary to move this amendment at all, because the subject matter of it is tied up in the definition clause&mdash;Section 1 (2). That sub-section lays down that the <Col N="1375" /> words and expressions to which a particular meaning is given by the Principal Act are to have the same meaning under this Bill.  Of course, the whole scope of the earlier Act was limited by the definition of &ldquo;allotments.&rdquo; Allotments, under that Act, are to be for the purpose of growing vegetables for the use of&mdash;and only for the use of&mdash;the person who grows them or his family.  I am assuming that that is still intended and that there will be no provision of seeds or manures or, as now proposed, potato-spraying materials, if the person who gets an allotment attempts to sell the produce of that allotment.  By putting down this amendment, I wanted to find out if it was proposed to abide rigidly by the intention of the original Act&mdash;to provide food for the allottee and his family.  If that be the case, the amendment need not be pressed.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In sub-section (3), line 10, after the word &ldquo;person&rdquo; to insert the words <Col N="1376" />&ldquo;who is ordinarily a civil servant or an officer or employee of a local authority and is&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I put down this amendment in order to place some impediment on the multiplication of inspectors which is proceeding in the country at present.  The phrase used here is very general.  Subject to the happening of certain things &ldquo;any inspector (subject to production by him, if so required, of his authority in writing as an inspector) may enter upon and inspect any of the said allotments and, in respect of any allotment for which seeds, manures or agricultural implements have been provided as aforesaid&rdquo;&mdash;there are certain additions being made to that to-day&mdash;&ldquo;may also inspect any such seeds, manures or agricultural implements.&rdquo; In sub-section (3) we have a delightful phrase used in defining the word &ldquo;inspector.&rdquo;&ldquo;Inspector&rdquo; means &ldquo;any person authorised in writing by the Minister or the Minister for Agriculture to exercise the powers conferred on any inspector by this section.&rdquo; There is not much in that in the way of development of intention. I want to limit the personnel of the inspectorate and to secure that the people to be appointed as inspectors will be persons who are ordinarily in the service of the State or else in the service of a local authority.  I presume that the Minister will have no difficulty in accepting that amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know why the Deputy raises this point.  He may have some special reason for raising it.  In every Bill brought before this House in which the duties of an inspector were dealt with, this was the phrase used.  In the Bills dealing with eggs, butter, fresh meat, and other products the same wording was used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no amendment to that definition.  I have an amendment to the word &ldquo;inspector&rdquo; but not in the definition section.  The authorisation may still be as it is in sub-section (3).  What I want to limit is the personnel.  The Minister has a multitude of inspectors on his hands at the moment and what I want to secure is that he will not appoint new people <Col N="1377" /> but will confer additional duties and powers on some of the people already associated with him.  I want to tie up the personnel of the inspectorate in the provision towards the end of page 3, or the amendment can be made in the definition section.  I do not care where it is made.  I am not debating the vague powers given.  What I am concentrating on are the individuals. The question might be brought to an end if the Minister would tell us whether it will be necessary to appoint anybody other than those already in the Civil Service&mdash;there are many civil servants engaged on different kinds of inspection under his own Ministry&mdash;or in the employment of a local authority.  I do not see how it will be necessary to employ anybody outside these groups.  If there is to be only £6,500 spent under this Act, there will not be an enormous amount of inspection to be done.  Why should not the people already employed have these additional duties and powers imposed on them?  That is the only point I am dealing with at the moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

If an existing inspector of the Department does the work, he will have to be replaced.  There is no point, so far as I can see, in the Deputy's amendment, because if we have to get a deputy for an inspector of the Department we shall have to make an appointment to the Civil Service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>My point is that when it is sought to employ new people the onus is on the people who are seeking to employ these people to show a case for it.  I asked the Minister to show such a case, but he has not done so.  He knows that it will be necessary to get such people.  Let us assume, according to what Deputy Moore said, that these people are precluded.  Does <Col N="1379" /> Deputy Moore believe that it is going to be necessary to employ people not ordinarily civil servants or in the service of the local authority to carry out this £6,500 job all over the country?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I have in mind with regard to this that one of the officials whom I know personally to be most interested in the idea of this Bill is frequently engaged by the Forestry Department to do inspections of land in connection with forestry work. Suppose that a temporary inspector is required for forestry purposes, as may be necessary in view of the more extensive programme proposed by the present Government, why should his services not be availed of in connection with this Act if he be suitable?  Why <Col N="1380" /> go to the expense of sending two inspectors to the same district if one inspector will do?  I do not say that such circumstances will arise, but I see no reason for tying the hands of the Department.</P>

Whether he can be spared from the work of the Department of Agriculture I cannot say at the moment, but I do not think he can. We may, therefore, have to employ a temporary inspector for three months or six months of the year, and I hold that if this amendment is carried we will be compelled to employ a man as a civil servant for only six months of the year.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 6 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has intimated that an inspector is likely to be appointed, or to be employed, for about six months of the year.  I would like to know from the Minister what kind of work the inspector is going to do.  The measure is intended to provide for the giving of allotments to persons in urban districts and it seems to me that you are likely to have these availed of in a large number of districts, if they are not availed of in all.  There will be about 80 centres and the persons who will be given these plots will be the unemployed in these areas.  These persons will require more technical guidance than administrative supervision. At any rate, if they require administrative supervision, they will <Col N="1383" /> require technical guidance as well.  I cannot conceive a scheme such as this being embarked upon without having some arrangement by which the county instructor of agriculture will have some responsibility or will be asked to visit the site of these plots, to consult with the persons who will be working these plots and to give them some elementary instructions or any instructions that may be necessary as to how to proceed.</P>
      <P>In the matter of the use of seeds or manures or any review of whether the plots are being used for the purpose for which they are being provided, the work could best be carried out by the county agricultural instructor or some of his assistants.  On the administrative side, the town clerk or the secretary of the town commissioners could do all the administrative supervision that is necessary.  The urban authority would have a certain amount of administrative work to do in providing these plots, dividing them and parcelling them out, but I think that any administrative supervision that is required could be carried out by the staff of the urban district council itself, and I should like to know what the inspector appointed under this Bill will have to do.  If he is to be employed for several weeks the expenditure on his salary, travelling expenses and subsistence allowance may well run into ten per cent. of what the total cost of the Bill will be.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The urban authorities will have certain duties in the administration of the Act, as under the Principal Act the urban authority looked after the taking over of the land.  Very often they got over a certain part of the difficulty by letting the entire amount of land to a society and the society, of course, under certain rules which were approved, divided that land amongst its members.  We have provided in the Estimate of £6,500 that was mentioned for instructors. We estimate that there will not be more than seven or eight areas which will be able to take up the scheme this year, because it is now rather late in the year.  It is unlikely that <Col N="1384" /> more than seven or eight will be able to take up the scheme and we think that about three instructors may be necessary for about 11 weeks.  These instructors will be able to take two or three centres each and will be employed only temporarily for the 11 weeks.  One inspector will be necessary to visit the different places and see that the instructors are looking after things properly and that the plots are being properly utilised. There has always been an inspector for these allotments, as the Deputy, who was Minister for Local Government, knows.  There has always been an inspector to go around to see that the plots are being properly kept. Where a plot is being neglected or has not been properly used, it is taken from the person who holds it and given to somebody else.  I think one inspector will be quite sufficient for a limited period.</P>

      <P>Under Section 4 of the Principal Act, when a local authority has failed to obtain land by agreement, they may acquire it compulsorily in like manner as lands are acquired under the Housing of the Working Classes Acts and the necessary public local inquiry will be held by an inspector of the Minister at which all interested persons have the right to appear.  If the inspector is satisfied as to the reasonableness of the scheme he makes a Provisional Order authorising the acquisition of the land.  Owners of land can appeal against the order within a period of five weeks from its service on them, and can lodge petitions against it either to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health or the Circuit Court.  That was the procedure until the Housing Act of 1931 was passed, and under that Act where no objection is raised a public inquiry is not necessary for the taking over of the land.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose amendment No. 1.  The sub-section says &ldquo;a school attendance committee, a vocational education committee, and a committee of agriculture.&rdquo;  The effect of bringing in these three bodies here is, that in a later section of the Bill those employed or operating under the auspices of these three committees, whatever their emoluments or commission, everything they get is subject to a certain cut.  I want to exempt those employed by the vocational education committee.  We have been told by the Minister that the whole Bill is going to effect a saving of £35,000.  We know, as we read through the Bill, that that money is not going to accrue either to the taxpayer or the ratepayer in any single respect.  Whatever is saved will scrupulously fall back into the fund out of which it was previously paid.  There is going to be no saving so far as the taxpayer is concerned. It seems to be an absurd thing, in order to allow a very small sum of money to fall back into a fund raised by local authorities, to upset a committee such as the vocational education committee and to disturb those employed under it.  I want to segregate this service particularly because it is the only service the inauguration <Col N="1391" /> of which was attended with a considerable amount of debate. There was what amounted to agreement, that the emoluments of the people coming into these services in this way were small.  It was indeed expressed as an excuse, for the point at which they are fixed, that they were more or less experimental, and even with that excuse it was admitted that the experiment was on the low side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Education who was speaking at the time did give a promise that mandatory salaries would be prescribed for the vocational education officers.  He took power to prescribe salaries.  In other words, it was apprehended that the salaries likely to be fixed would not be sufficient or adequate to the work to be performed, and with the consent of the House it was then proposed, and accepted, to give powers to the Minister afterwards to establish salaries which could not be interfered with. Since then these mandatory salaries have not been established.  So far from being established, and so far from the power given by the House being exercised, for that particular purpose, it is now proposed to take away something of what was since given.  Let us get a balance on all this.  This is not going to save the taxpayers at all.  There is no chance of saving the taxpayers or the ratepayers anything at all measurable. Take out all that is to be saved under the whole Bill and it has no force in relation either to the moneys that can be saved or the work that is being disturbed.  On the other hand, face up to these facts that we are dealing with people who have only recently been in the position I have described, and, add the further fact, that we are dealing with these in a group that got a promise of an upper grade. There is now a tendency downwards and you are certain to have an amount of discontent sown amongst those people.  It is going to spread naturally from those people.  The Vocational Education Act was supposed to be the beginning of a new system and the people who were to be appointed <Col N="1392" /> under it and who were to operate under it were supposed to be the inaugurators of a new scheme of things under the auspices of those vocational education committees in association with local authorities.  Instead of being allowed to do their work even under the restricted circumstances held out to them, they are going to be further restricted.  No real excuse has been given for it. Again I urge, as I did previously when the main Economies Bill, which has been a fiasco as far as saving is concerned, was introduced, that it is a grossly immoral thing to pick out people to have their salaries cut against whom the allegation cannot be made that they are overpaid either in relation to the experience or talents they have or to the work they do and to hack at their salaries simply because they are people in the second remove from the Government.  What makes them open to attack is not anything inherent either in the work they do or the importance of the posts they occupy, but simply that they are near the Government, and that is the sole reason for this choice.</P>
    <P>There has never been an argument put forward in the House with regard to these people or the other people in the public service whose salaries were cut that they were not doing the work for which they were paid; that the work was not of the importance which entitled them to the old-time sum, or that the work had become lessened in any degree.  None of these arguments was made.  It is simply that these people are near the Government when they are striking out blindly.  These were the first people on whom their fists lighted because they were in close proximity. They have now moved down another step from the people immediately under the State to the people under the local authorities.  There is no pretence made that there is economy in this.  The only excuse made is that they are determined to spread the hardship all round; that they have come in here and done a certain amount of injury to the country and everybody must share in it.  That is not an argument that should weigh <Col N="1393" /> with regard to people in a service inaugurated under the circumstances I have explained.  I am going to press definitely to a conclusion the amendment that vocational education committees should be excepted from this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to support the proposal to delete the officers of vocational education committees from the scope of the Bill.  There are many unwarranted things done under the Bill, but there seems to be the least possible excuse for bringing within the scope of the Bill the employees of vocational education committees.  As Deputy McGilligan pointed out, the imposition of a cut on the salaries of these officers will yield no revenue to the State.  It will yield no easement to the burden of taxation of the local ratepayer.  It seems to me that the proposal to include such officers is based either on a complete misconception of what is involved or merely a desire to impose a cut for the sake of imposing a cut.  The rating authority for the vocational education committee is the county council.  Even if this Bill is passed, and assuming that these cuts are imposed, the rating authority would still continue to levy a fixed rate for vocational education purposes and to that extent the local ratepayer gets no relief.  Assuming the vocational education committee cuts the salaries of its employees, then, under Section 20 of the Bill, the Minister will deduct no grant from any local education authority which complies with the terms of the Act.  So that you have got the position that when the local authority cuts the salaries of its employees the State saves nothing, because it continues the old grant, and the local ratepayer gets no relief because there is a statutory obligation to levy a fixed rate for the purpose of vocational education. There is no saving whatever to the local ratepayer.  There is no saving to the central State funds.  What merely happens is that the local authority has still the old sum available for vocational education purposes but is definitely prohibited by the Minister from continuing to pay the old salaries even though the local <Col N="1394" /> vocational education committee felt it was bound to pay the old salaries as a matter of equity between themselves and the employees.</P>
      <P>As Deputy McGilligan said, vocational education is relatively a new service here.  It ought to start under the happiest possible auspices and under the most congenial possible circumstances. It seems to me hardly likely that a Bill of this kind is going to promote that efficiency and contentment which are so necessary at the outset of a move of this kind in our national life.  Vocational education officers, as most people know, are notoriously underpaid.  The overwhelming majority of those officers are paid salaries which nobody could possibly justify either in relation to the work they perform or to their human or civic responsibilities. When the Vocational Education Act of 1930 was passing through the House they were promised that something would be done in the way of prescribing for local vocational education committees a mandatory scale of salaries which it was then felt would have to be forced on the local vocational education committees in order to get them to recognise the responsible work which the officers of the committees were performing.  That was in 1930. In the intervening four years nothing has been done to implement the promises then made or to take advantage of that particular section of the 1930 Act to endeavour to create a national scale of salaries for people employed by such local authorities. Instead of the State facing up to its responsibility under the Act and realising it ought to pay reasonable salaries to those employees, instead of some effort being made to put the remuneration on some kind of reasonable basis, it is now proposed to brush aside all that was said and implied when the Act was passing through the House, and instead of presenting them with a decent scale of salaries to present them with cuts which will only aggravate instead of improving their position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Vocational Education Act of 1930 certain employees of the old <Col N="1395" /> technical instruction committees were taken over by the new committees and a special section in that Act&mdash;I think Section 99&mdash;provided that those who were so transferred should hold their office on the same terms and conditions as formerly.  That seemed to be an implied promise by the State that there would be no reduction whatever in the remuneration of the officers transferred from one committee to an entirely new committee, functioning in a different way.  Now apparently under this Bill that particular section of the 1930 Act is to be torn up and cuts imposed, as I contend, in flagrant defiance of the definite guarantee given to them under Section 99 of the 1930 Act.  There is no case for including those officers.  I think all sections of the House, including the Minister's own Party, would very much prefer that he came to the House prescribing a reasonable rate of salaries for vocational education officers instead of asking them to cut salaries which are disgracefully low at present, and which I say are not calculated to make officers of vocational education committees either attentive to work or efficient in its performance.</P>

      <P>It is worth noting the different type of speech that has been made in the House here, such as the one which has been made by Deputy McGilligan on this question of salary cuts for teachers employed under vocational education bodies, and the type of speech that his colleagues in the Party have been making during the last few months all over the country.  There we are told that the country is fast being driven into bankruptcy, that the farmers are in a state bordering on destitution, that there is no money for anything in the country.  That is the type of speech to which we have been listening for a long time, and I have no doubt we will hear it again from many of the Deputy's colleagues, and may be from the Deputy himself when he is in other places.

Deputies over there know that is quite true, and are aware that they have done that in all parts of the country, north, south, cast and west.  Deputy McGilligan's colleagues have been cutting salaries to the extent of 25 per cent. in some cases.  There are some here who will say that a cut of 5 per cent. is not enough.  I know that the colleagues of the Deputy, if they were free to speak, would rather have a cut of 10 per cent. or 20 per cent.</P>

      <P>Colleagues of the Deputy all over the country have advocated huge cuts.  They have demanded cuts in the salaries of civil servants and public officials of all kinds.  I do not think any member of the Party can deny that.  I do not think that the opposition of Deputy McGilligan and his Party&mdash;I presume he speaks for the Party&mdash;to this proposed cut, is serious. In the case of officers of vocational education committees, if the proposed cut were eliminated it would place them in a position that I do not think, as public servants, they are entitled to be placed in, particularly when it is proposed to cut the salaries of all other servants of public authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan and Deputy Norton reminded us that these officers were paid on a lower scale some years ago and that when the Act of 1930 was being put through the House certain promises were made to those officers of improved salaries.  While the Minister has not availed of the authority to prescribe salaries, he has used his influence with the local authorities to have the salaries of these people raised to what he believed was a proper <Col N="1398" /> amount.  The suggestions made by him to these local authorities dealing with vocational education, to put the salaries of their officials on a basis that he considered reasonable, have been adopted by authorities all over the country, with three exceptions.  There are three local authorities that have refused, so far, to raise the salaries to the rate that the Minister considered would be commensurate with the duties performed by the officials.  In all other cases the salaries have been raised in accordance with the promise given by the then Minister in this House.  I think that disposes of the arguments of Deputy Norton and Deputy McGilligan.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Under a circular dated in April of last year the scales would appear to be:&mdash; Men, £130, rising by annual increments of £10 to £200; women, £120, rising by annual increments of £10 to £170, together with such cost of living bonus on the Civil Service scale in each case as may be approved from time to time by the Minister for Finance.  The circular points out that manual instructors will not be eligible for increments on the scale beyond £150 unless they have obtained a manual instructor's certificate. That, in general, shows an increase, in some cases a fairly considerable increase, on what were the <Col N="1399" /> salaries paid before this cirucular was issued to and adopted by the local authorities.  The improved scales have been adopted by 38 committees and there were three exceptions, namely, Kilkenny, Monaghan and Leitrim. That, I think, disposes very largely, if not altogether, of the case made as to the poor salary that was paid to these teachers previous to 1930.  It is true that the Minister has not prescribed but he has written to and circularised all these bodies and he has induced them to raise, and to raise in some cases very considerably, the salaries paid these officials to the level that he thought was within the capacity of the committees to pay and up to the standard of the work that they were doing for the public.</P>
      <P>It is not true to say that none of this money saved by this Bill will be saved to the local authorities.  The money will be credited to them.  The saving made will be credited to the next year's estimates and that money will be available for their work in the future.  There will be a certain saving, a saving which some people may say is not sufficient.  But this is the minimum scale and there will certainly be recoupment to the State, not of a very large amount but nevertheless there is economy and there is a saving, a saving both to the ratepayers and to the taxpayers.  While, as Deputy Norton says, the committees will have to raise the amount specified for education in the coming year, nevertheless this money saved in this way will be saved to them and it will be at their disposal for next year's work.</P>

      <P>The Minister has mentioned certain salaries for teachers under the vocational education committees. These salaries are below the scale with which this Bill deals.  I do not think there is any bigger blot on our whole system of building up the country than the scale of salaries paid to technical instructors and technical instructresses.  A number of affairs operated to make that so, but the fact that it is so, with all that comes later <Col N="1400" /> on from it, explains why our technical education is in the backward position in which it is.  The salaries that are dealt with in this Bill are the salaries paid to people who have the higher responsibilities under these local bodies, but they do bear a relation in the smallness of their size to the more disgraceful salaries that exist lower down.</P>
      <P>The Minister is, no doubt, sensitive with regard to the position in which the farmers find themselves.  We find a report in this morning's Press that for the payment of an outstanding sum of £25 in rates, a woman in South Tipperary had her 11 in-calf cows seized by the sheriff.  We can understand how sensitive the Minister is with regard to the position of the farmers.  But the condition of affairs which brings about a situation that makes the Minister sensitive with regard to that, also brings about a situation for him and the Executive Council in which they are asking for a complete revolution in our farming methods and a complete revolution in the work to be done by the instructors and instructresses under the agricultural committees.</P>
      <P>The instructors have a very big function to perform in the sphere of education.  The students leaving the secondary schools, who are going to carry on the farming industry, have very important functions.  Unless the machinery has been functioning, and unless those who are to direct the machinery for giving instruction in agricultural work under our agricultural committees have enthusiasm, the results that the Minister hopes for, and the results that we hope for, generally, for better agricultural education in the country are not going to be reached.  On the purely agricultural side alone, an effort is being made to increase our agricultural output and to increase the efficiency and the adaptability of our people.  But when they have gained their education, fitting them for engaging in industry, this is a step that will not lead to increased enthusiasm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We look to the teachers under the vocational education committees to supply not only instruction, but to be prepared to work to influence the <Col N="1401" /> minds of our growing people for engaging in industry.  We look to them also for enthusiasm, and if we do not get that enthusiasm we are not going to get the results that are necessary in our vocational education.  Anyone who has had experience, say, of technical schools in the City of Dublin, whether in Kevin Street or Bolton Street, and who has seen the pupils coming from ordinary schools to take up work there under the type of teachers which Dublin has been able to provide, realises what the new outlook on secondary education is and what the students are going to get from being brought into touch with the type of teacher that exists in the City of Dublin.</P>
    <P>The Vocational Education Act, passed some years ago, was intended to take some of the anaemia out of the educational system in the country.  I do not know that it has achieved much in making our technical education schemes bear more on industry than they did in the past, but, nevertheless, since that Act was passed, a number of young teachers have been drafted into the scheme.  A number of executive officers have been brought in.  A new ideal has been set before them and new hopes have been built that not alone will they get assistance to carry on their work, but that they will have an opportunity of serving the State in preparing boys and girls leaving schools for a more suitable and more effective entry into the technical life of the country than did the technical schools in the past.  Here, again, the enthusiasm and efficiency of the particular scheme that is dealing with technical education is going to be impaired.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education wanted certain clauses referred to himself to secure that adequate salaries would be paid to the teachers working under these bodies.  The other day, in Kilkenny, he declared that it was the duty of the State to provide provision so that young men with patriotic fervour and patriotic aspirations would have an opportunity of working for these things.  And within the last week we passed a Vote here which, even for the few remaining months of this financial year, is double the amount of <Col N="1402" /> the saving that would be made under this Bill.  I submit, when you take into consideration the statements made on behalf of the Executive Council with regard to the new hope, the new activity and the new developments that they say are taking place, and that they hope will take place more and more widespread throughout the country in both industry and agriculture, one cannot understand this Bill.  When we hear that they are to have an enthused machinery that must be utilised to bring about these things, and when we compare what they are doing on a more futile and destructive side, we have a measure not alone of their competence but of their wisdom. I am of opinion that the proposals in the measure, as far as vocational committees and committees of agriculture are concerned, are going to undermine the enthusiasm and efficiency of a body of men and women throughout the country whose services and whose enthusiasm are so urgently needed at the present time.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Local Government and Public Health commented upon the speeches that were made through the country, pointing out that the country is in decay and despair, and he opines that it will be very hard to reconcile the speeches made here to-night with those phrases.  People who really believe that this country is in decay, and have grounds for that belief, will not take much solace from £35,000 being saved on this measure, when they think of the extra expense that has been brought on the State, say, in the last week, by the present Minister.  If the Minister wishes to create any confusion or embarrassment about speeches in this House and speeches outside it, will he let us know how he will feel when he next addresses the people and tells them that everything is rosy?  That was his phrase&mdash;everything is rosy.  I wonder if he has ever read Dickens, and found the Marchioness asking the person who used that phrase to pass the rosy.  He ought to pass the rosy prospects on to other people.  How are the people being benefited by £37,000 being saved through cuts this <Col N="1403" /> week, and maybe a quarter of a million pounds paid out next week?  Go and tell them that £1,000 is going to be saved on the cutting of the vocational education officers' and teachers' salaries this week, and that to-morrow we will establish a new publicity department for the Government at the cost of a couple of thousand pounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Think of the speeches that will be made.  Everything is perfect in the country according to the Minister. Never was such an effort made to get the country saved.  The battle has been won according to the three times statement of the Minister.  What he says three times is presumably true. The country is being saved.  We are well out of the old decay.  There are the 300 factories, which have not yet been discovered, the vast number of people who are crowding into employment, the money that must be in circulation through the country by reason of the vast increase in the industrial development of the country.  How does all that square with this attack on the salaries of people who are not expressed in this House as being overpaid? What about the other economies that were promised without touching anybody's salary?  Has the Minister forgotten the advertisements&mdash;the million pounds that were to be saved, the close calculation that had been made upon the examination of the current estimates of about three years ago?  The Minister was one of the people who was satisfied that a saving of £1,000,000 could be achieved without cutting salaries.  Does he remember the old speech I have often referred to which Deputy Cooney made&mdash;appropriately, as I always said&mdash;at Grangegorman, where he talked about the administrative programme including a saving of £2,000,000 on the Army? Deputy Cooney must have been temporarily located there in the last fortnight, when he allowed, not a saving of £2,000,000, but an increase of a quarter of a million pounds.  He must have known that his Minister was coming in with an attempt to cut the salaries of local authorities and save this miserable £35,000.  Deputy <Col N="1404" /> Cooney, in that same speech, promised a saving of half a million pounds on the Civic Guards, instead of which we have got the Broy Harriers.  Those are some of the things which the Minister might reconcile when next, if at all, he attempts to address the people of the country.</P>
    <P>This measure effects no economy.  It is a miserable attempt at economy.  It does not show that there is any seriousness in the talk of economy.  It is not based upon any principle.  It does not proceed upon the grounds that the people attacked here are being overpaid, that their work is unnecessary, or that the services they render to the country do not, or would not ordinarily, warrant their getting the moneys that are being paid to them. None of those arguments on the merits is put up.  The Minister simply comes in here and says &ldquo;I happen to have a body of people under my thumb, the civil servants.  I am going to take something off their salaries; when I have finished with those I am coming to the second group.&rdquo;  His best argument here to-night was that it would be an impossible position to leave those people uncut when everybody else in the local services is going to be cut.  He has not yet said why those people are going to be cut&mdash;just that they are; just because of the Minister's inefficiency, just because the Minister and his Government blundered into an economic war.  It has been declared here recently and shown conclusively that we are actually having more extracted from us in taxes on our produce than what we have withheld. Because more money is being paid to the British through the economic war the local authority services have got to be cut!  Who is held out for cutting under this particular amendment? First of all, those people&mdash;let me repeat&mdash;were promised that their salaries would be fixed on a particular scale and that that scale would be made mandatory on the local authority by act of the Minister for Education, or of the Minister for Finance.  That has not be done.  That promise has not been carried out.  The Minister tells us to-day that some time recently <Col N="1405" /> the Minister for Education wrote to the vocational education committees and used some influence to get certain things done.  When was that letter written?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>In April last. Speaking in this House in regard to the whole measure in June of last year the Minister did not say he wrote that letter then.  Imagine the views that the vocational education committees must have taken of the Minister who came to them and said: &ldquo;Put up the salaries or give some boost to the salaries of those people,&rdquo; when they knew that he had previously put in a &ldquo;Cuts&rdquo; Bill, and only went to the local authorities because he was afraid to face the Division Lobby on it.  The salaries have not been raised.  They certainly have not been raised in fulfilment of the promise as to mandatory salaries that was given.  That is the first thing.  We have said there is no saving to the taxpayer.  That has not been argued.  There is not a shilling of saving to the taxpayer.  I have argued, and still contend, that there is no saving to the ratepayer.  The Minister says there is&mdash;that next year they will be eased in their Budget. How is that?  I had understood that the rate that had to be levied for vocational education was fixed&mdash;that it was compulsory.  What is the saving, therefore?  They are going to save money, and in these times when money is required to be spread over the people of the community for their spending, what is going to happen is that the same compulsory rate will be levied, but instead of being paid out as previously to those people in salaries it is going to be saved.  We said this was no saving to the ratepayer. That is correct.  Again, taking the position as I have described it, that this mandatory arrangement was not made, what is the situation with regard to those vocational teachers at the moment?  They claim&mdash;the claim may be somewhat exaggerated but it is very close to the truth&mdash;that they are so lowly paid that 90 per cent. will be below the scale at which the cuts begin.  I do not think it is so high, but <Col N="1406" /> certainly there will not be very many of them.  In the main, as a body, they are below the attacked scales, so it is only a certain percentage of them that is going to be attacked.  There is another thing which particularises those people from anybody else.  First of all, they did not get their salaries raised as they were promised; they are generally on a low scale; because of the fall arising from the cut in the bonus they have lost in the last number of years, and, unlike other people, they have no ordinary increments to set off against that.</P>

At any rate, there is the position: these people have for some time past been suffering as the bonus fell, and up to recently had no incremental scale; they are at a point where only a small number emerge above the accepted point&mdash;they have not got the salaries that were promised to them; there is going to be no saving to the taxpayer, and I yet can see no saving to the ratepayer; yet those people are being held up here for a certain amount of cutting.  I do not bring out any weakness in my own argument when I say that this cut, if it is operated at all, will hit only a small percentage of the vocational education teachers.  I think it is necessary to stress that point because it shows just how little the saving will be, anyway, even though it is only money saved to lie by idly. There is nothing saved, but the loss on the individual, and particularly the individual who has to work on a very low salary and, possibly, has made commitments in respect of it, is going to be pretty severe.  Again, I stress that no reason has been given for it. There is not one of these individuals can sit back and think, after the arguments here to-night, that a good case was made for his cut.  &ldquo;It was proved that I was getting too much; it was proved that my salary was incommensurate in comparison with the work I do; it was proved that the work I do <Col N="1407" /> is not required in the present circumstances of the country&rdquo;&mdash;not one of them can say that that was argued here.  All he can say is: &ldquo;For some reason unknown to me and for some reason which the Minister may know but was not fit to speak of, my salary has been cut.&rdquo;  The saving, as I say, if there be a saving at all, in the sense of money idly put by, is going to be very small indeed, while the loss to the individual will be very big.</P>
      <P>We are told that we have a great industrial revival on, and certainly, at the beginning, it was intended that those who got any sort of instruction through the medium of these vocational education teachers were to have their minds directed towards industry and to have whatever talents they had in their heads and in their fingers directed towards industrial production.  We are in a great industrial movement.  Sometimes we are told we are, but, at any rate, it is the argument, it is the pretence, that we are, and anything that is done concretely shows that the Ministry do not believe one bit in all they so often say about industrial revival.  These are the people on whom it was expected we would lean for the better provisioning of the future workers of the country in industrial matters&mdash;and they are being cut now. It is a good recommendation as to the sincerity of the Ministry's promises in regard to education and in regard to industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one last matter.  Some day we will get a proper equation of the moneys that were, in fact, saved on the first cuts Bill and the moneys the State lost on the first cuts Bill through the people who went into retirement because of the material change made in their conditions, and some day we will get added to that, on the debit side, not merely the moneys the State has lost through having to pay earlier what might have to be paid&mdash;moneys to people who have gone into retirement &mdash;but some calculation as to the loss the State has suffered by reason of good men leaving the service earlier than they might have been made to leave.  I doubt if anybody, even accounting the moneys alone, could say <Col N="1408" /> that last year there was any saving to the State, mean and mangy as the saving might be.  There were transferred officers with rights.  There was an attempt made, when the measure was going through the House, to get these rights taken away from the people who had them, and that was beaten. There was an attempt then made by administrative action to prevent these officers from getting their rights, and they had to go to the courts for their rights, but they did get them.  There are transferred officers here, too, and it will not take many people to assert the rights which they have as transferred officers to wipe out the odd thousand that will be saved by this absurdity, and the Ministry will have again exposed themselves to the very natural comment that they tried to do an illegal thing as well as an inequitable thing in trying to get cuts forced through without any excuse on the merits being given in the House.  I think it is well that we have segregated the vocational education teachers and officers because it shows up, as under a magnifying glass, the meanness and the futility of all this nonsense.  I should like to bring the Minister back to what he started with&mdash;if he thinks that this will appear before the public either as a proper answer in the way of economy to those who believe that the country requires economy or that it can be argued as a just thing before those who hold that the country is prosperous, he is making a mistake in both cases, but it is good to have him say what he did say.</P>

      <P>I am opposed to these cuts.  I am opposed to them as I am against the policy of the Government. The Minister sneers at farmers.  He sneered at the position of the farmers. He can well afford to sneer when he and his wife draw £2,000 from this State, and draw it free of income tax.  That is the type of politician we have in this country at the present time who sneers at unfortunate people who are on the verge of bankruptcy.  I have before me here the case of an unfortunate man who sent 12 turkeys and 34 geese to London at Christmas.  They realised a sum of £20 Is., from which £1 10s. 10d. was deducted for expenses and £9 15s. 9d. <Col N="1409" /> for tax.  There is another constituent of mine who, last October, sent 24 cattle from Kanturk.  They realised £400 10s., from which was deducted a sum of £144, together with £56 17s. 9d. expenses, with the result that he received £199 12s. 3d., and the Minister is going to compensate him by giving him 1d. in every £100.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, in the course of an attempt to justify this cut, referred to speeches made throughout the country by the Party opposite indicating the position of the farmer, and while that may have suited the Minister's particular line of argument, the real position is that it is very doubtful if he could produce for this House a single request from a vocational education committee to be permitted to cut the wages or salaries of its employees.  If there is a single case of that kind from a local vocational education committee, I should be glad to hear it and to know the local authority concerned and to be able to examine the mentality of those who comprise it, but I venture to say that the Minister has had no demand whatever from vocational education committees to be permitted to cut the salaries paid to their employees.  That is the real test&mdash;that these vocational education committees, responsible to local public opinion, are not in favour of cutting the remuneration of their employees.  I think it has been proved perfectly clearly that there is no saving to the Central Fund; there is no saving to the rating authority, and there is no saving to the local vocational education committee by cutting the salaries of the employees of these committees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has said that if the money for one year proves more than is necessary there will be a certain credit next year.  I should like the Minister to tell the House in what way that credit is going to be brought to account and in what way it is going to save the local taxpayer in the subsequent year, because, presumably, the same levy will continue and, if the Bill should be continued, will yield an accumulating surplus.  The local vocational education committee, presumably, will not need, if the <Col N="1410" /> salaries of its employees are cut, all it formerly needed, and, as Deputy McGilligan pointed out, it will then be put in the privileged position of saving money but saving it at the expense of the underpaid employees of the committee.  I think the Minister when he indicated that the Department informed the vocational education committees that they were willing to sanction a certain scale of salaries might have been a little more generous in the scale of salaries prescribed. Many of the chief executive officers of these committees are men of high educational qualifications.  Many of them have legal qualifications, many have engineering qualifications; and to prescribe a basic scale of salary of £140, rising by annual increments of £10 to £200, to people who possess the educational qualifications that many of these people have is not placing any premium whatever on intelligence or ability or adaptability.</P>
    <P>The scale of salaries set out in the Minister's circular is one which is in no way over-generous.  In my opinion it still perpetuates the gross underpayment from which this section of the community suffers.  If the Minister thought that a fair scale of salaries in April of last year I cannot for the life of me see what has happened since to justify him in cutting it in February of this year.  Nothing has happened in the meantime to justify the cut.  It is a very poor argument for the Minister to say: &ldquo;It is because these officers are in the group and I cannot conveniently segregate them, I must impose a reduction on them.&rdquo; That is a very poor line of defence for the Minister to take in his attempt to justify these cuts.  I suggest to the Minister that this Bill could well be withdrawn.  It is really a jest to say that this country urgently needs the £35,000 which it is estimated will be saved under the Bill.  That sum means absolutely nothing to the country.  If our problems are to be measured economically, financially or industrially, by a saving in one year of £35,000, then we have no problem of any kind to face up to, and I suggest this Bill ought to be withdrawn.  If the Minister persists in going ahead <Col N="1411" /> with it, then I think the employees of the vocational education committees ought to be excluded.  Their inclusion cannot possibly be justified simply because there is alleged to be a clamour in the country for cutting down the salaries of the employees of local authorities.</P>
    <P>I can tell the Minister that you have a dangerous kind of democracy in this country if it is the kind of democracy that takes the form of advocating the slashing of wages as a means of getting rid of all our problems.  It is very unstable and sandy and, in my opinion, ought not to be pandered to.  Rather our endeavour should be to build up a decent standard of life for our people.  We ought to say in connection with these employees of vocational education committees: It is not that we are too poor to be able to pay a decent rate of wages, but that we are too poor in the matter of vocational education to dream of cutting their salaries because inevitably the effect of such cuts will mean for them a lessening of enthusiasm and the benefits of that enthusiasm in the case of those who are pupils of vocational education committees.</P>

      <P>I do not think there is anything more that I can say in connection with this amendment.  I still maintain that there will be a saving to the ratepayer and to the taxpayer. In the majority of cases all over the country the minimum rate fixed for vocational education committees is exceeded so that the saving effected will enable counties, in some cases, perhaps, to approximate nearer to the minimum rate fixed.  At any rate, there is not much point in Deputy Norton's case.  The Deputy talks of cutting small salaries.  No salary below a maximum of £300 will be cut. Therefore, the people with small salaries that he talked about will not be cut.  The point he made about cutting what he called the miserable salaries of these teachers, therefore, falls to the ground.  The same remark applies to the point made by Deputy McGilligan.  The Deputy may have been exaggerating, but I think he took the figure of 90 per cent. and said that <Col N="1412" /> number of teachers would come under the authority of the vocational education committees.  I do not know what the exact figure is, but I should say that the vast bulk of these teachers will not be cut because their salaries do not come up to the figure of £300.</P>

      <P>I do not know about £210.  £300 is the figure that is being fixed, and so far as I know the majority of these teachers will not come near that.  I did not sneer at the farmers. I believe that the farmers in many parts of the country are having a hard time.  I did not sneer at the Deputy or at anybody in this House.  I simply reminded the Deputy and the House of a certain type of speech that is being made, one that he must have read in the newspapers as well as I did, about the condition of the farming community. I did not say whether it was correct or not.  I did say that Farmer-Deputies sitting in all parts of the House have made speeches here demanding and clamouring for economies. They have made in this House that particular type of speech to which I have referred; clamouring that those high salaries, as they called them, should be cut down.  When they spoke of high salaries I do not know what figure they had in mind, whether it was £300, £400 or £500, but their demand has been that these salaries should be cut when the farmer's price for his produce has fallen so considerably. That demand has been made insistently from all sides of the House.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister tell us whether, in dealing with the officials of vocational education committees, we are not dealing with a class that is going to be hit twice?  Under Section 11 of the Public Services (Temporary Economies) Act, 1933, provision is made by which the Minister can withdraw portion of the grants payable to certain local bodies, having regard to deductions from salaries made under Part II of the Act and the other circumstances of the case, the deductions being from salaries earned during the current financial year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 31st January, this year, I asked the Minister for Finance whether any deductions had been made from any grant under Section 11 of the Public Services (Temporary Economies) Act from any local authority or from any committee or other body, the members of which are appointed wholly or partially by a local authority.  The Minister in his reply said: &ldquo;It is not proposed to make a deduction from any such grant.  Section 11 of the Public Services (Temporary Economies) Act will be applied only to the grants payable to vocational education committees and to county committees of agriculture. No deduction has yet been made under Section 11 from any grant payable to a vocational education committee or a county committee of agriculture. It is intended, however, to make a deduction from the grant payable to each such committee in the current financial year.&rdquo;  I then asked the Minister whether &ldquo;reductions will be made in the amount of salaries paid to the employees or some of the employees of these bodies in respect of <Col N="1414" /> the current financial year,&rdquo; and the Minister, in reply, said that he was not in a position to say that.  In view of the fact that the Act of 1933, giving the Minister power to withdraw certain grants from these committees, contained a provision to the effect that the amount so withdrawn would bear some relation to the deduction made in the salaries of some of the officers of these committees, earned and payable during the financial year, 1933.  I would like the Minister to tell us whether, in fact, the employees or any employee of vocational education committees are going to have deductions made in their salaries under the 1933 Act and also under this Act for the year 1934.  If that is so will he say what is the reason for it?  If it is not so, why does the Minister for Finance propose to withhold from some of those committees grants normally payable to them, and withhold them under Section 11?  I submit he is not entitled to withhold them.</P>

      <P>I am in favour of this amendment.  As a member of a vocational education committee for a number of years, I am perfectly satisfied&mdash;I can speak, of course, only for urban vocational committees, because my experience is limited to those&mdash;that in a great many cases these men are not sufficiently paid for the work they do.  I should like to hear from the Minister how it is proposed that a saving will be effected on behalf of the local authorities.  The Minister is, I am sure, aware that under the recently passed Vocational Education Act the minimum rate for an urban area, like the town of Wexford, is 3d. in the £.  That increases by ½d. in the £ each year until it reaches the maximum of 6d. in the £. That is settled by statute.  I wonder how any relief will be given to the ratepayers if that provision of the statute is insisted upon.  I cannot see how the ratepayers are going to benefit if this provision is insisted upon.</P>

      <P>I am surprised at some of the statements made here to-night. I do not consider that any official with £300 a year is badly off.  I understand <Col N="1415" /> that this Bill does not apply to officials receiving less than £300 a year.  If Deputy O'Leary considers that it is a reflection on his character to say that he was in favour of cuts in wages or salaries, I wonder where Deputy MacDermot, Deputy Dillon and Deputy Curran come in, as they voted for the Second Reading of a similar Bill.  Do they change their policy as they change their seats?  Some of these Deputies were annoyed with me because I did not move for a harsher cut than was proposed previously.  I am sure that Deputy MacDermot will remember that.  He was very much annoyed because I did not move an amendment which I had down, which proposed to impose a harsher cut than was proposed in the Bill.  Since he changed his seat he is, I suppose, prepared to vote against these cuts. Instead of Deputy MacDermot and his Party swallowing the Cumann na nGaedheal Party, I think that the Cumann na nGaedheal Party have swallowed them.  The proof will be the way in which they vote on this proposal.</P>
      <P>For the past seven or eight years there has been a demand in the country for a cut in salaries&mdash;a far larger cut than is proposed in this Bill. Local bodies, which are more in touch with people in the country than the Dáil, are crying out for cuts in salaries. I realise that the farmers' representatives on local bodies are far more inclined to cut the wages of a labourer than the salary of an official because, in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred, the official is some relative of their own.  At the same time I should like to hear Deputy MacDermot justify his change of front within a few short months.  If he is going to vote for this amendment, I should like to hear his reasons for the change.  There has been a change of front or, as my friend here suggests, a change of shirt, on this question.  I should like to hear from Deputy MacDermot, Deputy Dillon and Deputy Curran some reason for their change of front, or shirt.</P>

      <P>The Minister says that he has explained this matter and that Deputy Minch was not here. <Col N="1417" /> I was not here either, and I ask the Minister to be a little more detailed in his explanation.  What number of county councils will benefit by the reduction, and to what extent will they benefit?  The Minister should not content himself merely with a statement that in certain cases the rate struck is higher than the compulsory rate.  He should tell the House in how many cases that is so.  Is it the general rule that a higher rate than the compulsory rate is struck?  What will the saving be in those cases?  In the case of those county councils and local bodies that do not strike a higher rate than the compulsory rate, perhaps the Minister will attempt to answer Deputy Minch's question.  Where there is a higher rate struck than the compulsory rate the benefit of the saving must, I presume, remain with the vocational education committee. That being so, why is the money not to be spent in the way in which it ought to be spent&mdash;in securing that there will be proper teaching?  Does the Minister think that it will conduce to proper teaching to cut salaries merely for the sake of cutting?  It is quite obvious that a cut is now being made not on account of the money that will be saved, but because, having damaged certain portions of the community, you are determined to damage others.  If there is not a higher rate levied than the compulsory rate, there will not be a saving to the local authorities.  Am I correct in that? The Minister does not answer, but I think I am correct.  Where there are savings why cannot they go to the committee to be utilised in the best way&mdash;in securing that teachers are satisfied and that they are properly paid?  Now, this is a branch of the teaching profession in regard to which, I think, the whole House recognised, when the Technical Instruction Bill or the Vocational Education Bill was going through this House, that even if teachers as a whole are not well paid here, this branch was not even so well paid.  Not merely was that recognised, but again and again the case was put forward&mdash;and I must say that I was sympathetic towards it&mdash;that it would <Col N="1418" /> be a good thing for education if this particular type of education was held in higher esteem in this country than it is.  I suggest that the Minister is doing no good to the county councils, to the ratepayers, or to anybody, merely by sticking to the mere mathematical logic to which his Party or the Government seem to be so wedded.</P>
      <P>Deputy Corry refers to the fact that there have been demands for this for a number of years.  There have also been demands for a number of other things for a number of years, demands to which the Party opposite and the Government are particularly deaf. There have been demands for a reduction in taxation, and I suggest that they have been much stronger and much more insistent demands than in this particular case.  There have been demands for a market.  There have been demands for all these things, and yet to these things the Party opposite and the Government shut their ears; but they are quite satisfied if they can inflict this damage on a certain number of teachers.  There is and has been a great deal of talk from the Government side about about our new industries, and complaints have been made that the proper personnel are not there; and, as their little contribution to doing that, the Government cuts the salaries of precisely those technical teachers who might be able, if they got some assistance and encouragement, at least, to prepare the proper personnel of these new industries.  In reality, the Ministry do not really believe in those new industries. Probably they do not believe that, by cutting in this way the salaries of the technical teachers, they are doing any damage to these industries in which they do not believe and which are mere moonshine so far as the majority are concerned.  I trust that the Minister will give us more information than he has given, and will not ask the House to be satisfied with the mere statement that there are cases in which a higher rate is struck than the compulsory rate, and that he will indicate the number of such cases and to what extent that happens to be so.</P>

      <P>I do not want to appear discourteous by not replying to the challenge of Deputy Corry and, therefore, I rise, for a few moments, to do so.  I think, however, that Deputy Corry is showing considerable audacity in accusing anybody else of inconsistency in connection with this particular matter.  I am sorry that I have not got before me the reports of the speeches he made in connection with the Public Services (Temporary Economies) Bill, but I do remember that he was extremely eloquent on the subject of the burdens that were pressing on the farmers of this country, and upon the necessity for lightening those burdens.  I cannot help asking myself the question how a zealot for economy like Deputy Corry, and a man who is as anxious as he is to lighten the burden on the farmers, can be supporting the Government policy of spending an entirely unnecessary quarter of a million a year on a new Defence Force.  In my opinion, the recent acts of the Government, in regard to the Defence Force for instance, and also through expenditure on creating a new Special Civic Guard force&mdash;</P>

Deputy Corry assumed that I was going to vote in favour of the various amendments to this Bill.  He was rather rash in that assumption.

      <P>It seems to me that the allegation that the new industries claimed by the Government are largely <Col N="1420" /> moonshine is, in itself, ample justification for the Bill.  The same Deputies who allege that the new industries are moonshine allege that farming is in a bad state.

Surely it would be more consistent for the Opposition to claim that the Minister is not going far enough in his demands for economy?  How can the Party opposite make these allegations about the state of industry and agriculture&mdash;particularly about the state of agriculture&mdash;and at the same time claim that a man earning over £300 a year in a provincial town cannot afford a reduction in his salary?  Of course, I do not believe that the point now being emphasised&mdash;that it does not mean any saving to the ratepayer&mdash;is sincere.  I do not think there is a county council in Ireland that is not contributing, for instance, to the erection of new buildings for vocational education, and surely the saving that will be effected through this Bill will help, to some extent, to relieve the ratepayers with regard to the contributions to which they have committed themselves in respect of new buildings.</P>

      <P>The Minister rather suggested that on this side of the House there was a general demand for the cutting of salaries.  I have no doubt that there was such an expression of views in various parts of the country, mainly confined to the supporters of Fianna Fáil, for the cutting of salaries. I have never been an exponent of that type of economy.  This Bill clears the air as far as the measure of saving that will result by any attempt to cut even <Col N="1422" /> fairly average salaries.  The ordinary person, I dare say, believes that the cutting of official salaries should amount to a very large sum.  I have no doubt that the Minister very carefully considered the Bill and brought every class that he could under its provisions, but, lo and behold, the saving for the nation is mentioned as £35,000.  As Deputy Mulcahy pointed out, coincident with this Bill the Minister has brought in other Bills which will place ten times that amount of expense on the community.  I am sorry Deputy Moore has left the House, because I wanted to refer to something he said. A great deal has been said about vocational education and other committees, but I should like to say a few words about the committees of agriculture.</P>

      <P>Deputy Moore suggested, in regard to another proposed appointment, that possibly some of the agricultural instructors in the employment of the State could be used for the work that was referred to, instead of having to appoint new men.  I suggest that if there is one class of officials whose salaries should not be cut it is the agricultural instructors and men in kindred occupations, because, as far as we know the policy of this Government, it is not going to relieve these officials but rather tends to increase their duties.  If all the experiments and new legislation that this Government is putting into operation continue I can see the time coming when the services of agricultural instructors will not be available, because they will be engaged teaching people how to grow beet, how to convert calves into cash, how to get rid of surplus dairy cows, and how to make wheat millable.  Deputy Moore spoke about &ldquo;moonshine.&rdquo;  The instructors might have to have an investigation into the making of &ldquo;moonshine&rdquo; out of some barley.</P>

      <P>I predict that there is more likelihood of that, because certain people have been endeavouring to manufacture &ldquo;moonshine&rdquo; for many years.  Agricultural instructors, as a class, are not very well paid.  As their duties will now be greatly increased, <Col N="1424" /> this is not a time to include them under the provisions of this Bill.  I will not argue on behalf of the vocational education officials.  I agree with what has been said on their behalf by previous speakers, but I am not as well acquainted with their duties.  I appeal to have men engaged in agricultural instruction excluded from this Bill, because it is almost certain that their work will be increased fivefold by the legislation of this Government.</P>

      <P>It is an interesting confession to have it on this Bill that we have to pull up in our expenditure, notwithstanding all the signs of prosperity that we heard of.  It is interesting also to learn that the instructors under the committees of agriculture could not be used for other jobs. Speaking with nine years' experience, and as a chairman of a committee of agriculture, I know that in the last year we failed, even in County Dublin, to get people to take up premiums for bulls, boars, etc., to meet the requirements of the county because the game does not pay.  I do not share the views of the last Deputy, who spoke about utilising the officials of these committees. The Minister should have looked at the matter squarely and shut down the committees of agriculture. He would then have effected a real saving, because when agriculture is dead&mdash;as far as being profitable&mdash;I do not see much use in paying salaries to instructors in agriculture.</P>
      <P>I do not see what use there is in carrying out the various experiments which the committees have been carrying out when, whether they are successful or not, they will not pay.  The Minister thinks that by taking a bit off salaries it will effect economy.  If there is one thing that the Minister and his colleagues have preached for the last two years it is the policy of self-sufficiency, whatever that means. Does he not realise that a policy of self-sufficiency means to be self-contained?</P>

The carrot that is held <Col N="1425" /> up before the country people is: &ldquo;The farmer is in the trenches, therefore the other fellow must get into the trenches.&rdquo;  But they have not the courage to put him in step with the farmer who has lost his entire income. Why, if you are going to put all in step, do you not face the thing boldly and make a reduction commensurate with the reduction that the agricultural community have had to suffer in their incomes, as a result of your insane policy?  I do not say that I would even vote for a proposal of that kind but it would have this merit&mdash;it would be honest.  This thing is not honest.  I am sorry that our two-gun friend, the Minister for Finance, is not here.  I wanted to tell him that the policy which I have always preached and that the farmer should be strongest in favour of, is high wages and if the export market is gone from the farmer and we thank God it has gone from him, according to the new economy opposite, well then if ever there was a need for high wages and salaries in this country, it is now. Otherwise you are going to cut the bottom out of the farmer's market.  To take off a small percentage from people with over £300 a year is an insult to the intelligence of people who have had 75 per cent. taken from them.</P>
      <P>We had Deputy Moore getting up and talking about the unreality of this debate.

      <P>I am afraid I will not. It is one of the most deadly sins I have ever committed.  This Bill is pure eye-wash. It is pure eye-wash to say that if you take a small percentage reduction off the salaries of the secretary of a county committee of agriculture you are going to help anybody.  There are some secretaries and instructors of committees of agriculture who are getting £500 or £600 a year.  I take it it was considered that they were worth that.  I see a Deputy opposite taking a note of that figure.  I suppose he is going to use that and ask me to name the farmer who has that income.  I know that no farmer in Ireland has that or even half of it, thanks to the Government over there, but are we going to put the farmer right by putting other people wrong?  There is one way out but you will not adopt that course.  Let it be clearly understood that we are not opposed to real economy but you are never going to economise by lowering the standard of living.  You are never going to help the market by taking money out of that market and if the agricultural economy practised by the Government in power for the last two years is going to be the national economy of the future, then the purchasing power for agricultural produce in this country will depend upon the standard of wages and the standard of salaries here.  That should be quite plain even though there are only a few representatives of the Government opposite and even though most of them appear not to have had enough sleep last night.</P>

      <P>There is another side to this, that we should not reduce the salaries of those engaged in technical teaching.  Agricultural teaching is technical teaching, for not only do the instructors conduct experiments in agriculture round the country, but they hold agricultural classes as well throughout the winter months.  Even though we could do without them for the present, we shall not always be under the present regime, and it would be false economy to impair their efficiency even though there is no outlet for agricultural produce just now. It would also be only proper to honour the contract that was made with the instructors and to retain them at the salaries which the county committees contracted to give them.  They were told that the emoluments of their office would not be interfered with except for reasons of inefficiency.  That is going to be done now under this section of the Bill.  As far as I am concerned, I am going to oppose it for two reasons. Firstly, I am against cutting salaries or wages.  Secondly, the proposal is dishonest, because if we all had our minds made up that every citizen in the country should bear an equal share in this fight, then a proposal should be put before the House, and it should be proved mathematically that that proposal was going to impose an equal burden on all.  I would be glad to hear anybody from the Government Benches proving that a little slice from a £300 or £400 a year salary is commensurate with what has been taken off agriculture through the Government policy in this country.  There is no comparison between the proposed cut and the cuts imposed upon the agricultural community.  Will they go down to the labourers in the towns and tell them what they are doing?  Deputy Kelly's friends, employees of the Dublin Corporation, are getting £2 19/- a week.  That is not too much.  I would resent a cut in the wages of the Corporation workers.  Do Deputies opposite want to reduce these men's wages to the level of the farm labourers &mdash;15/- a week?  If there is to be equal burden, let it be an equal burden, but <Col N="1428" /> this proposal does not suggest an equal burden.  This proposed cutting of salaries is merely eye-wash.  It proposes to enable certain people to go to the cross-roads and say, &ldquo;We propose cutting the big salaries in Dublin.&rdquo; But, again, I ask, will they propose a cut commensurate with the cut the agricultural community has suffered? If they did that it would put a different complexion on the matter.  But they will not do that because their proposal is dishonest and will not stand examination.</P>

      <P>I agree absolutely with Deputy Moore that there is something very unreal about this debate.  I go further and say there is something farcical about the whole debate when one considers the times we are living in.  We are living in circumstances when the bottom has fallen out of the greatest market the country has ever had, and when the roofs are being blown up over the heads of the people in the country.  This Parliament has nothing better to do in such circumstances than to discuss for three hours how best to victimise 50 or 60 little individuals in the country in order, mar eadh, to assist the agricultural interest in the country and to assist the finances of the county councils and the local boards.  Is there any genuine necessity for these proposals?  As far as I can learn, the average amount of money to be saved by these victimisations is a matter of £37 per county. Everyone knows that £37 per county matters as little to the finances of the country as would an extra tear to the Atlantic Ocean.  The only result of this proposal is that no potential results will accrue to the finances of any county council.  If this proposal is passed, 50 or 60 individuals will have to economise in their modest homes, and the people behind them as usual &mdash;the housewife or the children&mdash;will suffer drastically with no benefit to the community as a whole.  The thing is nothing more or less than a bit of political humbug.  I re-echo what Deputy Belton has said, that this Bill is introduced in order to put a phrase into the mouth of the cross-road politician and enable him to say &ldquo;We have cut the big salaries in Dublin; <Col N="1429" /> we stand for the little man.&rdquo;  These men, no doubt, are little men.  They may be small, but they are not half as small as the sponsors of this Bill.</P>

I admit that straight off the reel.  But the arguments we have heard put up against the cuts are rather amusing. We heard Deputy Belton declaring that the agricultural instructors have not got half enough.  He said that he knows some of them who have only £500 or £600 a year.  In my county their salaries are round about £400 or £500 a year.  If the condition of agriculture were as good as it was in 1917 to 1919, and prices as high as they were then, I would still be in favour of a cut in salaries.  We could not, at any time, afford these salaries.  When this State was set up here apparently there were so many people pitchforked into jobs that it was not a question so much of position as of salary.  We had O.C.s of the coal scuttle getting £600 a year. I wonder if Deputy Belton, at any time, ever saw farm labourers' wages compare with the wages of the town workers.</P>

      <P>Wait until Deputy O'Higgins counts up the cuts in his salary, and see how much comes off. I do not think he will call that eye-wash. I would like to hear something more definite from Deputy MacDermot. He was very anxious last year that I should press an amendment demanding four times a heavier cut.  I am surprised at the change that has taken place, and I see no excuse for it.  It would take more eyewash than has been supplied to convince the people as to the reason for this change on the part of Deputy MacDermot and his friends.  The real position is that at no time since this State was set up could we afford the salaries paid in the country.  Neither now nor ten years ago could we afford those salaries.  The proposed cuts do not go one-fourth as far as I would go, and I make no bones about that.  If Deputy Belton thinks an agricultural instructor with £400 a year, with bonus and travelling expenses on top of it, could not afford a nine or ten per cent. cut in his salary without his woman and children having to suffer, I wonder has he thought what kind of eyewash that is.</P>

As a matter of fact, I have to go down to Cork to-morrow morning to stop a cut of that description. Supporters of the Deputies who are shouting to-night against the cut in the salary of the man with £300 and £400 and upwards and who are evidently acting on instructions are to propose at the Cork County Council to-morrow a cut in the wages of the labourers who have 35/- a week.  The man with £300 a year is not to have his salary cut because his long-tailed family stretches into the benches opposite.</P>

How can he reconcile that with the recent appointment made by his Government of a man from County Tipperary who is getting £1,500 a year as a land commissioner? How can he talk about slashing salaries when his Government gave £1,500 a year to a land commissioner who was only able to earn £300, £400, or £500 in the past?  These are statements which he probably does not like to hear.  I am as much for economy as anybody in this House or outside.  I know the relief that this Bill is going to give to ratepayers.  The Minister has justified this Bill by pointing to the relief it will bring to the ratepayers. It will not mean one penny in the £ in my constituency.</P>

There are men whose salaries will probably be cut under this Bill, whose salaries I shall never stand for cutting even at the risk of a mandamus because I know what they have done. I know that a good official is entitled to be paid and we have some good officials.  I am not acquainted with the highly-salaried officials that Deputy Corry talks about.  I do not know of them.  I should like to see economies in my county if it is possible to make them, but you will not do it by the fraction of a penny relief which will be given by this Bill.  I ask Deputy Corry or anybody else to deny that that is the kind of economy which will be brought about under this Bill.  It is not worth talking about.

      <P>Envy has often been said to be the besetting sin of this country.  It is mainly expressed in the hatred displayed amongst certain low, mean-minded people in the country towards the successful neighbour's child.  Deputy Corry's envy of anything educative is something that is really that type of local distaste of a decent neighbour's child.  Deputy Corry hates anybody who is educated. Anybody who looks to get a reward for the education or talent or experience that he may have gets Deputy Corry seeing red&mdash;a peculiar type of red that wants to slash.  Deputy Corry is very much in the position of the times when the surgeon used to have a barber's pole as a sign outside his door. He bled everybody.  Bleeding was the great method of cure for everything. Let blood run even for the sake of seeing blood run.  That is the mentality of mind that is afflicting some portion of this country and it is not to be denied that Deputy Corry, if there was a corporation of that sort of rather mean-minded people, would be a proper representative of them.  I do not know what Deputy Breathnach said, but, if he is backing Deputy Corry, all I can say is that he did not do it before his own association.</P>

Let him ask Deputy Cooney about this wonderful Grangegorman speech.  &ldquo;Our administrative programme includes a saving of £2,000,000 on the army.&rdquo;  Of course, it did not matter much to Deputy Cooney, but the fact of the matter is that at that particular time the army was not costing £2,000,000.</P>

The money paid to them was and is badly wanted for other purposes, but Deputy Corry was very silent about all that.  Deputy Cooney at Grangegorman told us that there could be a saving of £500,000 on the Civic Guards and other savings could be made which could be put into productive industry.  Then there was this sapience at Grangegorman: &ldquo;We have come to the conclusion that we can solve the unemployment problem in 12 months.&rdquo;  He has got his 12 months and what has been done?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>A general statement was made to the effect that people earning £600 should have their salaries cut.  The Deputy talked a lot about savings, and he told us that they were going to put in better people to do better work at lower salaries.  In due course we will see what the lower salaries will be.  As Deputy O'Higgins pointed out, the Deputy wants to cut the salaries of 70 or 80 people throughout the country, and 90 per cent. of them are already below the accepted limit.  If one man happens to have his head over others in the matter of talent and experience it means something, and that extra talent and experience gets Deputy Corry's goat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two other people featured in this amendment.  We have, for instance, school attendance officers.  I remember that it was held here as a very big progressive step when they brought in a Bill which increased the age at which children were to be kept at school.  It means extra work on the school attendance officers.  The school attendance officer, the man who, <Col N="1437" /> possibly, kept Deputy Corry at school, when he did not want to be there, is to have his salary cut.  The officers connected with committees of agriculture are also to have their salaries cut.  And all this at a time when we are inaugurating a great change.  A new system is coming into being.  The old system certainly has been wrecked. We are having a great change.  We are going to begin on the marvellous extension of agriculture that was promised. There is never a time when the Minister for Agriculture visits the country that he does not talk about the great work that is being done.  The officers serving under the committees of agriculture are going to have whatever little salaries they possess lopped, because Deputy Corry dislikes education and Deputy Cooney cannot get what he promised for the Grangegorman people.</P>
    <P>There has not been one argument used by anybody, if we except the blind hatred of Deputy Corry, to show that these people are getting more than they should get.  Nobody has had the temerity to deal with the work that those people do or to say that for that work too much is being paid, too much by so much.  Nobody has had the temerity to say that these people are doing work for which the country cannot pay at the moment. No one has attempted to make a case on the merits.  The Minister merely says: &ldquo;These people are next to my hand and I am going to hit at them. It is untenable that they should have such high salaries when everybody else has to suffer.&rdquo;  Deputy Corry says that everyone with a salary over a certain amount must necessarily have it cut.  That is pure hatred of advance.  It is the idea of keeping everybody at a level, possibly putting them below Deputy Corry's level.  If you take the case of the vocational education people, the salaries they are at, the promise made to them, the fact that they have no bonus or that the bonus has been cut, that up to recently they have had no incremental additions, the fact that the saving in their case will be very little, no matter to whom it accrues, and the other fact that there is admittedly no saving in <Col N="1438" /> this matter to the taxpayer&mdash;and, I hold, none to the ratepayer either&mdash; you will realise how absurd is the whole proposal.  Despite all that, the point of view of Deputy Corry is going to go.  These people are going to be cut just because they have reached something a little bit higher than Deputy Corry himself.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to bring Deputy Corry down to something definite. He said that those officials at any time had too much.  Is his the case then that in normal times their salaries were too high?  Or is his case that in these abnormal times their salaries are too high?  He must not have read the title of the Bill.  The title of the Bill is Local Services (Temporary Economies) (No. 2) Bill, 1933.  If these officials in normal times had too high a salary, why is this called a Temporary Economies Bill? Why is it not called a Permanent Economies Bill?  I would like to bring the Deputy or any member of his Party down to a definite point.  He charges us with going down to the country and saying that agriculture, for instance, is in an impoverished condition.  Surely he will not deny that.  Would he take that portion of the Bill which applies peculiarly to the officials we are discussing under this amendment, people earning between £300 and £400 a year with a cut of 2 per cent.  The cut in such cases would vary from £6 to £8.  Will not the farmer lose that much or thereabouts on one bullock because of the import duties put on by England?  Is that equitable?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If all are going to get into step, why should not all go into step?  Any man who could be described as a farmer would have to sell yearly ten bullocks or their equivalent.  Even that would be a small farmer.  Now in this era of new economy, starting off with tillage, we are going to reduce the salaries of agricultural instructors.  Deputy Corry will admit this, despite the strictures of Deputy McGilligan, that to make tillage pay we must have the best of seeds as well as the best of fertilisers.  The Deputy knows that these itinerant instructors are carrying out experiments, and that they have <Col N="1439" /> been for years carrying out experiments in barley, beet, potatoes, fruit, cattle, sheep, pigs, ducks, turkeys, geese and hens.  He knows these experiments have been carried out. He knows that various types or strains are a success in some parts of the country and that these are not a success in other parts of the country. The instructor is experimenting in order to find out the strain or breed that is most suitable for each county. The Deputy knows how much success has attended those experiments and he knows how absolutely essential for the future of tillage it is that there should be a full trial of these experiments in the country.  Yet he proposes to cut the salaries of those who are carrying them out.</P>
    <P>We are wasting hours discussing this, but the Government Party would not allow the tillage position itself to be discussed.  We are running this whole machine of the organisation to find out what is best to help tillage, but we have 58 per cent. of the tillage products at the present time on our hands and we cannot get a bob for them. There is no market for them and the Government Party would not give time for a discussion on this question. But it gives time for the piffle contained in this Bill.  You have 12,000 to 15,000 fat cattle on the hands of feeders at present.  These cattle were fed by the produce of tillage and there is no market for them.  Perhaps it is by a process of inversion that they arrive at the Temporary Economies Bill and that they have come to the conclusion that there is not much need for those agricultural instructors.  If they go along that line and say &ldquo;abolish them&rdquo; we might not agree but it would be the logical course.  The time of the House has been wasted in putting up arguments for a &ldquo;cut&rdquo; that is not a commensurate &ldquo;cut&rdquo; at all if we were to admit the principle even of &ldquo;cuts.&rdquo;  There is no use here in giving us a foretaste of what is to be given by the Party opposite off the platforms in the country&mdash;that they tried to economise but that the Opposition opposed them.  They did not try honest economy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1440" /> I am sure Deputy Corry's colleague in the back bench, Deputy Breathnach, would find himself in Queer Street with his association if honest economy all round were attempted.  If you want to get in step why not get the teachers in step and take 50 per cent. off their salaries?  I would not support cutting 50 per cent. off the teachers' salaries, but if we are to keep in step each section of the community should bear an equitable share of the burden of the economic war.  The farmers do not want to get any peculiar relief, but is it not time that the men in the front line trenches were relieved of bearing the almost entire burden?  Let us see how many teachers will volunteer to step into the front line trenches and sacrifice the whole or half of their salaries for a year and a half.  If you were to propose it you would find that none of them would come in here and vote for the continuance of the economic war.</P>

      <P>I hope the Deputy will not vote for a cut in the salaries paid to the employees of the county committees of agriculture, because after all these are useful, and are doing very useful work, even though at the moment the outlet for the sale of agricultural produce may be stopped; but a change will come some time, because the country cannot be always in the neighbourhood of Grangegorman.  I would like Deputy Corry to come down to brass tacks and to answer these two questions.  He said that these officials always had too high a salary. <Col N="1441" /> He nods assent.  Then, if that is so, why vote for a temporary Bill Evidently the Minister does not think that the salaries are too high in normal times, and under normal conditions.</P>
      <P>If this is a Bill to put all on a level during the economic war, I put it to Deputy Corry or any Deputy on the opposite benches, to show that this schedule of cuts in the Bill bears any relation whatever to the loss sustained by the agricultural community.</P>

I hope that they will not be reduced to the level which the agricultural community are reduced to to-day.  Of course we would be in the vicious circle if it were started, and if the position is that the British market is gone, and gone for ever, thank God, you will be coming back here with temporary reductions in a few months' time, and they will become greater, until the salaries will vanish altogether.

Yes, I believe&mdash;and I <Col N="1442" /> stated that already&mdash;that salaries in this country are too high and have been too high for the past ten years, over since this State came into being.

      <P>When we compare notes on this matter we see what happens. We heard the statements that were made here from these benches when Deputy McGilligan was over here. They do not want any cut on any official salary.  I gave the reason a while ago.  A man may die of starvation in this country, but it is not the duty of the Government to provide employment for him.  A man may die of starvation, but the official salaries should remain at £600 to £1,500 a year. If that is the kind of education Deputy McGilligan learned in his University, I am not at all sorry to have escaped from it.  When Deputy McGilligan finds the foundations taken from his case he always resorts to a particular kind of filthy abuse.  I remember here some time ago I found one kind of employment for the Deputy, which suited him perfectly, namely, that he should go down to Nenagh and lend a hand in killing the musk rats; that is the only job that would suit him.</P>

The position is that the salaries in any country must be commensurate with the capacity of the people to pay those salaries, and I hold that at no time since this State was established could this country afford the salaries that were paid.  If those people can get more elsewhere let them go elsewhere. When Deputy Curran speaks here of the appointment of Mr. Mansfield to a position, and of Mr. Mansfield's salary, I would remind him that Mr. Mansfield's predecessor had a far higher salary, and the farmers of the Free State paid £66,000 a year for it in increased rents.  If we have Mr. Mansfield there at that salary to see that the unfortunate tenants of this State get a fair crack of the whip, it is about time they got it.  There is a big difference between Mr. Mansfield, friend of the tenants&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I am not going to say one or the other, but I will say this much: I gave figures in this House on three occasions during the last 12 months proving that the ordinary farmer with 40 acres of land was at least £40 better off under our Government than he was under Cumann na nGaedheal.  I did not yet hear the figures contradicted in this House, and I am waiting to hear one farmer contradict them.</P>

We are sneered at if we stand up to speak as farmers.  We are sneered at by Deputy McGilligan who says that we have not the intelligence to do it but I say that we have intelligence enough to know that there is depression in this country as well as in other countries.  I will go further and say that the farmers are in the first line of trenches.  I do say that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Victory</NameTxt>
      <P>One would also think that we controlled markets outside this country.  If they do think so, I would ask them if there was a depression in 1931 when Deputy Cosgrave went over to England and asked for time to pay a quarter of a million pounds and did not get it?  Was there depression then?  One would think that we ruled the English market but we had Deputy MacDermot reported last week as saying in this city:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Great Britain had made a change in her own agricultural policy.  She was now committed to a policy of protecting her farmers against foreign competition and even against Dominion competition.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What are we doing to-day?  Are we not protecting the farmers, in so far as it is humanly possible, in the home market?  We cannot control the outside market and the sooner the Opposition realise that the better.  We are starting off to guarantee, so far as we <Col N="1446" /> can, the price of bacon, of butter, of wheat and of oats.  We heard oat flour and black bread being sneered at last week.  It comes very ill from professional gentlemen and particularly doctors and Free State Army pensioners, to sneer at farmers talking in this House.  If they do stand up to criticise the Government, let them put up their own scheme but let them not tell us that we control the English market while they tell a different story outside.</P>

      <P>Right.  We take it for granted then that he has no <Col N="1447" /> case, and he knows he has no case.  I think it proves quite conclusively that, in this case, as in the case of the Bill last year, the aim is not economy and the aim is not to come to the assistance of local bodies, but merely to cut for the sake of cutting.  The aim is to inflict damage on certain classes of the community because they have already inflicted damage on other classes of the community.  I should say that that is quite apparent from the Minister's failure to answer the various criticisms put up.  I should like, however, to welcome Deputy Corry back&mdash;I am sorry he has gone&mdash;to his position of taking charge of these Bills once again.  There was a time when I feared that we would be without his valuable assistance, because, as I have remarked on more than one occasion, Deputy Corry generally acts as Parliamentary Secretary to whatever type of Bill is under discussion, and he tells us much more clearly than the Ministers do what is really at the back of the mind of the Government.  I take it for granted that Deputy Corry, in speaking, was really representing the mind of his Party, and that, in reality, the Government's wish would be not for a temporary Bill but for a permanent one, and that, practically speaking, on its merits, this Bill is altogether independent of any passing depression there may be.  That was the line taken up by, as I say, the most vocal of the Minister's own supporters, the man who, again and again in this House, has blurted out the Government's intentions much more clearly than the Ministers have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have often heard that it was the intention of the head of the Government to level.  It is quite true that his followers would like to say that he wanted a levelling up as well as a levelling down but in the two years during which he has been in office, all the evidence we have seen has shown that the tendency is mainly in the direction of levelling down.  He has pulled down so far as the farmers are concerned and so far as the wealth of this country is concerned and now by this legislation and by the legislation of last year, he is determined to pull down.  It is <Col N="1448" /> all a case of pulling down and as we can see from the speech of the best supporter that the Minister has got&mdash; he himself has contributed nothing to this particular discussion, in the last two hours, at least&mdash;that pulling down is the general policy, a returning to the simpler life as the Government and the head of the Government have always proclaimed to be their policy.  We are told that even if prices continued as high as they were in 1917 and 1918, we would have these cuts.  Not a single case has been put forward by the Minister, however, to argue on the merits of these bodies, no suggestion that value is not given for the money. I suggest that not merely is value given in the case of the particular officers we are discussing, but, seeing that this is a comparatively new service, seeing that for a number of years it was treated more or less as a kind of step child, so far as the country was concerned and not properly looked after, when there is an opportunity of raising this service&mdash;I am speaking particularly of vocational education committees and their officers and teachers&mdash;to the level to which it ought to be raised, not merely is there no attempt to raise it-although in other directions where the return may be expected to be much less remunerative, the Government is squandering not merely tens of thousands of pounds but hundreds of thousands of pounds&mdash;to its proper level in the sphere of education&mdash;and everybody acknowledges that it is for the good of the country that it should be improved&mdash;but this Bill is brought forward and this clause inserted merely for the sake of cutting and merely to prove that these people are to suffer as well as anybody else.</P>
    <P>The Minister refuses to give an answer to the question as to the number of cases of vocational officers in which the money would go back to the ratepayer.  He says there are some cases, but he does not indicate in respect of how many committees that will happen.  He refuses to give the information, and he refuses to make the case.  We are justified, therefore, in assuming that the spirit behind the Bill is the spirit revealed by Deputy Corry&mdash;pull down.  It does not matter <Col N="1449" /> whether the services are good or not-pull down.  As I say, I congratulate the Deputy on taking up again his position as unofficial Parliamentary Secretary to this and similar Bills.  If an attempt were made to justify it, I could understand it, but there is no attempt.  Perhaps the Minister does not believe in the Bill.  I wonder does he?  I gather from his attitude, and from the spirited defence which he has put up in favour of the clauses of this Bill, that he must not be a whole hearted supporter, at all events, and that he realises in his calmer moments that this is a bad Bill, and a thoroughly bad Bill, but the spirit of Deputy Corry and others is a bit too strong, and they have gained the day.  Still, I have just a little too much belief in the fundamental good sense and also the fundamental uprightness of character of the people of this country to believe that they will not be deceived by a Bill whose only purpose is to hurt, not <Col N="1450" /> really to help.  The only appeal it can make to people is that it hurts others. If Deputy Corry and others think it is good politics to play to that particular feeling, abroad in some circles, I have sufficient fáith in the goodness of our fellow-countrymen to believe that such an appeal will fail.</P>

      <P>As regards amendment No. 6, I should not like to leave Deputy McGilligan under a misapprehension. It seems to me that amendment No. 6 is the same in essence as amendment No. 2.  Therefore to move amendment No. 6 on Report Stage would be to attempt to negative a decision arrived at by the Committee, which is not permissible. If the Deputy desires to have a division now on amendment No. 6, without further discussion, he may challenge a division.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 7:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (3), line 44, after the word &ldquo;authority&rdquo; to add the words &ldquo;but shall not include any medical officer in the employment of such local authority.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sub-section, if amended, would read &ldquo;the word officer means any person in the employment of a local authority but shall not include any medical officer in the employment of such local authority.&rdquo;  I am aiming, again, at getting those who are in the medical profession and who are under the authority and control of a local authority exempted from this measure. These professional people, on the medical side, were included in the <Col N="1453" /> main &ldquo;cuts&rdquo; Bill of last year.  For some reason unknown, it was decided to remove those under the control of the local authority from the scope of that measure and the &ldquo;cut&rdquo; was not, I hope, imposed upon them.  Now, an attempt is being made, for the second time, to cut their salaries.  When previously speaking on this matter, I divided those people into the various classes set out in a memorandum they had furnished at the time which was prepared by the Irish Medical Committee. Some of these are possibly not covered now by the Bill, but there will be included whole-time medical officers attached to local authorities, county hospital surgeons and county medical officers.  We have attached to and paid by the local authorities certain professional medical men.  On them depends, to a great extent, the health of the community.  On them depends entirely the health of the community in so far as that is adverted to by the State operating through the local authorities.  An attempt had been made in this country since the Treaty was signed to get these professional men put into something approaching a suitable category with something in the way of reasonable salaries attached to their posts. It was pointed out with regard to some of them that right at the beginning they had rather to be forced on the local authorities.  The local authorities did not welcome the idea of receiving these men and making the payments, small as these payments were, associated with the posts. For that reason it was argued here, and I think commonly agreed, that the medical officers had been put in on a very small scale of salary indeed, with the hope that the local authorities eventually would see the good they did in the community and would realise that they were well worth not merely what was paid to them in the beginning but some increase.</P>
    <P>In various classes these professional men met in their professional associations and put up reasonable claims from time to time as to the emoluments they were getting.  They pointed out the nature of their duties, the experience they had got to have <Col N="1454" /> before they achieved these posts, and the standard of education associated with them.  They made a good case, even in the higher ranks, even in what would be regarded by some people as the extravagantly paid classes, with regard to their emoluments&mdash;not merely for the retention of what they were getting but for additions in their emoluments.  The case they make generally runs this way: that you have got to take into consideration, when thinking of the salaries to be paid to them, the fact that there is a long and costly professional course to be studied, and, when that course is finished and a good professional qualification achieved, that, in the main, in connection with the public appointments of recent years, there had to be added to their studies and their qualifications a considerable amount of experience. That experience, in the main, was gained outside this country. That also, in the main, meant that men who started in practice found it was incumbent on them to get a secondary degree, which entailed their breaking away from their practice and resuming their academic studies once more for periods of anything from six months to a year.  So that, on the whole, having done one course over a number of years and paying heavily for it, men had to enter into a practice and work at it for some years in order to have saved enough either to appoint a <i>locum</i> or to enable them to leave the practice and devote themselves again to study.  Even then there were few plums to be got.  There were a great many applicants for these very small appointments.</P>
    <P>Those people are well qualified.  They have studied hard and have shown talents and capacity and, in addition, they have had to acquire a certain amount of experience outside this country.  One of the results of that experience is that these men go into these posts at a later stage in life than those entering the Civil Service and, even if they had the same pension rights and other rights as in the Civil Service, they have not the same chances as in the Civil Service.  They have not the same emoluments or the same chances of additional emoluments, <Col N="1455" /> and they have nothing like the same chance of achieving a pension at the same rate.  As to the work they did, there might have been some question as to that eight or nine years ago when some of these appointments were new, but there has been no authority of the local type found recently to say that the men occupying these posts were unequal to the work they had to do.  No authority dealing with the health of the people has been found to say that the work is not there to be done and is not being done magnificently, or that the salaries paid are more than what the duties warrant.  It is in these circumstances that it is now proposed to make a cut in the salaries of these men.</P>
    <P>I want to hear again in this debate if anybody has the temerity to say, with regard to any of these people, that they are not of the standard required or that the work is not there to be done and that it is not valuable, national work that has got to be done. I want to hear if anybody has the temerity to say, with regard to any of these people or to any group of them, that the moneys paid are outside what this country, even in its present deplorable circumstances, can afford to pay.  That is the broad principle upon which I open this matter.  There is quite an amount of detail into which I can go, such as the details of the salaries of any of these groups&mdash;the county hospital surgeons or the medical officers attached to the local authorities&mdash;and there is a tremendous case to be made for the ordinary poor law medical officers.  These, as a group, have probably more distressful conditions than any of their professional brethren.  They have been living in hopes of increases in their emoluments. These increases have been promised to them from time to time, and they find now that not merely are they going to be cut in the salaries attached to the duties they are bound to perform, but that, in the case of the part-time men, any private practice they have has ceased to be remunerative. I said, when speaking on a previous occasion, that it was even then <Col N="1456" /> recognised that the doctor's bill was one of the last things to be paid, and as the months have gone on since last June that has become more apparent still.  Men practising in the countryside find themselves in the position that they have got to keep up the habit of attending private patients, not because of any great return financially from that, but because they know that there are people who are ill and requiring their attention and they go to them, but the way the part-time work used to be added to by private practice has disappeared for many months past.</P>
    <P>You have these people with high qualifications, who have run the gauntlet of a series of examinations, who have succeeded against the claims of many other applicants in being passed by the Appointments Commission, entering the service at a low rate of pay because they knew that some of the services were new and they had to ingratiate themselves with the local authority, or else because men, in their anxiety to secure posts in their own country, accepted in this country much lower salaries than they could have got abroad.  Having arrived here, under these conditions, they find now, not on any arguments founded on their merits as to whether they are qualified or as to how they perform their duties or what their work is, but simply because they are near the blundering fists of the Minister, that their salaries, low as they are at present, are going to be cut. If there is a case to be made for this it certainly was not made last July when this was debated.  If there is a case to be made, it is about time that it should be made, or that an attempt should be made in this House to have it presented.  Up to date, those who want these cuts have been silent as to their merits.  The Minister said, with regard to another class of people, that it would be an unreasonable thing to leave these men with the salaries they have at present as long as other men's salaries are to be cut, and I am sure we will hear the same argument now. Again, I say that we should have some indication, as regards these men of the medical type, of what is going to be saved, and we will then know in what <Col N="1457" /> degree or to what extent a real attempt is being made, even in this fatuous way, to meet an ugly situation.  There is a bad situation, but it is not one to be met in this way.  There is a bad situation that can be eased by people giving up the habit of thinking always politically, and not minding anything that happens nationally, economically or financially.  It is unfair that these people, whose merits are so great, should be picked out, because a blunder has been committed, and just because an amount of money has to be saved, big or small.  There should be some attempt now, at the conclusion of the debate, to acquaint these men with the merits of the sacrifice proposed to be imposed upon them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SydneyBMinch" hpid="Mr. Minch Mr. Minch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Minch</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support very strongly the appeal that Deputy McGilligan has made on behalf of the medical fraternity, and particularly on behalf of dispensary doctors.  Everyone knows that if there is one way to bring down a profession and to degrade the individual, it is to bring those who belong to it down to the bare marrow of being able to live as gentlemen, in the position they occupy, leaving aside the big expense they had to incur in securing a medical qualification and a university degree.  In view of the disappearance of their private practice, dispensary doctors in our towns and villages are put to the pin of their collars to make ends meet.  These men have to live up to a certain status. They are the first to be asked to subscribe to local appeals, because they have to give a lead, as it were, to ordinary citizens.  Yet, when private practice has practically ceased, their position is to be further degraded.  As a result, the next thing we may expect is to have medical officers wearing mufflers around their necks instead of their customary attire.  There is very little in towns or villages for the uplifting of our people, but if we find those who occupy a certain social scale unable to keep it up, it will have a repercussion in another way.  Can these men be expected to give the same service, or to keep themselves up to date if their condition is worsened?  It is quite obvious that that cannot go on, and that a general demoralisation will <Col N="1458" /> take place in the profession.  They cannot take the same interest in the upkeep of their dispensaries or in their patients because this may be only the beginning of a further reduction in their status.  In the interests of the medical profession, in the interests of poor patients, and in the interests of the whole system, I hold that nothing will undermine local administration more than cutting the emoluments of dispensary doctors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertEDavitt" hpid="Dr. Davitt Dr. Davitt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Davitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot remember an old Dutch phrase which represents the varying opinions held about a doctor who attends a patient.  When the patient was sick the doctor was represented as a god; when the patient was convalescent the doctor was represented as an angel; when the patient was well the doctor became an ordinary human being, but, when he presented his bill he becomes a demon incarnate. There is a feeling growing up in the medical profession, not only in Ireland, but in America and in other countries, that the time has come when they no longer want to be looked upon as ministering angels, or, as Deputy Minch mentioned, as country gentlemen going round and giving their services to people who, very often, are not as poor as they represent themselves to be, and getting nothing in return. Nobody will deny that there has been for a long time an agitation for the improvement of their position on behalf of medical doctors, and especially poor law dispensary doctors. Few will deny the fact that they are under-paid.  The doctors have been agitating for better payment for their services.  As Deputy McGilligan stated, these services are of extreme importance to the individual and to the State.  While it has been shown that the emoluments which accrue to the doctors are insufficient, the Government now brings in a measure to cut their salaries further.  Possibly it has not occurred to the Minister what effect the cutting of the salaries of doctors may have upon the future of the medical profession.  There have been complaints about the numbers of doctors we export.  There is a certain amount of justice in that complaint, <Col N="1459" /> but if medical students going through their course, either in the university or in the College of Surgeons, notice that the prospects of a medical profession in Ireland are not showing any signs of betterment, but signs of worsening, that must act as an incentive to them to seek a livelihood abroad where their services will be better appreciated from the point of view of financial remuneration.  Action such as the Minister intends to take is bound to have repercussions, and from that point of view alone it is a regrettable one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Minch mentioned, the fact is that dispensary doctors are at present in an exceedingly needy position, and in many cases, are barely able to make ends meet.  Do not let us forget that although this is a poor country, apparently, yet a doctor's overhead expenses in Ireland are greater than those of his colleagues in England.  Few will deny that a motor-car is absolutely essential for a doctor in the country.  What does he have to pay here for that essential equipment? In the first place, he has to pay far more than his colleagues in England. In the second place, he has to pay a bigger tax on petrol, and in the third place, he will have to pay a larger premium on his insurance policy&mdash;with the prospect of a 25 per cent. increase &mdash;since insurance was made compulsory here.  In that way doctors here to start off are handicapped compared with the position of their colleagues in England, who may, on the average, earn six times as much money.  Is that fair? Is it fair that an essential accoutrement of doctors should be so much more expensive here than across the Channel?  I am not now advocating that doctors should get motor-cars cheaper than anyone else, although I have strong views on the point.  It is important to bear these things in mind when considering the position of dispensary doctors and other doctors paid by local bodies.  There is undoubtedly a falling off in the private practice of doctors.  When you consider the position of doctors existing apparently on salaries paid by local <Col N="1460" /> bodies, and partly on whatever private practice has been built up, then we have the situation that when private practice is rapidly falling off, and in some districts is practically non-existent, there is to be a further reduction.  I admit that some doctors make a good living, but remember the amount of money spent on their education, and in preparing themselves for their profession, and while they are giving their services to the people, they see those who were students with them going straight into the money market and making money.  At a time when private practice is falling away, and when expenses are increasing, the Minister brings in a Bill to cut the salaries paid to doctors by local bodies.</P>
    <P>On the face of it, it seems to me that, whatever be the claims of other people who are hit by the Bill, certainly the doctors&mdash;full-time medical officers of health, county hospital surgeons and poor law dispensary medical officers&mdash; have a very genuine case for exemption from this Bill.  I suppose we shall hear some of the spokesmen from the opposite benches on that point.  I dare say Deputy Corry will get up and say that the doctor who is supposed to have £300, is an eyesore to him, but I think that even Deputy Corry will admit that possibly the medical men he knows are finding it very difficult to make both ends meet, and that medical men all over Ireland are really sick and tired of hearing &ldquo;thanks be to God&rdquo; as the only reward for their services.  It has come to that now, that the average fees book of a dispensary medical officer has more &ldquo;thanks be to God&rdquo; cases than actual L.s.d. cases.  At the same time one cannot expect doctors to refuse to do their work.  The nature of their work is such that they simply cannot refuse to act when called upon. They would be regarded as inhuman if they refused to attend a case of sickness even when they know very often that they are not going to get any fee for it.  They make it a habit to go out in any case.  I would ask the Minister to accept the amendment.  I fully believe that some members of his own Party are in favour of it.  I believe that if there were a free vote of the <Col N="1461" /> House, this amendment would be carried.  I believe that many of those on the opposite benches would be behind the amendment if a free vote were permitted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamJosephBroderi" hpid="Mr. W. Broderick Mr. W. Broderick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. W. Broderick</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to add a word to the appeal made on behalf of the dispensary doctor.  I was for a number of years a member of the Cork Board of Assistance and I have a fairly good experience of the work which fell to dispensary doctors during that time.  I can say that the life of a dispensary doctor is one long drudgery. He is at the beck and call of the public day and night.  Even the fees doctors once got from the farmers are no longer forthcoming.  They get more promises now than money.  I really do not know how some of them bring up their families on the small salaries they get at present.  I think it is a very grave mistake to enforce a reduction of their salaries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to support the plea which has been made for the exclusion of the medical officer in the employment of a local authority from the scope of this Bill.  I cannot imagine that a Bill which purports to single out the dispensary medical officer for a special cut has been balanced by any regard or any kind of thought for the position of the medical officer in the community.  If the position were that the State, as a whole, thought that medical officers were overpaid, then one could understand an effort being made to impose a general levy, or a poll tax on all medical officers in the community, but here we find a particular class, the worst paid class of the whole lot, the dispensary medical officer, singled out for a special type of cut while his colleagues in the medical profession outside who may be earning ten times his income at present, are permitted to go free.  I am not advocating a cut on any particular class of person; I do not think that cuts in salaries are a remedy, but I cannot understand the viewpoint of a Minister who says that the gentleman with £5,000 a year outside is to be free from any cuts while the dispensary medical officer whose total income is four or five hundred <Col N="1462" /> pounds is to be subjected to a special cut.  I cannot understand the mentality behind that at all and I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and the Minister for Agriculture to tell us from their own personal experience whether dispensary medical officers are people who can afford the cuts that will be imposed on them under this Bill.</P>
      <P>As has been already stated, a large amount of the time of the dispensary medical officer is given free.  Probably the poor, especially in rural areas, have no greater friend than the dispensary medical officer.  He is available at all times to attend to their needs. When the poor are ill, they are the first whom the dispensary medical officer attends and they are the last people from whom the dispensary medical officer expects any fee or reward.  As a matter of fact, the giving of medical treatment is not like selling potatoes or cabbage.  In buying potatoes or cabbage one is forced to have cash. You must pay for these commodities or do without them.  Medical treatment, not being a commodity, is not sold for cash in the same way as commodities are sold, with the result that medical officers generally, particularly dispensary medical officers, render much service to the community for which, in the great majority of cases, they receive no remuneration whatever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Davitt has mentioned the expense to which the medical officer is subjected in the course of his duties. He has referred to the fact that the-medical officer must, of necessity, in existing circumstances, have a car.  A car, one might say, is a tool of the dispensary medical officer's occupation. It is almost impossible to think of a dispensary medical officer without a car.  In any case, it is a most undesirable thing if he is without a car, because obviously rapid transport will often mean the life or death of his patient.  A motor-car to the medical officer is a tool of his occupation.  It is a necessity for him.  In rural areas especially that car is used continuously in the interests of the poor patients whom the medical officer attends as part of his official duty. The cost of purchasing the car and of <Col N="1463" /> its upkeep is a large item in the domestic budget for every dispensary medical officer.  When one considers his present low rate of salary, one shudders to think how the ordinary dispensary medical officer can manage to keep his head above water and keep free from debt having regard to his outgoings on the one hand and his meagre income on the other.</P>
    <P>It has been mentioned and, of course, everybody knows it from experience, that the last person one thinks of paying is the medical officer.  Everybody goes to him, but, as Deputy Davitt says, he is regarded as a demon incarnate when he presents his bill, the result being that in the majority of cases which they attend medical officers receive no payment whatever. Indeed dispensary medical officers, because they are associated with the scheme of free medical attention, are frequently assumed to be impertinent if they attempt to demand fees from people who are often well able to pay fees.  I think it is rather unfortunate and grossly unfair that dispensary medical officers, who are very much underpaid, should be singled out for a special cut as distinct from other medical officers and other persons in the medical profession.  There is no case for singling out dispensary medical officers.  Nobody has shown, and I am sure nobody can show, that the dispensary medical officer is in any way overpaid.  Nobody can show that his duties are not burdensome.  Nobody can show that he is in any way excessively remunerated for the multifarious duties which he performs.  If the Ministry cannot see its way to exempt medical officers completely from the scope of the Bill I would suggest that some substantial allowance, much more than the £50 mentioned in the Bill, should be made.  Dispensary medical officers have to maintain motor-cars for their duties, and it is impossible for them to meet the expenses incurred in the discharge of their duties on the scale of salaries provided at present, and it will be further impossible under this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrRobertJRowlette" hpid="Dr. Rowlette Dr. Rowlette">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Rowlette</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support the amendment before the House, which <Col N="1464" /> is almost identical with an amendment of which I have given notice.  I appeal to Deputies on both sides of the House, and I appeal to the Minister in charge of the Bill, to receive this amendment in a sympathetic spirit. It is said by several Deputies that medical officers of every class are not overpaid.  I think that opinion will be shared by the Minister.  I am sure he will make no claim that there is extravagance, or lack of economy shown in the salaries of medical officers who are likely to be affected by this Bill. In asking for special consideration for medical officers I am not wishing to make any unfair discrimination against other officers affected by the Bill.  But medical officers stand in a special position as compared with the great bulk of other officers.  They constitute the largest class of professional men in the employment of local authorities and these professional officers of the local authorities should receive special consideration.  They do not enter upon the public service until they have spent five or six years, at considerable cost to their parents, in educating themselves for the profession and in study which alone will make them eligible candidates for such appointments.  Again, and this applies particularly in recent years, since the status of medical officers throughout the country has been raised by the Government methods of appointment, the competition has been very keen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not sufficient now to look for appointment in any branch of the public medical service simply with medical qualifications.  The candidate must possess experience.  He must possess experience at starting which will increase his usefulness to the community.  Then, in addition, a candidate seeking employment should possess some higher qualifications than formerly.  Any medical body in the last seven or eight years knows that a very large number of men have to spend a certain number of years in the practice given to their work and whatever employment they are going in for, in order to fit themselves to receive appointments in the public service, which looks for extra experience  <Col N="1465" /> as a qualification.  The result is that the country can congratulate itself that its public medical service is much more efficient to-day than it was ten years ago.</P>
    <P>What has been the great attraction to these men to seek appointment in the public service?  It is certainly not the wealth they expect to acquire from it.  They know, perfectly well, they could not attain wealth by employment in the public service.  What they look to are salaries increasing by a fixed scale as promised, but above all, they look to security in their contract, and the right to pension when their working days are over.  This Bill interferes with that security and the candidates for public services in the future will know that the contract of their appointment, although protected by the terms of the Bill, may be altered at any time by the legislature.  That security is no longer one of the assets in employment for the public service, and that is what service under the local authorities promises in the future.</P>
    <P>Again, much of what I say in regard to doctors in the public service applies equally to engineers and others, as well as to the medical profession.  From these men considerable experience is required before they can get their appointments.  Doctors enter the public service later in life than clerks who enter a county council office and, consequently, their years of tenure of office are shorter for securing pensions than those who enter the public service five or ten years earlier.</P>
    <P>I would like to draw attention to some of the different classes of medical officers in the public service.  One may take first what is the most important branch of the medical service in the country and that which is most hopeful for the country, that is the service of the county medical officer of health.  Up to ten years ago we had no county medical officer of health in this country.  We neglected that all through our history.  We were half a century behind other civilised countries. It is to the credit of this State that that condition of things was taken in hand and, that, <Col N="1466" /> a couple of years ago, a public medical service was founded, and is now in practice, which is proving a benefit and a credit to the country. When it was necessary to start this work, to initiate it, and to put into operation a scheme to which the country was unaccustomed, we had to get men from other countries, where this scheme was developed.  We had no demand for candidates in the Irish Free State for the position of medical officers of health.  The great majority of the men we got received their training in Great Britain, and many of them were enjoying salaries higher than they actually accepted on their return to their own country.  Men with salaries of £1,200 a year accepted salaries of £800 in order to help in doing useful work for their native country.  They were assured, and persuaded, and they believed that, though beginning at a small salary, as the value of their work was more appreciated salaries would be increased in proportion to the importance of the work done.  They have been here only a few years.  None of them held these positions some five or six years ago, yet now their salaries are to be cut by a substantial figure &mdash; £50 in the case of salaries of £800 a year.  Then again these men had much better prospects in the country from which they came.  Not only had they larger salaries, but they had better prospects.  They came here at salaries on a scale between £800 and £1,000 rather than remain in Great Britain with better salaries and emoluments. They made sacrifices to come here upon an understanding that they believed was an honourable understanding, but which this Bill now claims the right to tear up.</P>
    <P>It is not as if these salaries had been fixed at a time when salaries and prices were high.  They were fixed in recent years.  There is little if any alteration in the cost of living since these salaries were fixed.  With these men I may class the assistant medical officers of health, mostly engaged in such important work as the prevention of tuberculosis and the care of school children &mdash; the most important services that this country could undertake.  If <Col N="1467" /> we are to attract the proper class of candidates to these public services we must make these services secure and we must make the salary attractive, but above all we must give security, which is threatened by this Bill.  Again, I think officers engaged in the mental hospitals service deserve special consideration. In these cases the assistant medical officer is usually a whole-time officer with £300 a year and accommodation. Some of the tradesmen working in the mental hospitals are more highly paid &mdash; I do not grudge it to them &mdash; I am sure they earn what they get.  Is that a salary which will attract medical officers of the class that one would like to be in charge of the most unfortunate class of the community? Are we likely to attract medical officers who will do credit to the service, who will make improvements in that service, which so far has lagged behind in the general advance of medical services?  These men have little prospect.  The number of senior posts which they may attain is very small. A young man going in at 25 or 30 years of age at £300 a year may look to advancement as assistant medical officer, perhaps, to £500, but once he attains the age of 40 or 45 he is very unlikely to get any further.  He is unlikely to be chosen for one of the senior appointments.  As is quite natural, the Appointments Commission selects the younger men.  It is an unattractive service. Is it the wish of the Government to make it more unattractive?  Does it not occur to them that it may increase the melancholy conditions prevalent in the mental hospitals if they depress the salaries of the unfortunate medical officers?</P>
    <P>The county hospital surgeons stand in much the same position as the county medical officers of health.  Most of them are recent appointments.  I think there is no office in the country, medical or otherwise, which demands more varied accomplishments than that of county surgeon.  He has to be a skilled surgeon, a skilled physician, a skilled gynaecologist, a skilled laryngologist, an x-rayist, and a pathologist, and all these things at the same time.  He must be a man of very great capacity, a very versatile professional man, and <Col N="1468" /> he must have the confidence of the public.  If the people of the country are to be properly treated in the county hospitals, and I know the Minister is anxious that the county hospitals should be thoroughly efficient, it is essential that men of the highest professional capacity should be attracted to those offices, and that if they cannot expect wealth in these offices they can, at any rate, expect the security which they believe they got when they accepted the office.</P>
    <P>Several Deputies have already spoken of the poor law medical officers. I make no appeal to the House for charity for these men, but I do appeal to the House for justice for them, and I do appeal to the House still more to maintain the efficiency of the dispensary medical service through the country.  It is on the dispensary doctor, the general practitioner, not on the county hospital surgeon or the county medical officer of health that the health and happiness of the great bulk of the people depend.  It is on his efficiency and devotion to duty. No one who is a member of the profession could fail to listen with pleasure to the words that came from several lay Deputies this evening in recognition of the work performed by dispensary medical officers.  It has been said that this cut will hit them specially hard. I agree.  Much has been said in the earlier part of the debate to-day, and much has appeared in the papers in very serious pronouncements within the last few days about the farmers being in the trenches.  They are in the trenches, but the doctors are with them.  Whatever touches the prosperity of the farmer touches immediately the livelihood of the doctor. The work of the doctors through the country in the last year or two has been transferred from their private practice to their poor law practice.  I do not say that their former private patients are getting red tickets, but they are getting free attendance.  I have been told &mdash; and I believe it &mdash; by dispensary medical officers in many parts of the country that their poor law practice &mdash; that is the practice actually done on red tickets and black tickets &mdash; has increased 50 per cent. in <Col N="1469" /> the last 12 months.  I have been told by them personally &mdash; and I have been in touch with them in most parts of the country &mdash; that in the last 12 months their private practice has almost vanished.  They are doing the work, but they are not being paid; they have no expectation of being paid and no possibility of enforcing payment.  They are reduced to living on their poor law salaries, while at the same time they have to keep up the expense of doing an extensive private practice&mdash; extensive as far as area goes.  The minimum poor law salary of a dispensary doctor is £175 per year.  He is immune from the cut.  The maximum is £350 a year, together with some small stipend &mdash; a contemptuous stipend &mdash; as assistant medical officer of health.  On that sum of money he is expected to suffer a reduction.  He has been attempting to live, and has been living with difficulty, on that sum of money, plus his private practice.  It is impossible for him to alter his means of living &mdash; the education of his family, the manner in which he runs his house &mdash; if he is reduced to his dispensary salary minus the minimum cutscale, or perhaps a larger scale if he does not happen to be popular with the local authority.  His dispensary salary in many cases will do little more than pay his travelling expenses through his district even for his poor law patients, without, as happens now, his having to pay the expenses of his private practice as well, for which he gets little or no remuneration.  That applies to dispensary doctors generally throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I should like to say something about the position of the dispensary doctors in Dublin.  In Dublin the scale is relatively good.  The scale of salary runs from £250 to £350, with £25 as medical officer of health.  That with private practice might seem to offer a good livelihood but where is the possibility of the private practice?  A dispensary doctor practising in Dublin gave me those figures to-day as to his dispensary work in the year 1933.  He attended a total of 10,185 patients throughout the year, and his colleague in the same dispensary attended a total of 12,193 for a salary of about <Col N="1470" /> £300 a year.  If one of those gentlemen was looking for a position as a panel doctor in England he would be only allowed to undertake the liability of attending 1,500 persons, not patients. In Dublin he attends 10,000 or 12,000 patients, representing possibly a population which is liable to attain to twice that amount.  Where could such a man get an opportunity for private practice?  He is depending absolutely on his dispensary salary for his livelihood. Moreover, if he had time for private practice, in many parts of Dublin the private practice has now moved out to the suburbs while he is perhaps in a tenement district where he has to live if he is to keep in touch with his poorer patients.  I think everyone in the House&mdash;most of the Deputies know the conditions in which the medical officers of the country work &mdash; will agree that none of them is overpaid.</P>
    <P>The word &ldquo;economy&rdquo; has been greatly used to-day and in recent days. I ask Deputies to consider what economy is.  Economy is not the mere saving of money: it is getting full work well done.  There is no such thing as economy without efficiency.  In so far as this Bill is concerned with the cutting down of salaries by amounts which will inflict suffering on some thousands of persons through the country, it will merely effect a contemptible amount of saving of money for the country as a whole &mdash; £35,000 is the amount quoted by the Minister.  In so far as economy is concerned, the mere saving of that sum of money, if it diminishes the efficiency of the officers of local authorities throughout the country, will mean that there will be no economy whatever. I believe, and I think I have given the House reason to believe, that the efficiency of future medical services will be gravely interfered with by the passing of this Bill in its present form. It will mean that a less suitable class of candidate will be seeking to enter the public service in the future.  It is not the medical profession that will suffer; it is the whole country that will suffer through a lack of efficiency and through a worsening of conditions in relation to the general health of the people.  I appeal to the Minister to <Col N="1471" /> give sympathetic consideration to this case, to consider medical officers as a class by themselves with certain claims which other classes cannot completely show.  I appeal to him to take the same attitude towards them as he took last year on a similar Bill in regard to the Civic Guards by not inflicting a cut in their salaries.  I trust that he will consent to accept the amendment which has been moved.</P>

      <P>I am in close association with them on public boards, and I must say they are good men and they do their work well, the greater proportion of them.  However, there is an odd black sheep in every flock, and we cannot help that.  Despite all that, I cannot see why doctors should be exempted from the cut.  This cut will not inflict the enormous hardship on them which has been mentioned so eloquently from the benches opposite. A cut of £10 or £15 a year off their salaries is not too much, and it will not inflict on them the hardship we have had so much noise about.</P>
      <P>The last Deputy told us about the sacrifices made by doctors who came back from other lands to take up jobs here at £800 a year.  If they were in better positions elsewhere I can assure every Deputy here they would not come back.  Anyway, there were enough doctors here to fill all the jobs without bringing any fellows back from other countries.  Unfortunately, the medical profession in this country has been overdone.</P>

Might I also point out that there were no men in the country sufficiently qualified to fill those positions and that is why men with experience gained elsewhere were brought over here?</P>

The dispensary doctors have not the same amount of work to do as they used to have.  All over the country we have cottage hospitals set up where special doctors are put.  At present if an ordinary dispensary patient gets ill and the doctor has to pay that patient a second visit, he is shifted off to the cottage hospital.</P>

We have had a new service set up, the county medical officer of health.  Honestly speaking, from the specimens I have seen going around, they do not appear to be overworked; whether they are overpaid or not is another question.  The County Medical Officer of Health in Cork has three assistants, and five or six lady assistants tacked on also.  I think it was a case of making posts for the doctors.  The ordinary dispensary doctor starts off with £250 or £300 a year. In addition to that, he has his private practice.  I admit there are a few honourable exceptions, but I would like to see the doctor who is prepared to come in and say: &ldquo;God bless you; I will not charge you at all,&rdquo; when he goes round to the ordinary farmer.  I have heard no case showing why the dispensary doctor or the medical officer <Col N="1473" /> of health should not have his salary reduced, just the same as everyone else.</P>

So far as these two amendments are concerned, I have no very special contribution to make to the debate; but the arguments which apply to these amendments, and to the section of the Bill which these amendments seek to alter, seem to me to be similar to those which apply to every other section of the Bill.  There seems to be a certain amount of temerity, or rather diffidence and shyness, in suggesting to the Government what the proper remedy is for their shortage of money.  There are other ways, besides raiding the salaries of medical officers, of finding money for this hard-up State.  I am going to say, without any diffidence and without any shyness, that the proper way to find money, if you want to find it, is to settle this dispute which is going on with England, this rotten dispute which is proving every day it goes on the imcompetence and stupidity of the Government which is ruling the destinies of the country.

That, sir, is my submission to you as to the relevance of my remarks. To proceed with my argument, the point which I would like to stress is this &mdash; that as long as this present Government is led by an arch-fanatic <Col N="1474" /> there is very little chance of having any settlement with England.</P>

These two amendments propose that the Bill, in so far as it proposes to make cuts on the salaries of dispensary doctors, should be amended.  My suggestion goes to show this &mdash; that there are other ways of finding the money which is being taken out of the pockets of the doctors.  Surely I am entitled to say that instead of taking the money out of the pockets of the doctors, the money could be got in another feasible way, a way which is open to any commonsense Government, and that way as I have already indicated is, undoubtedly, by entering into negotiations with England&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Before discussing the particular amendment I wish to say that I am rather glad to notice that the Minister has returned to the House, because I want to take the very earliest opportunity of refuting the slander which was uttered by Deputy Corry on the dispensary doctors of this country.  I think that Deputies of all parties, irrespective of political affiliations, and the Minister for Local Government and Public Health in particular, will agree that it is unfair to charge dispensary doctors generally with packing off to hospital every dispensary case that requires as much as a second visit.  One outstanding feature of this debate was that even those who found themselves in the unfortunate position of having to advocate a reduction in the already slender income of dispensary doctors, as well as those who were opposed to <Col N="1475" /> that action, have one and all, with the exception of one Deputy, proclaimed with a loud voice their tribute to the dispensary doctors of Ireland.  I hope when the Minister's attention is called to what was uttered from behind his seat that he will see that that is contradicted on the part of the Government and by the man best fitted to contradict it, namely, the Minister to whom all these doctors are responsible.</P>
      <P>In good and in bad times, in good and in bad weather, the dispensary doctors of Ireland have always rendered heroic services to the people of Ireland, particularly to the poor.  Any suggestion that they have attempted to side-step their responsibilities, or that in a spirit of utter selfishness, to save themselves a visit to a sick house, they would pack the patient to hospital, is a suggestion that should not be tolerated in this Assembly.  I can only echo the tribute which has been paid to this long-suffering body of men, whether that tribute has been paid from the benches opposite or from my own.  I would ask the Minister in particular to hearken to those tributes and thus to realise what this amendment means; that it is merely an appeal to him to listen to those tributes from all sides and to exempt that particular class from the axe that is in operation at the moment.</P>
      <P>So far as I can see, the argument advanced for this particular type of economy is that we are all going through it, that we all have to go through it together, that the sacrifices must be equal and that all must bear their share.  Whether I agree with the cause or the policy that brought about that particular set of circumstances, I agree with the demand that if sacrifices have got to be made then that all should make these sacrifices, that all should make sacrifices according to their capacity or capability.  I hold that the dispensary medical officers or the part-time medical officers have made a greater contribution and a bigger sacrifice in this economic war than any other class in the community, not excepting even the farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I argued before on the Second Reading of the Bill that the larger part of <Col N="1476" /> the income of the dispensary medical officer was made up of private practice, and that private practice in rural areas had disappeared entirely.  That may be an exaggeration.  Their private practice may have disappeared or their income from the private practice may have disappeared only by 50, 60 or 70 per cent.  But it has disappeared to a very great extent.  I would ask the members of all Parties to realise this, that the dispensary doctor, the poor law medical officer, is the one man whose work costs him money out of pocket.  Every case means out-of-pocket expenditure.  Every wave of illness in his district means more and more out-of-pocket expenditure.  With the income from his private practice disappearing the car has still to be run, the tax on that car has to be paid, and that tax is more than the doctor can often bear.</P>
    <P>Within the last five days I spoke to a doctor, who certainly is not and never was a supporter of the Party to which I belong.  He is a man who minds his business and works hard, and he told me that he is still driving his car with last year's licence.  The reason is that he cannot get the cash to pay for the new licence.  The one defence he has if he is up in court, is that he has not got the money.  Now he is the last man in the world who, I would suggest, is not minding his job. But the cash is not in his parish.  He has a bigger practice than ever, but he is not getting the money.  He has reached the point now where private practice is a loss to him.  All he gets out of it is the wear and tear of his car and the cost of petrol, with no remuneration for his services.  I would like to tell the House that that is not an exceptional case.</P>
    <P>I have a shrewd suspicion that dispensary doctors were included in this particular Bill because of the argument that if you are going to have such a Bill at all, it should apply to all, and that if you open the door to exempt any class, you will never be able to close that door &mdash; that there will be such a demand for exemptions that your Bill will not be worth while.  Even though the argument may be in any direction, if the balance of equity and <Col N="1477" /> justice is in the other direction, then equity and justice should be our guide rather than cold logic and argument. There is no doubt about it.  It has been said there are exceptions: that there are some doctors still earning a considerable amount by practice, and they can afford a cut. They are already taxed by reason of increased income tax, by reason of increased car tax, by reason of compulsory insurance, by reason of the 25 per cent. increase in insurance.  The man who of necessity has to utilise a motor-car for his work is taxed top, bottom and middle, without any further cut.  Remember you can, through your economy Bill, force this dispensary medical officer to become economically minded.  You can force him to begin to watch petrol consumption. You can force him, by stress of lack of money, to do what Deputy Corry accuses him of doing &mdash; to visit a case only once, and if it is going to be a tedious one to get it packed off to the nearest hospital.  I wonder how that would suit the poor.  He would be within his rights in doing it. He would also be within his rights, on visiting a case and seeing that it was not a terribly serious one, in saying: &ldquo;I will be around this way again in four or five days time.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>You can force him to economise. You can force him to economise to such a point that he will visit a case once in six days, where he is visiting it now five times in six days.  Who is the loser and who is the gainer?  The State gains £3 or £4 a year; the county gains £3 or £4 a year.  Every sick poor person in the district loses the careful attention and the visit of that doctor daily or every second day. Even though he does not do anything in particular each time he visits the house, the people &mdash; particularly the poor &mdash; like to have a doctor calling when somebody is sick, even if it is only to say &ldquo;Good-day, Mary,&rdquo; and a kind word, and &ldquo;You are doing well.&rdquo;  That feeling of welcome for the doctor, and the reassurance that he is coming again to-morrow, is more important than medicine in bringing that person back to a state of health.  Mind you, I am not talking now in any Party line.  I <Col N="1478" /> say that either commonsense or fair play or equity or the capacity of the individual to bear the cut should prompt the Minister and his colleagues to exempt that particular class.  A case has been made for others.  I am only concerned with the part-time poor law medical officer, the man who was heretofore dependent on practice, the man who is forced down to the very lowest stiver now, the man who is unselfishly and heroically going his many miles per week now as he did in easy days, in days of luxury when money was plentiful and petrol no consideration.  There has been no decrease in the vigilance and consideration extended by these men to their patients.  We should appreciate that.  We should appreciate that rather than victimise them still further.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corry says that it is a matter of £10 or £15 a year.  It may be a matter of only £10 or £15 a year, but it is a matter of the last ten or 15 straws, and it will have the effect of forcing them to economy, or, on the other hand, turning them into a hard, commercially-minded class.  That has never been associated with a dispensary doctor.  He has gone on a ticket; he has attended as many people free as he has on tickets.  He has gone to people who could not very well produce a ticket, but who could not very well produce a fee, and he has never pressed for that fee.  In law he would be entitled to it.  You can make him a hard, commercial machine.  Self-defence, the prevention of bankruptcy, the desire or the necessity to keep a car on the road, can turn him into that hard, commercial machine, where he has got to ring the last bob out of anybody capable of paying, where he has got to make the poor dread the day when illness will come to their house where he has got to make them fear the visit of a doctor rather than welcome it, got to make them, right through their illness, worry with the thought &ldquo;How are we going to pay this man at the end?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Where will all that lead to in this country?  It will lead back to a state of affairs that is happily past in Ireland. It will lead back to a state of affairs where many illnesses go undetected, <Col N="1479" /> untreated and undiagnosed; where you have the spread of diseases through those hidden or undiagnosed cases.  In the long run, there, again, who is going to suffer?  The county; the public of the county; and we are supposed to be compensating for all that by victimising the greatest hero in every parish, by turning into a hard machine the one outstanding human factor in every parish.  As a compensation for that the parish will receive half of a £10 note per annum.  That forces me back to where I began, that the only justification for the inclusion of these poor law medical officers in a Bill such as this is the inadvisability of making any exceptions lest you might have to except all.  That, instead of being an argument for the inclusion of the dispensary medical officer, is an argument for the withdrawal of the Bill.  If your case is so weak against all that the exception of any class would force the exemption of all, then there are rather groggy legs under the whole Bill.</P>
    <P>I do not want to get back into anything but the particular amendment we are dealing with, but remember that dispensary doctors in every board of health area are of all ages.  There are some young men, some middle-aged men, and some older men.  With their practice gone, and the threat of a cut in salary, undoubtedly you will have one, two or three resignations in every board of health area.  You will have one, two or three new appointments. You will have one, two or three new pensions.  Where is the economy? Where does the £10 or £15 a year come in?  Does not anyone who knows the facts and knows and appreciates the circumstances realise this, that this Bill may stand for anything but it does not stand for economy?  This Bill, in its application to that class, will mean more expenditure in every board of health area.  It will mean more expenditure if it has the natural effect of doing what Deputy Corry has prompted; if it has that result it will mean more expenditure, transport to and from hospital, maintenance of the cases in hospital, etc.  If it leads to even one resignation in the whole <Col N="1480" /> county it will not result in economy. It will result in more expenditure than there is at the present moment.</P>
    <P>Then there is another thing which I left last; there is the value of a contract; the value of security and the value to the individual of a feeling of stability.  Those mean more than money.  Those mean more than money to the individual.  They mean more than money to those dependent on the individual.  All those things are blasted by this Bill.  What security is there for any servant of this State after a sequence of this class of Bill? What value will they place on the contract made between the individual and the State?  What security can any man, irrespective of what his salary or wages are, feel after this particular precedent is established?  Mind you, a rate of x number of pounds a year is purely an arbitrary figure but utilise that for the moment.  Those who fix the rate at x pounds this year can make it half x pounds next year, once you drive the thin end of the wedge in. The spearhead is there and the shaft will follow easily and once the salaried classes are attacked in this Bill, the wage classes will be attacked in the next and we will reach a point, if we give approval to this Bill, at which we shall have established in this country that the only officials, the only officers or the only servants of the State who can feel their position secure or their incomes anyway stable are those who were specially protected by the British Government at the time of the Treaty.  I move to report progress.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;I had a very hard week at the Ard-Fheis and I just came down to talk to you like this.  I knew you would not take me too serious.&rdquo; Words taken from speech 446 delivered by the extern leader of the Opposition Party at Kanturk on Sunday last. &ldquo;Don't take me too serious.&rdquo;  I do not think anybody believes that any person in this country or any Deputy in this House takes the proceedings of the Opposition Party in relation to this or any other motion too seriously.  I think that the House will remember that, on the last occasion, in the few intervals in which I was able to intersperse my remarks among the interruptions which were hurled at me from the Opposition Benches, I endeavoured to point out that since this motion was first put down in the name of Deputy Belton and of some other Deputies, whose experience of this House might have taught them to have greater regard for the time of this House, the Opposition had not taken this motion seriously.  One could only come to the conclusion that the Party managers, finding, as previous associates of the Deputy had found, that it was difficult to restrain him in his wilder moments, had allowed Deputy Belton to put this motion down in order that he might blow off steam and if any proof of that conjecture were necessary, we can find it in the recorded proceedings, or at least, in such of the proceedings of the Fine Gael Ard-Fheis as appeared in the daily newspapers for February 9th.  Those proceedings were full of interest because one of them, at any rate, was the last gulp which Fine Gael had made at swallowing holus-bolus the complete Fianna Fáil programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that connection, I should like to remind the House that General O'Duffy, in the intervals when he is not unfolding his life story, which he tells with so fervid a fancy and so fertile an imagination, has already told us that the Fianna Fáil wheat and tillage policy is not going to be abandoned.  Why?  When the measures which were necessary to give effect to that policy were going <Col N="1482" /> through this House, they were opposed with great vehemence and great bitterness by the Opposition.  When the Department of Agriculture was endeavouring to get farmers to adopt that policy, certain Deputies of this House told the farmers to have nothing to do with the Fianna Fáil wheat policy.  Now, we hear that the short experience of 12 months has convinced the leaders of the Party, at any rate, that the policy is popular in the country, that the policy is beneficial to the country and that they would risk their political future, insecure and uncertain as that future is, by announcing that if they were to be returned to office, there was to be a complete right-about turn and that they would not go back to the policy which they pursued under Deputy Hogan when he was Minister for Agriculture, when he was, in the words of Deputy Belton, Minister for grass in this country.  Then we have heard just this morning, I think, that the land annuities are not going ever again to be paid over to Great Britain.  Why not?  We have been told by one of the circulating VicePresidents of the all U.P. organisation that in keeping these annuities here, we were guilty of the foul and dishonourable crime of embezzlement.  We have heard ourselves denounced as men who have no regard for the Ten Commandments.  I heard Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney, in his speech during the last Autumn session, calling the country to witness that Heaven will yet wreak vengeance on the Irish people because we had been guilty of a breach of the Seventh Commandment. If it is dishonourable for us to retain the annuities now, if we have no right to them, if the retention of the annuities is the cause of the economic war&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This motion seems to have left the realms of relevancy altogether.  There is no question about that.  It seems to have <Col N="1483" /> left relevancy behind completely, and the Minister is not adding to the relevancy by his remarks now.</P>

I think I am entitled to develop that aspect of the question because I am entitled to prove that this motion no longer figures as an honest motion before this House.</P>

      <P>I am not the least concerned with what the U.I.P. policy is.  What I am concerned with is to get the House to discuss the motion on the Order Paper.  Clearly the right or justice of the retention of the land annuities is scarcely relevant to this motion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit that the retention of the land annuities has a great relevancy to this motion.  We have been told that the economic war is due to the fact that we have retained the land annuities.  We have been told at great length by members of the Opposition Party that we could settle the economic war.  How are we to settle it?  According to them, by giving over the land annuities to Great Britain.  But now they tell us, never again, in the words of General O'Duffy, are the land annuities going to be paid over to Great Britain.  If we do not pay them over the economic war continues, and if they do not pay over the land annuities do they think there is going to be any change in the situation? Do they think that they, any more than we, would be in a position to give effect to this motion which is:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the Dáil condemns the action of the Government in reducing the total of the grants payable for the relief of rates on agricultural land&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to say this: that one of the reasons why we felt justified in reducing the grants on agricultural land was that we had reduced the annuities <Col N="1484" /> payable on agricultural land by 50 per cent.  We have been able to do that by retaining the land annuities in this country.  The whole of these matters are interrelated and cannot be separated.  And with great respect, I think, I have proved that they are relevant to the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister does not argue that it is relevant to go over the whole issue whether they were justified in withholding the land annuities or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>After the statement of General O'Duffy, which I have quoted, I do not think there can be any doubt in the minds of reasonable men that we have been fully justified in withholding the land annuities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not concerned with what General O'Duffy said or did not say.  I am only concerned with what is relevant to the motion before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite so, but we would be only in a position to give effect to this motion if we were entitled to retain these annuities as of right, and if the other party to the dispute acknowledged our right to so retain them.  I presume that we have, at any rate, reached accord on this; both the Opposition and ourselves. It is a hopeful and a healthy sign for the future, that the economic war and the retention of the land annuities need no longer be a bone of contention between us.  In the same way we were told &mdash; it is one of the reasons why we cannot afford any further relief to agricultural land at this period &mdash; that we were developing our industrial arm too hastily; that it has made considerable claims upon the attention of the Government and has imposed certain burdens upon the public funds. If we were to slow up industrial development it might be held by some that we would be in a better position to give effect to this motion, but do the Opposition wish us to slow up industrial developments?  On the contrary, General O'Duffy again has told us that industrial development, if he and his party are ever returned to power in this country, is no longer to <Col N="1485" /> be strangled as it was in the old days of Cumann na nGaedheal.  Once again, why?  Because quite obviously it is in the best interests of the people of this country that our policy of industrial development should be pursued to its fulfilment, and that all sections of the community including the holders, the owners or the possessors of agricultural land should contribute something to enable us to carry through our programme in that regard.  But the significant fact is that having listened 12 months ago to the speeches of Deputy Dillon, Deputy McGilligan and Deputy Mulcahy &mdash; he even yet has not resigned himself to the existing situation, as the question which he had on the Order Paper to-day testifies &mdash; the only effect of them has been to convert the back benchers of Fine Gael to the Fianna Fáil point of view, to compel them and coerce their organisation to adopt the Fianna Fáil policy in regard to industrial development.</P>
      <P>It has also been said that the farmers would not require the additional help which the terms of this resolution condemn the Government for not giving, if it were not for the fact, as it has been said, that the economic difference with Great Britain has been complicated by political considerations.  But only the other day General O'Duffy again told us that the people of this country were going to be given an opportunity to decide for themselves between a republic and a commonwealth.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SydneyBMinch" hpid="Mr. Minch Mr. Minch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Minch</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order. What has General O'Duffy got to do with this motion before the House?  I am one of the signatories to the motion and I have been waiting since March last to get a word in in connection with it, but I have not yet succeeded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of Deputies succeeded in getting in a good many words between my speech though they have not added much to the order of debate.  It will be welcome news to the more intelligent elements in the political life of this country to hear that General O'Duffy has got nothing to do with Deputy Minch.  I understood that the real head of the Opposition is a gentleman <Col N="1486" /> who disdains to enter the Dáil, possibly so long as the present members of the Opposition retain their membership of this Assembly.  Therefore, I must refer, in the course of this debate, to a gentleman who is not a member of this House, because I presume that none of his followers inside or outside of it would dare to say boo, much less put down a motion on the Order Paper, unless they had secured first of all the sanction of the great Pooh-Bah of their organisation.  I was pointing out that it has been alleged, in the course of the debate, that an easy and advantageous settlement of this dispute regarding the land annuities might be secured if it were not that we had allowed our attitude towards Great Britain to be biassed by political considerations. What has been our attitude in this matter?  We have always maintained that the people of this country have a right to determine for themselves what their international associations will be.  We have always contended that their choice in that regard must be a free and a voluntary one.  On every opportunity which we have had of discussing with the British Government the differences which are now at issue between us, we have asked only that, in regard to our own political future, our own political status, our own standing in the world of affairs, our people should be allowed to make a free and voluntary choice. On the last occasion on which this issue was raised between the two countries, it was raised by the President of the Executive Council asking the Secretary for Dominion Affairs in the British Government whether or not, if that issue were put to the people, the threat of war, which has hitherto hung over our heads, would be withdrawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I, as one who is exceedingly anxious that the relations between this country and Great Britain should be close and cordial, am very sorry to say that we were unable to get an unequivocal answer to that straight question.  It is the question which General O'Duffy himself and members of the Fine Gael Party must put to some British Government and some British Minister if they are ever returned to power and if they are ever <Col N="1487" /> to fulfil the promises and undertakings they are now giving as members of the Opposition.  General O'Duffy has said that the association of this country with Great Britain in the Commonwealth must be a free and voluntary one.  If that association is to be a free and voluntary one, then the people of this country must be left free and unfettered to decide whether they will declare for an Irish Republic or whether they will declare for the maintenance of our present status, or something equivalent to that status, within the Commonwealth.  We have never contended for more.  We are Republicans and, if we did go to the country, we would ask the people to declare for a Republic.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry.  I was saying, on the point as to the free choice of the people, that there is no longer any difference between Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil.  We are to have the Fianna Fáil tillage policy. We are to have the Fianna Fáil policy in regard to the land annuities.  We are to have the Fianna Fáil policy in regard to industrial development.  We are to have the Fianna Fáil policy in regard to the right of the people to exercise self-determination in respect to their own political status.  Now, as a result of the Fine Gael Ard-Fheis, Fine Gael is going to adopt the Fianna Fáil policy in regard to derating, because the Deputy who is primarily <Col N="1488" /> responsible for this motion and who has carried Deputy Minch into the realms of political extravaganza in which Deputy Belton continually moves and has his being moved an amendment dealing with derating. The Deputy must be a brave man if he wants to change an iota of anything that General O'Duffy has ever written or said.  It must seem to be flying in the face of Providential inspiration to differ with that great man even on such a matter as derating. At any rate, Deputy Belton moved an amendment from the County Dublin Executive that the time had come for complete derating of agricultural land. &ldquo;The time has come,&rdquo; said Deputy Belton, &ldquo;for the complete derating of agricultural land.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The time has come, the walrus said,</P>
      <P>To talk of many things;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Of lords,&rdquo; said Dick Mulcahy,</P>
      <P>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Cosgrave cried, &ldquo;of kings.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Of lords and ladies and other things, but not of complete derating.  Deputy Belton has grown older and wiser. Four or five years ago, if any person had asked Deputy Belton to observe the pledges of Party loyalty which he had given, to be true to his written bond and Deputy Belton had another idea in his mind, he would speedily have left that political Party.</P>

Deputy Belton moved, as an amendment from the County Dublin Executive, that the time had come for the complete derating of agricultural land.  It was a sad day for Deputy Belton when he moved that amendment, because Deputy Cosgrave headed the cohorts of Fine Gael and routed Deputy Belton upon that motion, so that complete derating of agricultural land is no longer a plank in the Fine Gael platform.  They, just <Col N="1489" /> as we, have realised that the most equitable way of helping the farmers is not by complete derating of agricultural land.</P>

With such a complete recantation of everything that they have professed hitherto to stand for, what reason have the Opposition for existing at all except possibly that they feel their mission in life &mdash; and look at their doleful and downcast faces! &mdash; is to make everybody look as blue as they feel blue.</P>

When I was speaking on this motion last week I referred to the activities of some of their leading members. I dealt at length with the strategic silence of Deputy Dillon on occasions and the more ill-considered statements of Deputy Belton.  I think I was making the point that these people, who are asking for an increase or who are condemning the Government for reducing the grants for the relief of rates on agricultural land, were themselves suborning people not to pay their rates, and I think I referred to a statement of Deputy Belton in which he said that if the farmers of this country had some backbone none of them would pay their rates and there would be a strike against the payment of rates.</P>

I should like to say, in regard to what Deputy Davin said, that we listened at great length to a debate which covered every possible field, and that when the Government Party had to put up speakers I rose when no other person offered.  Certainly I have not prevented any Deputy interested in this question, which touches other motions on the Order Paper&mdash;possibly that with which Deputy Davin is associated&mdash; from speaking because, if this motion were allowed to go by default, I suggest there would not be resources at the command of the Government which would help us to give sympathetic consideration to the other ones.</P>

      <P>I do not argue anything of the sort, but I would direct attention to the length of the speeches that were delivered covering a wide field, and that probably I may be the last speaker for the Government on this motion.  I had to deal, necessarily, with a multitude, I do not say of irrelevancies, but with a multitude of arguments, which appear to the Opposition to have some bearing on the motion.  I am disposing of them, and I am just going to refer to one other aspect of the case.  Undoubtedly the economic dispute with Great Britain could have been ended, if it had not been for the comfort and the succour which the Opposition Party had given to the other parties to the quarrel.  (<i>Interruption</i>).  Am I being fairly treated?  If it were not for the hopes which are being based on the activities of Deputy Belton, and those responsible for this motion, Deputy O'Higgins, Deputy Minch, and every member of the Opposition Party, who is engaged in undermining the democratic institutions in this country, that they would one day be in power, and that a settlement advantageous to Great Britain could be secured, as it had been already secured in regard to the <Col N="1496" /> Boundary, and other matters; as it was secured in regard to the miserable trifle of a railway debt of £800,000, for which our rights to the annuities would have been conceded by Deputy Cosgrave in 1923; if it were not for the hope that history would repeat itself, and the same pliable personalities would be entrusted with the conduct of the Irish people's affairs the British Government would long ago have come to a reasonable settlement with regard to this matter, and there would have been no necessity to have a motion &mdash; no excuse I should say, because there is not at the present moment any real necessity &mdash; there would not have been a shadow of excuse for a motion such as stands in the name of Deputy Belton on the Order Paper.  We should have resources with which to give practical effect not merely to the wishes and desires of the Labour Party in regard to No. 19 on the Order Paper but to give practical effect to the considered policy of the Government in that regard.  Therefore, sir, it is necessary for me to deal for just about five minutes longer with the activities of the Opposition Party in the country, activities which have prevented us from doing even more than we have done for the Irish farmer and the Irish people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was talking about their attempts to dislocate local services.  I was talking about the conspiracy which they have engendered to prevent the people from paying rates.  I was referring to statements which have appeared in the Press on the part of their leaders, their most responsible leaders.  I shall just refer to one typical example out of many that might be cited.  I refer to a photograph which was printed in a Dublin newspaper on November 8th last.  The nature of the picture can best be imagined from the title which was given to it in the paper as follows: &ldquo;Back from the fair with her cow unsold.  This Tipperary woman goes home to wait for the next fair day.&rdquo; That appeared on November 8th and on 25th November the same newspaper published in a comparatively obscure position as compared with the prominent position given to the <Col N="1497" /> photograph, the following: &ldquo;We are informed that the subject of the picture&rdquo;&mdash;which was published with the inscription to which I have referred &mdash;&ldquo;Mrs. P.J. Gardiner, Main Street, Cloughjordan, regards this description as a grievance since she was going with her cow, not to the fair, but to the pasture.  We desire, therefore, to correct the wrong impression and to express our regret for any annoyance which the description may have caused Mrs. Gardiner.&rdquo;  How mildly the editor has put it when he states that the lady concerned regards the description of the photograph as a grievance!  I say it was an outrage.  I say it was an outrage against the people of this State.  I am not going to say in that connection that the editor of the paper which published the photograph was personally responsible. I am perfectly certain from what I know of him that he would not knowingly be guilty&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>When this sort of thing was going on, while we were faced with mendacious attempts of this nature to undermine the morale of the people, to get the farmers to believe that their cattle were not saleable and city people to believe that the economic life of the country was being undermined, let the Deputies who were responsible for it and who have just endorsed it by their foolish laughter, hear what the Government was doing for the farmers of this country.  The value of what we have been doing can only be appraised and measured by what our predecessors did for the farmers.  I said last evening that we are condemned in this motion because in 1933-34, when so much more intensive <Col N="1498" /> constructive work was being done for the farmers than we had been able to get under way in 1932-3, we discontinued a special emergency grant of £250,000 which had been made in 1932-33 and slightly reduced the additional supplementary agricultural grant, making the total amount allocated for the relief of rates on agricultural land £1,750,000.  Now I should like in connection with that figure to draw the attention of this House to this vital and significant fact, that that £1,750,000 has not merely been voted for the relief of local authorities, but has actually been paid over to them.  A fair basis of comparison, therefore, between what we are doing, what we are providing by way of relief of rates in accordance with the terms of the motion, and what our predecessors did, is the amount of money that will be paid over to the local authorities in the present year as compared with what was actually paid over by the Cumann na nGaedheal Government in 1931-32.  The local authorities will receive from us £1,750,000.  The amount which the same authorities received from our predecessors during the last year that they were in office, when they were bidding as high as they dared for votes and found the electorate unbribeable&mdash; because no bribe or no promise would induce the Irish people to return Mr. Cosgrave to power again after having an experience of his Party for over ten years &mdash; in that year when they were bidding their highest the actual amount paid over by them to the local authorities in relief of rates on agricultural land was £1,812,000.  That is just £62,000 more than we are paying in relief of agricultural rates.</P>

      <P>The Deputy ought to have some regard for manners, and speak when he is spoken to.  I would like to emphasise this, because it is the sole point of advantage the Opposition has got out of the debate, in regard to relief of rates on agricultural land that, in 1931 and 1932, when conditions were easier, and it would be much easier for the Cosgrave Government to give more, they only gave £62,000 more than we gave in 1933-1934.  But we have not confined the relief we offered to the farmers merely to the relief of rates upon agricultural land.  We have not distributed all our relief in the way that Deputy Belton endeavoured to convince the Fine Gael Ard Fheis that it ought to be distributed, and which the good sense of the Ard Fheis rejected, that is by way of derating relief.  We have done more.  We reduced the land annuities by 50 per cent., which represents a net gain to the farming community&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In addition to the concession afforded by the reduction of land annuities I should like to remind Deputy Keating that the Exchequer has assumed full responsibility for the payment of the interest and sinking fund upon the £30,000,000 of land bonds issued to complete the operations under the Land Act of 1923, and have undertaken in regard to future transactions under the 1932 Land Act, similarly to meet the interest and sinking fund required for the service of these bonds, and at the same time it has reduced by 50 per cent. the annuities which under the original terms of the 1923 Act will be payable by those who bought out under that Act.  And this has got nothing whatever to do with the land annuities that were formerly paid to Great Britain but represents a voluntary assumption by the Exchequer of this country in order to provide additional relief to the farmers.  In addition to that, we have also provided for export bounties £2,350,000 per annum.  I know the farmers on the Opposition Benches will say that they do not get any benefit or advantage out of this export bounty.  I know Deputy <Col N="1501" /> Keating will say he knows shippers who do not get any advantage conferred upon them by that.  When we hear statements like that it must be obvious to everyone that the interests in this country concerned in the cattle trade are divided about that £2,350,000.</P>

      <P>I could deal very effectively with that last interruption because I notice that most of the dances run by the Fine Gael are jazz dances.  I was saying we reduced the land annuities by half, provided £2,350,000 for export bounties.  Then again, we have provided £100,000 for a milk scheme most of which comes from the farmers in the home market and a large portion of which is distributed to necessitous families in poor areas.  Then again, towards the development of the turf scheme we allocated £150,000 most of which is to be spent for the benefit of farmers.</P>

      <P>One seldom hears anything very relevant or intelligent from Deputy O'Leary.  I say this in regard to the £150,000 that we provided for the turf development scheme that every penny piece of it will be spent in the agricultural areas in the country. Under the Agricultural Produce (Cereals) Act we provide in this financial year which is just closing <Col N="1502" /> £56,670.  I think it is anticipated that we will more than double that in the next financial year.  For the purposes of the Agricultural Produce (Regulation of Exports) Act we are providing £18,443.  For other relief schemes for works carried out mainly in agricultural areas we are providing £250,000.</P>

      <P>Not more than three columns of General O'Duffy's speeches once a week in the newspapers &mdash; the cost of paper and printing.  Under the Old Age Pensions Act, 1932, we are giving to the agricultural population by way of increased old age pensions not less than £600,000.  The cost of the Act I should like to say is much more than that, but of the total amount of the increased burden which that Act has put upon the Exchequer not less than £600,000 is being spent in agricultural areas and is being paid to those who were formerly owners of substantial farms.  As a result of the concession granted last year in regard to Irish tobacco we have made it possible for the farmers to reap a clear profit at the lowest computation of not less than £100,000.  I suppose Deputies opposite will deny that that statement is true.  I do not hear any of them getting up to controvert it, because I have the facts to prove that it is true, among them this significant one, that a certain gentleman who was arrested with General O'Duffy in Westport and subsequently released, and who is a leading member of the organisation represented on the opposite benches, cleared a sum of almost £200 out of tobacco growing during the past year. In addition to the things I have recited we have taken steps this year to establish the sugar beet industry on a national scale, with the consequence that next year out of the beet crop alone farmers and rural workers generally will get between £600,000 and <Col N="1503" /> £700,000.  These are the solid and lasting things which we have done for the farmers.  Never in his whole history has the Irish farmer had a Government that has been so solicitous for his interests as this one has been.  The things that I have recited are incontrovertible. Let Deputy Belton when he replies deal if he can with any one of those statements or shake any one of those figures&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I would almost say more than they did in the whole of the four and a half years that preceded 1932 and those are figures upon which we stand.  Not merely have we done more than our predecessors did to relieve the agriculturist, not merely have we doubled what they did or trebled it, but we have more than quadrupled it.  Our achievement in that regard has been so colossal, has been done so quietly, so quickly, and so well, that people have not yet begun to realise the far-reaching changes that have been brought about.  In time even that section of the farmers who are now being misled by the misstatements of the Opposition will realise that in the doctrine of economic self-sufficiency lies their only hope in this world of over-production and under-consumption.</P>
      <P>I should like now, for a moment, to get back to the speech of Deputy Dillon.  I do not know whether I am being unfair to Deputy Belton, or whether I am unduly flattering Deputy Dillon, but my speech in this debate seems to be concerned with dealing with the arguments advanced by one or other of those Deputies.  I am sorry that Deputy Dillon is not here, because I am going to deal with the point which he made when he referred to taxation in this year as compared with taxation in 1928-1929.  I am going to concede immediately that it is quite true that taxation this year is heavier than it was then, but I am also going to make this point, that taxation is not to be justified, nor is it to be condemned, by a consideration merely of its magnitude.  The use to which taxation is put, the purpose for which the moneys collected from the people are employed &mdash; there is the real touchstone. In 1928-29 our predecessors collected £20,880,000 in tax revenue.  In this year's Budget we estimated that taxation would bring in about £22,046,000.  The difference about which Deputy Dillon was so doleful was £1,116,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cost of the additional provisions which we are making in excess of those made by our predecessors for agricultural <Col N="1505" /> purposes and for purposes from which the agricultural community will derive a large share of the benefit is, as I have already indicated, £6,326,000 and of this amount only £1,225,000, representing one-half of the cost of the bounties, is being raised by borrowing. The value of the increased benefits which we provide for farmers and their dependents in this year is almost five times the amount of the additional taxation which we have imposed.  Does Deputy Belton, who apparently is Deputy Dillon's understudy, or the Opposition Party, or do the farmer members of the Centre Party want us to drop the benefits and to reduce the taxation?  We have increased taxation admittedly by £1,116,000, but we have provided for the farmers additional benefits over and above what was provided in 1928-29, costing £6,326,000. Which leg is Deputy Belton going to stand on?  Deputy Dillon wants us to reduce taxation.  If we do we have to reduce the benefits also.  What does Deputy Belton want?</P>
    <P>How have we been able to do that? It seems, and it is, in fact, a remarkable achievement and we are entitled and the people of the country are entitled to ask how has it been done. In that connection I would like again to emphasise that it is not the amount of taxation but the purpose for which it is used that counts.  The Cumann na nGaedheal Government could not provide these increased benefits for the people; they could not afford to encourage wheat growing; they could not afford to induce the people to start the cultivation of tobacco; they could not provide the additional £600,000 for old age pensions going in to relieve the necessities of farmers' households; they could not afford to reduce the land annuities.  They were taxing the people, not to develop the bogs, not to maintain our dairying industry, not to encourage tillage, not to raise the standard of living here, not to make our people self-supporting and self-respecting, but to provide pensions for ex-R.I.C. men, to pay the land annuities to Great Britain and to fulfil the terms of the secret agreement of 1923.  There is the secret of our success. They taxed the people, taxed <Col N="1506" /> them admittedly for a lesser amount than we did, but of what they collected they sent a large share abroad.  If we impose taxes, at any rate we spend the proceeds here.</P>
    <P>I referred, when I was resuming my speech, to the very significant words of General O'Duffy, the leader of the Opposition, when he said: &ldquo;Do not take me too seriously.&rdquo;  I presume it is in that spirit, the spirit that at the present moment animates the Opposition Benches, that Deputy Dillon condemned us for increasing taxation, because in one breath he stated that the local rates should become a charge on the Central Fund and in the next breath he compared taxation in the present year with what it was in 1928-1929. At one moment he cries out that the burden of taxation is crushing and in the next moment, supporting this resolution, he clamours that we should increase it.  I can only say that Deputy Dillon is not sincere and that he, like his leader General O'Duffy, expects the House and the country not to take him too seriously.  Deputy Dillon knows pretty well that if the local rates were made a charge on the Central Fund the farmer would have to pay them by means of increased taxation.  There is no way out of that dilemma.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Leary, just as well as Deputy Dillon, knows that if we were to give effect to the policy that is behind this motion there would be no reduction in the aggregate burden.  It would simply mean that the people who could best afford to pay, the large ratepayers, would escape.  The gentlemen who drive to political meetings in motor-cars, the gentlemen who, when their household goods and chattels are seized, can write a cheque for more than twice the amount of the rates which before that they were proclaiming they could not afford to pay &mdash; these are the gentlemen who would escape if effect were given to the policy that is behind Deputy Belton's motion.  They would escape by having a large share of the burden, their own rightful obligation, transferred from them who are well-off to <Col N="1508" /> those who can less well afford to pay. That is what is behind the Deputy's motion.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon must not forget that he and his colleagues represent the larger landed interests in this country, the shopkeepers who own more land than they can work, and the graziers, who will not work the land they own. They represent the leisured agriculturists who have been leading a more or less parasitic existence in this country. If the rates are to be transferred to the Central Fund this class, as I have said, would be relieved of a large part of their legitimate burden, and what they throw off would be put by Deputy Dillon and the Party opposite, if they were in power, on the backs of the smaller farmers, the farm workers, the farm labourers, in the shape of increased taxation upon the necessaries of life.  Deputy Dillon's Party is the one class-conscious Party in this House.  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>
