      <P>Section 4, sub-section (2).  A new sub-section inserted before the sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  An issue of debentures shall not be made by an agricultural co-operative society under this <Col N="2580" /> section unless either the committee of such society has power under the rules of such society to borrow money and the amount to be borrowed on the security of such debentures is within such borrowing power or a resolution approving of the making of such issue has been passed by a special meeting of the shareholders of such society convened expressly for the purpose of considering and, if thought fit, passing such resolution.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That amendment was inserted by the Seanad because they had a certain anxiety that the committee of a co-operative society might issue debentures without having authority from the members of the society to borrow money.  As the amendment stands&mdash;and, in fact, as I am advised&mdash;no committee could issue debentures unless they had powers to borrow.  If they had powers to borrow, then it would be all right; but if they have no powers to borrow, then they must go to the society.</P>

      <P>As the Principal Act stands the Minister for Industry and Commerce has power to prohibit the import of wheat products.  Having done so he can then issue a licence to any particular person.  Up to this the practice has been to issue a licence for the import of wheat products that might be recommended by a medical adviser, but people coming into the country might have, say, a cake or half a cake in their baggage.  That has been extremely awkward up to the present, because the Revenue Commissioners had to confiscate such imports.  The purpose of the amendment is to allow such things to be brought in and also to allow a person inside the country to receive a present of a cake from a person outside the country.</P>

    <P>(a)  in the case of a compound feeding stuff not manufactured in Saorstát Eireann, there is printed on the package containing such compound feeding stuff or on a label securely affixed to such package the name and address of <Col N="2585" /> the manufacturer and a statement in the prescribed form that such compound feeding stuff was imported into Saorstát Eireann under a licence issued by the Minister for Agriculture, and</P>
    <P>(b)  in the case of a compound feeding stuff manufactured in Saorstát Eireann, there is printed, on the package containing such compound feeding stuff or on a label securely affixed to such package, a statement in the prescribed form that such compound feeding stuff was manufactured in Saorstát Eireann under a licence issued by the Minister for Agriculture and the number of such licence.</P>

      <P>I think the Minister might explain the difference between this amendment and the last one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the Principal Act we have power to compel the manufacturers of compound feeding stuffs to keep records.  That was an extremely difficult thing for those people to do because, in some cases, there might be ten or 12 different materials in the one compound of feeding stuffs.  It was very hard for them to keep complete records seeing that at the same time they might, for instance, be selling barley, and that barley might be one of the materials used in the manufacture. In the amending Bill that was brought before the Dáil that was changed.  We then only asked those registered as manufacturers of compound feeding stuffs to have the name attached to a sack of compound feeding stuffs on leaving the factory because, by analysis, we can trace it back to see that they are complying with the formula submitted.  We are not any longer enforcing the very strict keeping of records of the materials going into the feeding stuffs because we can at any time see if they are keeping to the formula which they have submitted and which is licensed by my Department.  The question then arose of one compound feeding stuff manufacturer getting another compound feeding stuff manufacturer to do another part of the process <Col N="2586" /> for him.  If the amending Bill were to remain as it left the Dáil, that would have to be disclosed.  We are now only asking for the licence number of the other compound feeding stuff manufacturer which the Department knows and which the public are not interested in.  That gets over the difficulty of one compound feeding stuff manufacturer getting another compound feeding stuff manufacturer to do a part of the process for him.  A foreign manufacturer will still have to give the full name of the manufacturer as well as a statement relating to the licence under which he is allowed to import.</P>

    <P>New section.  Before Section 65, and in Part V, a new section inserted as follows:&mdash;<Col N="2587" /> 65.  &mdash;(1) Whenever a milling (composite flour) order is in force, it shall not be lawful for any registered flour importer to sell any imported wheaten flour unless such wheaten flour is sold to another registered flour importer, the holder of a milling licence or the Minister or such wheaten flour is sold under and in accordance with a licence issued by the Minister under this section.</P>
    <P>(2)  If any registered flour importer acts in contravention of this section such registered flour importer shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to the penalties mentioned in Part I of the Schedule to this Act.</P>
    <P>(3)  Where a registered flour importer acts in contravention of this section such registered flour importer shall, for the purposes of Section 61 of the Principal Act, as amended by this Act, be deemed to have acted in contravention of the Principal Act, and the said Section 61, as so amended, shall apply and have effect accordingly.</P>
    <P>(4)  An offence under this section may be prosecuted by or at the suit of the Minister as prosecutor.</P>
    <P>(5)  The Minister may on the application of a registered flour importer grant to such importer a licence expressed to authorise such importer, subject to compliance with such conditions as he thinks fit to impose, to sell imported wheaten flour to a specified person without limit as to time or quantity or either of them or within a specified time or in a specified quantity.</P>
    <P>(6)  Every licence granted under this section to a registered flour importer shall operate to authorise such importer, subject to compliance with such conditions (if any) as may be specified therein, to sell imported wheaten flour to the person specified therein either (as may be specified therein) without limit as to time or quantity or either of them or within a specified time or in a specified quantity.</P>

These sections are now being removed to another part of the Bill and will only come into operation whenever a mixing order is made.

      <P>I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment No. 7:&mdash;</P>
      <P>New section.  Before Section 10 a new section inserted as follows:&mdash; 10.&mdash;(1) It shall not be lawful for any person to carry on in any premises or place whatsoever other than registered slaughtering premises the business of slaughtering cattle for sale for human consumption in Saorstát Eireann or the business of slaughtering sheep for sale for human consumption in Saorstát Eireann or the business of slaughtering both cattle and sheep for sale for human consumption in Saorstát Eireann.</P>
      <P>(2) It shall not be lawful for any person to carry on in any premises or place whatsoever other than registered victualling premises the business of selling beef, veal, mutton, and lamb, or any of them.</P>
      <P>(3)  Every person who shall carry on any business in contravention of this section shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to a fine not exceeding £50 or, at the discretion of the court, to imprisonment for any term not exceeding three months or to both such fine and such imprisonment.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask if this amendment is going to affect persons in country districts, who, as a result of the small prices obtaining for cattle and sheep, have begun on their own farm premises the slaughter of cattle and sheep and the retailing of the meat in the neighbouring towns.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, this has nothing to do with that.  As a matter of fact, although the Bill did lay down certain regulations with regard to people registering and prescribed penalties for contravention of the Act and so on, there was nothing in the Bill compelling a person to register before he can carry on business.  This section does make it quite clear that a person in the business of slaughtering cattle or selling meat must be registered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The section which the Minister proposes to insert here would appear to apply to a farmer who, on his own farm, had undertaken the slaughter of sheep, the treatment of the carcases as a butcher, and the retailing of the meat either to his neighbours or in some of the neighbouring towns.  As that is so, a farmer would be prevented under this section from carrying on that business. I should like to ask if the Minister has taken that into consideration, and whether farmers, generally, who have undertaken, or whom the economic circumstances in the country may drive into undertaking, the treatment of their cattle in that particular way, will automatically get a licence to carry on both the slaughter of animals on their farm premises and the retailing of the meat?</P>

      <P>And, of course, the Minister is aware that there are other Acts governing slaughter houses.  He cannot give a licence in respect of a ramshackle place for the slaughtering of animals.  It is the local authority administers these Acts, and once it becomes a recognised slaughtering place under this Act, other Acts will start to operate by which certain requirements must be met, so that the Minister cannot say he believes that if a person slaughters ten sheep, he becomes a slaughterer of animals.  It would be interesting to know at what point a man becomes a recognised slaughterer of animals.  I take it from my reading of this that if he kills one sheep and offers one pound of it for sale, he is in the business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

      <P>That is quite right. With regard to what Deputy Belton has said, sub-section (3) of Section 10 states that we cannot register unless the premises comply with all the relevant regulations and by-laws made by the local sanitary authority. He must comply with those first before we can register him.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister is not recommending this for our adoption?  Who is to decide whether he has committed an offence?  Most of the provisions of this Bill provide for dealing with offences in court and where they are not dealt with in court, I presume the Minister has not a second category in which he would file a number of commissions of offences for which people were not prosecuted?  If it is to be amended in this fashion, it would follow that if the Minister kept a file of commissions of offences in respect of which no convictions in court were obtained penalties would operate which I do not think the Minister had in mind.  I think the words &ldquo;has been convicted of&rdquo; were more in accordance with the general acceptance of a court decision than merely the commission of offences.  I presume that quite a number of offences of one sort or another are committed in respect of which no convictions in court are obtained.  Will it be considered then that if a complaint is made in respect of any departure from grace on the part of a butcher or farmer or any other person concerned in this Bill, or if there is a list on which there is a complaint regarding <Col N="2595" /> the commission of an offence, the licence will be withdrawn?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is rather an interesting history connected with this section.  In the Acts which dealt with agricultural produce&mdash;the Eggs Act and so on&mdash;passed by the previous Government, of which Deputy Cosgrave was the head, the wording that I am proposing to adopt now is the wording that was used.  It is the wording in the Eggs Act, the Dairy Produce Act and the Fresh Meat Act.  When the Cereals Act was being drafted, I told the draftsman that I thought that wording was too drastic and that I did not agree with the Cumann na nGaedheal Government in being so drastic.  The draftsman changed the wording then to its original form here, in order to allow the courts to determine these charges, but, from experience, we found that the Cumann na nGaedheal Government were right for once, and we had to bring in an amendment to the Cereals Act to deal with the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People who commit an offence under these Acts, and who are, perhaps, making a good profit out of it, are quite prepared to continue the offence while we are preparing to bring them into court, which takes about six months.  They may make quite a lot of money in the meantime.  We found from experience that we had to amend the Cereals Bill.  It was amended in this House and even by the Seanad. When I explained the position in regard to the present Bill, the Seanad unanimously agreed that it should be changed.  I thought that there was, perhaps, much more reason to have these drastic powers in the Cattle Bill than in any of the other Acts because any offence, if prolonged under this Bill, might have very disastrous consequences. Very big profits might be made from an offence under the free meat scheme for instance.  The person who was committing the offence would probably have regard to the fact that it would take us some time to bring him into court, that there could be an appeal from the decision of the court, and possibly another appeal after that.  He would probably calculate <Col N="2596" /> that it would take us six months to get the conviction we sought and in the meantime a lot of damage might be done.  Under the next amendment, however, the Minister may hold an enquiry if he is requested to do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>It might be better if the Minister, in considering a measure of this sort would remember the fact that this is a Bill of the Oireachtas as a whole and will be an Act of Parliament eventually, not an Act of either the Fianna Fáil or the Cumann na nGaedheal Governments.  The whole of the Parliament is responsible for the Act.  It is a responsibility that we all share and that we should shoulder.  We have not got any of the Acts which the Minister mentioned before us at the moment, but I should like to see the particular clause in them on which the Minister is relying Certain businesess are being regimented under this Act and power is being taken to deprive a man of his business completely by an act of the administration&mdash;a political act.  That is a very great power to take under any circumstances.  I have very grave doubts that any such power was taken under the previous Acts.  The Minister may at any time alter or cancel the registration of any premises.  A man may have been in business for 40 or 50 years.  He is suddenly called upon under this Bill to fill up a great number of forms.  In fact his business premises becomes, as was said in the Seanad, something like a distiller's or a brewer's premises.  If he makes a mistake in respect of one of these forms he has committed an offence. He may make one or two or three mistakes and the whole of his business may be destroyed.  The only saving feature is that inquiry may be instituted, but let us understand about this inquiry.  The Department which makes the complaint is the Department that is going to hold the inquiry. They are both the prosecutors and the judge.</P>

      <P>The Minister adopted a very different attitude when dealing with the cost of production of cereals. He promised to fix a price, allowing a margin of profit.  Is he not aware that beef and mutton are really the market for the cereals, and that the export price regulates the price of beef and mutton.  Follow that back.  The price of beef and mutton must regulate and standardise the price of cereals or the whole scheme cracks up.  The Minister said that he cannot guarantee what I am asking him to do.  I want to emphasise this aspect of the question. The Minister fixes the price of cereals at a certain figure in order, as he alleges, to make tillage pay.  Will the Minister fix a price for beef and mutton that will pay the cost of the cereals used, the labour involved and leave a little margin of profit?  If he does not do that, I say, without fear of contradiction, that the whole scheme of fixing prices for cereals and beef and mutton is a farce.  Will the Minister fix a standard price for beef and mutton which will pay the cost of production and leave a little profit. Let us get away from Great Britain for once.  The-export-market, according to the Minister, should not regulate the price of our beef and mutton.  I suggest that the price is going to be regulated by the export market, &ldquo;which has gone for ever, thank God.&rdquo;  The British market will dictate in connection with all these matters the Minister has been talking of in relation to these two Bills.  It is the British market price that is going to rule the price of our agricultural produce right down the line.</P>

      <P>I am at a loss to understand why the Minister accepted this amendment at all.  The Minister, evidently, intends to fix the price at the export price.  Any regard the Minister will have to the cost of production will <Col N="2602" /> only arise if, by any chance, the export price is greater than the cost of production. In that event, the Minister might like to save money by reducing the price.  Otherwise, the Minister's regard for the cost of production means nothing.</P>

I have explained it on several occasions and any person taking an interest in the Bill who wanted to understand it would understand it by now.  The price must be fixed on the export value.  As this Bill is framed, we cannot fix it otherwise.  Whether we can raise the export price by other means, is another question but the price must be based on the export value.  As regards cost of production, when that amendment was being inserted, I told the mover and the Seanad, as a whole, that I was quite prepared to have regard to the cost of production but that I did not see it could in any way influence the fixing of the price under this Bill.</P>

      <P>Beef and mutton are the export of your cereals.  Have you not got that in yet?  Cattle, pigs and poultry are the market for our cereals and the price of poultry, eggs, beef, mutton and pork standardises the price of cereals precisely as the export market standardises the price of beef and mutton.  The Minister has admitted that he cannot have regard to the cost of production in fixing the price of beef and mutton; that he must base his standard price on the wholesale price.  We agree, and we are glad the Minister is learning. Similarly, he cannot have regard to the cost of the production of cereals. The price of cereals is based on the price of beef, mutton, eggs and poultry and the price of these is, in turn, based on the export market. Carry that down the line and we find that the price of beef, mutton, eggs, poultry, pork and cereals, except the amount of cereals used for human consumption, is based on the export market.</P>

The Ottawa agreements had nothing to do with the dispute.  Under the Ottawa agreements, New Zealand was entitled to export 400,000 cwts. of frozen or chilled beef to Great Britain in 1933.  She actually exported 700,000 cwts., which is, probably, the equivalent of 50,000 head of cattle.  This year she is exporting to Great Britain the equivalent of 100,000 head of cattle.

      <P>New section.  Before Section 26, and in Part V, a new section inserted as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>26.&mdash;(1)  Every registered proprietor of registered victualling premises who procures the slaughter of any cattle or sheep in any premises or place whatsoever other than registered slaughtering premises shall be guilty of an offence under this sub-section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The first impression one gets after reading this amendment is that it is out of order.  If you look at the Title of the Bill, you observe that it is an Act to make provision for the regulation and control of the slaughter of cattle and sheep for human consumption.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite understand. Anyhow, that was my first impression. If the Minister means the case of an animal damaged on a railway line or on the road&mdash;that it cannot be slaughtered on the spot&mdash;it is ridiculous. Surely it is not intended that animals when injured should be brought to a slaughterhouse to be slaughtered?  This amendment runs: &ldquo;Every registered proprietor of registered victualling premises who procures the slaughter of any cattle or sheep in any premises or place whatsoever...&rdquo; Surely it is not the Minister's intention to prevent the slaughter of injured animals except in a slaughterhouse?  As I read this amendment, that is what it would seem to mean.  If the Minister means that registered proprietors cannot slaughter and sell ordinary cattle for human consumption, that ought to be stated. This is open to two or three interpretations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy might have read the Title in full, but that point has been ruled out.  This new section applies to a victualler getting cattle slaughtered in a non-registered premises or a premises removed from the register.  It compels him to get the animals slaughtered on registered <Col N="2607" /> premises.  Section 25 (3) provides for cattle that are suffering pain caused by injury or disease and, if they are slaughtered in order to avoid unnecessary suffering, they are exempt.  There is provision there for exempting cattle injured or suffering from disease.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister observe this, that that refers to individuals, but this specifically precludes persons who are registered proprietors?  In the other case it is a person who has not a licence, but in this case it would appear that a proprietor of a registered victualling premises cannot do it.  Why were the words &ldquo;for human consumption&rdquo; left out of this?  I take it that is what was intended.  Those words are in practically every other part of the Bill.  The Seanad put in quite a number of amendments, I suppose on the Minister's suggestion regarding that point, and I would like to know why the words are left out of this.  Was it simply through inadvertence?</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

      <P>Section 37, sub-section (6).  A new sub-section inserted before the sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(6)  Whenever the Minister lends money under this section, he shall, within one month after making such loan, cause to be published in the <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> a notice stating the <Col N="2611" /> fact of the making of such loan and also stating all material particulars of such loan.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister proposes to give notice in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> of moneys lent under this section, but he takes power to vary the terms under which the advances are to be paid in future.  He also takes power to compound for in respect of moneys already lent.  Are we to understand from the Minister that it is proposed, where money has been lent, that all the details will be inserted in <i>Iris Oifigiúil,</i> but that when the terms are varied in respect of any transaction there will be no notice in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> as regards that; and that when moneys lent are compounded for there will be no notice in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>?  It would seem as if the insertion in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> is intended to be a record of the circumstances under which money was lent under this section, and it should also be indicated when there is a change in the terms under which the money is repaid, and when moneys lent are compounded for.</P>

      <P>I move that the committee agree with the Seanad in amendment No. 43:&mdash;</P>
      <P>New section.  Before Section 48 a new section inserted as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>48.  &mdash;(1)  It shall not be lawful for any person who is not for the time being a recipient to apply for or to receive a beef voucher.</P>
      <P>(2)  Every person who applies for or receives or applies for and receives a beef voucher in contravention of this section shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to a fine not exceeding two pounds or, at the discretion of the court, to imprisonment for any term not exceeding fourteen days.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to hear from the Minister the reason for putting in this extraordinary new section.  The Bill provides that a recipient, as defined in Section 39, is a person who is in receipt of unemployment assistance or home assistance, or of both such unemployment assistance, or and outdoor relief.  The amendment provides that it shall not be lawful for any person other than those in receipt of home assistance or unemployment assistance to apply for any of the free beef which it is proposed to distribute. These people are going to be liable to a fine of £2 or imprisonment not exceeding 14 days if they do so.  When this part of the Bill was discussed in the Dáil previously, the Minister appreciated the fact that there were people, other than those in receipt of home assistance, whose condition would entitle them to unemployment assistance, and who might be in such circumstances as would warrant them receiving some of this meat.  The Minister accepted an amendment that made it possible to extend the provisions of the Bill to persons other than those mentioned.  Surely the Minister does not mean to suggest that in any area where people are in poor circumstances the very fact of applying for some of the free beef should render them liable to a fine not exceeding £2 or to imprisonment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a clause in the previous section under which the court may impose a fine not exceeding £5 or imprisonment on any person who shall be guilty of bartering the beef vouchers.  I suppose the normal distribution of this beef would be about three lbs., which would be worth about 9d. or 1/-, as was stated in the Seanad. Under that section a person would be liable to a fine of £5 for an offence committed under it.  In the majority of cases the persons receiving this meat do not understand the law, and it would be a hardship if they were to be hauled before a court for a technical offence. How does the present amendment affect a recipient?  He must make an application at some time.  Surely it is not intended to debar any persons who <Col N="2614" /> might apply.  I take it it is not the Minister's intention that such persons would be liable to a fine of 40/- for making application.  Will the fact of applying qualify for prosecution? Surely not.  If persons who think they are entitled to beef vouchers make application, does that render them liable to prosecution?  I do not think that was the Minister's intention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are only two classes who are recipients but, under Section 39, the Minister may by order include any other classes.  Sub-section (2) says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The Minister may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, at any time by order declare any particular class or description of necessitous persons to be recipients for the purpose of this part of this Act....</P>
      <P>If there is any other class, whoever they may be, in need of free meat they can be made recipients by order, and once they are recipients they are entitled to the meat.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>My point is that the Minister cannot get any information that would enable him to take a decision under sub-section (2) of Section 39, except people go to where the beef vouchers are given out and ask for them.  There is an implication that there are other classes than those receiving home assistance and unemployment assistance who might be entitled to free beef, because of their circumstances.  If these people exist, the natural way they will show up is by approaching those who have the giving out of the beef vouchers.  The Minister proposes to put a section into the Bill now which would make persons who make such an approach guilty of an offence and liable to a fine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of Deputy Cosgrave's remarks, it is quite obvious that a person who thinks he is genuinely entitled to free meat, and who applied to the relieving officer or the unemployment officer and is told he is not entitled, would not be guilty of an offence.  As the Bill stood, supposing a person did succeed in getting a voucher from, if you like, some corrupt <Col N="2615" /> officer, nothing could be done to him without having this section in the Bill.  Such an officer might do a very big trade in the giving out of beef vouchers to people who were not entitled to them.  As Deputies will realise, it is not always possible to catch the persons at that stage.  It may be only possible to catch them actually coming in and applying for the vouchers.  It is useful, therefore, to have the power even to bring them to court for applying for the voucher when it is plain that they knew they were not entitled.  As to the classes referred to, the necessitous people who are as badly off as those in receipt of home assistance or unemployment assistance, who genuinely come along asking to be included, I am sure no District Justice would inflict a penalty on such people.  It is only where there is fraud intended.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Assuming what the Minister says is correct, let us go a step further.  A corrupt officer advises, let us say, me to apply, and I apply, having been told by that officer that he will give it to me.  I am the person who is punished, while the person really responsible is the officer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>If you have not got some means of dealing with him in this Bill, I doubt very much that you can deal with him under anything else.  This is not co-ordinated with the poor law&mdash;it is something over and above it&mdash;unless amendment No. 34, which deals with the Minister for Local Government and states: &ldquo;if made with the concurrence of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health may impose on relieving officers and assistance officers the duty of distributing beef vouchers to recipients who are in receipt of outdoor relief or home assistance,&rdquo; covers it.  I have very great doubt that it imposes anything else but that duty. The Minister is responsible for whatever other duties he performs in connection with poor law administration, but this is not poor law.  It is not co-ordinated <Col N="2616" /> with the Poor Law Acts. If the real sinner in the case is the official, I do not believe you will be able to catch him under this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister intimated that he did not really mean the penalty for the persons who apply&mdash; that he really intended it in the case of officers who were themselves committing offences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>In any case, as far as officers are concerned, the only officer who would be likely to bring to the Minister's notice that a certain person had applied for beef without being qualified would be an officer who is doing his duty.  Therefore, the officer would not do it in any case.  That is beside the point, however.  When we were discussing the Bill some of us on this side of the House suggested to the Minister that there were other classes outside the two classes mentioned deserving of free beef and the Minister said that he would make provision for it.  He stated a moment ago that he has taken power to include any other classes.  Until he does that certain people will be in a very dangerous position.  Somebody suggested that the recipients of relief from the St. Vincent de Paul Society should be included in this Bill.  They are not so far.  Until the Minister does declare them one of the classes that come under the Bill the mere fact of any of these people applying to anybody for free beef or for any of the other purposes dealt with by the Bill will make them liable to a fine of £2.  The Minister may take a long time to define them.  Until the Minister sets up something that they will come under any unfortunate person who applies to anybody for free beef is liable to a penalty of £2.</P>

    <P>(3)  The Act of 1924 shall, for the purposes of this section, be deemed not to apply to a person to whom that Act in fact applies but in respect of whom the Minister is satisfied either that because of such person <Col N="2619" /> having served in the Forces he did not apply for a certificate of military service under the said Act or that such person was refused such certificate because of his having been sentenced to imprisonment or penal servitude in respect of an act done by him in the execution of his duty as a member of the Forces.</P>

      <P>1.  Section 4.  A new sub-section added at the end of the section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(3)  The Civil Service Regulation Acts, 1924 and 1926, shall not apply to any person employed or appointed by the Minister under this section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Certain persons will be employed in connection with this enterprise in the same manner as those employed in ordinary commercial firms.  The provisions of the Civil Service Acts such as including sanction of the Minister for their appointment or dismissal shall not apply. <Col N="2623" /> Obviously in a concern of this kind such conditions could not obtain.</P>

      <P>Does this amendment in any way lessen, or reduce the Minister's authority for seeing that the persons employed in this undertaking will not be foreigners?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Not in the least.  It is not clear from the terms of the Schedule of the Civil Service Regulation Act, 1924, that persons employed as workers in these distilleries would be exempt from the operations of the Act as certain persons in that Schedule are exempt.  Consequently, in the appointment of those persons, the requirements of the Minister for Finance would have to be followed, and his sanction obtained for the appointment of workers or for their dismissal.  Obviously that would be an impracticable way of running a business of this kind.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>New section.  Before Section 18 a new section inserted as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>18.&mdash;The Minister shall cause to be kept, in respect of the undertaking, all proper and usual accounts, in such form as shall be approved of by the Minister for Finance, of all moneys received or expended by him.</P>
