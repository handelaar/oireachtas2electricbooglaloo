      <P>Last might when we adjourned we were dealing with the question of the re-Vote of £130,000, which is ascertained to be the amount which was got out of the first large Unemployment Fund for the purpose of financing without unnecessary delay the preparation of new works.  The Vote for 1934-35 consists of: (a) re-Vote '33-'34, £130,000; (b) £120,000, Public Health and Miscellaneous Works, and (c) £100,000, Drainage of Bogs, etc.  Both those terms&mdash;Public Health and Miscellaneous Works and Drainage of Bogs&mdash; are intended to be terms of the widest possible interpretation.  If you deduct that £130,000 it leaves £220,000 available for new works, and this has been provisionally allocated between the different Departments.  I may tell the House what the allocation is, but the difficulty is that there is a tendency to regard these as in some sense cast-iron agreements.  In the allocation of the money between the Votes it is quite impossible at this stage to be definite, because the actual final allocation depends entirely on the time factor in getting them into operation, and the relative suitability of the different works put forward by the different Departments to deal with the interests of the different areas.  In the allocation and administration of the new Vote this year it is proposed, generally speaking, to follow the practice <Col N="472" /> of previous years.  It is rather a pity that, out of the 9,000 or 10,000 proposals which have been put forward from every possible source in the country, nothing of an original character has been suggested.  As the House is aware, we are considering the whole question of public works, and what can be done over a period in relation to this problem.  The fact is that they will take in a much wider ambit than the schemes which necessarily come under an <i>ad hoc</i> Vote in a particular year, and as they are to be considered as things which may go on from year to year it is probable that the ambit of the work to be done will be very considerably increased. If anyone has any original idea on the subject, if anyone knows of some really useful fundamental work which has both a high labour content in it and will give really economic value in return for the money spent, all I can say is that this is a very receptive Department.  We should be very glad to have the information, to acknowledge its source, and to express our gratitude for any help we can get in the matter.  Suitable schemes will be selected from those received from various departments and, as I say, from other sources, in order, as far as possible, to avoid overlapping of grants and secure that the fund will be equitably distributed.</P>
      <P>Arrangements have had to be made that schemes must be lodged in good time.  For instance, we started to make out minor relief schemes for next winter in January of this year.  It was necessary to go over the whole of the existing material which we had and, out of the material which had already been vetted, selected and judged, to pick out, as far as possible, the works required in particular areas.  In so doing we were surprised to find that there were quite a number of areas which had claims to relief on their merits for which, out of the whole mass of that material, we had not received schemes.  That gap has now been filled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The selected works will, as a rule, be carried out during the winter, when unemployment may be supposed to be at the maximum.  Peat development <Col N="473" /> and marine works, however, may sometimes be exceptional in this respect. Marine works, as Deputies know, in some cases have to be done when both tide and weather will allow.  In some cases, it is quite impossible to do the marine works which we want to do during the rough winter weather.  For that reason, we have to do them in the milder portion of the year.  This is not greatly against them, because minor marine works are generally done in areas in which you are not dealing with an unemployment distress problem, but a poverty distress problem.  From my experience now in going over the whole of these things, I am satisfied that in no place in the whole of this country is there any problem in relation to unemployment whose intensity is of the same measure as the distress problem due to the permanent poverty of a very considerable portion of our people.</P>
    <P>Peat development also falls on the same lines.  When we were concentrating entirely on using our money during the period when it was most desirable from the point of view of unemployment relief, that is the cold, wet, hard winter months, when poverty is a very acute misery, we were up against the difficulty that it was not the right or profitable time in which to develop bogs.  We can put, and did put, good economical roads into bogs for the purpose of enabling people to get to their own turbary.  That had to be done during that time.  Due to the fact that there is behind these bog roads an amazing, an almost unbelievable enthusiasm, energy and enterprise on the part of those who would benefit by them, the physical defect of attempting to do that during that period was considerably overcome.</P>
    <P>As to the general question of the use and relative value of the relief works we are doing, from an inspection of some hundreds of them I have come to this opinion.  If I go on a job for which I know £100 has been allocated and I find that for that money as much as I could possibly expect to get for £150 in commercial work has been done, then I am perfectly satisfied that, whatever other thing can be said for or against that work, it is intrinsically <Col N="474" /> valuable.  That, in my experience, is the best criterion of the integral value of the work.  I have seen some work done on which there was an amazing output of value for the money.  In other cases, I have found the contrary. That is my general criterion at the moment.  For that reason, we were able during the bad winter months to do development work of the character I speak of where it simply meant enabling a man to get to his turbary.  But, where it came to the wholesale development of peat for the purpose purely and simply of commercial use, then the problem altered. It is necessary in these cases, where possible, to do the work at a period of the year in which the work itself can be most efficiently and economically done and that is during the dry period of the year.  In addition to that there is the Peat Development Section which has a very definite programme of output which requires to be met during the next year.  We cannot put off the doing of the necessary work of preparation until it is convenient purely and simply from the unemployment impact point of view I think some 73 schemes altogether were carried out by the Peat Development Section up to the present at a cost of £24,000.  I think that every peat development scheme put forward up to the present has either been completed or is now in active operation.</P>
    <P>Owing to the pressure of work which has been occasioned by the bringing into operation of the Unemployment Assistance Act, the local labour exchanges have been going through a very bad time and they have been subjected to very great pressure.  They have decided, I hope temporarily, to change the system under which men for relief schemes were found from the labour exchanges.  In practice the labour exchanges have been available in different degrees and with different degrees of efficiency both in relation to the different class of work which was done and in relation to the time. There has been a gradual improvement in the operations, for instance, in relation to public health work and in relation to road work, especially so in the eastern division of the Saorstát <Col N="475" /> where unemployment registration was common; in ordinary practice the system of recruitment which is now being changed was satisfactory.</P>
    <P>As the House will remember, one of the actions of the present Government was to intensify registration&mdash;to make extraordinary efforts to see that the people who previously had not been in a position to register should register.  The result was that the registration figures of somewhere about 30,000 under the old régime were raised to somewhere about 100,000. This increase in registration took place practically entirely in the western districts of Ireland.  I may mention that for the information of the Dáil maps were made showing the density of unemployment registration as distinct from unemployment.  There was a complete revolution in the contour and appearance of these maps after the intensification of the registration.  In fact, the map looked like a map of the congested districts of Ireland.  In the first place, in those districts, the people had not been accustomed to registration, and, in the second place, the particulars of registration&mdash;I mean the particulars in relation to individuals&mdash;were not closely or personally known at the beginning to the labour exchanges.  In fact, for a few months the labour exchanges in the western districts were completely snowed under and very specially so in relation to the minor relief works, where you desire to see strictly local men on the job. In these cases the labour exchanges were practically useless.</P>
    <P>Gradually as time went on, the labour exchanges improved enormously in that matter and we were able to hand over county by county. From the beginning we used the labour exchanges in the eastern counties, and as time went on, county by county, we were able to hand over &mdash;and we were enthusiastically anxious to hand over&mdash;to the labour exchanges all control in the matter of taking on the men.  We had hoped that this year that process of transfer would have been practically completed. <Col N="476" /> Unfortunately, due to the pressure which is now on the Department and for which I frankly recognise there is a legitimate reason or excuse at the moment for taking work of that kind off them, we have now had to go back to the system of appointment by officials who will be controlling the individual works. The regulation in relation to that matter is that applicants who are in receipt of unemployment assistance are to receive preference over those who are not; and every effort will be made to secure that those longest unemployed will be the first to be engaged.  The local labour exchanges will assist by giving any information in their possession with regard to applicants who are in receipt of unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>In regard to the applicants, 75 per cent. of the vacancies are to be given to married men and 25 per cent. to single men.  I hope myself that the new system is temporary, and that we will eventually get back to the position in which the central association of the employment exchanges will be able to take over this work again.</P>
    <P>In the detailed distribution of the relief works, grants will be made in proportion to the needs of each area as far as they can be ascertained; and due regard will be had to the desirability of providing work where possible for able-bodied men who are in receipt of unemployment assistance under the new Act.  The sum provided this year for this purpose is £1,186,000. In allocating the funds a broad distinction will be made between county boroughs and urban districts on the one hand and rural areas on the other.</P>
    <P>The relief problem in the cities and towns of the Saorstát is one of unemployment, and the largest element in dealing with that at the present moment is, undoubtedly, the huge scheme of house building which is going on.  Where that is not sufficient we use for the purpose of giving employment the local government machinery of sewerage and waterworks, roads and schemes of that kind.  The only two types of work yet discovered which can be put immediately and <Col N="477" /> flexibly into operation to deal with what you might call emergency states of unemployment are what we now know broadly as minor relief schemes and road work.  Both of these are organised in such a way that you can practically, at any time, throw a whole lot of men into them.  But to do a very large amount of work of that kind, I mean a large amount of work considerably in excess of the amount that we are now spending in an area, the thing cannot be continuous and economic.  In the rural areas the problem is twofold. You have unemployment amongst the agricultural labourers as such and you have what I regard as altogether a greater and more overwhelming problem, that is poverty.  The extent of this poverty amongst large numbers of agricultural producers is amazingly unbelievable.</P>
    <P>What we have done as far as relief is concerned in these districts I have already told the House.  We tried to get a mathematical basis, but all mathematical bases built on human affairs are fallible.  But we try to do all we can to correct this by the experience which we ourselves have and the experience which we get from members of the House.  We took out the valuation of every single rural electoral area and we divided that valuation by its agricultural population. By that we got a valuation per head of the population and from that we derived a poverty factor.  We then divided out the minor relief fund between all these electoral areas, without any regard to any other consideration, as to about 75 per cent. of the total amount available on the basis of that poverty factor, multiplied by the population of the area which was concerned. You have now a position in which you have simply a list of electoral areas. Behind those you have a definite money allocation, calculated on that basis as belonging to the electoral area.  We went through the works we had and we selected the work which in itself was most suitable and which came as near as we could manage it within the limits, allowing a certain latitude necessary one way or the other.  As far <Col N="478" /> as the balance of the fund was concerned, we distributed it over the areas largely in proportion to the number of unemployed agricultural labourers existing in those areas. Out of these two factors we got a formula by which, I should say, at least 90 per cent. of the total of the minor relief fund is automatically allocated in an equitable manner.</P>
    <P>Everybody knows that any formula of this kind, while it is very nice and scientific, does not take into account all considerations.  We have regarded the figures as ones which stood subject to criticism by anyone who had a better knowledge.  Where a case was put up that a particular area was more necessitous than our calculation would show, we have gone into it simply and solely as a problem to be decided on its merits.  If it were shown, as in quite a few cases it was shown, that our calculation was vitiated by the fact that out of 100 or 200 holders in a particular area two or three of them held three-quarters of the land&mdash;in other words, if it was shown that the calculation was vitiated by the lack of average in the size of the holding, that would then be taken into account. I am putting this matter to the House in this fashion so that they will understand that in administering the funds which have been given to us in trust to administer we are trying to find a basis which will be reasonable and fair.  If anyone can find a better basis I should like to hear of it.  We have put up for two years maps showing the whole detailed distribution, the distribution of every penny of the fund, geographically and otherwise.  It may be that with the very best wish in the world we have not succeeded in distributing that money fairly, either as between the counties or as between different portions of the counties.  If those Deputies who have closer personal knowledge than I have of the necessities of the particular areas will go over those maps and point out to us where we have failed to meet the necessities which they know of in the distribution, we will be very glad to take their suggestions into consideration <Col N="479" /> and use them in the further development of the schemes.</P>
    <P>The principal kinds of relief which we have indulged in are peat development schemes, reclamation of land, afforestation, mineral exploration and development, minor marine works and minor relief schemes.  Peat schemes of a commercial character were instituted and I think the one stroke of genius in the peat development scheme was the flat rate on rail.  By arrangement with the railways they were prepared to take peat from any place in the Saorstát to any place in the Saorstát for a flat rate.  That solved at a stroke the biggest and most difficult of all the problems, and that was the transportation problem and the problem of the various values of peat due to its distance from the centres of consumption.  It meant that every place within three or four miles of a railway, wherever it was in Ireland, was practically on a balance if the peat itself was good.  I hope this year we will spend at least three times as much as we spent last year in the preparatory development of peat; that is to say, in the planning out of large areas of peat development, driving roads into them and constructing drains out of them so as to enable them to be brought into production this year.  Most of the work up to the present has been done through co-operative peat societies.  I am not one of those people who are wild enthusiasts for co-operative societies as effective units.  I stress that point for the purpose of paying tribute to the efficiency with which the co-operative societies in this case have as a rule delivered the goods.  It is essentially one of the activities in which cooperation is needed among those who are going to produce the stuff and the use of co-operative societies for this purpose up to the present has been a success.  Whether or not we are coming to the limit of efficient activity of co-operative societies in this connection is a matter which is under consideration.  It is suggested that while to the extent to which it is further possible we shall use the <Col N="480" /> co-operative society, if the very much larger output which is envisaged is to be obtained it may have to be obtained by more direct methods.</P>
    <P>In the reclamation of land, grants varying from £1 to £5 are given by the Department of Agriculture to encourage tenants with uneconomic holdings from the various districts to reclaim waste lands and bring them into cultivation and make them a permanent addition to their agricultural farms.  The Land Commission carry out reclamation on a sufficiently large scale to provide entirely new holdings for migrants.  Any money of that kind which we use is used through the Land Commission.  Broadly speaking, the whole object of the Department which we control is not to do the work ourselves if an existing organisation of the State can do it.  I must say that in the somewhat onerous task of co-ordinating those activities we have had the highest and the most cordial co-operation from all the other Departments of the State.</P>
    <P>Marine works consist of boat slips and piers mostly in very poor areas. They are used for the purpose of enabling the people to do a little more fishing largely for their own use, for the gathering of kelp, for the gathering of seaweed for farm purposes and sand and gravel also largely for agricultural purposes.  A good deal more work of that kind can be done.  There are a lot more piers that have been proposed.  Taking a period of over 50 years you will find that there were a lot of piers erected which, certainly, ought never to have been proposed.  I used to say in the days when it was my business to know a great deal about the sea coast that there were piers in Ireland that would justify a revolution. I say that deliberately, and my experience in the building of them has not altered that opinion.</P>
    <P>Minor relief schemes are the most popular of all.  I should say I get 30 inquiries, from members of the Dáil, in relation to minor relief schemes, for every one that I get in connection with other schemes.  It is amazing!  You <Col N="481" /> can spend £1,000 on an ordinary road but it does not seem to have the impact or the interest of £100 spent upon a bog road.  Certainly the atmosphere created and the work done in connection with the bog roads is surprising.  Those of us who have seen Ford's making castings, and moulds, and cores for castings, for piece work, certainly regarded human labour as being brought to the limit of intensity. But I can say I have seen men working on bog roads, trying to cut another few yards to the bank, with an intensity that would make the intensity in Ford's in making their castings look like slow motion.  The reason is that the work is useful to themselves.  We try, as far as possible, in every case, for the purpose of getting those good results, to employ upon the works those who will benefit from them.  Exactly in the same way, where we drive considerable roads into bogs, for the commercial development of peat, we employ, if possible, members of the co-operative society who afterwards are going to work that bog and get the benefit.  Speedy cuts are made, and with an enthusiasm and directness that you do not get from ordinary hired labour.</P>
    <P>Some 1,900 separate minor relief schemes were carried out last year. In the month of December there were engaged, at one time, some 16,000 men upon these schemes.  Although we turned out about 2,500 schemes of different sorts, I must say they have gone this year with a smoothness and an ease, and a lack of trouble, that is a very great testimony to the efficiency and the energy of the officials of the Department who have to deal with, what I need hardly tell the House, are the very considerable and various ways, 2,500 schemes scattered all over the country.</P>
    <P>I again refer to the map that I put up outside in the Lobby.  I hope in future years that will be the practice. I think two or three years' maps of the kind that I have put up will eventually prove to be most valuable organisation sources of the proper distribution of relief schemes in the future.  They have not been put up for advertisement or kudos of any kind, <Col N="482" /> but for the deliberate purpose of enabling members of this House to have full and exact knowledge of what has been done and to bring constructive criticism to bear in the administration of the relief schemes, in order that they may realise more than they do now what, I think, the Dáil intended them to be when they put these advantages at the disposal of the Department for the relief of distressed industries.</P>

      <P>In Meath we have had minor relief schemes and money allocated in the last few years.  I desire to inform the Parliamentary Secretary that the work carried out, under those schemes, has been very beneficial.  I ask for a continuance in Meath of the distribution of minor relief schemes and the money grants, which were very desirable.  In County Meath we have allocated the money to the repair of lanes, boreens and bog roads.  Ratepayers living down these old boreens, and their people before them for centuries, have had to keep those old laneways in repair.  The ordinary amenities, enjoyed by people living adjacent to the highways, were denied to people living down those old byways and boreens.  In going to church, on Sundays, or week-days, and in going to market, or to do their local shopping, or in going to their amusements or their pastimes, they found they had to plough their way through mud and numerous kinds of potholes.  Those living outside, adjacent to the highways, when it was their lot to have to pass through these lanes and boreens for various reasons&mdash;funerals, weddings, and so forth&mdash;found that although the local people have made every effort to improve the surface of the laneways, their condition still left much to be desired.  Oftentimes the owner of the land in these places would not have the same interest in having those byways repaired, and left it to those who lived on the spot to do the repairs.  I myself saw the value of the output received from the men engaged in the repair of laneways under these minor schemes.  It was simply amazing.  In fact, we cannot properly estimate the value of this work to the <Col N="483" /> people living in these places.  Bog roads, which have been repaired under these schemes, are now in the position to have ordinary transport pass over them.  Heretofore the bogs were isolated from their markets to a great extent.  Ordinary motors can now come through the bogs, load the turf there, and bring it to the market at a cheap rate.</P>
      <P>I would suggest that allowance be made for the erection and repair of bridges in these old laneways and bog roads.  What is everybody's business is nobody's business where these old bridges are concerned.  I refer to bridges leading to the residences of ratepayers, or leading over the highway to two or three tillage farms.  In asking for a continuance of the grant for minor relief schemes for the repair of laneways in County Meath, I suggest that it should, if possible, be applied on a wider scale, or that more money should be allocated.  We have not many average-sized holdings in County Meath.  Unfortunately there are districts where two or three men own large areas of land, where practically no employment is given. Although the calculation made by the Parliamentary Secretary, as to the poverty factor, may distribute the money over other areas equally, I suggest that in portion of Meath where we have such large holdings, on which no employment is given, a greater amount of money should be made available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I desire to pay a tribute to the general efficiency of the Parliamentary Secretary's Department.  I must say that great satisfaction has been given to all concerned.  The Department has certainly given great satisfaction to Deputies who have to go to it to look for grants.  I do not see why minor, relief schemes should be so termed. They have certainly been major relief schemes, as far as great numbers of our people are concerned.  I suppose the only minor item in these schemes would be the wage paid to the men working on them.  While we do not recognise it as a decent living wage, we take it in the right spirit, because <Col N="484" /> the work is given in the winter-time, when other employment is practically at a standstill.  In that way it is looked upon merely as minor relief work.  As far as value goes I certainly say it is major relief.  The Parliamentary Secretary visited County Meath during the year and inspected a number of the works carried out there.  I am sure he will agree with me that great work was done for the money, and that 100 per cent. value was obtained.  The only fault I can find with the Parliamentary Secretary is that his visit was not known to the Deputies or the people of Meath.  I can assure him that if we had known of his visit we would have given him a great welcome, in order to show him how we appreciate the benefit he and his Department have conferred on the people of the county.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask one or two questions arising out of the statement of the Parliamentary Secretary. I want to know if it would be possible to make the rules and regulations governing the expenditure of money on minor and major relief schemes a little more flexible.  We are given to understand that money passed for relief schemes must be expended within a given period.  I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to recall a case in Cork, where a certain amount of money was granted for a minor relief scheme, but at the time neither Cork Corporation nor Cork Harbour Commissioners could put up a scheme which would fit in with the rules of the Department.  I think the money had to be expended within a given period, and not later than March 31st. If I am wrong in saying that the Parliamentary Secretary will correct me.  It was found difficult within these limits to undertake any large scheme.  A very big scheme is proceeding a mile or two from Cork General Post Office, known as the Tivoli Reclamation Scheme.  If there is any money to be allocated for these minor schemes in future in Cork City, the rules governing the expenditure should be a little more flexible.  The Parliamentary Secretary understands that it is almost impossible to have money spent to the best advantage on a particular <Col N="485" /> scheme if it is surrounded by the limitations I have mentioned.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has adverted more than once to the development of the peat industry.  He has very properly taken an interest in bog roads or boreens leading to bogs. As a representative of the City of Cork, the Parliamentary Secretary must have received a communication from the residents of Donoughmore. He will understand that this is not a matter of political kudos.</P>

      <P>At Barracharing a county councillor for the area began a road leading to the bog some time ago, but the county council decided that all new works started by members were to cease.  This road was left unfinished. I know the district fairly well, and I know that it would be a great boon to farmers and labourers there if the road was finished, as it would make a large amount of turbary available.  I do not propose to make any further comment on the administration of the Board of Works.  As far as my experience goes, it is a very well administered Department, and the officials are the last word in courtesy and efficiency.  I might have something to say with regard to employment under these schemes, but I prefer not to do so as a happy note has been struck by the first speaker.  I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that he might make some inquiries as to whether there is or is not discrimination in the employment of labour on many of these schemes.  I am not at all surprised that the Parliamentary Secretary is having many bouquets thrown at him by members of his own Party, because I am given to understand that in areas outside Cork a good deal of discrimination is exercised.  I feel sure the Parliamentary Secretary would not stand for that kind of conduct.  The essential thing in employment given on these relief schemes should be the circumstances of the applicants.  The fact that a person is unemployed for a period, or that he may be a married man with dependents, are things that should be taken into consideration, and <Col N="486" /> not political views.  Many cases have been brought to my notice in which undoubtedly that kind of discrimination has been exercised.  I am sure every right-minded man will condemn that kind of conduct.</P>
      <P>Another point I want to emphasise is this, that applicants for work under these relief schemes are frequently persons who have 5/- or 6/- weekly as allowances or pensions, either from the British or the Irish Governments, or perhaps from some previous employers.  Everyone knows that a man with a pension of 5/- or 6/- a week, and who may be living in one of the Corporation houses may have to pay 10/- or 12/- weekly in rent, so that the 4/- or 5/- should not be taken into account.  That has frequently occurred in the administration of these schemes, just as it has occurred in the administration of the Unemployment Assistance Act.  I feel that many persons, because they have pensions of 5/- or 6/- a week, are completely ruled out from obtaining work under some of these schemes. The Parliamentary Secretary might look into that in order to remove any disability.</P>

      <P>I am accepting that in the spirit Deputy Anthony mentioned, but I do not want the House to misunderstand my attitude in the matter. I have deliberately chosen, in relation to relief schemes, a certain attitude. That was deliberately for the purpose of encouraging criticism.  If my conciliatory attitude is going in any way to hamper the style of any Deputy who thinks he ought to come out with criticism, then I will have to change my attitude.  I am quite sincere in that.  A man will say &ldquo;He has treated us decently and we are not going to say anything nasty about it.&rdquo; And you are not saying anything nasty about it if what you have got to say is that there is anything wrong with these schemes.  I want to know if there is.  If I were to use a conciliatory attitude for the purpose of hampering anyone in saying that, I would be using an oratorical device for a thoroughly scandalous purpose. <Col N="487" /> I am simply saying to Deputy Anthony: &ldquo;Do not conceal anything if things are wrong.  Do not do anything but tell me either here, or preferably by writing to my office, the actual circumstances of anything that you think is wrong even if you do not know of your own knowledge that it is wrong and I will investigate it.&rdquo;  I do not think that at the present moment there is in my Department one single complaint outstanding which has not been investigated.  If any complaint should remain uninvestigated I would regard it as a most serious dereliction of duty.  In that spirit and in that way, I do not want to misinterpret anything that Deputy Anthony or anyone else has said. Give me facts.  If you cannot give me facts give me the basis of well-founded suspicion.  We intend the relief scheme administration to be clean and we ask your help in seeing that it is clean.</P>

      <P>(An Clár): Now that the gloves are off, let me put a brick or at least a sod of black turf into the bouquet.  The first complaint I have to make is that I consider the amount divided is not at all adequate to the need.  I think that there should be considerably more in the circumstances. Generally, considerable satisfaction has been expressed as to the schemes carried out and as to the method by which they are carried out.  Personally I can say that schemes which I have suggested and which I have seen carried out, and schemes which have been suggested by others and with which I have come in personal contact, have been very well carried out and have been, on the whole, very good schemes.  The Parliamentary Secretary told us that a large amount of money was being spent on bog roads, on land reclamation, peat development, and such things.  That is all to the good.  The Parliamentary Secretary, I think, should continue along these lines to some extent and earmark a certain amount of money for these works because it is necessary they should continue until the most necessary of them are completed and until peat development has reached a much <Col N="488" /> more advanced stage.  I think the time, if it has not already come, is rapidly approaching when relief schemes should be considered on a more scientific basis than at the present time. There should be some indication as to where we are heading in the execution of relief schemes, what purpose we intend to achieve in carrying out these relief schemes and the giving of relief. I hold that while the giving of relief is a very excellent thing, we should have another purpose in view besides the mere giving of relief and that we should direct our attention in that way.</P>
      <P>I have in mind several methods by which relief schemes might be administered. There is scarcely a Deputy here who does not know that in his constituency there are such things as non-urbanised towns and that local authorities find it very difficult to carry on housing schemes and to engage in certain works such as sewerage schemes and water supply schemes in these towns.  I think we ought to set ourselves out to create such a thing as a minimum standard of local service in the matter of water supplies, sewerage schemes and site development for houses.  I do not want the Parliamentary Secretary to go into these non-urbanised towns and erect houses that the board of health should erect, but I think he should consider the possibility of going into these towns to help local authorities to the extent of developing sites for the erection of houses.  There are many of these non-urbanised towns in which the local authorities themselves cannot do that effectively.  I have in mind my own county in which there are a good many non-urbanised towns, where there are wretched housing conditions and where the local councils find it very difficult to do all the necessary preliminary work.  I suggest that the Parliamentary Secretary ought to give some consideration to that matter in future schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that there should be also in such towns a minimum standard of service in the matter of water supplies and sewerage.  Such works would give employment and would provide necessary <Col N="489" /> services, services which are absolutely essential.  In conjunction with the local authorities, I think his Department should examine the position with a view to setting up that minimum standard of local services.  Wherever the local authority is not able to secure that standard of local services, he should help the local authority to establish it.  I do not say that he should undertake the work of the local authorities to any very considerable extent but we have now for some years past been dealing with such things as national roads.  We have set up a standard of road-making for these roads which is excellent.  Why should we not also set up a standard on the county roads and see that none of the roads falls below that standard?  Why should we not subsidise local authorities to the extent of assisting them to maintain a certain standard on these county roads?  I think that is a matter worth considering.  I put this matter before to the Parliamentary Secretary and he was good enough to say that it was worth considering.  I put it to him again and I think that it is still worth considering.</P>

      <P>I am afraid I shall not be able to go on if these compliments continue.  Let us take the tourist areas.  We give tourists velvet roads to get to these areas but we do not provide them with velvet roads in the tourist areas.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary ought to consider that matter.  I know there is the consideration that a good many of these roads are under cóntract by the local authorities and that it is difficult to break these contracts, but I am sure that these difficulties could be surmounted. I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary could reach a point at which he could say, &ldquo;That is the maximum amount we can give you for creating a minimum of service in the matter of sites, health services, sanitation, sewerage and water schemes.&rdquo;  He could decide on that point and he would find that these works would be very advantageous to the district and to the workers concerned.  Speaking <Col N="490" /> of tourist areas, I have said that you bring tourists into a district on fine roads but you do not give them the same service in roads in the district. I shall take a concrete instance.  Take Lisdoonvarna, one of the best health resorts in the world.  Mineral springs and such things attract a great many tourists, and they are endeavouring to develop sea bathing and so on in conjunction with them.  In order to do that, they have to try to maintain a road about two miles long.  That is one instance.  I am not giving this particular instance with the object of bringing the Parliamentary Secretary down immediately to look over the district for the sake of Lisdoonvarna. I am merely giving it as a concrete example.</P>

      <P>When increasing provision has to be made to provide for unemployment relief, it is not a healthy sign of the times.  It is regrettable that it should be necessary.  Of course we all admit that it is a necessary evil, but it is not normal and we all look forward to the time when it will become unnecessary to make these annual provisions.  The Parliamentary Secretary has asked for suggestions.  I think that, with regard to the carrying out of these relief schemes, the money has been expended as well as it could possibly be spent.  There is a great difficulty, however, in finding works of public utility in some places and at certain times.  What I suggest is that <Col N="491" /> something should be done to stimulate employment and to obviate the necessity for these relief schemes, at least to as great a degree as possible.</P>
      <P>There are certain difficulties in rural districts because there are four dead months in the year, during the winter, in which there is general unemployment. The reason is obvious.  It is because it does not pay at that time to give much employment on the land. Days are short and the weather is generally bad.  For that reason it does not pay people to give employment on land.  Small farmers, who can find employment for their own family during the other seven or eight months of the year, find that at this time they are out of employment, so far as productive employment is concerned, and these people are thrown on the dole, unemployment assistance, relief work, or something like that.  I suggest that private enterprise should be encouraged, to a greater extent than is being done, instead of public works. If we take the agricultural industry and compare it with manufacturing industries, we find that it is not getting a fair chance so far as the encouragement of employment is concerned.  Manufacturing industries, I think, are protected by tariffs in order to stimulate employment.  From the nature of agricultural work it is impossible to protect it, because there is a surplus to be sold, and when there is a surplus you cannot devise any means of protecting it by tariffs, and some other means must be found.  For the months of the winter, when unemployment is most general on the land, I would suggest that improvements could be carried out, but I do not believe that it would be a practical suggestion to say that inspectors should be appointed to go around to look at this man's land that man's land in order to see how money should be expended.  I consider that money would be wasted on inspectors and things of that sort.  I suggest, however, that a subsidy should be given to men who would give extra employment in the winter season.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have not thought out an actual scheme and am only making a suggestion. <Col N="492" /> My suggestion is that a committee should be appointed from every Party in this House to consider this matter and to try to devise some workable scheme.  I know that there are very big difficulties in the way, but I think they could be overcome, and I know that Deputies on all sides of the House would agree to some such scheme as this.  I have been discussing it with some of the Fianna Fáil Deputies and I find that they are in agreement with the general principle of the scheme.  As to the details, of course, it is difficult to devise a workable scheme.  However, I think that it is a matter that should be very carefully considered by the Parliamentary Secretary.  No harm could result from it.  It is possible that such a committee would not be able to devise a workable scheme, but, if not, no harm would be done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MatthewOReilly" hpid="Mr. M. O'Reilly Mr. M. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Hogan of Clare that these schemes give a great deal of relief and do a lot of good at the same time.  A good deal of what one might call economic results is obtained from them, especially in a county like Meath where we have so many of those old lanes and boreens along which so many small farmers live who are now producing a considerable amount of grain and who, owing to the disrepair and continued neglect of those old lanes, find it extremely difficult to convey their corn to the mill or to the market, or to sell it to anybody else who might want to take it away.  It is also very difficult to get threshing machines through those old boreens.  It was not so bad in the days of the cattle trade.  People generally succeeded in getting a calf or two to the fair after considerable difficulty.  We are coming into a new phase now, however, and I think it would be well to pay some attention to that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the time of the grand jury and the old system such places were completely neglected.  I could mention many parishes in County Meath in which there are lanes that have got very little, if any, attention indeed. In these places the roads are generally <Col N="493" /> waterlogged before the winter.  The people have to get to Mass and to market towns through these lanes and boreens and now, under the new economic system, they have to convey more things to the market than they used to carry.  That is a thing that we should keep in our minds.  I agree thoroughly with Deputy Hogan that this principle on which we are working could be developed, and if it is developed in that direction it would certainly give a good return for any money expended.</P>
    <P>There are some difficulties to overcome in these matters.  For instance, I found two cases in County Meath in which disputes arose as to rights of way.  They did not seem to think that any agreement could be reached between the representatives of the Parliamentary Secretary's Department and the owners of the land.  Sometimes these lanes, towards the end, perhaps, as they go on to the main roads, cross people's land, and these people will not agree that it should be made a right of way absolutely.  They cannot dispute a right of way, but still they will not agree to let the work go on.  We have been held up in two places.  One was in Killeen and the other in Wilkinstown.  Quite a number of people were unemployed and a great deal of hardship was created. This is one of the old Tara roads.  At Killeen, ten or 15 persons have been left without a pass road.  They use this pass when going to Mass and they have to walk over slush and muck to get to Mass or to get to the bus or their market town.  It is rather awkward for the landowner, to some extent, and I think that some other method of approach to these people, with a view to getting agreement, might be used.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hogan referred to a matter to which I also consider it necessary to call attention.  He referred to the position of towns which are not urban areas.  Oldcastle, for instance, has a population of over 900 and less than 1,000.  In 35 years, which is the longest period I remember clearly, not a single house was built in that town. A peculiar feature is that we have a <Col N="494" /> magnificent waterworks, half a sewerage scheme and electric light.  The houses are one-storey and suitable for poultry but not suitable for human beings.  There must be about 80 or 90 of these houses.  Nobody seems to have any control and nobody seems to be able to do anything.  The Parliamentary Secretary came to the relief of people living down some of these old lanes and the puddles were filled up, making the laneways passable to some extent. So far as the houses are concerned, the position is ludicrous, having regard to the fact that we have electric light, waterworks and a sanitary scheme half completed.  I agree with what Deputy Hogan said and I take this opportunity of calling the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary to the matter. These are not relief schemes on which money is thrown away.  They have given good results economically and they could be developed to give far better results.  We have to face new problems now.  Other counties may be situated like Meath but they have not such long, old boreens which are extremely narrow.  If, owing to the new economic conditions, the people grow corn, they suffer hardship because it is difficult to get it out.  It takes a whole day in many cases to get in a threshing machine and very often they have to take out the corn to get it threshed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Minch</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary comes in seeking a Vote of £100,000 odd for minor relief works, and he tries to put it over with plausibility.  We are supposed to sit around, gaze into his eyes and applaud the great work that is being done, while saying nothing of the things that are left undone.  On two or three occasions I did believe in the Parliamentary Secretary's sincerity.  I believed that when he spoke like that he meant it, that when a letter would go up to the Board of Works it would be answered, that victimisation in the application of these grants would be immediately stopped and that everybody entitled would have a chance of getting a bit of work under the relief grants.  Everybody knows that that is not so.  Everybody knows that, in <Col N="495" /> many constituencies victimisation is rampant.  Everybody knows that if unfortunate men come along to make complaints and their names are given or handed in they will be marked men, that even the bit of work they may have got will be filched from them. Deputy Norton on one occasion got up here and made a tremendous attack in connection with the victimisation that took place in the constituency which he and I represent.  Everybody knows that unemployment is worse than it was, that deputations are springing up throughout the country and that marches are taking place even from the Parliamentary Secretary's own city to Dublin.  The Minister for Education had to receive a deputation of the Federation of Unemployed when he came to Athy last Sunday.  We hear about these bodies springing up in Newbridge to march to the city.  My view is that to vote £103,000 for these works is to do nothing more than trifle with the whole situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Minch</NameTxt>
      <P>It makes no difference whatever.  Deputy Hogan referred to towns that were not urbanised.  He said that the local authority was not able to give these towns just attention, that the county councils, which administer these towns are overloaded with work and that towns with a concentrated population cannot receive from the county councils the attention that their population would warrant.  That is a very serious complaint.  Where minor relief grants are being made in a county, where the local authority has been consulted and where a certain line has been decided upon, that work should be separated from the administration of the local authority and an impartial manager or representative of the Board of Works should be put in direct charge of the schemes.  I understand that local authorities will have power in future to employ directly, instead of through the labour exchanges.  I do not know whether that is going to be carried out or not. I think that a person from outside the <Col N="496" /> county, a man who has no axe to grind and no votes to catch, a man who does not mind being criticised, would be the best person to see that these works are carried out and that men are employed irrespective of their political affiliations. If that is brought about any time we are asked to co-operate we shall.  I do not care what may be the criticism, that impartial administrator will be backed up to the full.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very difficult to get the atmosphere of a local region or area into this House.  It is impossible by words to give a general idea of the criticism, the disappointments and the general disapproval that arise, no matter how these grants are administered, once the work is started. Time and again, I have been approached with a view to going out to make speeches with a view almost to siding with force and bringing about such a rumpus and row that grievances in certain areas would be attended to. I have always stopped it and always disliked it because it certainly does not bring credit to anyone. Unfortunately, it often ends up with hardship to many.  I quite agree that in giving employment under these schemes the man in whose home want and destitution are most pressing should get preference.  No two men out of the one home should get work. On the general unemployment question that is the principle that has been laid down by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, but I want to say that the way this money is being administered is most unsatisfactory.  There is partiality, and victimisation is taking place.  Certain legislation that has passed through this House is being held up in the Seanad, and we have the fact at the moment that young men who belong to the Blueshirt organisation are not getting a fair chance to obtain a week's work on unemployment minor relief schemes.  I find it very difficult indeed to restrain some of these young men from making trouble. I want to put this to the Parliamentary Secretary: that this is the taxpayers' money.  It is money voted here by all the political Parties representing all classes of the people.  It should be administered in the interests of the <Col N="497" /> people as a whole, the work to be given to the unfortunate unemployed no matter what Party they belong to.</P>

      <P>I desire to welcome in a most cordial manner the speech which has just been delivered by Deputy Minch.  I want to say deliberately that it is entirely to his credit.  It was a speech for which the House is greatly indebted to him.  If we have been playing about here in a false atmosphere, with people pretending to believe in clean and honest administration, Deputy Minch by his speech has rendered a thoroughly sound and honourable service in dissipating that atmosphere.  Personally I want to encourage speeches of that kind.  I do not want to attack that particular atmosphere.  I want everyone to feel that they can get up and say harsh things so long as they speak what they know and what they believe.  I am certainly not going to use the fact that anyone has made such an attack as an excuse for retorting in that spirit, except merely to deal with the facts. Deputy Minch said that everybody knows.  Well, what is everybody's business is nobody's business and what everybody knows is not evidence either against honest administration or the Parliamentary Secretary.  The Parliamentary Secretary does not matter, but the honesty of the administration does, as well as those who are behind him and for whom he says that they are under a very definite obligation to act in a fair spirit in the matter.  On the last occasion Deputy Minch said that there were cases within his knowledge. I asked him then if he had brought those cases to my knowledge, and he said, &ldquo;No.&rdquo;  He said that he would bring them to my knowledge but he has not done so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a question of no necessity.  I have had a scheme brought to me in connection with a complaint made in this House, and though the work on the scheme was over we investigated it.  It is not the importance of stopping a particular <Col N="498" /> incident that matters.  It is stopping the machinery by which such incidents can occur.  If, for instance, we find that there are complaints, then we get back to know how the thing that was complained of happened.  We may get back to the fact that there is some default or defect in the system of administration from above which enables us to take the action which we legitimately ought to take, or whether it was the case of a man who was found not playing the game.  Again, I want to say that I thoroughly appreciate the action of Deputy Minch.  I am making no suggestion of any sort, kind or description in derogation of his motives.  I am under a debt of gratitude to him, but I want to say that Deputy Minch must deliver the goods.  He must give me the means by which I can investigate specific cases and get to the bottom of them, to find out whether it is the system that has broken down, or whether it is a man who has broken down.  Whatever has broken down we want to see that the thing is altered; that it is not encouraged, and is not sanctioned.  It would be intolerable, in my opinion, that such a thing should be allowed to continue.</P>
      <P>There is no single thing which I personally am more determined on than this: that money which is given for the purposes of the poor will go to the poor.  There is nothing that I am more solidly determined on than it will not be used for political purposes.  It has been suggested that I go a good deal around the country incognito.  I have never in all my wanderings through the country made any contact with any politician of any kind while I have been on work of that kind.  Surely the House ought to know that there are two people they have to deal with in this House in relation to this.  There are two Hugo Flinns.  One of them is dealing with relief works. The other is a politician.  I have deliberately kept that personality and those works as far away from Party purposes as possible, and I intend to continue doing that whatever attacks are delivered on me. I am grateful to the Deputy.</P>

      <P>On this important Estimate the Parliamentary Secretary made a very interesting and admirable statement, but if there was one imperfection in it, one thing that could not be welcome to Deputies, it was the announcement of the decision to go back to the principle of allowing the local engineer to select the men for these relief schemes.  In my opinion, that is a most regrettable decision and I am greatly surprised that the Parliamentary Secretary should have given his assent to it.  It really means that a man who has not the time and could not possibly go to the trouble of investigating the domestic position of each applicant for work is to be charged with the responsibility of deciding the circumstances of each applicant.  In reality, what he does is to leave it to his ganger.  Surely the Parliamentary Secretary will admit that the average ganger throughout the country is not of the type, nor has he had the training necessary, for work such as that.  Therefore, it is inevitable that there will be disputes under this system.  Two years ago I heard the remark made in a certain district that &ldquo;where you have a relief scheme you have a row.&rdquo;  I am afraid it is going to be very much the same in the immediate future when this principle is restored.</P>

I have, as a matter of fact, more trouble on that score than in relation to anything else in my constituency, and that is why I intervened in this debate at all. I would not for a moment put any blame on any local engineer I am acquainted with.  I think it is inevitable that where you leave it to the local ganger, which is what it amounts to in the long run, there will be dissatisfaction. I repeat that it is a great pity the Parliamentary Secretary has allowed the Department of Industry and Commerce to insist on a reversion to so faulty a system.</P>
      <P>There is another matter upon which I should like to remark.  There is a tremendous lot of money being spent on sewerage schemes at present and I think the Parliamentary Secretary has encouraged these schemes in most places.  While I do not think they are satisfactory from the point of view of labour content, they are supposed to be very desirable improvements in the social conditions of the towns.</P>

      <P>In many places big schemes have been undertaken, and I am afraid that they have amounted to little more than that principle we have all heard of, of building walls merely for the sake of building, regardless of any utility in the walls themselves. These schemes are not utilised at all. There is no provision to enable poor people to link up their houses with these schemes, with the result that <Col N="502" /> very large sums of money have been spent rather uselessly, I am afraid.  I could mention one town, for instance, where over £6,000, I think, has been spent on a sewerage scheme and I am told that only a very small proportion of the houses in that town are linked up with the scheme.  From several points of view, I think that is a regrettable feature.  For one thing, I presume that farmers, if not in the whole county, at least in the district of that town, would have to pay part of the cost, and if they are paying part of the cost and the scheme is not being utilised, the desirability of spending money in that way has got to be reconsidered.</P>

      <P>He referred to the great advantage of having been able to get a flat rate on the railway.  Of course it has been a very great advantage and it was an inspired thing, as he himself put it, but there is this consideration, that many of the most valuable bogs are situated at such a distance from the railway that if the railway company only give that advantage on the rails, these bogs cannot be developed. The railway company, since the Transport Act of 1932 was passed, has to be regarded not merely as a railway company, but, as a matter of fact, as having transport responsibilities to every section of the community, apart from whether they utilise the railway itself or not, and some concession ought to be got from the railway company for the transport of peat by road. Otherwise a lot of those people in the vicinity of bogs which are situated at considerable distance from the railway will have a very big grievance, and many of the best bogs in the country may not, therefore, be developed.  I rather think that that is an aspect of <Col N="503" /> the peat development question that should be considered.</P>

It seems to me that there is room there for the beneficial expenditure of quite considerable sums.  At all events, any money spent on those lines should give some return and might possibly give a very considerable return.</P>

      <P>I should like to deal first with this question of unemployment raised by Deputy Moore.  It is a very vexed question and in my constituency, owing to the nature of a large part of it, this question of relief has always been a chronic one. This question of employment and of what is the best means of selecting workers arises from that.  You have the system of labour exchanges and you have the system of trusting the local engineer to select the men.  You have to make a choice between these two methods and I think that, in the main, the best method is to leave it to the local engineer.  Deputy Moore says that he has not got the means of collecting the information.  He has not got to collect it.  He is a man who has spent years in the particular area and knows everybody in it.  He knows whether a man is entitled to work and he knows further whether he is a good workman who should get work or a man who is so lazy that he should not get work at all.  I think that, on the whole, it is a very difficult thing on which to come to a decision but experience, so far as County Donegal is concerned, has proved that the best method is to leave it in the hands of the county engineers.  Of course, there will be complaints.  No human institution is perfect and no machinery set up by any Government Department or any other Department will give entire satisfaction, but I think, looking over a long number of years of the <Col N="504" /> operations in the county under the British and under our own Government, the greatest satisfaction has been given by leaving the local engineer to select the men.</P>
      <P>I should like to refer to the suggestion made by you, Sir, when you were speaking on this matter.  Where is all this leading to?  Are we in a <i>cul-de-sac</i> and walking to the top of it each year, coming back to the bottom and turning round and proceeding to go up again?  Is there any constructive objective before us?  Two Deputies from County Meath have spoken here to-day and really, I was amused.  Nothing concerned them but the repair of boreens leading up to their houses.  That struck me as a very serious problem&mdash;the repairing of boreens leading to the houses of farmers in County Meath.  I do not mind whether they are large or small farms but as I understand that up to these houses threshers had to be brought to thresh corn, I take it that these are farms of very considerable size.  Are those men so utterly indifferent to their duties that they will not take out horses and carts, get some stones and gravel and repair the boreens leading to their houses?  I wonder do those two Deputies from Meath want us to go down and give the farmers of County Meath tea and toast, or ham and eggs.</P>

      <P>I think it is about time we got rid of that imbecile point of view.  Where there is genuine unemployment and genuine need for money is where we should go.  The question is how should we spend it.  I think the suggestion made by you, Sir, when you were speaking is a real opening in that direction.  It is the direction we should concentrate on. You referred to a matter I have been thinking about myself, and that was the question of sanitary improvement and waterworks in non-urbanised towns.  I do not know very much about County Clare, but I take it that it is very similar to my own constituency.  We have very many of those small, non-urbanised towns, with bad houses in <Col N="505" /> many cases and, of course, no water at all.  I want to come to a particular problem which probably the Parliamentary Secretary is already acquainted with, and that is the supply of water to the entire west of County Donegal.  Of course, owing to what occurred here last night, perhaps I am not entitled to speak for that area now.  However, I am going to do it. The county medical officer of health there, who is a very efficient, very farseeing; and very progressive man, has tackled this whole problem in the county, and by his diplomacy has made headway by pulling the board of health with him.  They have voted a large amount of money with regard to the provision of sanitary works and waterworks in the county.  It is a very remarkable and curious thing, and I should like to direct the Parliamentary Secretary's attention to it, that first of all there is no water at all in West Donegal.  There are no springs in it, as far as we know.  The question then arises whether, if we had a geological survey of that area, water could be found.  Is it somewhere there, but at the moment not coming to the surface? I would really ask the assistance of the Parliamentary Secretary in the direction of giving some attention, by way of geological survey, to finding out whether there is any water at all in our area.  It is incredible&mdash;an outsider could not believe it&mdash;that that whole area from Gortahork into Gweebarra is without a solitary gallon of spring water, and that the entire community is drinking water out of streams.  To me it is remarkable in face of all that, that with very few exceptions there has not been any serious outbreak of disease in that area.  The case I want to bring immediately before the notice of the Parliamentary Secretary is the case of Rann-na-Feirsde and the Irish College in Rann-na-Feirsde. The difficulty in that case is that it is under no Department's particular care. The college itself is a non-State college. As it is not under his immediate control the Minister for Education is not entitled to vote any moneys under his control for that purpose.  The Local Government Department are prepared to give the ordinary sum to the board <Col N="506" /> of health for this work, but the trouble is that this work would take, I think, £6,000 or £7,000.  I am not quite certain as to the amount, but I think it is approximately £6,000 or £7,000.  The board of health are of opinion that this is not their primary concern, as the college is only a seasonal one.  They hold that the floating population which comes in there are not their immediate care; that they are only there for a month or two; that they come of their own free choice from other counties in Ireland, and that it is not a question for the board of health.  They are prepared to go on with this work, but they want some extra assistance over the normal amount given by the Local Government Department.  I would particularly ask the Parliamentary Secretary to look into this matter of Rann-na-Feirsde College.</P>

      <P>There is no water within a mile of the houses in Rann-na-Feirsde. The question is how it is to be got.  The board of health think that if they are to expend this £6,000 or £7,000 in providing a water supply for people who come there for only about two months in the year, although the local population is there all the time, they ought to receive an extra sum from the Department.  The real crisis is about this crowd coming to the college in the summer weather, when it is highly dangerous for them to be there owing to the lack of water supplies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>How is the water brought to them in fact?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is taken in barrels, buckets, cans and all the ordinary primitive ways of carrying water out of the streams.  It is a real problem.  The menace about it is that in any summer, in any week from now to September, there may be an outbreak there, and then, of course, we would all be reproaching ourselves. This is a real proposal.  It is much better than making bog roads; it is much better than cutting off corners and doing a lot of other things.  When the corners are cut off we have to go and put them back again if we want to give work.  Here is a really genuine job.  They ought to do it for this district, because it has done much for the Irish language.  Any enthusiast for the language must give this project his support.  Rann-na-Feirsde is one of the strongholds of the Irish <Col N="508" /> language.  It is an absolutely congested area and very impoverished. There is a menace to the public health arising from lack of water.  Of course, when the Parliamentary Secretary is considering this I would ask him to take in the entire area from Gortahork to Gweebarra with regard to the water supply.  I think it is really constructive work, and that it would bring permanent benefit to the public of the county as a whole, and to this area in particular.  I would ask him to consider the Rann-na-Feirsde question in particular, but I would also ask him to keep his eye on the entire area.  The employment given in this work would be much more beneficial and give more permanent benefit to the entire community, in my opinion, than work on the roads, which is really only for the purpose of giving employment in winter months.  This work would effect a permanent improvement, which would be of permanent service to the community, and of benefit to the public health.</P>
      <P>With regard to the question which has been raised about partisanship, I suppose everybody has had complaints about that.  I must say, however, that I have got very few.  I think that if a Deputy pokes his nose into local disputes he will get plenty of them.  He should make an effort to calm things down.  If he goes to the local ganger or somebody like that he may be able to settle the matter.  There has, I think, been a change in the practice of employing gangers from some district other than the one in which the work is being carried out.  That is very wise.  As Deputy Minch suggested, a ganger brought in from another district has no local interest and does not know A from B.  If he makes even a <i>bona fide</i> mistake it will be said that he was a political agent. Fortunately, I have had very few serious complaints with regard to partisanship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a considerable amount to be done in County Donegal with regard to the development of bogs, the extending of roads to the bogs, and the draining of bogs.  When this develops <Col N="509" /> there are some very substantial jobs to be done in Donegal, and I hope to be troubling the Parliamentary Secretary and chief of staff at some later date in connection with these things.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKilroy" hpid="Mr. Kilroy Mr. Kilroy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kilroy</NameTxt>
      <P>During the course of this debate on minor relief schemes I find Deputy Minch and others, including, I think, Deputy McMenamin, have been putting the question as to where this is to lead or must we, for our time, continue to produce minor relief schemes to keep the people in work and to keep them from being hungry.  Of course, we have higher aspirations than that, and what has been done in recent years leads us to believe and, in my opinion, to see clearly that there is another outlook in front of us rather than to continue the production of relief schemes to keep people from starving.  For instance, the making of bog roads in order to help the development of the peat scheme is, in my opinion, a great advance.  Undoubtedly, a lot of money is being earned by the peat co-operative societies, both in North and South Mayo, and we hope to see that scheme developed to a much greater extent.</P>
      <P>I am sorry that there are certain connections of roads left unfinished in particular districts in that county. There will be great inconvenience this year in the turning out of turf because the roads were not extended to the extent required by the peat societies.  If it were possible before the harvest to get these unfinished roads completed it would be a great help.  I do not know if it is possible for the Parliamentary Secretary to have it done, because I believe there is a decision to postpone the work until the coming winter.  However, if he could stretch a point and get the few small jobs that I refer to finished, it would be a great asset to the people concerned.  In the two districts of Achill and Newport about 20,000 tons of turf will be produced this year. They have not sufficient roads to handle that quantity in a proper way and they do require a further extension of roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should also like if the Parliamentary <Col N="510" /> Secretary could do something, in conjunction with the Land Commission, to speed up the striping or apportioning of turbary which is very necessary.  We were promised that those people who required turbary would be given it in order to come into the peat scheme, but they have not secured it so far.  The Parliamentary Secretary referred to co-operation, and co-operation in that direction would be most desirable.  I trust that he will use his influence with the Land Commission to have the matter pressed forward.  If that is done, of course it will mean that a lot of employment will be given in the making of further roads in connection with the apportioning of this turbary and in that way relief will be given.</P>
    <P>Deputy Minch referred to partisanship, evidently on political lines so far as I could make out.  Of course, all representatives from areas in which relief schemes have been carried out have had complaints from time to time. In my district, however, I can truthfully say that there has been no such partisanship.  I have had my share of the trouble as well as everybody else. We have succeeded in overcoming it between all the parties concerned and I do not think there has been anything unreasonable in that way.  I know that supporters of Deputy Minch have gone to such an extreme in that direction in a neighbouring constituency to mine that they have actually been dismissed. So that I think if the shoe pinches anybody it would pinch Deputy Minch's own Party rather than anybody else and it is a subject that he should have left unmentioned in my opinion.  It is an undesirable thing to speak about at all, but the fact is that a representative of the labour exchange had to be dismissed because of his partisanship in connection with the sending out of men to gangers in charge of schemes of this kind.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce will be able to congratulate himself on having been relieved, for a temporary period at any rate, of the responsibility of dealing with complaints, justifiable and unjustifiable, which arise in connection with the selection of men for employment on minor relief works and other works to be carried out in future under the supervision of the Parliamentary Secretary.  I have not, I think, given a great deal of trouble to the Parliamentary Secretary or his Department in connection with complaints of this kind, but I must say that I have been receiving a considerable number.  I have always encouraged those who complained to try and get the complaints threshed out and settled locally. I think the Parliamentary Secretary will require to explain in greater detail than he has done the method of employment in future.  Is it to be understood that applicants for employment on relief works in future will have to make application direct to the county surveyor or his assistants in the area in which the work is to be carried out?  If so, will there be an obligation upon the county surveyor and his assistants to go to the local labour exchange and find out whether applicants are in receipt of unemployment assistance; or must the county surveyor deal only with the applications which come to him direct from individuals regardless of whether they are in receipt of unemployment assistance or not?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary will agree with the members of this Party that the proper policy is work or maintenance.  Failing the provision of work, there must be maintenance under the terms, for the time being, of the Unemployment Assistance Act about which, as the Parliamentary Secretary knows, there is a great deal of contention at <Col N="512" /> present regarding the method of administration.  I am speaking entirely for myself when I say that I do not want to see any person maintained at the expense of the State who would be suitable for work carried out under the supervision of the Parliamentary Secretary.  Therefore, I want to see a definite obligation imposed on the county surveyor, or whoever is responsible, not to ignore the fact that other persons in the same area who may not apply for work on a scheme may be at the time in receipt of unemployment assistance.  I do not want a person who is suitable for work on minor relief schemes to be maintained at the expense of the State.  It must be pointed out clearly to the county surveyor that it is his duty to take off that list suitable men who are available in the area and give them work rather than maintenance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Are we to understand also that the preferences for work on these minor relief schemes will be in accordance with the existing regulations made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, or in accordance with such other regulations as he may make, alter or amend as required by experience?  I agree myself that the labour exchange is the only channel through which men should be recruited for work of that kind on minor relief schemes carried out with the assistance of State grants.  I believe the time will come, as it does come, when in the administration of this Act it will be absolutely essential to check fraudulent claims and to see that the men are employed through that machinery so as the better to check any possible fraud.  I think it might be possible under the Act to get payment <Col N="513" /> of unemployment assistance for the periods during which they may be employed by the board of health or the county councils until and unless the regulation is definitely made that the channel for employment should be through the labour exchange in the area concerned.  I think that is the only channel through which a man should be employed and it is the only way through which complaints should be remedied.  I am quite satisfied to stand up for, and to defend, the regulations made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce in this or in any other Government that may be in office at the time and to insist that these regulations should be carried out.</P>
      <P>With regard to the complaints about references, my opinion is that you will have those complaints as to favouritism for one group or other of people as long as you have in charge of the work and in charge of the selection of the men a local agent, for he is a man who is bound to have preferences.  It is alleged in some places in the country that the county surveyor and his assistants are in favour of the Blueshirts or that they are Blueshirts themselves. In other areas the complaint is made that the county surveyor and his assistants are in favour of the Greenshirts.  At all events it is known that they are local men with local preferences and these allegations will be made and can be made until such time as definite regulations are made.  I presume that this is only to be an experiment for a period.  I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary will, at the end of the experimental period, be glad to rid himself of the responsibility of answering and dealing with allegations of unfair treatment and preferential treatment in regard to employment on these works.  Probably another year will not have passed when he will come back to this House and ask us to hand this responsibility over to the shoulders of someone else.

      <P>As far as my constituency is concerned I have no complaints to make except that the Minister for Finance has up to the present failed to provide the Parliamentary Secretary with the money required for such things as the completion of bog drainage and the maintenance of bog roads in my area.  The work in my area, so far as I am aware, has been carried out pretty well with the exception that in half-a-dozen cases or so I have been told that the money allocated was not sufficient to complete the works.  We have had an assurance that provision will be made in the next Vote for the completion of these necessary works.</P>

      <P>I would like to know who is really responsible for preparing and supplying the estimates as to the amount required for the proper carrying out of these works?  Is the obligation placed on the shoulders of a competent man or have the estimates been prepared by a man without any experience of estimating or of surveying work?  I think it would be better <Col N="515" /> if the responsibility for this work were put on the assistant county surveyors. If that were done the Parliamentary Secretary would be furnished with more accurate estimates and in that way he would be spared subsequent appeals for money for the completion of the works.  I can only hope that the Minister for Finance will furnish the Parliamentary Secretary in the coming year with whatever sums are required to carry out these useful works so urgently required in areas where bog roads and bog drainage are required to be done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Goulding</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite agree with Deputy Davin as to the method in which the men to be employed on these works should be selected.  I make that statement for the reason that the local gangers are not always free from criticism.  I am told and everyone of us is told that a Blueshirt ganger will only employ Blueshirts and that a Greenshirt ganger will only employ Greenshirts; that each will only employ men belonging to his own Party.  It is stated that preferential treatment should be put out of their power.  Deputy MacDermot raised another point.  It was pointed out to him by county surveyors that some men taken on by the labour exchanges were not suitable for the work.  The difficulty is that the most suitable men are not the most in need of employment. A strong, able young man is very often not as badly off as a married man.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">

      <P>It would be well to call public attention to the quality of the turf supply.  Deputy Moore called <Col N="516" /> attention to the fact that railway facilities are available for the transport of the turf.

      <P>Turf is coming into our districts under these schemes and it is not at all as good turf as the turf in our own districts.  But we are not able to supply the turf ourselves because we have not the transport facilities.  If we had the transport facilities we would be in a better position than Kildare men, but our people in Waterford have to send turf ten or twelve miles to the railway station from the bogs where it is cut.  The extra cost of transport would be too heavy.  It would be unfair to expect us to take turf from an outside area when we have much better turf in our own county.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the point.  I agree with Deputy Davin and Deputy Goulding that if we want to give a square deal to everybody the best way is to do it through the labour exchanges that have been set up by the Minister for Industry and Commerce. Complaints have been made to me that certain political supporters &mdash;maybe my own&mdash;were not getting a square deal and they did not get employment.  I investigated that at the local labour exchange and I found that the granting of employment was governed by regulations.  We all know that nearly everyone has his political views at the present time and, human nature being as it is, an official may be somewhat lenient to some political Party.  If you want to give this work in the spirit in which you say it ought to be given&mdash;to the man most worthy of work, no matter <Col N="517" /> what his political views are&mdash;I think you should not depart from the position which is at present in operation and that is through the labour exchanges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I think a certain amount of what has been said with reference to the labour exchanges has been due to the fact that Deputies did not hear what I said at the beginning.  The position was that when we started first to do a widely distributed series of relief works with the intention of seeing that the employment did go to the people who required it, the equipment of the labour exchanges was not sufficient.  Gradually that equipment improved and to the extent to which it improved we were very anxious to use it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was always difficult to deal with it, and it had not reached a perfect stage of availability, in relation to minor relief work in the western districts. It was available in the eastern districts, where the people employed were largely agricultural labourers or people who had had some habit of being registered.  Here is our actual experience.  We would go into a particular electoral area and take a bog road.  The labour exchange would be 15 miles away and if we asked the labour exchange to send us men on any system of preference they had, they might send us men who would have to travel almost all the day to get to the job.  I am not blaming them.  When we started to extend the labour exchange operations and intensified registration, the registration leaped up at such a rate that the labour exchanges were not even capable of reading the applications that came in.  In Mayo, for example, the numbers who registered jumped from 350 to 11,500.  You can imagine what happened.  The labour exchanges, with the best intentions in the world, were utterly incapable of sending us men who ordinarily ought to be employed on a bog road in a particular electoral area.  Gradually the position improved and under the new information which we are going to get under the Unemployment Assistance Act, I believe the Irish employment offices will have the best social <Col N="518" /> statistics of that character in the world.  In my opinion the labour exchanges will be in a position to supply men for even a bog road in some remote district in Donegal.  But unfortunately, just at the time when this new information is coming into their possession which will enable them efficiently to perform, even for the remote, difficult and small localised jobs, the work which they have been doing excellently for considerable and other jobs in the eastern districts, this is the very moment at which a new function of an immensely large and onerous character has been cast upon them.  I have to be honest in the matter.  I have to admit, after examining the amazing amount of work which for a short time will be thrown upon the exchanges, that it is going to be extremely difficult for them to do work of this character.  I think that a centralised organisation such as a labour exchange, with the full information and statistics in their possession which they soon will have arising out of the Unemployment Assistance Act, will provide efficient machinery for supplying men fairly for relief works.</P>
    <P>I hope that the interruption in the development of the labour exchanges in the direction of being completely efficient and completely available to do that is only an interruption.  I hope at the earliest possible moment we will get back to the condition in which the labour exchanges will, not merely to the extent to which they have been, but more universally and outside any control of political and local influences, be in a position to send out men to relief jobs in proportion as necessity requires that they should be employed.  During the interregnum all I can say is that while I have no doubt&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, because the whole method of calculation in the minor relief jobs, and where they come first here, is the particular area in which there is necessity, measured to a certain amount by the actual statistics that we can obtain.  The idea is that the amount of poverty in the electoral area, as far as possible, should govern the grant.  They are specifically localised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I cannot say it would be absolutely imperative, but in 99 per cent, the boundary is so.  The suggestion is that the poverty factor is not applicable to Meath.  I am quite prepared to admit there are poor parts or pockets in Meath, but I have to face the fact that there are places in the West of Ireland and other huge areas, in regard to which I may say the more prosperous people in the eastern districts are 1,000 years and 10,000 miles removed from them.  There is poverty in Lettermullen, Gorumna Island, in Blacksod, in the far parts of the Rosses and in Bangor-Erris, which is appalling and beyond belief.  I desire to pay testimony, with all my heart and soul, to the unbendable solidarity of character of the people who have to live in those areas.</P>
      <P>I went to Donegal, last year, before the harvest, and visited the bad places there.  I did not see a quarter of an acre of cultivable land in Donegal that was not twice as well cultivated as I would have the damned cheek to ask to have it cultivated.  Anyone who went through Donegal last year, before the harvest, and saw what was done would be proud that there was a county like that in Ireland and proud of the efforts of those poverty-stricken people.  It is all bad land.  If you took some of your farmers from the good lands in Ireland and dropped them down for a fortnight amongst the people who wring a living from nature, which turns a harder face to them than to any people in the civilised world and made them spend one fortnight in those districts, to learn the facts of the lives of the people living there, I think the whole face of the political and social life in Ireland would be altered definitely and finally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Anthony wanted the regulations to be made more flexible.  We make them as flexible as we can.  He raised a question for a grant in the City of Cork.  It is rather nice for the Parliamentary Secretary, who represents the City of Cork, to be rebuked for not being over-generous to his own city.  What happened in this case was this: there was a considerable <Col N="521" /> scheme for Tivoli reclamation, as it was called.  Any scheme that would have to be undertaken would have to be carried out within the moneys the Minister for Finance provided for the purpose.  It was quite impossible for me, or anyone else, to say that in future years the Minister for Finance will provide money that the Dáil had not yet provided.  No scheme was put up by the harbour board in Cork which would have enabled an amount of money that would provide reasonable results to be spent in a reasonable time.  It was work which if once started, I would have to complete if they did not, for if only portion of the work were carried out it would be of no value until the entire job was completed.  The scheme was examined on its merits and turned down on its merits as every scheme put forward will be examined and turned down, if it has to be turned down.  I thought myself that the brains of the engineering side of the City of Cork might have been able to offer me a better proposition than they did.</P>
    <P>The Deputy suggested that Dunamore bog should be inspected.  As a matter of fact, I inspected that bog twice.  An inspector has been sent, and if he reports in favour of it the work will be done.  But the particular road that he described to-day, if the description of it as a road is correct, is a road on which the county council has already spent money and we are going to get into a very complicated and old controversy if we attempt to spend money on that particular road.  Again, merely alluding to the matter, there was a suggestion that there might be discrimination but Deputy Anthony has not brought to my notice any specific cause of complaint.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hogan (Clare) said the total sum is insufficient.  I shall deal with that later, because it is very far from being the only sum used for that purpose.  There is a sum of £130,000 in our Vote which I am afraid Deputy Minch mistook for the total Vote. But there is an additional £220,000, and in addition to that, as Deputies <Col N="522" /> will probably recollect, the Minister for Finance said he would put at our disposal later in the year another £150,000.  So that the total amount, instead of being £130,000, is a sum of £500,000.  Why I interrupted to correct the Deputy on that point was I thought there might be a grievance as to the amount of money to be revoted.  Say, for instance, the amount to be provided was £500,000 and I had £400,000 revoted at the end of the year that would be a considerable cause of complaint.  He made the suggestion that we should look into the position in unurbanised towns, and to make a standard for local services.  That is a question that can come before the Commissioners of Public Works and we will see the amount it would run into in the end.  As to the suggestion that every local road should be raised to a certain standard, all I can say is Lord deliver us!  We are utterly over-roaded in this country.  We have per head of the population two and a half times as many roads as Scotland has.  We have 30,000 or 40,000 miles of road, and I am very unwilling to build any new road except for the specific purpose of having productive results.  I am prepared to build a new road for the purpose of enabling persons to get into bogs, or for people who have to carry turf on their backs over mountains.  I am prepared to provide roads for men who, when carrying out turf are up to their waists in water, but actually to increase the number of roads, or to take the line that we should raise the standard of all the by-roads to some hitherto undecided standard is different.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the proposal regarding tourist roads, I have considerable sympathy with that, where it is a place to which you want to go but find you cannot go.  We will certainly try there.  For instance, there was the case of a road near Allihies connecting the Cork and Kerry coast roads, where a wonderful piece of engineering work was done by the county surveyor in Cork.  Last year we completed what is known as the Atlantic road, around a big cliff at Rosapenna.  There are two or three other places where the road came to a dead end in places where there is special local interest or beautiful scenery; and this due to the fact that there is some small link, very often of one or two miles, wanting.  I will be very glad to have the matter brought under special consideration.  The next time I am down in Lisdoonvarna I will have a look at the place referred to by the Deputy.  Deputy McGovern suggested that there should be a subsidy provided.  A good deal of work has been done trying to ease the position in regard to urban dwellers, and the Deputy suggested that something should be done now for rural dwellers. A considerable portion of the total expenditure is in rural districts.  The whole of the minor relief expenditure is of its nature rural expenditure.  To meet the situation it is suggested that there should be a subsidy given for the employment of extra men on land used for winter feeding.  That is not for my Department.  It is a question which I will bring to the knowledge of the Minister for Agriculture.  In relation to rating there is definite preference given in the relief of rates on agricultural land according to the number of people employed.  Apparently the principle is accepted on both sides of the House.  As to what extent that can be worked further, all I can say is that it will have ready co-operation here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At one time there were so many bouquets given me that I felt embarrassed.  I am very glad that <Col N="524" /> some Deputies afterwards put the bouquets in pots, before they sent them over.  Deputy O'Reilly referred to certain works which were held up by difficulties about rights of way.  We are tired and weary trying to get over little difficulties of that kind.  Deputies would be amazed at what happens. Here is an instance.  After enormous agitation we built a defence wall, which had been promised farmers in certain agricultural districts in order to stop erosion.  The farmers then asked for compensation for the work we had built to save their land.  The number of people who do that annoys one, but we become very philosophical. There is a lot of human nature left about when dealing with relief grants. I dealt with the speech of Deputy Minch in which he said everyone knew there was victimisation.  I want him to feel that any complaints he has will be very welcome at my office.  I want every Deputy, no matter what the personal relations with myself may be, to know that in connection with relief schemes, my office is entirely at his disposal, and every helpful assistance I can possibly give to make the job clean will be given.  I am entitled to require that it shall also be given to me.  Deputy Moore raised a question about the selection of men.  He was in favour of the labour exchange.</P>
    <P>The Deputy raised a question concerning the percentage of labour content to sewerage schemes.  The House may like to know in relation to various schemes of work what is the labour content.  For public health, waterworks and sewerage, the average direct labour content is 50 per cent.  Adding indirect labour content to the things made in this country which are used in such work, the percentage is 60 per cent.; in housing the labour content is about 52 per cent.; in county roads about 85 per cent.; in agricultural relief schemes, peat development and minor marine works it runs as high as 90 per cent.; in land reclamation, both for the Agricultural Department and the Land Commission, it is something in the nature of 90 per cent.; and in drainage works 72 per cent.  In public health works about 15 per cent. of the <Col N="525" /> labour is skilled, in housing about 43 per cent. is skilled, and on county roads about 10 per cent.  The figure 10 per cent. would cover most of the other activities.  The Deputy spoke of Baltinglass public health works which cost £6,000, which he says are not being used.  I will have that matter investigated to see what will be done. It sometimes happens that when a scheme is completed people will not make the necessary connections.  It may be that there is some particular reason why they will not do so in this case.  At any rate, it is up to me to find out.</P>
    <P>The Deputy raised a question about bogs that are a distance from the railways, and he suggested that transport should be subsidised.  The truth of the matter is that a flat rate on rail services from any place in Ireland to any other place is an active and formal subsidy for bog development in areas which otherwise would not be developed.  It can be said that distant hauls are all being subsidised at the cost of short hauls.  To that extent it may be taken that subsidisation is going on in relation to the areas that are most difficult.  In addition, we are, as far as we can, working out a system of road transport parallel to it.  For instance, in the case of Achill, in connection with which that question was raised, the railway is going to disappear.  The railway, unfortunately, is also going to disappear in the Westport district.  These are two big areas in which we hoped a good deal of relief would be given to the people as a result of these schemes. In both these areas, we are trying to use road transport and in certain places, where even that is not solving the problem, a proposal is under consideration to treat the peat and to transport the coke instead of transporting the peat.  All I can say is that the people who are engaged on the transport side have their minds very definitely alive to the necessity of seeing that peat development takes place in the areas in which there is most necessity.</P>
    <P>While the intention of my Department is principally to see that for the moment the actual works which are required in peat development are <Col N="526" /> carried out at once, so as to be in advance even of the demand, all our pressure is to see, as between the two sets of works, that work will be carried out in the areas in which there is real necessity and in which the production of peat, even at the price at which it is being produced, is a definite boon.  No one who knows the actual conditions can be in doubt as to the nature of that boon.  I mean the price is almost irrelevant as compared with the conditions under which these people work. The whole family work in the bog. They work at all hours in the bog and in many of the districts time is of practically no value.  People there work 12 hours in the same innocence and with the same disregard of fatigue as you and I would walk down to O'Connell Street.  I am an enthusiast for the benefit that is going to come to the poorer people of Ireland out of the development of the bogs.  From what I know knocking about&mdash;and I have knocked about a good deal&mdash;there is nothing which gives them greater satisfaction or on which they are more anxious to proceed, than the opportunity to produce commercial peat in large quantities.</P>

      <P>Deputy McMenamin objected to the making of &ldquo;boreens&rdquo; in Meath.  They are not made in Meath because they are &ldquo;boreens.&rdquo; They are made because they are apparently the only work available. That is one thing that breaks my heart when going about seeing work.  I have sometimes to pass work, because it is the only work available, not because it is work which specifically of itself is of value.  One of the guarantees the Dáil has in my administration of these affairs, is that I am so hard-hearted in matters of that kind, that I do want if it is humanly possible, to see value for the money expended.  I do hate to see public money, even with the best intentions, being misused.  A parallel case comes to my mind which arose in <Col N="527" /> probably the poorest part of Ireland I was in.  I saw them spending money on a road.  They were doing good work and they were making a good road of it but from what I knew of the transport which went over it and of the user which would be made of it, in its original unrepaired condition it was, for the purposes of that district, just as good a road before as when I had finished with it.  But I went over the whole area and I could not find other work which honestly would give better value than that work.  I did unfortunately find in various parts of the country, evidence where the old Congested Districts Board and other Departments had carried out jobs which represented the same problem of impossibility of finding in that particular area any more useful work.  All I can do is, as far as Deputy McMenamin's complaints are concerned, to say that when I see bad work I hate it and that is the best guarantee that as far as it is humanly possible bad work will not be carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy suggested that a geological survey might be carried out to find water in certain districts in Donegal.  I shall think that over.  One never knows but that we might drop on water, and if we do we shall be very thankful to Deputy McMenamin.  I do not know what we can do in the case of Rann-na-Feirsde.  It seems to me as if that is a job for the board of health. I cannot see how it would be a job for the central authority.  I do not see how you could justify the spending of £6,000 in that particular area.  We have, I think, 250 minor relief schemes in Donegal.  There are schemes in operation all over the place, and I would have to stop 60 of those to undertake that work.  I have only a limited sum of money at my disposal, and my business is honestly to distribute that all over the country according to the necessities of each district.  If I proceed to spend £6,000 in Rann-na-Feirsde I must take it from some other place.  If I took it from some other constituency that would be wrong, and if I were to scrap 60 minor relief schemes in Donegal for <Col N="528" /> the purpose of doing this work I should be lynched, and I should deserve it.</P>

I can see a case being put up for a water supply for the houses around and if the Deputy had been a little less honest, he could have put up a better case that way.  It is very difficult to justify putting up £6,000 of local money for a scheme which would be of service only to the students of this particular institution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>That is exactly the argument the Deputy did not put up.  That is the argument I invited him to put up.  It is the only argument that he can have any hope of getting away with.  Deputy Davin is strongly in favour of the labour exchange method of giving employment.  So am I.  The Deputy asked what was the method of estimating the cost of works.  There is first an estimate made by our supervising ganger, who is a man of very considerable experience in these matters. Then at headquarters they are examined and judged by an inspector, who is a fully qualified man to do it. That is the end of the story as far as I know.  I do not think it is worth while going through the actual allocations, because although they are fairly representative they will have to be changed.  Deputy Davin and, I think, Deputy Hogan, of Clare, made the point that while this thing was all very well the joint was not really big enough.  That is done under a wrong impression of the amount of public money which in any particular year is <Col N="529" /> expended on works which are calculated to relieve distress due to unemployment. I think it might be worth while if I were to tell you some of the items, in addition to this £500,000, which have been provided for that purpose.  Under the heading of Local Loans there is provided for Drainage Loans £83,000; for Public Health Loans, £275,000; Housing of the Working Classes, £850,000; Small Dwellings Acquisition, £466,000; Labourers (Ireland) Act Loans, £2,765,000; Housing (Gaelteacht) Acts Loans, £6,000&mdash;this is all in addition &mdash;Vocational Education Loans (Buildings, and so on), £75,000; Unforeseen and Miscellaneous Expenditure, £20,000.  That makes a total of £4,500,000.</P>
      <P>Then we have Unemployment Insurance (Contribution to Fund), £240,000; Unemployment Assistance, £1,500,000; Relief Schemes, £350,000; Drainage, £47,000; Public Works and Buildings (New Works, Alterations and Additions), £361,000; Housing, £400,000. Any one of these might have met Deputy Davin's contention.  In addition, we have also Improvement of Estates, £250,000.  Under the Beet Sugar Subsidy it is calculated that approximately £360,000 will be spent on agricultural wages alone.  Then there is the grant for the supply of native fuel for necessitous households.  The figure is not yet available, but last year we provided £25,000.  There is the grant for supply of milk, £100,000; provision for labour only in connection with Afforestation Schemes, £52,000; Minerals Exploration, £13,000; Peat Fuel Development, £22,000; Coal Freight Subsidy&mdash;to help our own ships &mdash;£10,000.  We have £100,000 going into what is really a subsidy for the production of industrial alcohol.  We have £900,000 for Roads.  Altogether it amount to a total of nearly £9,000,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have tried deliberately to keep these schemes on a basis of fairness. We have deliberately co-ordinated all the Departments of the State in an attempt to use whatever amount of money the Minister for Finance may put at our disposal in the best and most economical way, so as to enable us to <Col N="530" /> get good works of every kind that we could possibly get into every area. We have tried to be strictly honest and strictly fair, and I can say that, during the administration of the scheme, not by one penny, one week, or one mile, has any alteration been made in the time or relief schedule for a general election, local election or any other purpose.  That is our intention, and we intend to continue that.  The best cooperation that any man in the House, who feels that that is a right and proper ideal, can give us is to see that the head of the Department, whose business it is to administer it, does get the earliest possible information about anything that is wrong.  If any member of the House fails to get redress by that means, we ask him to use the publicity of this House to give us those definite particulars which will enable anything wrong to be made right.  We regard the money in our possession as a trust, and we shall administer it as a trust.</P>

      <P>Very well.  Altogether there are the Central Savings Committee, the Civil Service (Compensation) Board, the Irish Manuscripts Commission, the Commission of Inquiry into the Civil Service, the Commission of Inquiry into Registration of Shops, and the Commission <Col N="533" /> of Inquiry into Widows' and Orphans' Pensions.  Those are the commissions with which this money has been particularly concerned.  We will take the Central Savings Committee as an example.  This committee was established in 1924 and has undertaken the organisation of a voluntary thrift movement in the Saorstát, and is entrusted with the direction of advertising and general publicity in connection with Savings Certificates. It is a voluntary and non-political body and its membership is mainly composed of Dublin residents, but there are 11 members from the provinces.  The committee in the main enlists the assistance of voluntary workers, but the expenses of the office staff and of the State savings officers, as well as advertising and travelling expenses, etc., are paid out of public funds.</P>
      <P>I think the Deputy is aware of the general functions of these Savings Certificates.  I can give him particulars of the First, Second and Third Issues of Certificates, but I do not think he will want me to go into that. If he likes, I can give him the actual amount of each of the Issues of Certificates of different denominations which were sold, but I rather suggest that this is not the time to give these particulars.</P>

I know that I am giving the game away by showing that it is not so.  The Irish Manuscripts Commission was appointed by Warrant <Col N="534" /> of the Executive Council dated 10th October, 1928.  A résumé of the terms of reference is given in the footnote in Part III of the Estimate under sub-head (D).  The terms of reference of the Commission are as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To report on the nature, extent and importance of collections of manuscripts and papers of literary, historical and general interest relating to Ireland, and on the places on which such manuscripts and papers are deposited, and to advise as to the steps which should be taken for the preservation and publication of such manuscripts and papers, whether in public collections or private ownership and for the collection of any such manuscripts and papers as may be in danger of being lost or obliterated; (2) to prepare, after such consultation with University authorities and other learned bodies, as the Commission may deem desirable, and submit from time to time for approval to the Minister for Education, and, subject to such approval, to arrange for and supervise the execution of programmes of work to be undertaken in (a) the preparing and publication of calendars and catalogues of such manuscripts and papers; (b) the editing and publication of hitherto unpublished texts in old Irish, middle Irish and modern (other than contemporary) Irish, and of hitherto unpublished manuscripts relating to Ireland, due regard being had to their relative linguistic, literary and historical importance&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There is a decrease on this Vote of £594 as compared with last year, when the Vote amounted to £6,868.  The function of the State Laboratory is to examine samples of various kinds sent up by the various Departments.  There were 37,545 samples examined last year. These included such articles as candles, soap, bottles, beer, spirits, wines, cider, denatured alcohol, fruit (dried or otherwise preserved), molasses, saccharine, sugar and sugar confectionery, cocoa, table waters, margarine, tobacco, oatmeal, and woollen materials.  The general criticism which arises on this Vote is that the functions of a State laboratory ought to be something more than that.  As Deputies are aware, provision is now being made for special examination for technical and industrial purposes through another channel.</P>

      <P>Is that fair to the local authority, considering that the local authority principally affected is Dublin. The Dublin Corporation is faced with a statutory increase in the rates of 1/6 in the £ for unemployment.  Why should not the grant to the Dublin Corporation and the other local authorities concerned be increased by 1/6 in the £, or whatever the amount may be in other parts of the country? In Dublin the maximum amount is levied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an increase in the case of the Department of Finance of £375.  The increase is due to the provision under the heading of Public Works and Buildings for rates on the premises known as the Viceregal Lodge.  The gross increase is offset by a reduction in the Dublin City rates and by the transfer of premises in Dublin Castle to the Department of Industry and Commerce.  In the case of the Department of Justice, there is an increase of £105, due to provision for increased rates in rural areas and to the expiration of the limited rating period.  In the case of the Department of Agriculture, there is a decrease of £2,870 due to the transfer of the Forestry Service to the Department of Lands.  In the case of the Department of Industry and Commerce, there is an increase of £200, due to provision for new premises required in connection with Unemployment Assistance.  As <Col N="538" /> regards the other services, the increases are, generally, due to additional accommodation having been provided for the Department concerned, or to an increase in rural rates.  Decreases, on the other hand, result from reduced accommodation or a reduction in the rates for the City of Dublin.</P>

      <P>I do not follow the Parliamentary Secretary.  The rate in Dublin this year is about 16/- in the £. That includes the 1/6 in the £ to which I have referred.  That is roughly one-eleventh of the total rate.  This grant that is made to the Dublin Corporation is not increased, because one-eleventh of the rate has been added on.  Why do we not get an increase when this added burden of 1/6 in the £ has been put on the poor law valuation of Dublin.</P>

      <P>In any case my question might arise in this way.  Surely the Minister for Finance would not sanction the payment of £17,000 for printing wrong information. If that amount of public money is going to be spent on printing surely it is necessary to see that the material sent to the printer is correct. I appreciate the difficulty of having it absolutely correct.  What I am urging is that it should be reasonably correct and responsibility should be fixed on some public servant to have the information reasonably correct.  We all know that it is not reasonably correct. There is no check to see that facilities are offered to voters, or potential voters, to claim their votes within the fixed periods or to object to voters' names going on the register within those periods.</P>
