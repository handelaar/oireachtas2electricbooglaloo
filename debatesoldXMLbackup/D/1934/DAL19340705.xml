      <P>asked the President (a) if his attention has been called to Press reports of a speech made by the Minister for Justice at Bonniconlon on June 10th last to the effect that, although there was not a thing that happened at an I.R.A. meeting of which he had not information before 24 hours, he does not act on such information; (b) if the Minister's neglect or failure to act on such information has been approved of as Government policy; (c) if the Gárda have been warned against or prevented from acting on such information; (d) if information which ordinarily would be sent to the Attorney-General for consideration as to whether prosecutions should follow is being withheld by the Minister; and (e) if the meeting of I.R.A. engineers or of other members of the I.R.A. held on Saturday, 10th February last, in Parnell Square was one about which the Minister had previous information and about which he did not act and is still refusing to act.</P>

      <P>The answer to part (a) of the question is in the affirmative and to parts (c), (d) and (e) in the negative.  With regard to part (b), the policy of the Minister for Justice in dealing with such matters as those referred to by the Deputy has the full approval of the Executive Council. With regard to the Deputy's question generally, it contains implications which are entirely unjustified.  Appropriate action is always taken on any information obtained by the Minister or the Gárda Síochána which indicates <Col N="1470" /> the likelihood of a breach of the peace or of an attack on the person or property of any citizen or section of citizens.  In every country where uniformed semi-military organisations exist outside the control of the State, serious difficulties are experienced in maintaining public order.  To judge from published reports of incidents abroad, these difficulties are being met at least as successfully here as in any other country.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he will state what steps, if any, were taken by the Gárda Síochána to prevent organised hooliganism by a crowd of 200 persons who attempted to break up a procession and meeting held by the Fine Gael Party at Ballina on Sunday, July 1st.</P>

      <P>In addition to higher officers a force of 250 police was on duty in the town. Whatever disorder did occur, in spite of the police preparations, is to be attributed mainly to the provocative tactics of the force of over 700 Blueshirts who were brought to the meeting by special trains.</P>

      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, does he controvert any part of the statement which I made in this house yesterday as to the occurrences that took place in Ballina?  Does the Minister suggest that the pouring of tar on the floor of a hall which was prepared for a dance, the destruction of band instruments, and the destruction of the decorations in that hall are due to any action of the members of the League of Youth?  Does the Minister <Col N="1472" /> further suggest that the assembly of a mob outside Deputy Davis's house and the attack upon his friend when he went to take his car from the garage in the presence of the Guards, was due to the provocative conduct of the members of the League of Youth; and, if the Minister does not suggest these things, how can he stand over the answer that he has just made to the question that I put to him?</P>

King, Loughrea; whether Mrs. Sheehan produced a receipt in court purporting to have been issued by the said Michael J. King for the sum of 5/- for these repairs; whether the proprietor of the garage, Michael J.

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the Minister to give the House some idea of what difficulty the Seanad had in this particular matter.  As far as we are concerned here, we have very serious difficulties in appreciating the way in which the Minister is administering the Army.  Repeatedly we have asked questions here as to why men in large and apparently growing numbers are being discharged from the Army reserve for no other reason <Col N="1476" /> than that the Minister says their services are no longer required.  All of these men, in respect of whom questions have been put to the Minister in the House, have given up to six, seven or eight years' service in the Army and three, four or five years' service in the Army reserve, and I do not think there has been any one of them whose character was not very good and admitted to be so by the Minister. Yet, while a large number of men like that have been discharged from the Army reserve, the Minister is not prepared to say a single word as to the general policy on his part that is dictating this action.  The only answer that he gave is that their services are no longer required.</P>
      <P>Deputies from the country who are in touch with these men and their neighbours know that in some cases at least these men have been discharged from the Army reserve because representations have been made to the Minister from the local Fianna Fáil Club to the effect that these men were not political supporters, but were perhaps political opponents of the Minister.  There seems to be a great necessity to ask on that particular point, if the Minister has any reasonable explanation to offer to the House, that he should offer to the House that explanation in full and take the stubborn stand he is taking in this matter over an explanation given rather than over a refusal to give any explanation, good, bad or indifferent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many happenings, both with regard to the Volunteer reserve and this reserve, which suggest to members of this House, and apparently to the Seanad, that the Minister is endeavouring to develop a purely political Army.  A certain number of the reserve were in training in Portobello Barracks during the last month.  A day or two ago, a friend of some of the officers or men there&mdash;it may be more than one person for all I know&mdash;called to Portobello Barracks and, in the usual way, went through the regular routine which a visitor goes through to see an officer in barracks.  He saw some of his friends in the reserve battalion that <Col N="1477" /> was in training there before they left for the country.  He was visited the following day by a member of the new detective force who questioned him as to what business he had in Portobello the day before, whom he saw and what matters he discussed with them.  This visitor to reserve officers or men from the country in training in Portobello is visited by a detective in his home to know what he said, what business he had there and generally what he was doing there.  In fact, as far as my knowledge goes, the detective got full information about the persons he was seeing and what conversations transpired. I do not know why any person visiting an officer in barracks, whether a reserve officer or not, or visiting men in barracks, whether in the reserve or not, should be under any obligation to give any person from the detective force visiting his house an account of the conversations which took place or any reason why he should have been inside the barracks. Not only that but I understand that a certain number of the reserve officers and men who were supposed to have seen this visitor&mdash;there may have been other visitors&mdash;were paraded before a group of officers and questioned in the same way as to whom they received as visitors; what conversations transpired and generally what it was all about.</P>
    <P>The only feeling that you can get from the whole business is that some kind of a German plot is being run by the Ministry.  We did have occasion to complain that a very short time before this Ministry came into office the Vice-President rang up, late at night, the Archbishop's Palace and conveyed to the Archbishop that he wished to have Mr. Cosgrave informed that two of his then Ministers were plotting to raid military barracks in Dublin that night and take arms.  The background to that kind of suggestion was the background to the Glasgow suggestion, which was that an ex-Minister was in Glasgow seeing a British Minister for the purpose of getting armed assistance from Great Britain to overthrow the Government here.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1478" /> All this kind of a German or a Cuban plot is apparently being pursued in a subtle propagandist way by the Minister.  If there was not something like that, then we would have the Minister telling us, however brutally, what are his reasons for discharging men from the Army reserve in the way in which it is being done; we would not have the members of the new detective force following to their homes visitors to officers in a military barracks to find out not only what they were doing but what they said; and we would not have inside the Army a parade before officers of other men or officers of the reserve to ascertain what kind of visitors they saw in the barracks, and what they said to them. There are very serious reasons why the Seanad should ask the Minister to tell them more with regard to his general administration of the Army and there is very good reason why we should press a lot more than we are able to press against the Minister's majority here in order to find out something of his policy with regard to Army administration.  The Minister can be very downright and brutal and dogmatic at times.  He might as well have been downright and brutal and dogmatic in telling them something about his Army policy rather than not saying anything to them on the subject.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Mulcahy made an allegation that certain reservists were being discharged on reports by members of Fianna Fáil clubs.  That is absolutely untrue.  All told, since we came into office, there were something like 61 reservists out of 8,000 discharged for the reason that their services were no longer required. Undoubtedly, a number of those men who were discharged under that regulation were discharged because they were members of the Blueshirt organisation.  In October of last year there was a regulation issued prohibiting members of the reserve from being members of the organisation which has changed its name many times but which is commonly known as the Blueshirt organisation.  If, upon inquiry, I find that any member of the reserve is a member of that organisation, he cannot <Col N="1479" /> be kept in the Army.  Now, as regards the men who were discharged for the reason that they were Blueshirts, their cases have been inquired into by the Civic Guard in the ordinary normal way and it was only upon a certificate coming from the Guards to the effect that these men were members of the Blueshirt organisation and that they had paraded in Blueshirts, that they were discharged by me.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mulcahy accuses us of wanting a political Army.  Since we came into office we have been doing our utmost to turn the Army into a really national Army that will have the confidence of all the people.  If we were to allow members of the Army reserve to parade in the uniform of a revolutionary organisation, the type of organisation responsible for certain crimes which were recently committed on the Continent, I do not think that the people would hold that we were doing our duty either by the Army or by the country.  They would not hold that we were doing our duty by the decent men in the Army who want the Army run under the control of the representatives of the people.  They would not hold that we were doing our duty properly by the country.  My duty as Minister for Defence is to put down any idea that may be instilled into certain members of the reserve by Deputy Mulcahy and a few of his friends, that they can use the Army for their own purposes, that they can use the Army to co-operate with their revolutionary activities.</P>

      <P>The Army inquiry which was held, and as a result of which <Col N="1480" /> Deputy Mulcahy was kicked out of the Cabinet, gave a pretty clear indication of his character, even to the people who did not know anything else about him.  It did not require an Army inquiry to tell me all about him. If Deputy Mulcahy thinks he is going to get away with that stuff again he is mistaken.  The case was proved in court where a member of the Blueshirt organisation was found guilty of endeavouring to seduce members of the public service into giving him information.  You had one case where a member of the Blueshirt organisation was found guilty by officers of the Army of attempting to take bombs from the Army during his last training period.  He admitted he was a Blueshirt.  After being found guilty of attempting to take bombs unlawfully out of the Army stores for Blueshirt purposes, he was received by Deputy Mulcahy and his friends in County Meath and welcomed as a hero.  Those are a couple of the things the public know.  They know also there is an intelligence service run by the Blueshirt organisation which was told to find out everything about every public service and to get all sorts of public servants under their control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not going to allow the Army to be undermined by the Blueshirt organisation if I can prevent it. When we took over here, as the President has already said, one of the things which ex-President Cosgrave and those others who handed over willingly the reins of Government to us had reason to be proud of was the fact that we took over peacefully from them.  I was given charge of the Army.  Generally speaking, the Army has behaved magnificently.  There is no complaint.  They have given loyal service to the Government and they have acted up to the principle for which they were asked to fight during the civil war, and that was that the majority should rule.  They have continued to act in accordance with that principle, even when the people who led them in the civil war deserted them.  I think there is no reasonable grievance in regard to the Army and I do not see why there should be this <Col N="1481" /> suggestion to restrict this measure to a period of three months.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the attention of the House should be very emphatically called to one of the most surprising incidents that has so far happened.  I have been present in this House on at least seven occasions when the Minister for Defence said that certain individuals had had their services dispensed with because they were no longer required.  On each of those occasions Deputy Mulcahy put a supplementary question asking the Minister if there was any additional reason and, amidst the gibes of his colleagues, the Minister said there was no reason other than that their services were no longer required.  To-day the Minister rises in his place and proclaims himself, before all beholders, a liar.  He says in one breath that he dismissed them because he no longer required their services, and in the next breath, because they were members of the League of Youth.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I would call the Deputy's attention to the fact that it is not permissible to call a Minister or a Deputy of this House a liar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not do it, Sir.  I suggested that the Minister proclaimed himself to be such by saying in one breath: &ldquo;I dismissed them because I no longer required their services,&rdquo; and in the next breath, &ldquo;I dismissed them because they were members of the League of Youth.&rdquo;  It is unnecessary for me to describe that contradiction. Its description is manifest to everybody who heard it.  I say that the procedure of the House with regard to Parliamentary questions should not be used for the purpose of deliberately deceiving the House and the country in the Parliamentary answer.  I have had occasion to say here before, Sir, that the Minister in debate has a scabrous record.  He will go out of his way to employ the most offensive, the most provocative and indefensible language that he can think of.  He chooses to refer to the League of Youth here to-day as the type of organisation which has been found guilty of various crimes on the continent, the implication being <Col N="1482" /> that the League of Youth in this country is a type of organisation which may be expected to be guilty of crimes in this country.  He went on to describe it as a revolutionary organisation.</P>
      <P>Now, as I pointed out on a previous occasion, what Frank Aiken would say matter very little, but what the Minister for Defence of Saorstát Eireann says carries weight.  He has no grounds whatever for either of those allegations, but he tosses them off from his Ministerial position without any regard whatever for what he is, and then has the barefaced effrontery in this House to refer to the case of Captain Hughes as having been convicted on a charge of having written a letter advising members of the public service to communicate with him, although the court, which sentenced him to jail, did not convict him of having written the letter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I, Sir, would not have referred to the case in question but for the fact that the Minister deliberately brought it in to justify himself for having victimised members of the League of Youth and because he used the procedure of Parliamentary Questions and Answers in this House in order to deceive the House.  He referred to the case of Captain Hughes in order to justify himself in holding that the League of Youth was in a conspiracy to seduce from their loyalty servants of the State.  I pointed out that Captain Hughes is sentenced on the uncorroborated evidence of a man whom the court found to be a perjurer.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The evidence in that case does not arise here.  The question for the Chair is that the Deputy has stated that the court found that man to be a perjurer.  If it did not so find, the statement should not be made in this House in relation to a person who has no defence against a privileged attack.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The court found that the evidence the man gave on oath was not true and they found it specifically as part of their verdict.  That case might well have been left rest and would not have been raised from this side of the House but that the verdict in question was used across the floor of this House to substantiate a charge against an organisation with which I am proud to be associated&mdash;a charge that they sought to seduce from their loyalty servants of the State.  That kind of language is reckless.  As I say, on the lips of Mr. Aiken, speaking as an individual, it will have no consequence whatsoever, but on the lips of the <Col N="1484" /> Minister for Defence, unfortunately, it is deserving of notice and it does require rebuttal.  I think that the House should take grave notice of the Minister's procedure in respect of Parliamentary Questions and Answers and I invite the House to observe that there is no Parliamentary precedent for it in the memory of anyone sitting here to-day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say one word in reply.  If I discharge a soldier from the reserve for the reason that his services are no longer required, I take the attitude that I can, if I wish, disclose to the House the exact and detailed reasons as to why his services are no longer required, or that, if I wish, I can withhold the exact reasons.  If members of the reserve are discharged under the regulation which gives me power to discharge them for the reason that their services are no longer required, I hold that a very good reason as to why their services should no longer be required is that they are members of the League of Youth.  I hold that to be an excellent and all-sufficing reason.</P>

I should like to say that if I misrepresented the Minister in regard to his answer to-day, I certainly withdraw; but undoubtedly he has conveyed that political considerations did not enter into his dismissal of these men. To-day was the first time that we heard that they were dismissed because they were members of the Blueshirt organisation.  That is the first time we heard it officially in this House.</P>

      <P>And every opportunity was given to the Minister on previous occasions in answer to previous questions, but the House probably will notice the extraordinary contempt with which the Ministry is treating this House on this and all other matters.  They simply refuse to give the information asked for&mdash;completely and absolutely refuse to give it. They give no reasons for what they do and they are reducing this House, as was indicated formerly that they would be bound to reduce it sooner or later, <Col N="1486" /> to a mere registration machine to carry out their wishes.  I do not know if it is because of a feeling that is going through part of the House&mdash;merely to support the Minister.  But there has been a distinct lack of courtesy so far as the House and the country are concerned. There is the refusal to give information; the effort at least to evade the giving of information and a few moments afterwards that is followed by the Minister breaking his silence and giving information.  He confesses that because this certain organisation is of a certain character, though no illegalities have been proved against it or against those who are members of that organisation, he is determined to take certain steps.  That is allowing political considerations to interfere with his administration of the Army.</P>

Is that the explanation, or is it because of extreme delicacy that the Chancellor of the University in his other capacity does not appear here to justify a Bill introduced in his own name and for which he is responsible.

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to the Bill.  I am coming to the fact that the man whose name is at the back of the Bill has not come here to justify it. He has not come here up to the Fifth Stage to justify it, and neither has it been justified by the Fianna Fáil Deputies who represent the University <Col N="1490" /> here.  I have been interrupted on several occasions by the Vice-President and I submit that any loss of time there has been is due to his interruptions. I must say it is an extraordinary thing that we have been presented with this Bill.  As I say, the President of the Executive Council in the matter of the Constitution (Amendment No. 23) Bill has chosen the part of silence.  Does he believe in the Bill?  He votes for it. We are aware of that.  Will he pretend that it was forced upon him by other members of the Party?  Will he adopt the attitude that was adopted on another Bill by the Vice-President, that really he was against the Bill, but he had to do it and he was sorry that he had to sponsor it?  Is that the attitude of the President towards this Bill?  We should have expected a really solid case for this Bill.  One argument and one argument only was put forward that merits anything in the nature of comment.  It was a purely mathematical conception of democracy, combined with the idea that you can only have one form of constituency in a democratic constitution.  Where members of the Government or members of the Fianna Fáil Party got that idea from I cannot say.  Possibly in this matter as in most other matters, as I have had occasion to point out, they are obsessed by the institutions just beyond the Channel.  There is nothing in the nature of democracy which compels us to have constituencies defined and delimited on purely territorial grounds, and that is the sole justification for this Bill&mdash;that combined with what I may call purely an attempt at very simple mathematics.  Mere arithmetic&mdash;even very elementary arithmetic &mdash;is all we get.  They do not go beyond that.  That apparently is the rule so far as any real argument is being put forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was pointed out that there was undue representation here if you look at the numbers.  One would imagine from the speeches which are made in favour of this Bill that the Government stood for absolute mathematical and arithmetical accuracy so far as representation is concerned, and yet at the very time that this Bill is going through the House that same <Col N="1491" /> Government is responsible for piloting and pushing through this House another measure dealing with constituencies, in which that same principle is violated by the unnecessary creation of a large number of three and four-member constituencies.  As the House must know, if they have thought for a moment over the principles of proportional representation, and as the Vice-President must also know, you throw away from you as far as you possibly can the principle of anything like mathematical equality in connection with representation when you have a large number of three or four-member constituencies.  They make very little difference, if any, between a 50 per cent. vote and a 75 per cent. vote.  That was one of the Bills they were piloting through while at the same time protesting that their desire for equality in this matter compelled them to push this measure through the House.  The Vice-President on a previous occasion in dealing with an amendment to this Bill confessed that there was no mandate. He said that Convocation&mdash;there are generally about 30 present I think&mdash;passed a resolution in favour of it.  He is not asking anybody who knows the institutions that we are dealing with to take that as representative of the body as a whole?  It could not be so.  Mere numbers would show him that, but even if he did seek any mandate or something approaching a mandate, if he did want to find out what the views of the University graduates in this matter are, I suggest that the proper place for that would have been at the election of the University candidates. Did they promise as a gift to those who elected them that after this Parliament was out they would no longer represent them or would not allow anybody else to represent them?  If it was sought to get the views of the graduates of the University on that question, that was a more appropriate way of doing it.  The Minister conveyed that a couple of Fianna Fáil clubs passed resolutions or discussed the matter.  Surely he is not suggesting that that makes it an issue before <Col N="1492" /> the country?  The matter was never raised so far as the country is concerned. It was never raised so far as either of the Universities is concerned. There was an opportunity of raising it, and if the Minister had any doubt about the sentiments of the graduates of the University in that matter he could have accepted the amendment, and allowed the two representatives of the Universities on those benches opposite&mdash;so eloquent by their silence on this matter&mdash;to put before the electorate as one of their attractive pieces of policy, the abolition of the constituency.</P>
    <P>None of those things has been done. Many of us had an uneasy feeling when this Bill was introduced, and that feeling has been by no means allayed by the conduct and by the arguments put forward from the Government Benches during the passage of the Bill through this House, namely, that the whole thing reduces itself to a sort of calculation as to how many seats they would win in the event of a general election.  For that, they are doing away with what has been an advantage, I suggest, not merely to the House but to the country, and also they are doing away with two constituencies which if you look at them from the point of view of the country have certainly justified their existence.  Furthermore, the only charge that can really be made against those constituencies is that they fail to support whole-heartedly the policy of the Minister.  It is impossible to get away from the belief that this measure has been brought forward merely to gain, on a balance, a couple of seats for the Government.  I suggest that that is not a satisfactory reason.  At the very best, it is taking a very short-sighted view of the matter.  When the Constitution was being framed, and this idea was introduced, the state of Parties in this country was such that it would be clear to anybody that such petty political considerations played no part.  If anybody has any doubt about that, he can read the debates on that particular occasion.  The Government left the matter to a completely free vote of the House.  It was by a vote of this House entirely untrammelled <Col N="1493" /> by Party considerations, a vote of this House when nobody could say to what Party's advantage the creation of those constituencies would work out, that this clause was put into the Constitution. Now, in the midst of Party strife, with equal balancing of Parties and sordid calculation of practically every seat, it is proposed to interfere with the Constitution.  I suggest that it is unwise to do so.  That is not the time to make a change of this kind, and I think that the Government will be making a mistake if they take such a short-sighted view.</P>
    <P>I am sorry, from another point of view, that the Government has seen fit to take this step.  Not merely have the constituencies justified themselves, and amply justified themselves, so far as the service of this House and the country is concerned, but the creation of that particular type of constituency was a tribute, and I know no country in which a practical tribute is more necessary, to the learning and scholarship of this country.  In no way did it cut across the principles of democracy.  As everybody knows, those who voted at the Universities could not vote in any other constituency, and there is, therefore, no question of a double vote.  The very most that could be said was that there was a disproportion as to the numbers. In itself, I do not think that is sufficient reason for even interfering. It certainly does not come well from a Government who, as I say, have deliberately and unnecessarily created a large number of three and four-member constituencies throughout the country, but even if there were something in that particular argument, the abolition of the constituency is certainly not the way to meet it.  The way to meet it would be by way of a diminution.</P>
    <P>At a time when I fear, all over the world, there is a tendency, a regrettable and a dangerous tendency, to elevate the uneducated man as the ideal, even of culture, because that is an ideal which is rapidly spreading in some countries, I think it is regrettable that the Government are taking the steps they are taking.  The <Col N="1494" /> only pretence of a justification, as I say, is some extraordinary idea of uniformity&mdash;that you must have the same kind of constituency.  That may be a passion on the part of the Ministers, but they need not think that because they have that particular outlook it has anything to do with democracy or with the principles of democracy.  I have no doubt that the Vice-President will once more be justified, that his Party will vote for him and that once more we shall see this House reduced, as it rapidly is being reduced, to a mere registration machine&mdash;and, if the Seanad goes, Parliament being reduced to a mere registration machine&mdash;to give almost a passive approval to ill-considered measures of the Government.  I would ask the House, therefore, even at this late hour, not to give an assent to this Bill.  Certainly none of the reasons put forward by the Minister on this or any of the previous stages of the Bill will justify the House in passing a measure of this kind.  It is not now a question of creating these constituencies for the first time.  It is interfering with actually existing institutions, and it is the duty of the Government to show sufficient and compelling reasons why these institutions now in existence should be interfered with before they are destroyed.</P>
    <P>I know that there are members of the Government Party in favour of this measure because they are under the belief that a certain class of the community, supposed to be the wealthier class of the community, in one of the constituencies are strongly represented. I am not going into the merits of that particular case but even supposing there was truth in that and considering merely the number of people in that particular class, I wonder does the Vice-President hold that, even from the point of view of numbers, they are over represented in this House?  Let him count up how many there are in this House and let him ask himself whether, taking the country as a whole, county constituencies and University constituencies, that particular class that arouses the ire of some of the members of his Party are  represented.  As I say, the House <Col N="1495" /> ought not to pass this Bill.  If they do they are certainly doing a thing that is purely short sighted.  They are not taking anything like a long view of the matter and it is a mistake for passing Party considerations and calculations to pass a measure of this kind. Once more, we can only express surprise that the President of the Executive Council, who introduced this Bill and who is Chancellor of one of the Universities, has not seen fit to make his appearance during the whole passage of this Bill through the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamEThrift" hpid="Professor Thrift Professor Thrift">
      <NameTxt>Professor Thrift</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to make a protest against the passing of this Bill.  I do not propose to recapitulate the arguments which have been put forward on previous stages of the Bill against it. It is quite obvious that argument is wasted and that it is not a matter for argument.  That is quite obvious from the complete absence of argument for the Bill so far as the Vice-President and any of his supporters are concerned. I quite feel for the Vice-President in this matter because I do not think he has any real heart for the Bill.  He has done the best he could for it, but, in my recollection, there never was a Bill went through this House with such slender attempt at argument in its favour.  Many Bills have been passed of which I strongly disapprove but I venture to say that in respect of every one of them, I could at least appreciate something in the point of view of its advocates and the reasons which led them to bring it forward.  But for this Bill, I can fix on nothing except the one thing to which the Vice-President himself gave expression at the termination of our last debate on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite true that the Bill was introduced under the plea that democracy required, as far as possible, equal values for all votes, but the underlying fallacy in that was exploded almost immediately and it was shown most demonstrably that democracy does not require any such thing.  Apart, however, from the democratic argument to which Deputy O'Sullivan has just given expression, there is one simple fact which shows how utterly <Col N="1496" /> impossible anything of that kind is of realisation in a country with proportional representation like ours, and, as Deputy O'Sullivan went on to point out most strongly, the other Bill which accompanied this in its passage through the House went definitely and directly on the lines of making that discrepancy between the values of individual votes more marked than it had been before.</P>
    <P>The Vice-President knows perfectly well that in almost every constituency in our State there are hundreds, if not thousands, of votes which are of no value at all; which utterly fail to succeed in getting any representation whatever for the point of view held by the minorities in these constituencies. The result is that in their particular constituency hundreds remain without having any say in the selection of representatives for this Parliament.  He tries to compare the ratio of the numbers of voters in University constituencies required to obtain a representative, with the number in other constituencies, and gets out a certain mathematical relation.  It is possible to express the ratio between two numbers, but it is not possible to express the ratio between zero and a finite number. He is trying to get a ratio between the two, but it is impossible to get a ratio between nothing and something.  The fact is that there are hundreds, if not thousands, whose votes have no value whatever.  University representation was a reasonable attempt to give that minority some representation, which, I hold, might correspond with its weight in numbers and value.</P>
    <P>The only attempt, to my mind, that the Minister made to approach anything like an argument was when he proceeded to consider what was done in the discussions in this House before, and at previous Departmental discussions on the question.  Not designedly I am sure, but he did omit to point out that in any of these discussions the question was not whether Universities should be disfranchised or not, but whether Universities should be entitled to a voice here or to a voice in the Oireachtas.  I venture to say that since this State was founded there was never <Col N="1497" /> a question of disfranchising Universities altogether.  That argument was completely vitiated by the fact that the Government has just put through a Bill designed to bring to an end the other part of the Oireachtas, and to leave the Dáil as the sole constituent of the Oireachtas.  There is no question then as to whether University representation should be effected through the Seanad or through the Dáil.  With the abolition of the Seanad, this Bill means that they will be completely disfranchised in the management of the State.  Therefore I say that that attempted argument was completely unsound.  I regret to say that I am forced eventually to the view that Fianna Fáil are suffering from a Party outlook merely.  They cannot see the difference between a Party outlook and a national outlook.  To them they are the same thing.  But they are not, and there is a definite distinction between them, and Party should not be the first thing.  Country should be first, and a time will come when Fianna Fáil will recognise that.  I regret to say that the Vice-President admitted that this was a Party measure, that it was done for Party purposes.  I do not attribute those words to him, but his admission could only mean that.  It is a regrettable thing for the country that the question of University representation has been put upon a Party platform. Fianna Fáil declared that they were going to remove it.  The Chief Opposition Party say that they will restore it.  Instead of that being a question which the country as a whole could decide, as a country, it is going to be decided by whatever Party is in control at the moment.</P>
    <P>That is no platform on which to put the big question, as to whether or not Universities are to take a vital part in the life of the country and have some weight in that matter.  They do not concern themselves with Parties.  It is for the country they are anxious; the country's vitality and the country's good.  I take it from that, that it is sad and a pity that the outlook of Fianna Fáil is limited to such Party considerations, and that they cannot see&mdash;I do not say that they will not see &mdash;that this is a question which involves <Col N="1498" /> the whole country, not the Twenty-Six Counties, not Fianna Fáil, but the whole of Ireland.  By this measure and other such measures they are condemning the Twenty-Six Counties to isolation from the Six Counties, a position which it might have been in their power to end.  Wider outlook and wider vision as to what Ireland wanted and not what Fianna Fáil wanted would have avoided the drift asunder which is becoming plainer and more irrevocable day by day.</P>

      <P>I did not intend to intervene in this debate, partly from a feeling of delicacy&mdash;my own interests being concerned&mdash;partly from the conviction that questions involving major issues of our Party's policy are best left to be defined and defended by our Front Bench.  But when the Bill was in Committee, Deputy McGilligan gave me such a cordial invitation&mdash;which was repeated to-day by Deputy O'Sullivan&mdash;to take part in the discussion that I had not the heart to turn it down. It is true that the Deputy always likes to heighten the flavour of his cordials from the cayenne pepper castor, rather than with the other ingredients of the spice box.  But, doubtless, that only makes them the more stimulating and piquant to a Northern palate.  The Deputy and I, if not Arcadians both&mdash;<i>Arcades ambo</i>&mdash;are the next best thing. We were both born in County Derry, and the pacifists, for that reason, nearly all belong to the company of which Deputy Dillon is a sworn brother:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We don't want to fight</P>
      <P>But, by Jingo, if we do&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan has made a serious charge against me.  He has accused me in the third person plural of having &ldquo;almost abolished myself by my performance in this House.&rdquo;  As that amounts to a charge of having failed in my duty to my constituents. I repeat that I look on it as a serious charge, especially as it comes from one of the most valued of them.  I must admit that my conception of the duties and functions of a University representative does not, possibly, coincide with that of the Deputy.  I do not conceive <Col N="1499" /> it to be my function, as an Irish University representative, at a time when there is so much work to be done to put the country on its feet, to take up the time of the House with long speeches, carefully denuded of any constructive idea, and apparently designed only to obstruct progress.  I do not conceive it to be my function as a National University representative, at a time when my nation is engaged in a vital struggle with another nation, to chuck bolts into the wheels of the machine, and watch out, with the impish glee of an irresponsible urchin, for a possible breakdown.</P>
    <P>I do not conceive it to be my duty as a University representative to fill my speech with personalities, and to make offensive references to the origins of my opponents.  On the contrary, I hope that when the period of my political life shall have been ended by the maturing of this Bill, I shall pass from the life of the House to the outer darkness with this to my credit, that the recording angel, whether on the floor of the House or elsewhere, shall have had no word to set down against me that might add to the bitterness that is all too prevalent in Irish public life to-day.  Therefore, I speak, not as a University representative but as a woman.  Deputy McGilligan has challenged me, by innuendo at least to show what I did for the University.  I might, as one of the Deputy's constituents, address the same challenge to him.  I have listened patiently while the Deputy addressed the House on many topics.  My friend Deputy Tom Kelly and I are the most patient listeners in this Assembly, and we both agreed that we could &ldquo;stand&rdquo; more of the Deputy than any other of the long distance athletes of the oratorical course.  He keeps us awake and amused.  But I do not recollect ever having heard the Deputy defend any University interest.  I do not blame him.  There has been little necessity, for he has reason to be convinced that the interests of the National University are safe in the hands of a paternal Government.  All the University representatives must be convinced of the same thing for when <Col N="1500" /> the Vote for Universities and Colleges was before this House, the only University representatives present were the two Fianna Fáil Deputies.</P>
    <P>And, now, having proclaimed what I conceive my functions as a University representative not to be, perhaps it is time for me to declare what I conceive them to be&mdash;in other words, what I feel my constituents expected from me when they sent me here.  In the first place&mdash;and transcending all else&mdash;they sent me here to show the world that the majority of the graduates of the National University were behind Eamon de Valera in the fight he is making for the rights of the Irish people.  It will be remembered that it was the &ldquo;change over&rdquo; in the National University electorate that gave the President his absolute majority.  Indeed, I might call myself the President's &ldquo;absolute majority.&rdquo; And I think I have always behaved as a well brought-up absolute majority should&mdash;winning the hearts of my Party's Whips by never missing a day's Parliamentary attendance and rarely a division.  In other respects too, I have comported myself as befits my responsible position.  The Chair has never had to &ldquo;name&rdquo; me.  I have answered my constituents' letters promptly and kept their interests well to the fore with Ministers and Departments. It has not always been easy to be the model &ldquo;absolute majority.&rdquo; It has meant coming up from Galway each week and often breaking off at an interesting point in my work on two important books which I am concerned to make as good as I can, for the honour of the University of which I am a representative, and the honour of this House of which I am a member. But it has been worth while and, so, like Deputy Professor Thrift, I too, have something to thank God for &mdash;good reason to mingle with my <i>Nune Dimittis</i> a <i>Deo Gratias.</i>  I have to thank God that in this House, which our opponents have chosen to make the battle-front in the present war with England, the National University of Ireland, through the majority of its representatives, has shown itself unshakeably behind Eamon de Valera.</P>

      <P>I shall not take upon myself the task or the duty, which Deputy McGilligan would I am sure be delighted to undertake, of arguing with Deputy Mrs Concannon whom I am delighted to see here taking part in this debate.  She has made her apologia.  She has been able to reconcile it with her University and political conscience to disfranchise the University of which she is a representative.  I could not discover what mandate she has got from the University for that.  I presume it was the mandate of Convocation but I think that mandate has been torn to pieces by Deputy McGilligan.  I think, however, it is rather a family dispute and it would be an impertinence for me to interfere in it.  I should like to bring the debate back to the main issue&mdash;the disfranchisement of the Universities and the abolition of University representation.  I feel that anything I may say is useless.  There is no argument that I could bring forward now which could soften the hard heart of our soft-spoken Vice-President. It would be simply arguing against the inevitable.  The deed was done long before this Bill came to the Dáil.  The Vice-President himself admitted frankly that he had no direct mandate from the country.  He tried to indicate that he had some kind of indirect direction from the country, that his Party had undertaken to reduce the expenses of administration and that this disfranchisement of the University was looked upon as an economy measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, he urged it was their duty to revise the constituencies and he regarded the enforced withdrawal of six University representatives from the Dáil as a good step in the direction of economy.  Nobody knows better than the Vice-President that that argument is completely fallacious.  He is a very logical man and he knows that he might as well have argued that, in the interests of economy and fortified by their duty to revise the constituencies, they might have &ldquo;revised&rdquo; out of existence the representation of any particular constituency&mdash;Cork, for instance. There are some Corkmen here. What a great economy that would be! <Col N="1502" /> Or they could go a little further and wipe out all Parliamentary representation in the name of economy.  Think how much that would contribute to the expedition of administration! They could rush through 20 Bills in an hour. Passing from absurdity, because many of the arguments put forward in support of this Bill were absurd, to facts, this measure was decided on before it ever came into the Dáil.  The Universities or University representation was arraigned, tried and sentenced <i>in camera, in camera obscura</i>, if you like.  None of the accused was summoned as a witness but sentence was passed and this Bill now before us is simply an expression of that sentence.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Government ever considered the question of University representation as such, on its merits, whether they ever thought of what should be the relations between the State and its Universities in an ideal community.  Possibly they did.  I wonder if they ever thought of what democracy is.  The ostensible reason for wiping out University representation is that it is contrary to the principle of democracy.  I ask what were the methods by which this Bill was produced.  Would one, speaking frankly, call them democratic?  I suppose the connotation of democracy differs somewhat to all of us but I think that every man who thinks reasonably about the matter will admit that that connotation contains the notion of justice, fair play and openness.  Were any of these elements present when this decision was arrived at?  Would one call the procedure democratic?  I cannot, I call it autocratic, and I think I could call it tyrannical.  No democratic action could be inspired by motives such as were admitted and confessed in the course of the debates in this House.  Perhaps the most respectable of these motives was that of political expediency.  There are others that are not so respectable, not so decent.  I am sorry that this Bill must pass, inevitably pass.  The majority will roll up, walk into the Lobbies, and through it goes.  I am sorry on many grounds, extremely sorry.</P>
    <P>Speaking for my own University at the moment, I know that we are conservative, <Col N="1503" /> and that, perhaps, our feelings are not shared by everybody in this House, but we are proud of our University and its traditions; and we are particularly proud of the right, or, perhaps, if you object to the word right, then of the privilege or of the honour by which we were enabled more than 300 years ago&mdash;1613&mdash;to send two burgesses to the Irish Parliament.  I do not say that our lives or our existence in all these centuries since were stainless or sinless.  A man lives but one generation, and in that short space there are few that are sinless.  Trinity has lived for centuries, and she does not claim to have always been without sin, but her sins are such as one might now easily forget.</P>
    <P>In the early days of the University there was a very close connection between the University and the Parliament. One of our first representatives was the Provost of the day.  Provost Bedell was the second, and down through the whole list, before the Union, which the representatives of Trinity College bitterly opposed, they were conspicuous figures in the Irish Parliament.  One was mentioned the other night by Deputy Tom Kelly, namely William Molyneux, a very strong representative in his day.  The list of Trinity representatives in the Irish Parliament is a long one and not a completely dishonourable or dishonoured one.  In the days when I was a student, some of us thought that we would again have our Parliament in Dublin.  Some of my friends thought that we, in Trinity, would suffer.  I thought our University, at any rate, would have a voice in that House.  I did not believe that an Irish Parliament in Ireland would pay us less respect or do us less honour than was done by the Parliament of Henry Grattan.  However, like many prophets, I am scorned, I am afraid, and the views and the beliefs that I held have been shattered. I regret, for other reasons, the action that has been taken in this matter; I regret it for the sake of the Fianna Fáil Party itself, for they have some ideals which I share, although they might find it difficult to believe that I do.  I hoped we might work some <Col N="1504" /> day on common lines, and that some of us, if not all of us, might see the breaking down of the barriers, and the filling in of the gulfs, that at present divide us in Ireland.  I am afraid, however, this last action of the Government, in depriving the Universities of their representation, will create wider gulfs and will break down, certainly, one bridge that exists at present.  I do not know that those names that are honoured in the world, great names in our tradition, are also honoured by members of the Government Party; the list is a long one.  I was gratified some time ago when the President, at Athlone, paid tribute to the work of men whose names are enshrined in Trinity.  Speaking at Athlone in February, 1933, he paid this tribute.  It is true he used the word &ldquo;Anglo-Irish,&rdquo; which, I must say, I hardly understood.  I do hate this hyphenated nationalism; but he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Anglo-Irish literature, though far less characteristic of the nation than that produced in the Irish language, includes much that is of lasting worth. Ireland has produced in Dean Swift probably the greatest satirist in the English language, in Edmund Burke probably the greatest writer on politics; in William Carleton a novelist of the first rank; in Oliver Goldsmith a poet of rare merit. Henry Grattan was one of the most eloquent orators of his time&mdash;the golden age of oratory in the English language.  Theobald Wolfe Tone has left us one of the most delightful autobiographies in literature.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>All these men mentioned, except one, were Trinity men, and as far as I know they were all men that were proud of their college, and their college was proud of them.  I was glad to think that the President, and the Fianna Fáil Party through him, claimed to be the heirs of such men.  I think that was a good speech and a wise speech and would be read by Trinity men all over the world with great interest.  But that dream has been shattered.  How can anyone reconcile the present Bill with those fair words?</P>
    <P>There are Trinity men out of sympathy with the Government's policy and with the Government Party. But this action of the Government will <Col N="1505" /> create a feeling of dismay amongst them.  There are others, perhaps, more distant from the Government, in their views, but who are Irish, and not Anglo-Irish, though they do not see eye to eye with the Fianna Fáil Party in its work.  But even they might very easily be won.  But this is not the way to win them.  What the Government are doing now, or what they have done (because the whole thing is inevitable), is something that will create suspicion and mistrust.  This short Bill will, I fear, have far-reaching and destructive consequences.  These consequences I deplore, and shall continue to deplore. I have spoken, perhaps, with more vehemence than I should, because I feel rather bitterly about the unwisdom of this Bill.  I would not like the Dáil to think that this bitterness is of a personal character.  Though I feel resentful, it is not resentment towards any individual member of the Dáil; I have received too many acts of courtesy and kindness from members of all Parties to have any such feeling as that.  But I do resent this Bill which drives the University, of which I am an unworthy representative, out of the Irish fold and ostracises us from the vital stream of national life.</P>

      <P>I expected to hear some reason from Deputies opposite as to why the Bill now before the House should not pass.  I have heard none. I have heard some talk about democratic rights.  I wonder where do democratic rights come in here. Deputies have been sent in here on a quota of 900 votes as compared with other Deputies who came in on a quota of 9,000 or 10,000 votes.  Is there any reason why any individual in this State should have ten times the voting power of another individual?  If there is any such reason, I should like to hear it. When we come to examine the list of those who have ten times the voting strength of ordinary individuals, we wonder still more, and with good reason.  We are told that a great number of these University graduates have sprung from the soil.  Take the case of the ordinary farmer, with three or four sons.  He has not room for all of them on the farm.  The eldest son, <Col N="1506" /> Jack, takes charge of the farm and works it, while Michael is sent to college.  Jack has to work, not alone to keep his father and mother and the rest of the family in comfort, but he has to work from morning to night to keep Michael in college in plus fours and with polished shoes.  After Jack has worked for five or six years to pay the fees of Michael, that young man comes out of college.  Unfortunately, 70 per cent. of the Michaels who come out of college are duds.  Jack has to come along and clap him into some rural dispensary or somewhere else.  If not, he goes abroad.  Taking the, I hope, isolated case of the really bad egg who comes out and goes abroad to India, South Africa or some other foreign country, we find that he has ten times the voting power of the man who remains at home earning his livelihood by working a farm and paying the rates and taxes due to the State.  From South Africa or India, this gentleman can exercise ten times the voting power of the man at home who is paying rent, rates and taxes.  That is the democracy we have so much noise about to-day.  That is the class of democracy to which this Bill is going to put an end, and it is high time we had a bit of levelling up in that regard.  I should like to hear from some Deputy opposite the reasons by which they urge that an individual living in Ceylon or some other foreign centre should be able to send his vote back here, and that that vote should have ten times the power of the vote of the ordinary man at home.  I do not agree with that kind of democracy.</P>

    <P>Deputy Thrift referred to politics.  I am sorry that Deputy Thrift and those associated with him did not think of that during the last seven or eight years.  They came in here and used their power to dragoon the unfortunate individuals outside.  In respect of every kind of coercion Bill introduced here during the last ten years, they were in the forefront of the voting line.  I am glad that there is an end to that once and for all.  We have had this matter threshed out several times already.  I had no desire to give a silent vote on it.  I wanted to state my views clearly and honestly, and I <Col N="1507" /> should still like to be informed why an individual living outside this State should possess a vote of ten times greater power than that of the man living and working at home, and paying his rates and taxes.</P>

      <P>The Vice-President proposed this motion in the very briefest form of words that he could have chosen.  He said, &ldquo;I move.&rdquo;  That seemed to me characteristic of the attitude behind the promulgation of this Bill.  On all the stages through which it has passed in this House, there has been an admitted absence of stated reasons why the Bill should pass and become law. It is true that the Vice-President made a more pertinent observation a couple of minutes afterwards while Deputy O'Sullivan was on his feet. I took that observation to be his excuse for not giving reasons to the House for the introduction of the Bill.  He said that the House was &ldquo;a good voting machine.&rdquo;  I myself should not like, with my short experience of the House, to have spoken of it in such contemptuous terms, nor do I think that such a contemptuous description is true.  Even if it were true, it would be a very uncomplimentary way of asking the House to pass a Bill which was being put before it.  It is, however, from a practical point of view, probably a complete justification of the attitude of the Vice-President and his colleagues in regard to the presentation of this Bill.  Not once during the several debates that have taken place have I heard any statement from the Government Benches devoted to showing that abolition of university representation was a desirable thing.  I have heard many arguments put forward&mdash;I do not say convincing arguments&mdash;by several members of the Government and their supporters, one of whom has just sat down, to establish a different thesis &mdash;that the universities are over-represented. But I have not yet heard any argument devoted to the question which constitutes the principle of this Bill, that the universities should have no representation at all.  Deputy Corry asks us to give reasons why this <Col N="1508" /> Bill should not be passed.  He asks us to give reasons for something which is not contained in the Bill.  He asks us to give reasons to justify a certain proportion of representation.  The only arguments put up for the Bill have dealt with the proportion of representation and not with the fact of representation.</P>
      <P>The Minister has, frankly enough, admitted that there was no mandate for this Bill.  He has admitted that, though the Bill alters the Constitution, the country has had no opportunity of considering it.  He might have admitted&mdash;I do not think that the question was put to him&mdash;that there has been no public demand for this Bill. It is curious, though, perhaps, natural, having regard to the absence of reasons, that there has been almost complete silence on the part of the members of the Government and their supporters on this matter also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not profess to have made a complete search of the Press during the last few months.  I have only lighted on one article, in the leading organ which supports the Government, which was devoted to supposed arguments in favour of this Bill.  Most of the argument in that article is on the same lines as we have heard in this House: that the Universities are over-represented. The leading article which appeared in the <i>Irish Press</i> on the morning after the Bill was introduced was headed &ldquo;Privileged Voters.&rdquo;  Any argument that is in that article relates to the proportion of voters who return University members as compared with the number of voters who return members in the ordinary territorial constituency. Perhaps I am unjust to this paper in saying that because it has gone one better than the Government spokesmen in this House. It has invented a number of statements which have no relation to fact but which are put forward to give justification for this Government measure. I do not think that in a short newspaper article I have ever seen more closely packed mis-statements of fact than were put forward by this organ. Having made the point that &ldquo;each graduate's vote was more than eight times as effective as the vote of the <Col N="1509" /> ordinary Irish man or woman,&rdquo; it went on to say:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In Trinity College three Independent Unionists were returned unopposed in each of the two recent elections.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The only statement that is true in that is that three Deputies were returned unopposed.  No Independent Unionist has ever been returned from Trinity College to this House.  No Unionist has been returned from Trinity College to this House.  Since this State was established no institution in the country&mdash;no group of voters in this country, has been more loyal to the State than the voters that are assembled in the constituency of Dublin University. That is a fact well known and must have been well known to the writer of this article.  As regards the present representatives of Trinity College it is untrue of two of them to say that they have been Unionists for very many years.  It is probable that they have been for as long Nationalists in this country as many of the members on the Government side of the House. But even if this statement were true, what has it to do with the case?  Even if there was an Independent Unionist returned and if there are enough Independent Unionists&mdash;I do not know if there are any left&mdash;to elect a representative to this House, surely they are entitled to have their voices heard. But it is necessary to invent statements like this in order to support a measure for which there was no popular demand and to get some popularity behind it.  I find that it is further stated in the article:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The clause reserving six seats in the Dáil for University representation was inserted in London at the instance of the British.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It must have been well known to members of the Dáil, if not to the readers of the <i>Irish Press</i>, that the clause giving six seats in the Dáil to University representation was not inserted in London at all, but was inserted in this House.  What was present in the Constitution as put before the Constituent Assembly provided for seats for University members in the Seanad.  But we are told again, in order to discredit <Col N="1510" /> University representation and to beat up a demand in favour of this Bill that the six members representing the Universities have their rights here by some favour granted in London.  We find this in the article:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is not hard to guess why it was inserted, for experience had shown that the only University in Ireland which had the power to elect M.P.s always returned the opponents of Home Rule.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That again is untrue and should be untrue to the knowledge of those who published that statement.  It is well known that one of the members who represented Dublin University at Westminster at the time the Treaty was signed had entered Parliament as an Irish Home Ruler and that he retained those convictions.  It is well know, too, that his services in the House of Commons were of considerable help in producing the condition of affairs which led to the possibility of the Truce and the signing of the Treaty.  We also find this in the article:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The University provisions inserted in the Free State draft were, therefore, but another effort of Britain to increase the political strength of those hostile to the mass of Irish Nationalists.  It has, of course, failed to fulfil this purpose so far as the National University of Ireland is concerned.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There again we have an attempt, by introducing an untrue political stigma against those who represent the Universities, a stigma which has no basis in fact, to endeavour to pretend to the public that there is some justification for the measure that the Government have put before the House and that they now ask us to pass. Listening to all the arguments that have been put forward in the House it has been admitted by every speaker from the Government Benches that what he has devoted his attention to is not the question of the abolition of University representation but the disproportionate weight that is said to be given to it.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce put it in the clearest way.  He said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1511" />&ldquo;The question which this House has got to answer is: why a graduate of one of our Universities, whether he lives in this country or outside it, whether he pays his taxes to our Exchequer or some foreign Exchequer, should have the same rights of representation in this House as ten persons who are not graduates?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister said that in the opening part of his Second Reading speech on the Bill, and repeated it in almost the same words at the end:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;University representation.... introduces into the political life of this country an undesirable situation, in so far as it means that a limited number of individuals are given special powers and privileges which the average voter does not enjoy.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the plea that Deputy Corry has just put forward.  Of course, Deputy Corry made the additional argument that 70 per cent. of University graduates are &ldquo;duds,&rdquo; and that the other sons of a farmer are hardworking and intelligent statesmen.  But it is possible that there are some intelligent people even among University graduates, and it is also possible that there are some &ldquo;duds&rdquo; even among farmers' sons, whether they are University graduates or not.</P>

      <P>The same argument was put forward by Deputy Donnelly in his speech on the Committee Stage on Deputy McGilligan's amendment. Much of the argument from the Government Benches has been devoted to the particular case of Dublin University of which I happen to be one of the representatives.  Certain advice was given to Dublin University in what, I hope, was a kindly spirit.  We were told that:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It would receive much more support from the mass of the people if it were made clear that its sole function in this country was an educational function and that it had no part whatever, as a University, in relation to politics.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1512" /> I dare say that something could be said in favour of that.  It is advice which has been given to Dublin University before and has been refused before.  It was given in this House a couple of weeks ago by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  It was given 140 years ago by a man of equal note in his time, John Fitzgibbon, Earl of Clare, and it was not accepted. Among those graduates of Dublin University at that time who did not accept the advice of John Fitzgibbon was Wolfe Tone.  Amongst others who heard the words of John Fitzgibbon was Robert Emmet, and he did not accept the advice either.  Fifty years later Thomas Davis and John Mitchel did not accept it.  Isaac Butt did not accept it.  It has been a tradition of Dublin University that it should be interested in politics as well as in other affairs that concern the interests of the State.  Why should John Fitzgibbon have given the advice and why does Deputy Lemass give the advice? Because they find that at a particular moment there are certain opinions held which are not favourable to them personally, which are not held by them and which are hostile to their own opinions, and then they give the advice.  The advice will be neglected now as it was 140 years ago by the University of Dublin: the advice that a University should not interest itself in politics.</P>
    <P>John Fitzgibbon would have been quite willing that the University should have been altogether on the side of his political outlook.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce has offered his advice only to Dublin University and not to the National University.  The National University has, however, shown more difference of opinion amongst those who represent her here than Dublin University.  Is there anything in the advice at all?  There is nothing but the personal attitude of the man who is giving it in each case.</P>
    <P>It has been said, and said, I know, in all kindness, by Deputy Thomas Kelly, that those who left Dublin University, those who are concerned with her, &ldquo;have lost their influence in this country because you gave of your best <Col N="1513" /> to the building up of the British Empire and neglected your own country.&rdquo;  Deputy Kelly has disproved his own words out of his own mouth, because a few minutes before he had read out names to this House which showed that Dublin University had not neglected this country.  I am not going to repeat any of the names great in literature or science that he mentioned, but amongst those who were great in politics he mentioned Molyneux, Swift, Berkeley, Burke, Grattan, Curran, Tone, Emmet, Moore, Butt, and Thomas Davis.  He might have mentioned John Mitchel and John Redmond.  That list disproves his criticism that Dublin University has neglected her own country.  Those names I have mentioned are a fine contribution by any one institution to the national life of the country in which it is situated.</P>
    <P>We have been advised again, with special reference to Dublin University, that it has nothing to fear from the State or the public of Ireland.  No suggestion has been made, no plea has been made, that Dublin University has anything to fear.  That is not the claim that we who speak to-day for Dublin University make for the University. The University made it clear 20 years ago that she did not want any safeguard against the will of the Irish people as regards her future life.  She made that clear in an expression which caused an alteration in the Bill then before the Westminster Parliament dealing with the future government of this country.  She does not make any demand, now that she is in need of protection, that she needs any safeguard. What she does demand is that her sons should be free to give service to the country in every way in which they can do so, and one of those ways in which they believe they can be of service is by taking part in the political life of the country.  We do not ask for protection or for any favour except the favour to be allowed to work for our country in the best way we believe we can.  We believe that we represent certain classes which would otherwise find it difficult to obtain representation in a popular assembly such as this.  These classes have something useful to contribute <Col N="1514" /> to the life of the country.  I am not suggesting for a moment that these classes need any special protection against their fellow-countrymen, but they have an outlook and an ability which they are willing to bring to the service of the country and they ask that the channel should be left open by which it can be brought into the life of the country.</P>
    <P>We are told, and I think told in all sincerity, by a Deputy on the Government side that graduates of the Universities will be very welcome as candidates for ordinary constituencies; that the fact of being a graduate of a University would add to a man's claim in offering himself as a candidate.  That expression of opinion came from Deputy Donnelly.  It did not, of course, come from Deputy Corry, with whom the fact that a man was a graduate would go to prove, at any rate, that he was a &ldquo;dud&rdquo; and, therefore, of course, unsuitable as a candidate for the Dáil.  What Deputy Donnelly said is probably quite true, but I think he overlooked one point, that though certain graduates might have their claims increased by the fact that they were graduates, there are many who may be chosen for University constituencies who will give useful service to the country, who will add to the value of the debates here, but who will not be chosen or have any chance of being chosen for an ordinary territorial constituency. I shall make no reference to those who are still University representatives or members of the House, but anyone who reads the history of this country for the last 14 years must recognise that in the framing of the Constitution and in the working of government in the early years certain University members gave most valuable service in the setting up of the State. Nobody who reads the debates on the Constitution could fail to realise that two University members, who no longer represent the University, gave most valuable service&mdash;one a broad scholar with a thorough knowledge of constitutionalism, the other a trained practical constitutional lawyer.  Nobody can read the Constitution without seeing the marks of their minds and hands <Col N="1515" /> on the framing of the Constitution.  Of another who is gone from amongst us&mdash; my immediate predecessor&mdash;I have heard Deputies from all parts of the House speak in the highest terms of appreciation of the services he rendered here.  I am not claiming that University members have given more valuable service than others.  What I want to suggest is that of such men as I have suggested hardly one would have any chance of being chosen as a candidate for any ordinary constituency and, even if he had been chosen, hardly one would have any chance of being returned. They came here by another channel and they gave useful service.</P>
    <P>It has been assumed&mdash;I suppose rightly&mdash;that this Bill is going to pass the Dáil, and to many it will seem a waste of time that those who are opposed to that measure should have thought it necessary to speak on the matter at this late stage.  I think it is important that, however weak our arguments, however weak our words may be, we should put our convictions on record that the Dáil is about to take a step which will diminish its value as a debating and legislative assembly, which will decrease its reputation throughout the world, and, perhaps more important than either, will take away the last link in the unity of Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I heard Deputy Corry speaking in this debate.  He is opposed to University representation; that is what one would expect.  Lenin was opposed to University representation; that is what one would expect. But Lenin would, at least, support his case with a certain amount of sensible argument and a marked absence of slander of his political opponents, yet in the speeches made from the Government Benches in support of this defiance of all mandates we have the old cheap political confusion of religion and politics.  We have a vindictive attempt to mix up the religion of an individual with the politics of an individual, or to confuse the politics of an individual with the politics of his forefathers. I should like this country to judge the people who sit on these <Col N="1516" /> benches and on the Independent Benches by past generations, even by the recently past generation, with the Deputy Corries and the people who sit opposite.  Then we might know what is the real stock or where sits the real stock of those who not only stood for and advocated, but defended the union of this country with Great Britain.  I think the time has come when it would be well for all Parties and politicians on all sides to forget at least the divisions of the past if they cannot forget the divisions of the moment and to discard terms which have long since ceased to have any meaning in the public life of this country.  To charge a man, because his religion differs from that of the majority, with being a Unionist, knowing the meaning of Unionist&mdash;union between this country and Great Britain and the denial even of Home Rule to this country&mdash;is not fair to those of the minority religion in this country.  Is it assumed that Fianna Fáil alone have the right to receive and accept into their Party and to utilise the services of those whose religion differs from the majority and that those who serve Fianna Fáil will be immune from that type of slander, but that those of the minority religion who oppose Fianna Fáil will always be open to that type of slander? It is not fair and it is not in accordance with the spirit of fair play. Honest men opposite know that is not fair in politics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there is a case to be made for the denial of University representation to University graduates, let it be honestly made and let it be unassociated with slander of that type.  No case has been made, no case was made here, and you did not dare even to hint at the making of a case when you went before the people for support, and particularly you dared not hint at your intentions when you circularised University graduates at home and abroad for their support. When the graduates of one University, in blinkers, supported Fianna Fáil by a vote of 2 to 1, do the representatives of that University think that they are obeying a mandate or that they are in any way honest in <Col N="1517" /> view of the support they got from priests, doctors and engineers all over the world?  Do you think it is fair play that, having got their votes, you can callously walk into this House and sneer at the man in Ceylon having any voice in the affairs of this country? Do you sneer at the dollars of the man in New York when you want a newspaper subsidised in this country?  The man in Ceylon has as much right to have a voice in the affairs of this country as the man in New York has to subsidise propaganda in this country.</P>
    <P>If we are going to be quit of outside influence of any kind, let us be fair about it and get rid of all kinds of outside influence.  The young priest abroad, or the doctor or the mug, according to Deputy Corry, the University mug, who went to preach Christianity in China or Africa, has no right to have any link with the old sod of turf at home, even the link of a postal vote that may never arrive.  He is to be a pariah, an outcast.  Not only are we to make permanent the partition which we have inside this little island of ours at the moment, but we are to throw up further barriers between the people of our race at home and the people of our race abroad.  We have frequently heard the proud cry that we are not just a little country; that we are a motherland, and we are the home-place of a mighty broad-flung race.  Deputy Corry tells us we must disown all these who went abroad, whether to civilise the world, to preach Christianity, to extend the teachings of science, or to extend further the respect for the good name of this little island in which we live.  They are all to be outcasts, aliens and foreigners. Is it not enough to have that threat thrown at us from abroad without people like Deputy Corry getting up to throw it at us here at home?</P>
    <P>I think if University electors are sold and cheated by any people in this Assembly, it is not so much the Deputy Corrys.  We can attribute what he says to pump politics and ignorance. They are sold particularly by the direct representatives of University graduates. If there was a suggestion in this House that Galway would be disfranchised, or Clare or Kerry, what <Col N="1518" /> would happen?  You saw it within the last month.  Fianna Fáil, Labour and Fine Gael, the elected representatives of the threatened county, in spite of whips and bosses, would all combine together, and the combined strength of those representatives would save the threatened county.  But when it is a case of a University, when it is a case of the educated and the intelligent, the very diploma gives them the right to renage.  The very diploma gives them the right to sneak away from all their vote-given responsibilities.  The very diploma gives them a right to do what a more humble person would be ashamed to do.  If there is any argument in favour of disfranchising Universities, it is the behaviour of two of the representatives of the National University in this House.</P>

I am not so sure if some of those people, when they get the Deputy's speech, might not be inclined to say that there is room for some of them at home, if there could be an increase of the private chaplain system, in order that they might teach some people here what Christianity is.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had another defence of this Bill from a University representative here&mdash;a voice from the grave at last. I gathered that Deputy Mrs. Concannon is not in favour of destruction. What is this Bill?  Is it construction? Is it not the destruction of what was in the Constitution&mdash;a constitutional amendment&mdash;the destruction of certain rights given to certain people with regard to the franchise in this country &mdash;a separate electorate for the purpose of electing certain people?  But Deputy Mrs. Concannon says that she is not in favour of destruction.  What Deputy Mrs. Concannon spoke to to-day, I do <Col N="1521" /> not know, if it was not for this Bill; and if she spoke to this Bill it was certainly in favour of destruction.  We have discovered mandates for many things before.  I should like to hear Deputy Mrs. Concannon say that she had a mandate for voting for this.  Did she say, in her electoral address to the electors of the National University, that her view was in favour of the destruction of this electorate and the destruction of the people who were to represent the National University? Must she not admit, as she has admitted up to to-day by her silence and as her colleague has admitted by his continued absence during all the stages of the discussion on this Bill, that they did not dare before to put it to the electors whose franchises they were seeking, that one of their objects was&mdash;if it was their object at that time &mdash;to destroy the special franchise created for University people?  Does Deputy Mrs. Concannon accept the view put forward, in passing the Second Reading of this measure, by the Vice-President who handles it, that unless there is evidence that the particular interests voting have a peculiar national importance, then there is no case against the Bill?  Would she have said to the electors, when going before them on the last two occasions, that she went before them seeking their votes although she believed that they were of no national importance, that they were rather a privileged class and that the privilege ought to be taken away from them?  Did she agree that the franchise was an education franchise, as it was facetiously described by the Vice-President, or would she agree that it was not so much the subjects they learned but the inter-action of University life on certain people that made them good citizens and did give them importance?  Would the Deputy deny that and have said that she did not believe in that and that the franchise was a useless one that should be done away with?  What is the good of my asking had she ever put this before the electors of the University?  The election addresses were full of promises, full of all the magnificent things to be done for the University&mdash; the entire Gaelicisation of <Col N="1522" /> the University and all the rest of it&mdash; which were somehow to be engineered by voting for her and her colleague. What step was to be taken in regard to anything they promised?</P>
    <P>Deputy Mrs. Concannon got no instructions, from the people who were putting her forward for election, to insult those people, for that is what it would be regarded as at that time, by telling them that she would, if she could, have answered the arguments of the Vice-President in passing the Second Reading of this Bill.  Why should she put herself about to claim that she has a mandate from the electors of the University?  We have the definite statement at last here on the Committee Stage from the Vice-President in charge of the measure, when the question of a mandate or lack of a mandate was raised, that:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The question of a mandate has been emphasised.  I want to say that I do not claim or attempt to claim that we have any mandate for this.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Let us repeat that: &ldquo;I want to say that I do not claim or attempt to claim that we have any mandate for this.&rdquo; and look at what we are up against&mdash; a constitutional amendment.  The two people who represent the National University in this House, or at least two out of the three who represent the National University, do not allege that they asked the electors to vote for them with this in the back of their heads.  The Vice-President further said that his Party or the Government as a whole do not assert that they have any mandate for this.  Against that, there are the facts I recited before and that I think fit to put before the House again now; that the late Archbishop of Dublin started the agitation for the representation of the National University; that he called on the people of the country to meet and agitate for the purpose of getting University representation for the National University included in a certain measure which was then before the British Parliament; that, inspired by his words, a group of distinguished graduates of the National University met and passed resolutions; that the students of the University met through <Col N="1523" /> their Students' Representative Council and sent a deputation to the leaders of Sinn Féin and from those leaders, as was admitted during the last stage by Deputy Donnelly, they got a definite statement that University representation was to be a plank in the Sinn Féin platform; and that, in the meantime, when the Irish Party were fighting the measure then before the British House of Commons, this particular matter was brought before them and they agreed to force a Speaker's Conference on the Re-Distribution Bill or the Suffrage Bill, or whatever it was called, and eventually there emerged from that the placing of the Universities into that measure.</P>
    <P>I say, again, that you had then, in the years 1917-18, a definite and specific mandate from anybody who spoke authoritatively for University matters in favour of University representation. You had the then Archbishop of Dublin, the graduates of the National University, the students of the National University, the Sinn Féin Party and the Irish Party, all in favour of University representation.  From that day to this nobody has dared to go before the people and say that it was time that this University representation was done away with.  There was no Party found from that day to this having the brazenness to allege what the Vice-President thought fit to allege here, during the Second Reading of this measure, that it is a privileged franchise, that the people who enjoy it were not of sufficient national importance to have this privilege attached to them, that it was a so-called education franchise, and that, therefore, it ought to be abolished. From 1917-1918, when this first became a serious subject of controversy&mdash;and it only became a matter of controversy when it was in process of being raised &mdash;since that time it became a matter of settled policy for every Party in the country, and no political Party since that time has dared to say that they were against it.  It is in the Constitution, but although it is in the Constitution and although not a University representative can be found to speak <Col N="1524" /> for it, and although the Vice-President says that there is no mandate for it, we are going to pass it.</P>
    <P>They tell the House that they are doing it in the interests of democracy and because it is an educational franchise, but that it does not go far enough.  It is only a so-called educational franchise.  In any event, we know the real reason now.  It came out at the end of the last day's debate when the Vice-President said it would have been well if &ldquo;Deputies Thrift and Alton had thought of it at an earlier date.  They ought not to have waited to have something come along here that strikes home to themselves in a particular way before these thoughts of further consideration and postponement entered their heads.&rdquo; What that really means is: if they voted oftener with Fianna Fáil.  If they representatives of Trinity College, Dublin, had voted oftener with Fianna Fáil there would be no question of challenging the educational franchise or the privileges of a class and no question of whether there was a mandate or not.  That is the real reason&mdash;that they did not vote oftener with Fianna Fáil.  There is not a mandate claimed for that measure.  It is not even asserted that Fianna Fáil definitely put this before the electors.  There it was pointed out that the Trinity College representatives only voted&mdash;we can imagine the phrase used&mdash;against the national interests.  Now, having got their power through the medium of their promises about economy and the reduction of taxation, the saving of the annuities and better times for everybody, they come along to enforce their will upon unfortunate people like Deputy Mrs. Concannon.</P>

      <P>I repeat the word &ldquo;unfortunate.&rdquo;  It is a desperate thing to have to vote about a matter in favour of which one cannot say one word or in support of which one cannot use one argument.  It is a desperate thing for anybody, even the most remote back-bencher, to have to do it. It is all the more desperate that the representative of the so-called educated classes has the face to come here and confess that she has no argument in <Col N="1525" /> favour of the adoption of this measure. But the Party Whip was cracked.  The Trinity College Deputies have voted too often against Fianna Fáil.  No matter whether there is a mandate in its favour or not, or whether there was, in the memory of the oldest of those connected with the University, a meeting in its favour, there is one thing that stands out, and that is that Trinity College voted too often against the Government and, therefore, the National University has got to lose this privilege so recently fought for and so recently established.  It was definitely established with the good-will of everybody who represented the educated classes of people in this country.  That was established so late as 1917-18.  And this is what we are going to do now. Sacrifices have been called for.  There is no argument.  Nobody has attempted to take up the running in this form&mdash; that there is an Article in the Constitution that gives certain people certain rights with regard to voting for their representatives.  It is there in the Constitution, written into the Constitution. Faced with that situation&mdash; that the present Government are taking the initiative against something in the Constitution&mdash;one would think they would take the initiative in some other way and that they would advance their own arguments as to why this measure should pass.  Deputies know what the Vice-President said on the Second Reading Stage.  I leave it to him.  One thing of substance was dragged out of him in the Committee Stage&mdash;there is no mandate; and it is not disputed that the Constitution is going to be hacked.  Behind the backs of the University electors, their rights, even if you like to use the word, their privileges, are to be taken away from them.  And two of the votes cast for taking away those privileges are the votes bestowed on the people who rode into this House on the backs of the electors of the National University. Did those representatives come in openly and honestly saying they would wipe out this representation?  Instead of that they said they would benefit the University in a variety of ways.  Is this one of their ways of benefiting the University?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1526" /> Just one last remark.  Deputy Professor Alton&mdash;and I think he was joined by the other representatives of Trinity College&mdash;said in reply to the Vice-President, on the Second Reading, that he believed that the University of Dublin had nothing to fear from the consequences of being deprived of University representation.  The three Deputies said they have no fears.  It is wise and well that they should say that.  We have, at any rate, established here that state of things.  When I use the word &ldquo;we,&rdquo; I use it not as representing the present Government. What I mean is that one section of this community has made it clear to the minds of the three Trinity College Deputies here that they have nothing to fear from the general mass of the Irish people; that they have nothing to fear through losing their separate representation for the Dublin University. But I say this now, that if left to the mercy of some of the people who spoke in this debate I wonder whether they would have their fears resurrected.  The only thing they have said is that the Trinity representatives are sound as regards their ideas of the Irish people.  I believe the University has nothing to fear from the general mass of the Irish people.  Deputy Mrs. Concannon refrained from asking whether they wanted that privilege removed.  If that question had been put to the Irish people, her Party would have got their answer.  I think that the Trinity College view of what the people might have said is a sounder view than the view on which Deputy Mrs. Concannon and the Vice-President have acted.  I do not think that Trinity College has anything to fear from the mass of the people&mdash;if the mass of the people are asked what it is they want done.  But they have a lot to fear from people who got in on certain promises which have not been fulfilled.  They have a lot to fear when the Fianna Fáil Party operate, not along the lines of those promises, but along different lines which they refrained from indicating when they were looking for the votes of the Irish people.</P>

      <P>If there is one person in this House who could not <Col N="1527" /> speak or pretend to speak on behalf of the mass of the people in this country it is Deputy McGilligan, the gentleman who has just sat down, for he has never stood before the people, and has never been elected to any position or office of honour in this country. Having stood before the University electors on a very restricted franchise, let us say roughly 3,000 people, and got elected, he is not entitled to come here and speak for the mass of the people of this country.  That did not entitle him to do so, nor to speak on behalf of his Party.  If there is anybody who can speak on behalf of the mass of the people in this country it is the people now sitting on these benches, who have for a good number of years&mdash;as long as the Deputy can recollect at any rate&mdash;stood before the people and got elected and re-elected in the last few years especially by a vast majority, a bigger majority than Deputy McGilligan and his Party ever had or ever will have in this country. I am speaking on behalf of the mass of the people, and I have a right to speak for them, and the Deputy knows it. With the one possible exception of Deputy Cosgrave, there is no man in this House who has been longer before the electors than I have been.  I am possibly a year or so longer than Deputy Cosgrave.  I have been elected and re-elected, and I have fought every fight.  I therefore say that I can speak here on behalf of the people of Ireland, having faced the electorate repeatedly, and never having been defeated.  I can say with truth to the Deputies for Trinity College and to the people they represent in this country, &ldquo;Go to the people.  Stand up to the people, tell them what your views are; do not work for any class distinction nor in furtherance of any institution that wants to shut itself up in a class distinct from the mass of the people.  Go to the people.&rdquo;  I am satisfied that the people will not refuse to hear those who come to them in that way.  Those who go to them and tell them frankly their minds and their purposes and seek their suffrage on that basis need have no fear.  I say that it is not one like Deputy McGilligan who can speak <Col N="1528" /> on the matter, but one who has gone again and again to the people, and not on a selected franchise.  The only argument of Deputy O'Sullivan, who opened this debate on behalf of the Opposition, was that the two Deputies representing University College had not spoken in the debate.  That was all he had to say in favour of his idea that this Bill should not pass.  Well, Deputy Mrs. Concannon did speak afterwards in favour of the motion &ldquo;that this Bill do now pass.&rdquo;  I do not see that it matters.  Those Deputies had given their views.  Their views have been heard.  I am here at any rate as one spokesman of the Party to speak the views of the Party, to speak the views of the country, and to speak them with authority.  It does not matter what individual member of the Party the Deputies opposite may think important or unimportant.  If they wish to do so, they are free to speak.  There is no prohibition against anybody speaking, but they know that there are people here who will express their views.  They know there are people here who have authority to express their views, and who have all the mandate that is necessary from the country and from the Government of the day to voice the views of the vast majority of the people of this country who have elected this Government with a greater majority than that with which any Government Party was elected in this country since the establishment of the Free State.  There was not a measure that was introduced by Deputy Cosgrave or by Deputy McGilligan, when they were members of the Government here, that had the same mandate behind it as this measure or any other measure that this Government has introduced, because they never spoke for a majority of this House.  They never at any time had behind them, as a Party, a majority of this House.  They had to scrape up and pick up votes wherever they could in this House.  They never once had a majority; we have.  We can speak for a majority of the House and for a majority of the country.  I do not know what mandate more than that is necessary.  I said and I repeat that we had not a direct man- <Col N="1529" /> date.  At the general election we did not put this before the people as one of the primary issues.  That is admitted. If there is any weight &mdash;I do not think there is much in the <i>tu quoque</i> argument I wonder whether Deputy Cosgrave and his colleagues on the Front Bench had put before the people at the general election any one of the 17 Constitutional amendments which they passed, and asked for a mandate.  On not one solitary amendment of that kind which they introduced did they ask for a mandate from the people of this country when they were a minority Party.  That knocks the bottom out of any argument of Deputy McGilligan as to the weight to be attached to a direct mandate for this particular measure.  Deputy Maguire, the Attorney-General, and Deputy Mrs. Concannon can say, as I have said before, that Convocation of the National University has asked that this measure be passed.  Convocation of the National University represents the vast majority of the graduates of the University.  When a meeting is held, Deputy McGilligan knows better than I do that a copy of the agenda with the resolutions to be proposed is sent to every member of Convocation.  They are asked to attend and they are asked to vote.  If they do not please to vote, then a resolution of this kind asking for abolition of University representation is one which does not excite much enthusiasm or much interest.  The Deputy's argument is that they do not attend&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That is not my experience in this place.  You have heard Deputy McGilligan to-day, and you heard Deputy O'Sullivan to-day.  They are very distinguished members, one a professor, and the other an ex-member of the staff of a University, and Deputy McGilligan, a representative of a University as well.  Is there any keener Party politician in this country than either one or the other?  Deputy McGilligan speaks as one of the representatives of National University, and there is not a keener Party politician speaking for his Party and working for his Party than he, and there is no better seconder, and there has not been any better seconder, to that Party than Deputy Thrift in this House.</P>

      <P>I am sorry for my want of clarity.  I do not know that I need say any more.  The question of University representation is one that has been debated, and frequently debated, in many countries.  It is regarded as a question of principle, and it was as a question of principle that it was decided to introduce this measure.  We had it debated, I know, in our own circles.  I think it was Deputy Alton who asked whether the point of view of those who are in favour of University representation was heard.  I assure him it was, and if I am not mistaken, it was put forward by a graduate of his own University.</P>

      <P>It was debated and all sides were heard, I believe, and on principle, and not on personalities and not on the question of for or against Trinity College, was the decision to bring in this measure taken, so far as this Party and this Government are concerned.  While on the subject of Trinity College, I may say that I endorse what my colleague and namesake, Deputy Kelly, said with regard to Trinity College and Dublin University. I stand in the same position as he, and I have honour and respect for what has been done by graduates of Trinity College to help national feeling and national sentiment, and to bring honour and credit to this country.  All that has been done in that direction by men whom we all know and all sides, whatever their views may have been with regard to these men in the past, honour them to-day.  Trinity College, being the alma mater of these men, naturally shares in the glory and honour that attaches to these men, although I do not agree that it was because of the inspiration of Trinity College or Dublin University that these men were as national or as patriotic as their lives showed them to be afterwards.  All honour and glory to the college that <Col N="1534" /> produced them, and let credit be given to the college for whatever share is due to the teachings that made them such decent and patriotic Irishmen as they were.</P>

There is no restriction on them in regard to giving service to the country in any <Col N="1535" /> manner which they think right or proper, but both National and Dublin Universities, taking their spokesmen to be Deputy McGilligan on one side, and Deputy Thrift and his colleagues on the other, are asking for exceptional treatment and I do not think that in this country, taking affairs as we find them, exceptional treatment is called for.  I think both Universities are safe in the hands of the mass of the people and are not likely to be injured, one or the other.  I think that is all I have to say.  I have referred already to the question of the special committee that was set up by the late Government to examine this question.  That committee decided to recommend that University representation in this House should not continue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. O Ceallaigh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Just about two years ago I introduced in this House the Housing (Financial and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 1932, initiating the Government's Housing programme. The progress made since then in the provision of houses has justified, even I am sure in the eyes of our most severe critics, the Government's claim that the Bill provided a solution to a social problem which had baffled previous Administrations.  The unparalleled success of the Housing programme is shown in the work accomplished during the brief period since the Act of 1932 passed into law.  Since then 11,692 houses have actually been pleted, 15,836 houses are in progress and 7,120 houses are about to be begun, tenders having been accepted or invited for them.  This makes a total of 34,648 houses either completed, in progress or about to be begun and the magnitude of this work can be gauged when I remind the House that as against these 34,648 houses provided for during a period of two years only 26,000 houses were provided by the previous Administration during a period of ten years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the 34,648 houses completed, in progress or about to be begun there are 5,555 houses in respect of which lands have been acquired and plans approved and 6,744 houses included in schemes at present being prepared.  This makes the total of 46,947 houses under proposals initiated during the past two years.  The figures I have quoted include the activities of local authorities and I have mentioned these simply to give a complete picture of the work which has <Col N="1539" /> been accomplished and is in prospect by the Government.  The Housing (Financial and Miscellaneous Provisions) (Amendment) Bill, 1934, which I propose for Second Reading to-day, deals mainly with the provision of houses by private persons and public utility societies and I do not propose, therefore, to go further into the question of the activities of local authorities for whom provision still exists under the parent Act.</P>
    <P>It has become necessary to introduce the present Bill because the sum of £700,000 provided under the Act of 1932, for the payment of grants under Section 5 of the Act has been exhausted in the allocations made to private persons and public utility societies. Further, under the Act of 1932 houses provided by private persons and public utility societies must be completed before the 1st April, 1935, to qualify for grants.  The proposals of the present Bill are to extend to the 1st April, 1937, the date for the completion of houses by private persons and public utility societies and to provide a further sum of £700,000 for the payment of grants in respect of the houses.</P>
    <P>For the convenience of the House I will deal in detail with the activities of private persons and public utility societies up to date.  Section 5 of the Act of 1932 enabled the payment of grants to private persons and public utility societies for the provision of houses in urban or rural areas and to small farmers and agricultural labourers for the reconstruction of their dwellings.  To date grants have been allocated to private persons and public utility societies in respect of:&mdash; 4,361 new houses in urban areas, 5,853 new houses in rural areas, and 4,655 houses for reconstruction, making a total of 14,869 houses in all, of which 5,580 have actually been completed, the remainder being in progress. Of the total number of houses in respect of which grants have been allocated about 75 per cent. have been or are being provided by private persons and 25 per cent. have been or are being provided by public utility societies.  In urban areas the bulk of <Col N="1540" /> the allocations are to private persons only about 17 per cent. being provided by public utility societies but in rural areas about 50 per cent. of the new houses are being provided by public utility societies.  Of the new houses being provided in rural areas where it will be remembered special grants are available for houses for small farmers and agricultural labourers 46 per cent. are being provided by small farmers whose valuation does not exceed £15, 8 per cent. by small farmers whose valuation exceeds £15 but does not exceed £25, 15 per cent. by agricultural labourers and 31 per cent. by other persons of the rural community. Under the reconstruction provisions of the Act it is found that over 90 per cent. of the houses are being reconstructed by small farmers.</P>
    <P>In the present Bill it is proposed so far as urban areas are concerned to continue the sliding scale of grants introduced under the parent Act and to this end the grant of £50 at present available will be continued in respect of houses completed up to the 1st April, 1936, but will be reduced to £45 in respect of houses completed on or after that date but before the 1st April, 1937.  The object of this sliding scale is to encourage expedition in the provision of houses in urban areas where difficulties and delays experienced in the rural areas do not exist.  In rural areas the grants available under the parent Act will remain unaltered but the time for the completion of houses will be extended to 1st April, 1937.</P>
    <P>Under paragraph (i) of sub-section (1) of Section 5 of the Act of 1932, provision was made for the erection of houses by public utility societies in urban areas for letting at rents approved by the Minister.  Public utility societies have been slow to avail of these grants and only a small number of houses has been provided under this special provision. It is understood, however, that certain public utility societies have proposals under consideration and it is proposed, therefore, under the Bill to continue the time for the completion of houses under this paragraph to the 1st April, 1937.  Paragraph (j) of sub-section <Col N="1541" /> (1) of Section 5 of the Act of 1932, enabled the payment of grants to local authorities and philanthropic societies for the renovation of tenements. Difficulties have been experienced by local authorities in securing suitable properties at reasonable cost and in an experimental case compulsory purchase has been resorted to by the local authority.  It is hoped to secure good results from the initial experiment and the grants will be continued.</P>
    <P>Much good work is being done by public utility societies in rural areas in facilitating small farmers and agricultural labourers in the provision of houses and it is intended to continue to give the increased grant to these bodies to encourage and facilitate their efforts.  The reconstruction provisions of the Act of 1932 have been successful beyond expectations and it is interesting to note the extent to which the grants are being availed of by small farmers for the reconstruction of their houses.  The benefits derived by the farming community from these grants are seen in the fact that up to date about 4,000 grants have been allocated to small farmers representing as I previously pointed out over 90 per cent. of the total allocations in respect of reconstruction work.</P>
    <P>On the Second Reading of the Act of 1932 I stated that it was the intention of the Government that building work would be continuous until the total housing demands of the State are fully satisfied, and it is in pursuance of this intention that the present Bill is introduced to encourage private persons and public utility societies to continue as agencies of house supply.  In 1932 it was not expected that these agencies would be as responsive as they have proven themselves, and it was then believed that local authorities would have to undertake a much larger share of the burden of the provision of the total need.  It is gratifying, however, to find that private persons and public utility societies are able with the assistance of the grants to undertake the provision of a larger share of the need than it was thought they could be encouraged to undertake.  The provision <Col N="1542" /> of houses by private persons and public utility societies costs to central and local funds considerably less than the provision of houses by local authorities, and the greater the activities of the former agencies of supply the more free will the local authorities be to deal with the housing of the very uneconomic classes and the clearance of slums and insanitary houses.  These are some of the factors which have influenced the Government in their decision to continue the grant system to private persons and public utility societies under the present Bill. In addition to the continuance of the grants, other facilities such as the remission of rates and the issue of loans provided for under the original scheme will, of course, be continued.</P>
    <P>Since the passing of the Act of 1932 considerable progress has been made in the development of building materials industries, and during the past two years the percentage of Saorstát materials used for the provision of the average house has been increased from about 30 per cent. to 45 per cent. Further increases are expected as the housing programme develops.  Building costs do not appear to have undergone any substantial change during the past two years.  An inquiry by the Prices Commission into the cost of building materials and appliances is in progress and the findings of the Commission are awaited.  If it is found that undue profits are being made, suitable steps will be taken to deal with the matter. Furthermore, if it is necessary to extend the scope of the inquiry steps will also be taken to this end.</P>
    <P>I am sure that all Parties in the House will support this Bill so that the good work which was initiated in 1932 and which has gone ahead with such gratifying pace may be enabled to continue to the goal which all national minded members of the community are anxious to reach as quickly as possible &mdash;when every citizen will have a decent and healthy home in which to live his life and bring up his family in a way that will ensure a race healthy in mind and body.</P>

      <P>The Minister has again simply tried to show us the number of houses built, and the figures <Col N="1543" /> totalled in the great expeditious work of house building, and he asks the House to accept these as evidence of unparalleled success in the solution of the problem of providing houses for the poorer classes that has baffled previous generations.  But there are very many aspects of this problem that, in his two years' experience of the Department of Local Government, he might have discussed in greater detail.  The problem is a very big one, and the problem is one that has to be understood from quite a number of different points of view.  Except we get from the Department in close contact with it what are the actual results in actual houses built and improved conditions rather than mere numerical tables, which do not show what problem has been attacked or solved, we have no means of properly judging what has been done.  You have two important aspects of this great question.  You have the rural aspect, and the urban aspect of the problem.  Let us direct our attention to the rural aspect first, and see what the actual results there are.  They do not show the special result the Minister has talked about.  It may be that the full situation is not disclosed in the actual arithmetical table.  But if that is not so we would like to hear in a broader and more detailed way from the Minister what the actual situation is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Houses are built by private persons, public utility societies and local authorities. He told us that 26,000 houses only were built by the previous Administration in ten years; over 2,000 of these were put up in 1924, when there was a very serious amount of disturbance in the country and when those who were building, at that time, were faced with enormously high building costs.  2,110 houses were then built by the local authorities but the State provided two-thirds of the cost. So that when we come to deal with the work of the previous Administration we have to deal with the erection by private persons, public utility societies and local authorities of 24,000 houses over a period of eight years.  When we compare the work done by private persons in that eight-year period <Col N="1544" /> against the work done by private persons in the two years' period that we are now discussing, we find that private persons erected up to March, 1932, 11,588 houses, and that the number built by private persons during the last two years is one-ninth of that figure or 1,267 houses.  Public utility societies, in the eight-years' period, built 294 houses.  Coming to the two-years' period public utility societies built two-and-a-half times that number or 759 houses; so that there is an increase to that extent in the number of houses built by public utility societies.</P>
    <P>Local authorities built, in the eight-years' period, 532 houses as against 8,413 built in the two-years' period. The total of houses built in rural areas by private persons, public utility societies and local authorities is 12,414, in the eight-year period, and in the period ending 31st March, 1934, the number was 2,869.  That is less than one-fourth of the numbers built in the eight-years' period.  Now that is just an arithmetical statement.  When we come to see where these houses were built, and the extent to which we are helping the parts of the country badly housed, and the people badly housed, then we come to the real problem and the real work.  The census volume for 1926, dealing with the housing position in the country, provides a picture of the over-crowding in rural areas.  The Minister will remember that in the map that accompanied the notice issued from the Department of Industry and Commerce in connection with that volume, the whole of the West of Ireland from the North of Donegal to the South of Kerry, including Leitrim, Sligo, Roscommon, Clare and Kerry, provided one black area.  The area of the country in which the percentage of the rural population was living, more than two persons to a room, ran from 25 per cent. in Clare to 33 per cent. in Mayo and 43 per cent. in Donegal.  The average was found to be 25 per cent. over the whole of that area.  Now, when we look to see how the present house building, and the new houses, have improved the situation in these areas of bad housing conditions, we find that the number of <Col N="1545" /> houses built by private persons, public utility societies and local authorities in Donegal, during the two years ended on the 31st March, 1934, is less than one-seventh of the total number of houses built in the eight years previously. In Leitrim the number was less than one-ninth, in Sligo less than one-fifth, in Mayo less than one-fourth, and in Galway less than one-twelfth. In Galway, 979 houses were built in the eight-year period ended March, 1932, whereas only 78 houses have been built in Galway in the two years ended March, 1934.  In Clare, the number of houses built was less than one-fifth of the number built in the eight-year period and, in Kerry, less than one-sixth. If we turn to the rural areas which are shown by these returns to be the best housed areas&mdash;Wexford, Carlow, Kilkenny and Waterford&mdash;we find that the building of houses, as compared with the eight-year period, has progressed very much more satisfactorily than it did in the badly-housed areas.  We find that the total number of houses built in rural areas in Wexford during the two-year period is, approximately, twice the number built in the eight-year period.  In the eight-year period 136 houses were built by private individuals, one by a public utility society and none by local authorities.  In the two-year period, 27 houses were built by private persons, none by public utility societies and 224 by local authorities.  In Carlow the number of houses built is 15 as against 33 in the eight-year period; in Kilkenny, 65 as against 133; in Waterford, 21 as against 78; in South Tipperary, 18 as against 111; in North Tipperary, 55 as against 195.  The general position is disclosed that, whereas in the rural areas that were outstandingly good as regards the housing of the rural population&mdash;such as Wexford&mdash;the building of houses has quickened, in the bad areas the completion of houses has progressed at a much slower rate than that which obtained in the eight-year period ended 31st March, 1932.</P>
    <P>The Minister speaks of a very valuable work being done by way of reconstruction.  If we look at the amount of money actually spent on <Col N="1546" /> reconstruction work in the poorly housed areas of the West, stretching from Donegal to Kerry, and compare it with the area of Louth, Monaghan and Cavan, we find the extraordinary fact that the Western area from Donegal to Kerry, with a rural population of 872,000, has been provided with £42,684 in reconstruction grants, whereas the Louth&mdash;Monaghan&mdash; Cavan area, with a rural population of 167,000, has received £47,176.  It will be said that there are additional housing or improvement grants given under the Housing (Gaeltacht) Act in the West, but the figures provided by the Minister for Lands in respect of that type of work make no material difference to the facts which I want to put before the Minister.  My contention is that the money which is being spent on reconstruction is not in any reasonable proportion assisting the part of the country that is badly housed and in which money is less easily obtainable either for building or improving of houses than it is in other parts.</P>
    <P>The Minister tells us that private persons and public utility societies still continue to do a lot of valuable work which might otherwise fall on the local authorities.  It is not clear that private persons are still continuing to build at the rate they were building in the past, although the financial inducements are considerably stronger under the last Act than they were previously.  We find that the public utility societies which are doing anything are established in County Mayo, where they built 319 houses; in Kerry, where they built 102 houses; in Galway, where they built 36 houses; in Clare, where they built 64 houses, and in Limerick, where they built 24 houses.  When we come to Wicklow, Carlow, Kilkenny, Waterford and Wexford, we find that there are no public utility societies working at all.  In North Tipperary, there is no public utility society working either.  A public utility society which built four houses in South Tipperary is the only kind of utility society that is working there.  It could not be said that, under the provisions of the Minister's Act, public utility societies have developed regionally in <Col N="1547" /> the West as against any particular part of the East, but they have developed in particular counties.  Having regard to the size of the grants given to public utility societies and, particularly, to societies building the lower valued houses for agricultural workers, it would be interesting to hear from the Minister what general purpose the utility societies are serving other than getting increased grants for their members. I admit that, if public utility societies could be got to undertake the building of houses for agricultural labourers without any drain directly on the local authority for maintenance and, perhaps, for loss in rates which prove to be uncollectable, it would be a most valuable development, but we have no information which would lead us to believe that there was that institutional development.  One would be inclined to think that these societies were simply a grouping-together of people around one particular builder or supplier for the purpose of getting increased grants for the building of houses.</P>
    <P>When we turn to the building of houses for agricultural workers by the local authorities, I think that some additional information might be given us by the Minister.  The Minister informed a Deputy in the House yesterday that he would not be able for a week or so to give him some information with regard to the rents of labourers' cottages in a certain number of counties, or to indicate the burden that was falling upon the rates in connection with the building of them.  The amount of money that is falling on the local ratepayers in connection with these cottages, and the capacity of agricultural labourers to pay the rents, are matters on which, I think, at this stage, after two years' experience of the working of the Principal Act, after the building of a certain number of houses by some boards of health, and after, no doubt, careful examination of a number of additional schemes in the Minister's Department, something further ought to be heard from the Minister.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1548" /> The Minister said the other day, in reply to a Parliamentary Question, that if we take the County Limerick, it was proposed to build 973 additional labourers' cottages there.  It is well to point out that the arrears on the present labourers' cottages in that county amounted to £3,232 on 31st March, 1932, and that they had risen to £7,008 by 31st March, 1934.  In the County Limerick 12 cottages were built during the last two years, and we now have it that 973 additional cottages are proposed to be built there.  At the same time, we have the statement from the Minister that the arrears on labourers' cottages in the County Limerick have risen by the enormous figure I have quoted&mdash;by nearly £4,000 above what they were on 31st March, 1932.  The Minister told us that they proposed to build 432 new labourers' cottages in County Galway.  The arrears in that County have doubled during the last two years.  They have increased from £830 to £1,900.  In County Cork they propose to build 168 cottages.  Over the whole of the County Cork the arrears have risen from £5,994 at 31st March, 1932, to £10,107 two years afterwards.  There is hardly a county, with the honourable exception of the County Dublin and, perhaps, Roscommon, where the arrears on labourers' cottages have not risen substantially during the past two years.  The arrears which stood at £34,000 on 31st March, 1932, now stand at the figure of £56,000.</P>
    <P>These arrears are disclosing themselves at a time when the wages of agricultural workers were never lower. The fact is disclosed in the <i>Irish Trade Journal</i> for September last, that as between the 11th July, 1931 and 5th July, 1933 the wages of agricultural workers on the average throughout the whole of Leinster fell by 2/3; in Munster they fell by 2/6; in Connacht they fell by 1/9 and in Ulster by 1/-, the average over the whole country being 2/3.  If the Minister, as he told us, is proposing to sanction in the case of local authorities the building of a large number of labourers' cottages, it would be interesting to hear what the rents of them are going to be.  I have found people in the country who say that the <Col N="1549" /> Minister is now sanctioning the erection of labourers' cottages at a rent of 1/6.  They expect that the Government are bearing a much bigger part of the loan charges than the present Act allows them to bear.  That, apparently, is not possible, and the Minister is not proposing to change that under this Bill.  Therefore, the inevitable conclusion is that the additional burden is going to fall on the local rates.  Those responsible for the local rates do not know that.  It seems to me that, in a certain number of cases where decisions have already been taken and rents fixed, the local authority does not yet know, although it ought to, what the amount of the capital cost falling on the local authority is, in fact, going to be.</P>
    <P>The present cost of building these cottages, so far as we know, is such as to increase the rents very considerably to the occupier.  Obviously when the wages of the occupier are reduced to-day as compared with two years ago, he will not be in a position to pay. In addition, we have the arrears of rents increasing by the enormous figure I have quoted.  In these circumstances I think it is absolutely essential that we should hear from the Minister what his policy is in the case of boards of health building labourers' cottages, and what he expects from public utility societies in a way that will relieve boards of health possibly of the burdens, responsibilities and anxieties as regards the future that, otherwise, might fall on them.</P>
    <P>I do not think that the position with regard to building in the urban districts is any more satisfactory.  In the eight-year period ended 31st March, 1932, private persons had built 3,128 houses. In the two-year period ended 31st March, 1934 they had built less than one-fifth, or 694 houses.  Public utility societies in the eight-year period had built 1,222 houses, and in the two-year period they had built one-seventh of that figure, 175 houses.  In fact, public utility societies that are developing in some strange way in, say, Mayo and Kerry, are fading out of existence in the urban districts where you might expect them to develop.  In the case of local authorities, they built 6,481 houses in the eight-year period as against <Col N="1550" /> 4,076 houses in the two-year period or, approximately, six-tenths of the number that had been built in the previous eight years.  Therefore, the position is that there is less building by private persons and by public utility societies.  They have built less than one-seventh as compared with the eight-year period.  In fact, they have practically vanished.  Beyond, I think, four houses built in Drogheda and four built in Cork the remainder of their 175 houses were built in the City of Dublin.</P>
    <P>Apart from that development with regard to private and public utility societies there is a real mystery in the case of local authorities.  The Minister has power under Section 6 (1) (a) (i) of the Act to pay 66? per cent. of the annual loan charges in the case of houses built by local authorities.  The section says that the Minister can give a grant not &ldquo;exceeding 66? per centum of such annual loan charges, where the Minister is satisfied that such houses have been provided for the acommodation of persons displaced by any operations of such local authority under the said Acts.&rdquo;&ldquo;The accommodation of persons displaced!&rdquo; The understanding was, I think, that this larger sum was to be given towards the building of houses by local authorities where houses were being demolished because they were unsatisfactory or where persons were being displaced from an overcrowded area which the local authority were taking control of from that particular point of view.  As I say, out of the total of 4,076 houses actually completed by local authorities, 3,612 were given grants by the Minister of the higher amount.  They got 66? per cent. of the total capital cost, whereas if the local authorities were building houses in the ordinary way they would only get one-half of that amount.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us that in the case of the 3,612 houses for which this additional displacement grant is being given 2,592 houses have been ordered to be destroyed, but that in fact only 640 have been destroyed.  The proportion between the 2,500 and the 3,600 is perhaps a reasonable proportion of demolitions, when the matter of providing houses for persons taken from <Col N="1551" /> overcrowded areas is taken into consideration. But over 2,500 of these houses were completed before the 31st December and, nevertheless, the Minister tells us that only 640 houses have actually been destroyed.  When we look further into the matter the thing becomes even more difficult to understand.  In Sligo, 179 houses were built and the Sligo Corporation were given the benefit of this section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister only ordered 36 houses to be destroyed.  So that here you have a balance of 143 houses built in Sligo for which the State is paying two-thirds of the capital cost.  In Wexford, 56 houses were built; 25 houses were ordered to be destroyed; and only two houses have been destroyed.  On the other hand, in Athy 93 houses have been built and the Minister has ordered the destruction of 227.  That may anticipate some further building there.  In Tullamore, 52 houses have been built and given the benefit of that section, but the Minister is not asking any houses to be destroyed.  When you look at the local authorities who have been given simply the 33? per cent. towards their loan charges, and when you look at places like Sligo which are given the 66? per cent.; when you see the discrepancy in these cases, and then see the discrepancy between the number of houses ordered for destruction and the number of houses actually destroyed, a statement from the Minister as to the whole control of the operation of that Section 6 (1) (a) (i) seems to be necessary.  There is a very considerable amount of money involved and I take it the extra grant in the case of these houses was meant to a large extent to compensate the authority for the destruction of these houses, for the work of removing the debris, making the area from which the houses were removed a sanitary area, and making it ready for another building scheme.  It seems to shroud the whole of the financing of the housing schemes of urban authorities with a very considerable amount of mystery which ought to be removed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1552" /> The Minister, I think, will admit that if public utility societies in some areas are relieving the local authorities of the burden that would otherwise fall upon them, the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act, in respect of another section of the people who are at such a point that they are very badly catered for in the matter of housing, is also relieving the local authorities of a very considerable amount of anxiety and expense, and also relieving the Minister of the problem of legislating for a particular type of person.  I do not think that any investment which the Dublin Corporation have made of their money has been more secure than the money which they have invested under the Small Dwellings Act.  I do not think it can be said that the Dublin Corporation have lost very many pounds in advancing money to persons under that Act. At present, however, a very large number of persons, who have applications in with the Dublin Corporation for grants to enable them to purchase new houses which are actually being built or have been built, are being told by the Corporation that no money is available for them.  That, if it continues, will certainly hold up a certain amount of very valuable house building in Dublin; will hold up house building for a class of people who particularly need to be catered for because they fall between the building speculator, who wishes to build an £800 house and the local authority which builds for the ordinary worker.  If the Minister can assist the Dublin Corporation to get over whatever difficulty they may have in meeting this particular class of person, he will do a considerable amount of good, both for the building trade and for a large number of people who are prepared to shoulder the responsibility of owning their own homes.</P>
    <P>If that is the position with regard to the Small Dwellings Act in Dublin, it would be interesting to hear from the Minister to what extent the extension of the Act to rural districts is helping local authorities to rid themselves of some of the burden and responsibility for housing.  I should also like to know whether he is in a position to say how many houses built by private individuals or public utility societies <Col N="1553" /> in rural areas are being financed by local authorities under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act.  Again I say that the Minister has simply given us the big lump figures of his achievement and the bigger lump figures of his expectations.  Something that would put a little more flesh and skin on the whole story of the position with regard to housing is wanted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>Even taking the number of houses built in the last few years, as compared with the number built in any two-year period mentioned by the Deputy, let us say from 1924 to 1926, the comparative figures for any of those years will bear out and be in relation to the totals that I gave. For the years 1922-1926, 5,312 houses were completed by all agencies as against 11,692 in the last few years. It is quite true that in certain areas there has not been the same amount of building by private persons and public utility societies as during a certain number of the years in the reign of the last Government; but as against that there has been a vastly increased rate of building by local authorities and the provision of houses for the poorer classes of persons.  These are the people in particular that we set out to cater for under this Bill.  It is admitted that houses are necessary for the better classes and the better paid artisan, but our chief object was to tackle the slum problem.  I think we have been doing that successfully, not everywhere, but in most places, during the past two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are some local authorities both in urban and rural areas that have not been induced to do their duty.  I hope that a new spirit will animate them in the future.  We hope it will not be necessary to put in certain clauses that are in the 1932 Act, taking the provision of houses out of their hands.  I would be loath to do that.  I would rather see the local authorities doing the work themselves. The Deputy pointed out districts where work in the way of house supply had not gone on during the past couple of years at a rate that ought to have been pursued, but in every case, in <Col N="1554" /> both urban and rural areas, no opportunity has been lost to endeavour to get the local authorities, whether boards of health, town councils or any other bodies, to interest themselves. We have pressed them by sending them letters, and by sending officials of the Department to interview them.  We have sent members of the Housing Board to interview them and point out the advantages offered to them and to point out their duty.  We have tried and in some cases we have failed.  I do not know why.  I have an idea that in some places it was probably due to politics, but it was not that cause everywhere.  We intend to continue to try to get every local authority to do its duty in the matter of housing.</P>
    <P>Reconstruction grants have been availed of&mdash;I think the Deputy is quite right&mdash;in some of the counties in the eastern part of the country to a much greater extent than in the west.  Of course, that is a matter in which we have no choice but to offer the people the facilities.  We have put them before the people through the medium of publicity. I have used the Press and the officials of the Department.  I have got officials to speak over the radio in order to tell the people, anyone who would care to listen, about the grants and the facilities for house-building that are available and also the grants for the reconstruction of houses.  I would be very happy to see reconstruction grants made more use of in all parts of the country.  The public utility societies, where they are active &mdash;and they are not active in as many places as I would like to see them&mdash;have been of considerable advantage. Many people, particularly in rural areas, are not so used to dealing with the various forms necessary to be filled and the machinery that has to be put into operation.  Where they can get a utility society with an intelligent and active secretary it helps them very materially in pushing ahead their claims both for grants for new houses and reconstruction grants.  I would gladly avail of the criticism of the Deputy regarding the inactivity of these societies in many areas in order to urge them to take greater heed of <Col N="1555" /> what is offered to them and to use the facilities afforded.  It is quite true, as the Deputy says, that arrears of rent on labourers' cottages have gone up in the last two years.  We have had to take serious notice of that matter. I cannot give the exact reason, but I am inclined to think that in some areas it was due to laxity on the part of collectors.  Believing that to be so, in some areas we have had to instruct local authorities to take very strict and drastic action against collectors. In some cases, where action of that kind has been threatened, there has been in the last few months a considerable improvement in the payment of rents on labourers' cottages.</P>
    <P>The work of destruction of condemned and insanitary dwellings is going ahead.  Admittedly, it is slow, but no grant will be paid to any local authority for the building of a new house where the condemned house, the house declared to be insanitary by the local authority, has not been destroyed. There is, admittedly, a considerable difference between the number of houses that have been approved for grants and those where the houses have not been demolished.  I will give the assurance to the House that we are watching that matter very closely and the grant will not be paid where an insanitary house that ought to have been demolished has not been demolished.  We had some difficulty, particularly in Sligo and one or two other places, in getting the law carried into effect in that matter.  We intend to insist that the law will be carried out and that these houses will be destroyed.</P>

    <P>No advances out of this sum of £200,000 will be made on any except newly-erected houses being sold for the first time, the borrower in each case being the first resident.  Eighty-five per cent. of the market value of houses up to £600 market value will in future be advanced out of this extra sum.</P>
    <P>In this connection, it may be noted that the Small Dwellings <Col N="1557" /> Acquisition Acts are operated by local authorities at their own option and the Minister has no power to compel local authorities to operate the Acts or to act himself in the event of their failure to do so.</P>

      <P>Can the Minister say if that statement comes as a relief to persons who, on the 28th June, were told that no money was available for them under these Acts and their application fee of two guineas would be returned?  There are large numbers of such persons.</P>

      <P>I cannot fix the date.  I cannot say on what date the applicants might have been told.  There was, recently, I know, a date where applicants were told that all the money had been allotted.  The question of raising further sums for grants under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act is at present receiving the earnest consideration of the City Manager, and he has, I believe, been in consultation with some of the officials of my Department on that matter.  I am inclined to think that it would not cover any of the cases of people who would apply in or about the 28th of June.</P>

      <P>That £200,000 was voted the other day.  It is to be borrowed later on.  Leave was given to borrow a further £200,000 for the operation of this Act.  They are not satisfied with that and are going to ask for another £250,000.  That will mean £800,000.  You have got to consider that our work is for the poor in Dublin especially.  I have no great interest in the people who can pay £1,000 or £800 for a house.  I think, having regard to the very large sum which it would take for slum clearance, the Minister ought to say that this further £200,000 is quite sufficient for the present and for a considerable time to come.</P>

      <P>May I interrupt the Minister for a moment?  I only wish to say a word with his consent.  Alderman Tom Kelly has mentioned a point on which I would be anxious to have the Minister comment.  He has mentioned that under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act every pound that the Corporation have provided for this is coming out of the pocket from which money would be provided for slum clearance, but where there is such congestion as there is in Dublin, surely the people who move into a new house will vacate some other house and provide more room.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasKelly" hpid="Mr. T. Kelly Mr. T. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but at a higher rent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, it will be at a lower rent if it has to be, and I think it is just as well that the Minister should take the point into consideration, that in providing money for these houses he is helping to solve the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Mulcahy and Deputy Dockrell that the question of refusing sanction for further loans under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act is one that must be very carefully considered indeed, because, while there are several good reasons, one is that we are providing housing accommodation for people who have to be housed anyway, and, secondly, we are providing employment. Quite a big number of tradesmen are occupied at present on houses that are being built which would not be built were it not for the loans granted under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act, and it would <Col N="1559" /> have a very serious effect on the housing conditions and on the question of employment if we were suddenly to shut down in the matter of grants under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act.</P>
      <P>There is another point to be borne in mind.  While the sums advanced add to the total debt of the municipality of Dublin, it is a remunerative debt.  The people to whom these grants are made are paying interest on them.  It adds to the sum total of the debt of the city in that way, if you like, but that money is being paid, and I think that Deputy Mulcahy is right in saying that if any money has been lost it is a very small sum.  With regard to the question of the operation of the Act in rural areas, I am afraid that difficulties have arisen that I am finding great obstacles in overcoming.  Legal difficulties have arisen in the last six months or so which have practically put the Act out of operation.  Points have been raised by legal advisers of different county councils with regard to the operation of the Act in some counties and, during the course of its operation, some bright legal mind discovered some flaws in the title of land rented by the Land Commission and rented in other ways that made it very difficult for the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act to operate. We have been trying for the last six months, with the help of all the legal advice it is possible to get both inside and outside the Department, to get over these difficulties, but we have not found a way out yet.  For the time being the operation of the Act has had to slow up in several counties where these points have been raised, but I hope that we will be able to find a way to get over the difficulties and put the Act in operation again as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>I wish the Minister would consider the point I raised on the Second Reading.  That is a matter with which I am mostly concerned. As I told the House on the Second Reading, I do not want to discuss this Bill at all from the Party point of view.  But I am really perturbed as to the dangers involved in legislation of this kind, especially if there are a number of Parties supporting the Government or a number of people on whom the Government is depending.  The Government may be depending on a <i>bloc</i> to maintain its position, and I do not think it would be possible in the circumstances to avoid corruption.  It would, at all events, be exceedingly difficult.  The Minister recognises that, even for his own comfort, this is a very bad provision in the Bill.  Whether the Minister is in the position he now holds and which he hopes to occupy for a longer time, and which I hope he will not, or whether a better Government will be in office&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;I think he would be in a very bad position under the provision in this section.  I know our greatest boon while we were the late Government was the Act setting up the Appointments Commissioners. I think the Minister would, from the point of view of his own comfort alone, be in a much better position if we would leave a decision of this kind in the hands of an expert committee which would be in a semi-judicial position.  It is not from the point of view of the comfort of the Minister that I urge this, but from the point of view of general policy.  I think there are dangers inherent, as the Minister himself acknowledged in his replying speech when this Bill was last before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are undoubtedly dangers inherent in this type of legislation.  I <Col N="1573" /> do not want to stress the point but there are these dangers there.  I think these dangers could be greatly diminished if the Minister would consent to have some kind of judicial or semi-judicial body set up to decide this matter of imports independent of the pressure that can be brought to bear upon members of the Government and members of Parties.  I think, unless something of that kind is done, the future will show that all kinds of pressure will be brought to bear on members of the Government and members of Parties.  That pressure will become almost intolerable or it will become successful.  In either case it would be most regrettable.  A certain amount of danger is always inherent in this particular type of legislation but I think it can always be diminished if a body of the type I suggest could be appointed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy appreciates that there are two decisions which arise, and I am not quite clear as to which of them he has related his remarks.  The first is the political decision&mdash;that a certain commodity shall be declared to be a reserved commodity and consequently shall become subject to this Bill.  That is a decision which has to be come to by the Executive; but effect cannot be given to it until approved of by the Dáil.  Following that, another series of decisions become necessary, namely, to whom is the licence going to be issued or to whom are the licences going to be issued to engage in the production of the commodity that has been declared a reserved commodity?  It is at that stage, I presume, that the Deputy anticipates that undesirable pressure will be exercised.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That seems to me to be the danger point&mdash;if there were a limited number of licences to be issued and there was competition among competing firms for these licences.  But that is a position of affairs that is not likely to arise because in relation to the commodities that I contemplate Orders under this part of the Bill will <Col N="1574" /> be made, the trouble will be to get somebody to engage in the production rather than to choose between a number of competitors.  There are various safeguards; first, that this part of the Bill is intended not to apply to any commodity that is not manufactured in the Saorstát at present or at the date on which the Order in respect of that commodity is made.  There is a phrase there that is causing Deputies concern. The words are &ldquo;not being manufactured in Saorstát Eireann to a substantial extent.&rdquo;  That is a safeguarding phrase.  It is possible that a better form of words could be used, a form of words which would more clearly express the idea intended&mdash;that no Order should be made in respect of any article manufactured at all except in a purely experimental way in the Saorstát.  If nobody is engaged in the production of the commodity for sale on a commercial scale, then I think no Order under this part of the Bill could or should be made in respect of that commodity.  There will be a couple of weeks between the Committee Stage and the Report Stage of this Bill and if I can find a better form of words or a more limiting phrase than that in the Bill I will move an amendment on Report Stage.  I invite Deputies to consider that point of view.  I consider there must be some safeguarding phrase or otherwise some difficulty might arise if Orders were made under that Bill and if somebody came forward and said he had manufactured a commodity in a workshop attached to his residence in a purely experimental way and claimed damages in consequence of the making of the Order and thus prevent the development of an industry concerned with the production of these commodities in a commercial scale in the Saorstát.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think there is any machinery which could be established to safeguard the issue of licences under this part of the Bill&mdash;that is, licences to engage in the manufacture of a commodity in respect of which an order has been made&mdash;that would be more likely to be proof against undesirable influences than the machinery contemplated in the Bill.  I cannot believe it <Col N="1575" /> is possible to get any body of people who will be so immune from the possibility of pressure of all kinds that they are to be preferred in that connection to the Executive Council of the State, who, after all, are carrying on their activities in relation to matters of this kind in the full light of publicity, and who are accountable for all their actions to the elected representatives of the people, and ultimately to the people themselves.  In this connection there is the fullest publicity.  The fact that the order is made is an indication to all interested parties that licences are about to be issued to engage in the manufacture of the commodities subject to the order.  All parties concerned can at that stage, if they so wish, make application for the issue of a licence. The licence is made public; it is made subject to conditions which are set out on the face of the Bill, and is available for inspection by interested parties. That machinery is, I think, as effective as any we can get.  I must say I am not a hundred per cent. enthusiastic over this part of the Bill.  I think it is necessary, having regard to the difficulties of securing the establishment in this State of certain industries, but the number of industries in respect of which those difficulties arise is exceedingly limited.  They are only those industries in respect of which it is not possible to contemplate more than one or two units of an economic size operating, having regard to the limitation upon the market here.  The existence of this part of the Bill is going to lead to representations for the making of an order on behalf of everybody proposing to engage in a new industry here, and it will necessitate the preparation of a printed refusal form in my Department to be issued automatically to all those people.  I am anxious to be in the position of telling those people that I have no power to make the order which they desire.  We have brought it in that it is the Executive Council is to make the order, and that it will not become effective until the Dáil has approved of it.  That is one safeguard. If Deputies can get me a form of words which will confine this part of the Bill to such industries as cement, where very heavy capital expenditure <Col N="1576" /> is involved and where the economic unit is a considerable affair, so that the number that could be established in relation to a particular industry in this country is very limited, I shall be very glad to accept that form of words, and rule out the possibility of orders being made under this part of the Bill in respect of any industry where it is possible to have a number of factories engaged in it, working on an economic scale and requiring the combined production of them all to supply the requirements of the market here.  The alternative to inserting Part III in this Bill is to contemplate the introduction, in relation to main industries, of legislation of the type we have already had enacted in relation to the cement industry.  I do not see that there is any advantage in necessitating the preparation of separate legislation, having regard to the fact that an order under this Part of the Bill does not become effective until the Dáil has approved of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister gave me this opportunity as, apparently, I was not quite clear on the matter.  It is precisely more, I might say, at the initial stage than ultimately that I would expect corruption or attempted corruption.  The Minister distinguished between the two stages, the first stage being the making of the order that a certain commodity is a reserved commodity; and the second stage, that order having been made, who is to get the monopoly.  May I divide them into those two stages? I expect any amount of pressure so far as the first stage is concerned.  The Minister says he can only see one or two instances of pressure.  It does not depend upon what the Minister sees; it depends upon what other people see.  The Minister knows perfectly well that there are any number of people willing to see any number of opportunities in this Bill for declaring certain commodities reserved under this part of the Bill.  In fact, in the concluding portion of his statement, he acknowledged that there are any number of people who will be anxious to get certain commodities declared reserved commodities&mdash;so many that he will have to get a printed form saying &ldquo;Nothing doing.&rdquo;  That is precisely <Col N="1577" /> where the pressure will start.  The Minister will say &ldquo;I cannot make it. The Dáil will make it.&rdquo;  Now we have had a certain amount of experience of this Dáil in resisting the Minister's proposals of various kinds.  I think the Minister has been two and a half years in office.  When did the Dáil rise up in their indignation and reject anything which the Minister has brought forward? I have had occasion to complain, as the Minister knows, in connection with other Bills, that the Dáil is becoming merely a registration body. They do not listen to anything.  They simply come in and do what the Minister tells them.  Does the Minister think that the excuse put forward by him to, shall I say, an enterprising manufacturer&mdash;we had better avoid offensive terms&mdash;or would-be manufacturer, that the Dáil has to pass it or that the Executive Council has to pass it, will save him from pressure? First of all they will say &ldquo;The Dáil will back you up.&rdquo;  They will go in then and lobby the members of the Executive Council.  Remember, I am not speaking now of the present or the past; I am speaking of what I fear may occur.</P>

      <P>I do not suggest legislation.  I will get on to that. Any amount of pressure will be brought to bear.  If people are serious in their belief that the Dáil has really a voice in the matter, as it may have, if proportional representation, as I suggested the last day, works out and you have a number of Parties, then pressure will be brought to bear on the Parties.  It does not matter whether there is a case on the merits for declaring a commodity reserved or not. Pressure will be determined according as to whether or not people see an opportunity to make money out of it. What I suggest, and what other people found necessary I think in order to save themselves, is that the primary decision in this matter should be with a kind of commission of experts, <Col N="1578" /> independent individuals who will investigate it, and unless it has passed them the Government should not have any power to bring it before the House. If the Minister thinks it necessary that no such order should pass without the Government's consent, let that come after the examination by an independent body of experts&mdash;a body independent of pressure from the Government or anybody else.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>You have it in the case of the judiciary.  They are independent of the Executive Council. For instance, take the argument which the Minister used about the Government being responsible to the people; that would apply equally well for the abolition of the judiciary.  Let the Government decide who is to go to jail and who is not, because ultimately they are responsible to the people and will be called to task by the people if they abuse their powers.  You can get a body of the kind I have mentioned, which will not be amenable to pressure. Men of that kind are not amenable to pressure, because they are independent of Parties.  You will not get a House, and you will not get a Government, ultimately, in the long run, especially if it is made up of composite parts, as may easily happen, to be independent of pressure.  You have it in the case of tariffs in various countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, excuse me. You might as well say that an independent judiciary is an argument in favour of the abolition of Governments. It is nothing of the kind.  What you want to get is an unbiassed decision as to the value of it, independent of pressure.  That is the reason we have an independent judiciary and that is the reason that judges are not capable of being pressed by a Government or by anybody else.  That is the importance of that.  I suggest that it would be much better in the ultimate working out of the success of this scheme, if a similar body could be established.  That is what I am arguing for.  When they have made <Col N="1579" /> their investigation and given their decision, it is not necessary for the Government to put it into effect, but the Government should not be allowed to put it into effect unless they have reported in favour of it.  Then, let it come before the House, if the Minister thinks it necessary.  I think it would be much better from the point of view of sound manufacture in this country and much better from the Minister's point of view and from the point of view of the country, if he could see his way to adopt a suggestion of that kind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to approach this question from a slightly different angle.  Deputy Professor O'Sullivan wants an independent body to consider this matter.  I am not at all sure that the Minister sees the difficulties that are going to arise in connection with it.  He has mentioned cement as an instance, and perhaps the word &ldquo;cement&rdquo; is written on the Minister's heart, but I do not think that there is going to be any difficulty with regard to cement.  One could not manufacture cement in one's leisure hours in a back garden, but it seems to me that there are other commodities which approach what I might call the borderline, and in respect of which there is a grave danger of an injustice being done to the Irish manufacturers. I should like the Minister to look at that aspect of the question.  I am not for a moment suggesting that he has not got the fullest sympathy with the Irish manufacturers, but I should like to put this aspect of the matter before him.  In other countries, industries are more highly developed, and they have advanced more than they have advanced in this country, but in spite of what anybody may think, there is a constant advance going on.  It may not be very apparent, but Irish manufacturers are slowly advancing in fields that are allied to their present undertakings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can imagine somebody&mdash;for the sake of argument, let us say, some foreign manufacturer&mdash;approaching the Minister and saying to him: &ldquo;There are no imitation carved mouldings manufactured in this country; I am prepared <Col N="1580" /> to lay down a plan and I want you to make these a reserved commodity.&rdquo; The Minister, with absolute sincerity, might, having examined the case, say &ldquo;I will make it a reserved commodity&rdquo; and he might take the requisite steps to have this matter published and he might give that manufacturer the protection he sought.  Probably the minute that manufacturer started to put that type of moulding on the market here, some Irish moulding manufacturer would come to the Minister and say &ldquo;We could have manufactured those,&rdquo; and the Minister would say to him &ldquo;You saw what was published in the official guide,&rdquo; to which the manufacturer might reply &ldquo;I am afraid I do not read the official guide every few days and you have done me an injustice.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of that case which I should like to put to the Minister. Suppose an Irish manufacturer here sees a foreign manufacturer about to stake out a claim in what he regards as the legitimate field of extension of his existing enterprises and suppose he comes to the Minister and says &ldquo;You are going to give this foreign manufacturer a monopoly of part of the business I could undertake&rdquo;. The Minister might say to him &ldquo;You have not undertaken it up to this and it is only this man's arrival that has brought you into the field.&rdquo;  The Irish manufacturer would probably say &ldquo;My resources are strained to bursting point and I have only been able to undertake this manufacture in a tentative way in order to preserve my legitimate field of extension for future years.&rdquo;  It seems to me that along those lines in respect of what I might describe as the borderline cases, there is a whole field of enterprises in respect of which, if they are treated as reserved commodities, the manufacturers of this country will be done a grave injustice by the limitation of their field of operations for the future.  It may be argued that they are unenterprising: that they do not read the official guide; and that they came forward only at the eleventh hour. Perhaps they did not recognise the commodity which they proposed to manufacture under the designation <Col N="1581" /> given to it in the official publication. There are all sorts of grounds for misunderstanding such as I have mentioned and I would suggest to the Minister that, looked at from that point of view, this section may quite easily become a two-edged sword that will do as much damage here as it gives help in another direction.  As I have said before, there is no question about some of the very large commodities like cement but certainly, in other directions, there is a very broad field for extension for the Irish manufacturer, which may quite easily be staked out by enterprising foreigners coming in here.  I think the Minister appreciates some of the difficulties that arise with respect to cases such as I have tried to put forward.  I could mention a number of other concrete cases but the one illustration is sufficient to show the line along which I see difficulty.  I would ask the Minister very carefully to consider this section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I merely mentioned the case of cement because it is a commodity of the kind I have in mind in respect of which there is already legislation and legislation of a kind that would not have been necessary if this part of this Bill had been law at the time the Cement Bill was introduced. I think we have got that ship very near harbour by this, but I do not think we would ever have got within sight of shore if we had not that legislation on the Statute Book.  It hit a few rocks on its passage but it is keeping afloat still.  It is not intended that this section of the Bill should do any injustice to any Irish manufacturer.  It is clear from the wording of it that an order cannot be made in respect of any commodity which any Irish manufacturer is producing.  Deputy Dockrell's point, however, is that an order may limit the field of operation of some manufacturer engaged in the production of kindred commodities but not actually engaged in the production of the commodity in respect of which the order is made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a device by which we could protect the interests of the manufacturers, which I have been considering, but which I am not anxious to <Col N="1582" /> adopt.  I think it could very well be fashioned, and would enable any manufacturer or any person in Saorstát Eireann, who alleged that he was engaged in the manufacture of the commodity in respect of which the Order was made, or who alleged that the making of the Order was going to be prejudicial to his interests to appeal to some court on these grounds against the making of the Order, and to enable him to prevent the Order being made if he satisfies the court that he is either &ldquo;engaged in the manufacture of the commodity concerned to a substantial extent,&rdquo; or some such words, or that the making of the Order is going prejudicially to affect the business in which he is engaged.  A device of that kind would I think protect the interests of a manufacturer if it was felt that his interests were going to be adversely affected by the enactment of this Part of the Bill.  I do not think they will be.  The whole purport of part of the Bill is so clear that one could not contemplate an Order being made in relation to some such commodity as cement, which is distinct from other commodities, and which no one makes as a side line, or as a sort of development of existing business, and which could only be made on the scale on which it is required to be made in this country, when very substantial capital had been subscribed for the installation of the necessary equipment. I have, however, made a suggestion which might be considered, and if there is a necessity for a safeguard in the matters to which they have referred, that suggestion might be adopted to meet their purpose in the form of an amendment on the Report Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Minister has really answered the question I put to him.  He has said to people on this side of the House that if they feel there is any danger about the situation they could put down an amendment.  The Minister must realise that there is a very real danger, in what I call the legitimate extension of existing manufacturers' field over here.  For instance, I can imagine the introduction of mass-production <Col N="1583" /> methods, for the sake of argument, to non-ferrous castings which would lead to the opening up and the development of a whole series of articles which are not now made here.  The Minister says quite rightly that there could be no danger over that.  But there is a grave danger in the legitimate extension into fields that are bordering on the manufacture of commodities which a manufacturer may at present be making.  The Minister appears to appreciate that point.  I think that is the kernel of the objection to this section.  The Minister should really undertake to consider that aspect of the question very carefully.  I mentioned that a manufacturer might come forward with the case that that was his legitimate field.  How far would the Minister meet that by saying: &ldquo;I have no power to help you?&rdquo; That would not do.  How does the Minister propose to deal with that aspect of the situation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's point is that some manufacturer engaged in the production of a commodity, of a nature similar to the commodity made as a reserved commodity, might say that he had intended at a future date to engage in the production of the reserved commodity as an extension of his existing business.  I think we could easily devise machinery by which, when notice of intention to make the Order is given, that manufacturer could come forward with that contention, and, if he established it, provide that the Order will be postponed until the manufacturer concerned could carry out the extension, if he really intended to do so.  There should be power to make the Order at the end of that period if the manufacturer failed to undertake the development in the interval.  That is something to which consideration could be given.</P>

      <P>I am not going to repeat what I said.  I gather that the Minister knows the danger, but is pretending not to see it.  I think he sees a way out, but is not going to adopt it.  I am not going to argue <Col N="1584" /> that point further.  Running right through the Minister's statement is this: what he sees in the Bill and what he intends.  I suggest that is completely irrelevant.  He is creating a machine that will work in a certain way.  That is what I want to provide against.  It is not what he wishes to make out of this Bill; it is what a large number of people keenly interested&mdash;each industry interested in one individual thing in a way that the Minister cannot be interested&mdash;will try to make out of it, whether natives or foreigners.  Foreigners can bring pressure to bear as well as natives in this matter.  It is not necessary for the Minister to say: &ldquo;I only foresee one or two commodities.  I do not see any by-product&mdash;if I might use that expression&mdash;being ruled out under this Commodity Order.&rdquo;  That may be the Minister's intention, but he is creating a machine that is going to work, not as he wishes but, according to the laws of the machine.  That is what I am afraid he does not foresee.</P>

      <P>The Minister has thrown a very considerable amount of cold water on his own proposal. Indeed, so well he might, because, stripped of the dangers that have been referred to, and the difficulties that will arise when the people engaged propose to manufacture, there is the beautiful simplicity of the scheme that is supposed to deal with big things.  The Minister had better apply this to things that are coming rather than to things that have come.  For that reason we have been able to find out that five different manufacturers are to set themselves up in this country, but it is not known where the factories will be.  We can have it possible under this Bill for the Minister to come along on, say, the 21st of the month, if it is not a Sunday, and say &ldquo;Where is the slave with a soul so dead who thinks that we cannot make our own buttons?&rdquo; and buttons become a reserved commodity, and no agricultural labourer down the country can put a &ldquo;cnaipín&rdquo; into his &ldquo;báinín&rdquo; without being held up under the Minister's Order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1585" /> The Minister said he is going to deal with little things.  At least, he did not say that in so many words, but that is the beautiful simplicity of his scheme. A person who is a non-national can be brought in here without a halfpenny Irish capital and handed over a monopoly for buttons.  As I say, that is the beautiful simplicity of the scheme.  The Minister got the idea into his head, because he worked out a scheme for cement.  Surely, if the Minister is thinking in terms of big and important things, which would be a very necessary adjunct to our general industrial economy here, and is anxious to see them fully and properly established, established in such a way that they will last, he ought to give greater warning to the public at large, apart altogether from the Dáil, than the four days which he proposes for matters like this.  Even if the decision is taken by the Executive Council it should be taken after a report from some technical body or from some body other than a purely political body, by some body like the old Tariff Commission. It seems to me that the Minister is glossing over what he has in his mind, if he has anything in his mind, because he was invited here on a previous occasion to give the Dáil some information as to the type of commodities that would be manufactured here.  After all, if there are big gaps in our industrial fabric here, the fact that we mention them in this House and discuss them, to some extent, is not going to prejudice their future development.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>On this section I should like to ask the Minister whether he has considered the possibility of one of these industries developing an export trade.  If so, there are certain paragraphs in the section that would seem to make that difficult.  For instance, if you take paragraph (e) the Minister has power to affix a condition specifying the maximum quantity of the reserved commodity which can be manufactured at the factory.  If he avails of that power, and that one of these firms were to get an unexpected order from another country, the firm would be in a difficulty.  The firm has got to say: &ldquo;I cannot tell you whether I can deal with the order until I have seen the Minister to ascertain whether he is prepared to alter that condition.&rdquo;  There are two or three of these paragraphs, as a matter of fact, that do not seem to take into account the possibility of an export <Col N="1588" /> trade.  For instance, under paragraph (g) the Minister has power to make a condition, fixing the maximum price. It might be &ldquo;prices.&rdquo;  I do not know whether the word &ldquo;price&rdquo; in law covers &ldquo;prices.&rdquo;  Obviously there might be different grades of a commodity which would be sold at different prices and &ldquo;maximum prices&rdquo; would seem to be more correct than &ldquo;maximum price.&rdquo;  Does the Minister propose to fix maximum prices at which goods of this kind can be exported?  It seems to me that these conditions point that way.  I hardly think the Minister desires to do more than to protect Saorstát citizens.  He does not insist, I presume, in protecting citizens of Belgium or Holland or Britain against extravagant prices of the manufacturers in this country.</P>
      <P>The further question arises whether maximum prices would be more than wholesale prices.  Does he, also, intend to fix retail prices?  In the case of leading commodities sold at present, and some that I can visualise as coming under this section of the Act, the manufacturer fixes the retail prices as well as the wholesale prices.  For instance, if the refining of oil is considered as an industry under this section, in that case, if the custom that prevails at present were followed, the manufacturer would fix both the retail and wholesale prices.  If the Minister has these two things in mind then the paragraph should be enlarged I think.  I would like to hear from the Minister whether he has considered these aspects of the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We have, in relation to some industries in the course of being established, or which may be established, always contemplated an export trade development at some stage.  The powers taken under Section 22 relate to the conditions which attach to a licence, and there are powers that may be necessary, having regard to Part 3 of the Bill, to protect, in certain cases, the interests of the consumer of reserved commodities of that sort.  There is no obligation to impose all these conditions.  There is power under sub-section (2), Section 23 to vary the conditions on the application <Col N="1589" /> of the licensee, if the circumstances seem to necessitate it.  Power is taken to fix the manufacturers' prices. If a manufacturer sells that commodity to a wholesaler to be distributed to retailers or himself sells to the retailer, we do not put on him the responsibility to ensure that reasonable profits only are taken by the persons who come in between the manufacturer and the ultimate consumer.  Special machinery has been established and is being operated in order to deal with that matter.  Where the manufacturer himself sells retail, then the price that would be subject to regulation would be the retail price.  Where the manufacturer sells at a wholesale price, and fixes the retail price, it is the wholesale price that will be subject to regulation. If there was reason to believe that the retail price allowed a higher margin of profit, that would come under another Act and not under a licence having such conditions attached.</P>

      <P>I move &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;  The present position is that University College receives a sum of £82,000 per annum.  There is also payable to the College for the purpose of technical and general agricultural instruction such annual sum, not exceeding £24,984 as the Minister for Finance shall sanction.  In November, 1931, the then Minister for Finance, on behalf of the Executive Council, gave an undertaking to a deputation from the College that the Government would provide, within a maximum of £3,000 per annum, the salaries and outlay falling on the College in the reorganisation and extension of the Department of modern Irish.  The substance of that undertaking was subsequently confirmed by the present Government, and the purpose of this Bill is to give effect to it.  Consequent upon the increased grants, a certain conversation took place between the Minister for Education and the College authorities, in consequence of which the authorities have agreed to make arrangements to bring the knowledge of spoken Irish to a satisfactory standard in the case <Col N="1591" /> of students of the College who desire to be admitted to degrees.  In consequence of this scheme the Academic Council have adopted a proposal providing that in future no students of the College will be admitted to the degree of Arts, Commerce, Science, or Agricultural Science, until he, or she, as the case may be, has passed such oral examination in Irish as will ensure that the persons proceeding to the degree can speak Irish fluently and correctly.  Secondly, that no student will be admitted to a degree in the professional faculties of Medicine, Engineering, Dentistry, or Architecture until such student has passed such oral examination in Irish as will ensure that the student can carry on a conversation in Irish on simple topics.  As students in the faculty of law must first take an Arts degree, they must fulfil the conditions laid down for Arts students. Due to the number of foreign students who attend the College, exemption from these conditions may be necessary and will be granted in the case of such students.  If Deputies refer to the text of the Bill, they will observe that it contains a preamble which recites that the governing body has agreed to make provision for the oral examinations in Irish.  This preamble, as Deputies are aware, has no executive effect, but it places on record the circumstances in which the Bill has its origin and serves as a recognition of the steps taken by the governing body of the College to increase the use of Irish.</P>
