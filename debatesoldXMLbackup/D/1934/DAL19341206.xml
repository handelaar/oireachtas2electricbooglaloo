      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he will state for each of the years 1926, 1927, 1928, 1929, 1930, 1931, 1932, 1933, and for that period of 1934 for which figures are available the number of persons charged before (a) all courts other than the Military Tribunal, and (b) the Military Tribunal on criminal charges, dividing these according to the ordinary categories of criminal matters, and further if he will state for each of these years in both (a) and (b) the number of convictions which resulted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major Myles</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice whether his attention had <Col N="718" /> been drawn to a speech delivered from the Bench by District Justice Walsh at Letterkenny recently; and if he will state what steps he proposes to take in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is in the affirmative.  I do not propose to take any steps in the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesSprouleMyles" hpid="Major Myles Major Myles">
      <NameTxt>Major Myles</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister say whether this speech was not tending to incite the people of that part of the country to commit illegal acts; and does he consider that it is right that a man in his position should make those speeches from the Bench which are read by the majority of the people as speeches inciting persons to do unlawful acts?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to discuss with the Deputy the merits or demerits of that particular matter. The people who originated this might also be accused of starting an incitement. My position in the matter is that as the law stands, I can take no disciplinary action against District Justices short of moving for their dismissal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesSprouleMyles" hpid="Major Myles Major Myles">
      <NameTxt>Major Myles</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is only right that the Minister should take cognisance in some form or other of this.  Am I right in saying that this man would be the judge of any action which might take place in that area as a result of his speech?  Does the Minister think that it is a right thing for a District Justice to make such a speech?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>I stated clearly to the Deputy that, as the law stands, I have no power to take any disciplinary action with regard to District Justices short of moving for their dismissal.  If the Deputy wants that, that is another matter.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if, regarding the statement issued by him to the Press in the month of October about &ldquo;Unemployment in the Free State,&rdquo; he will state the number of houses under construction in each of the years 1930, 1931, 1932, 1933, and the estimated number for 1934; and to estimate for each of these years in terms of average numbers of persons employed weekly: (1) the direct employment and (2) the indirect employment given thereby, and to indicate the seasonal fluctuation in such employment by giving for each quarter of 1933 and 1934 the average number (1) directly and (2) indirectly employed thereby.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if representations have been made to him by the Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway Company and by the railway trade unions requesting a continuation this year of the Government subsidy paid in previous years towards the maintenance of this line; whether in response to these representations he has declined to consider the payment of any subsidy for the current year and, if so, whether he will state the grounds upon which he made his decision; further, whether he has indicated to <Col N="720" /> representatives of the company, in reply to suggestions that in the absence of a subsidy the line might have to close down, that such a development would be favoured by the Government and, if so, whether he is aware that the closing down of this railway line, or parts of it, would not be in the best interests of the travelling and trading community in the districts affected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Representations of the nature indicated in the first part of the question have been made by the railway trade unions but not by the Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway Company.</P>
      <P>As regards the second part of the question, the grant of a subsidy to this company in respect of the year 1933 was conditional upon an undertaking that no further application for a subsidy would be made, and that steps would be taken forthwith under the powers conferred by the Railways Act, 1933, and the Road Transport Act, 1933, to effect such a reorganisation of the undertaking as would obviate the necessity for further subsidies.  Until the economies in working, possible under such a reorganisation, have been fully explored, the question of any further subsidy does not arise.</P>
      <P>The answer to the third part of the question is in the negative.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister given any authority to the general manager of the company to make the statement, which I believe he has made, that the <Col N="721" /> Government favour the closing down of the line?  That is in the question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>When the debate was adjourned last night, I was criticising the various items in this Vote for bounties and subsidies.  I was proceeding to state to the House that the dairying industry was not in a very flourishing condition when the Minister interrupted me.  His interruption was to the effect that the price of butter on the British market was 67/-.  His contention was, I think, that, if the Opposition was in power, the farmer would be receiving 67/- for his butter.  I do not know that the Minister had any knowledge of what the Opposition would do as a Government in the present circumstances, with butter at 67/-.  I retorted that, with an expenditure of about half the amount in which the Minister has involved himself for bounties and other aids to keep up the price of butter, we could maintain the price of butter at a far higher price than that at which it stands at present.  Perhaps it would be just as well if I were to give a short explanation of that statement. I accept the Minister's figure of 67/-, although the Minister said not very long ago that the average price of butter on the English market during 18 months was 80/-.  The creameries are getting about 100/- for their butter.  Obviously, a subsidy of 30/- or 31/- would keep butter at that price even if the price on the British market were as low as 67/- or 68/-. What is it costing the State to enable the farmers, through the creameries, to get 101/- or 100/- for their butter? The Minister is paying a direct subsidy of, at least, 31/-.  I am not so sure that that subsidy has not been increased recently but it is at least 31/-.  That sum, in itself, if there were no other complications, would have kept the price of butter at 100/-. Every member of this community who buys butter is paying, at least, 5d. per lb. more than he ought to pay in consequence of the economic war. I leave it to any Deputy who wishes, <Col N="735" /> to ascertain the amount of butter consumed at home, work out the extra cost at 5d. per lb. and see what the ordinary consumer is contributing. The farmer is, furthermore, contributing a huge sum by way of loss in price in other branches of the dairying industry.  A loss in production is tantamount to a reduction in price. In the production of butter, a cow is certainly necessary.  As the farmer carries on his dairying from year to year, his cows have to be changed.  I heard the statement made in the presence of the Minister recently that it costs £10 to replace a cow.  I agree with that.  If I were making the estimate, I should put it at a higher figure.  If we take into consideration the several amounts of £10 for replacing cows, and if we add that to what the farmer is losing otherwise, including his loss in respect of that other necessary adjunct to the dairying industry&mdash;the calf&mdash;we get an idea of the farmers' contribution to the price.  The State is at present contributing a sum which, if there were no economic war, would suffice to keep the price of butter not at 100/- but possibly at 140/- or 150/-. This is the industry which Ministerial spokesmen try, down the country, to persuade farmers is in a flourishing condition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an item in this estimate for £278,000 for bacon and pig offals and pork.  If there was any export we should easily have maintained, it was the export of pigs.  At one time, it was stated in this House that we could easily maintain our export of pigs.  Nevertheless, there has been difficulty in keeping up our export. The Minister has had, I think, to increase the subsidy.  He certainly has had to put an Excise duty on home bacon to entice people to ship portion of it, instead of retaining it for home use.  Incidentally, I think the Minister said yesterday that he hoped the Excise duty on bacon would produce £270,000, so that the amount shown here&mdash;£278,000&mdash;may not directly fall on the Exchequer.  Whether it falls directly on the Exchequer or not, no Deputy is so dense as to think that the bacon curers will themselves bear <Col N="736" /> this Excise duty of 10/- per cwt.  It will fall on the unfortunate consumers of bacon in this country.  The bacon consumers will have to contribute, as the butter consumers are contributing, to the maintenance of the export of our produce to a country in which, we are told, there is no market for it.  I think everybody, even the Minister, is satisfied now that bounties upon cattle, during the last six months, did not reach the farmer.  Recently, the Minister has made an attempt to remedy that state of affairs.  Unfortunately, the remedy has not improved matters very much.</P>
    <P>Before the recent effort to make exporters pay a certain sum, it was possible in the southern, and perhaps western districts, to sell cattle at a sort of a price&mdash;really at a loss.  But since the introduction of the new method of compulsion on exporters to pay a certain price one could not sell a fat beast at any price.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I tell the Deputy that if he can produce a remedy for the conditions that I mention he will be doing something that the Minister has not been able to do and, in fact, he ought to exchange places with the Minister.  The Minister, I admit, has attempted to find a remedy, but all Deputy Davin can do, apparently, is to ask questions.  The real position is that we have fat cattle to sell and cannot sell them at any price.  At a recent Munster fair the number of cattle was greater than, possibly, for many years past, and I venture to say that not one lot of fat cattle in that very great fair was sold, except a few bought by butchers for slaughter.  It is a most unfortunate statement to have to make, but it is the fact that at one of <Col N="737" /> the greatest fairs for fat cattle in Ireland not a single lot was bought, as far as I know.</P>

      <P>Because the exporters could not or would not, if you prefer it, pay the price the Minister says they ought to pay.  I leave it to the Deputy to answer whether &ldquo;would&rdquo; or &ldquo;could&rdquo; is the right word to use.</P>

      <P>Originally the expenditure of these moneys now being so lavishly expended was to find new markets, but except a limited market in Germany for a few cows, despite whatever search one makes, one fails to find any market that has been discovered after two years' attempts.  I do not want to follow the peregrinations of the chickens into France and Belgium or to deal with other small items.  One hoped that some substantial alternative to the British market would have been discovered in two years.  But at the end of two years we do not appear to be any nearer to discovering alternative markets than we were in July, 1932.  Evidently, the President was right when, on the introduction of the original Grant-in-Aid of £2,000,000, he honestly declared in this House that he had to admit that he had not any hope whatever of finding alternative markets, and he added: &ldquo;That is the truth,&rdquo; as much as to say that what the Minister for Finance and other Ministers had said before him was evidently not a fact.  The President came before the House and candidly stated that he could not see any hope of finding alternative markets, and he added: &ldquo;That is the truth.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Cleary, and other prominent members of his Party, have made the statement that I said I could pay my annuities, but I would not.  I never said such a thing.  I did say after the sale, that I would not find the money, which was a very different thing from saying that I could easily pay.  Even if I said that, the finding of the money would have been an extremely difficult matter for me then, and it would be an impossible matter for me now, because at the moment I could not give away some of the cattle I possess.  I venture to say that if I <Col N="739" /> approached my bank manager for an extension of credit I am afraid I would not get a very pleasant answer.</P>
      <P>I suppose there was a time in this State when one hesitated to admi poverty.  The admission of poverty i not really a crime.  I am not ashamed to admit in this House or out of it that my position is not much better than the ordinary average farmer in this State; and the position of the ordinary average farmer is a position which I am sure neither the Minister nor Deputy Cleary would wish any individual to be in.  We are opposing this motion and moving that it be referred back for reconsideration.  Personally, on my own behalf I would oppose it.  I would oppose definitely any extension of the bounties or continuation of the existing bounties when other methods of putting the farmer on his feet and of putting agriculture in something of a prosperous condition could be pursued.  One can visualise circumstances in agriculture, just as in any other industry, when artificial remedies are needful for a time, either by bounty or tariff, to protect such an industry.  I can quite see that there might be such circumstances.  But if one can remove the circumstances, it is a saner practice to remove them than to proceed to an uncertain cure. The circumstances that have brought agriculture to its present unfortunate position in this State could be and should be easily removed, and it is because no attempt, or no honest or decent attempt, has been made to put an end to these unfortunate circumstances that we oppose any extension of the bounty system or the subsidy system or the tariff system as an aid to agricultural prosperity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite the fact that for two years bounty on bounty has been added until we have arrived at the situation that every item of a farmer's output is aided by subsidy or bounty, and despite the fact as well that every other member of the community day by day has to bear additions to the cost of every article he consumes in order to keep agriculture in a prosperous condition, agriculture to-day is in a worse position than it ever was <Col N="740" /> at any previous period in the history of this State.  If any proof were needed of the failure of the bounty and subsidy system as an aid to agriculture, it is there to be seen as the results of two years' operation of that system in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>When I attended the first meetings of this House immediately after the last local elections, I assumed that if there were any commonsense left in the skulls of the Opposition members of this House they would come in here, having learned something from the lesson the people taught them at that time, and change their tactics and do some real work of nation building.  I thought that they would then at least help in some constructive way to put this State on a proper financial footing. Listening to, and having read two or three of the recent speeches made in this House, particularly those by Deputies O'Higgins and Dillon, I have come to the conclusion that they represent the mentality of self-appointed spokesmen of a Party which is completely demoralised and disorganised.</P>
      <P>I listened attentively to Deputy O'Higgins yesterday evening, repeating the sentences which he has so often repeated in this House before&mdash; sentences involving personal accusations of lack of courage against the President and lack of honour against the members of the Government in their dealings on behalf of this State with people on the far side of the Channel.  They were the same sentences, repeated in parrot-like fashion, that we have heard so often, with nothing of a constructive nature or sensible suggestion as to what should be done if the Minister withdraws these bounties.  The Deputy said: &ldquo;We never got an honest expression of Government opinion upon any matter of policy affecting the people of this country.&rdquo;  I think that what is really wrong is that the Government policy cannot be swallowed by people like Deputy O'Higgins or Deputy Dillon, and, consequently, they have made up their minds that instead of building up they are going to smash up everything all around.</P>

      <Col N="741" /> We are told by some of the speakers and some of the Front Bench people opposite that they are going to pass on to the people of this State a sort of Italian ice-cream Constitution&mdash; something like what they have in Italy at the present time, or in Germany or some of these other States that are governed by dictators to-day.  All I say is that if we ever have the kind of Constitution in this country that prevails at present in Italy, Germany and other countries of the kind, that the people opposite seem to like so much, some of the people opposite who make those speeches would find themselves within the biggest State institution that could be got to keep them within barbed wires.</P>

Deputy Bennett, who, I thought and believed until yesterday evening, knew a good deal about the dairying industry, does not seem to be in touch at all with the dairy farmers of his constituency or with the position of the people engaged in the dairying industry at the present time.</P>

      <P>I wonder whether the Deputy has been reading any of the papers published in the Dominions, or any of the reports recently published in the Irish papers&mdash;in the official organ of his own Party&mdash;regarding the collapse of the dairying industry in New Zealand?  Would the Deputy say that New Zealand, which is known to be the most loyal member of the British Commonwealth of Nations and which has the most loyal Prime Minister of any of the Dominions, is engaged in an economic war with Great Britain?  If it is engaged in such an economic war, I have not heard anything about it.  I should like the Deputy, therefore, to look into the position as affecting New Zealand at the moment and say whether the position there in connection with the dairying industry is due to the attitude of the Prime Minister of New Zealand and his Government.  Well, what is the cause of it?  Has it nothing to do with world conditions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have made a fairly careful study of the position of the dairy farmers in my constituency.  The reason I have studied the situation there is because a number of creameries have been established in my constituency inside the last three or four years, and I have been in fairly constant touch with the position there because I and my colleagues have been approached on various occasions asking for assistance in various direction for these co-operative <Col N="743" /> creameries.  I am satisfied&mdash; and the Minister can contradict me if I am wrong&mdash;that if we had no economic war, and if the present price of butter, known to the Deputy and to all the members of the House, was the price that should rule the price in this country to-day, the dairy farmers would be getting 2d. or 2¼d. per gallon for their milk to-day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Deputy get up in County Limerick, where there are a number of these co-operative creameries, and suggest to the farmers associated with these co-operative creameries that they should carry on with them and only receive between 2d. and 2¼d. for their milk?  If we had no economic war, if that were the situation with which we would be confronted, what would be the Deputy's alternative for maintaining the dairying industry, which is a very valuable industry from the employment point of view in this country?  You have criticised the Minister's policy of bounties and subsidies, but you have given us no alternative.  I say that it is the only alternative which we have at the moment to maintain an industry which this country cannot afford to lose.  I am supporting that part of the Government's policy with far greater enthusiasm than I support bounties and subsidies for other items affecting the agricultural community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no doubt whatsoever that I am doing right in voting for this Estimate <Col N="744" /> for the purpose of continuing to maintain this industry so as to give the farmers an economic, and in some cases a profitable, price for their milk.  I know the value of a cheque to the farmer at the end of the month.  A number of these cheques are paid every month in my constituency where the farmers have only in recent years come into the dairying industry.  They have been very helpful in enabling the farmers to pay their debts, including, I may say, the annuities, in spite of an attempt to organise them against the payment of annuities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Life is not long enough to explain my position in the matter to the Deputy and he would not understand it even if I did attempt it.  I am coming to the point which is apparently the real bone of contention with the Opposition and which I believe is a matter of serious concern to every Deputy in this House, including the Minister for Agriculture.  That is the provision of large sums out of this Vote for the payment of bounties to cattle dealers who engage in the export of surplus livestock from this country.  I am not infallible in this matter but I have come definitely to the conclusion that the money voted for this purpose has not been finding its way into the pockets of the livestock producers and I should like to hear from the Minister what his opinion is of that particular aspect of the cattle industry at the present time.  I want to have an assurance from the Minister, a very definite one, if we are going to continue to pay subsidies and bounties to cattle dealers who engage in exporting livestock from this country, that in view of the recent legislation, he will take all necessary steps, no matter how drastic they may be, to make these gentlemen pay the price which has been fixed under the Slaughter of Cattle and Sheep Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe a large number of these gentlemen have got licences since this particular Act came into operation. They signed undertakings of a very definite nature that they would pay the fixed price for certain classes of <Col N="745" /> cattle, but I have personal knowledge, obtained from the people concerned, that they have in almost all cases failed to do so.  There has been very definitely an organised opposition on the part of British and Irish cattle traders against that part of the Act and these people are determined if the Minister will allow them, to smash this vital section of the Act, that is, the section which fixes the minimum price of 25/- per cwt. for fat live stock.  I understand that the Minister has been holding up some licences for the current month in the case of those who have refused to honour their undertakings.  I hope that the Minister will not alone refuse to issue licences to people who have in a flagrant way dishonoured their undertakings, but that he will take any other action, no matter how drastic, to compel these gentlemen to honour any undertakings they may have given in a vital matter of this kind.</P>
    <P>I wonder could we have from the Minister the percentage or the number of individuals who signed undertakings and dishonoured them and also some indication of what action he proposes to take in future cases where similar undertakings are signed and not honoured?  It is ridiculous to think, and I have been informed that it is true, that these gentlemen have been again asked to sign some other kind of a very drastic form of undertaking. I should like to know what exactly is the position in regard to those who got licences for the last month and whose licences up to the present are held up.  There is only one cure for these gentlemen and that is to put them out of action and, if necessary, adopt the policy which this Party advocated three years ago&mdash;set up a marketing organisation which will deal with the whole export trade, just as Britain and other States have been forced to do for reasons which are not applicable to this State.  It is three years ago since this Party, in a manifesto issued after the economic war started, definitely encouraged the Government to set up a marketing organisation, and though I am no prophet, I say that if the present situation continues, the Government will be forced to do it or <Col N="746" /> else admit defeat at the hands of this organised gang of people who have robbed the live stock producers of this country for the past two years.  We suggested in October, 1932, that the sale and export of cattle should be undertaken by an organisation acting on behalf of the Government, and that any loss incurred, as between the sale price and the purchase price, should be borne by the State.  Supposing such an organisation were set up at that time, one thing bound to happen would be that any price paid for the cattle would be bound to find its way back to the producers from whom they were bought and on whose behalf they were sold.</P>
    <P>I listened to portion of Deputy O'Higgins' speech yesterday evening in which he purported to quote remarks attributed to the Minister for Agriculture in a speech delivered somewhere in the country.  He then proceeded to quote a speech delivered by Senator Connolly in Kilcock in which he was supposed to pray to God for the destruction of the cattle trade of this country.  I remember that Senator Connolly contradicted that version of his speech which was published in the <i>Irish Independent,</i> but, of course, Deputy O'Higgins, for reasons of his own, never read that contradiction.  I am fully satisfied that the present serious position affects every occupier of agricultural land in this country down to the cottier who has a cow and rears a calf, and therefore there is no reason for suggesting, as some people do, that this situation only affects the ranchers and the large farmers.  I am satisfied that if the new Act came into operation right away and if those who have cattle for sale were to get a minimum of 25/- per cwt. for these cattle, the people who would benefit most would be the large farmers who were lucky enough to buy cattle six months or a year ago.  The small farmer or the cottier, who has an animal to sell now and again, would only come to benefit after the surplus cattle has been disposed of in a year or 18 months' time.  There is more in the Act to the benefit and advantage of Deputies sitting on the Opposition benches than some of them are prepared <Col N="747" /> to admit.  That is why, if there was a proper spirit prevailing in the country, we should have this House assisting, instead of obstructing, the Minister in enforcing the terms of that Act on those who are engaged in the export cattle industry.  But, no, they cannot do it.  They think of their Party before their country and before the people of the country.  If they were wise they would think less of the Party that is now so disorganised and demoralised, but I suppose the demoralisation has crept into their own constitutions.  I am satisfied that if this economic war is to be fought out to a finish&mdash;apparently, there are some people in the country who say it should be fought to a finish&mdash;and won, then the winning of it will depend to a great extent, as far as the farmers are concerned, on the power and willingness of the Minister to enforce payment of these minimum prices, no matter what they may be from time to time.</P>

      <P>Probably Deputies will not laugh when I am finished, but that is why I am encouraging, and will continue to encourage, the Minister to take the most drastic action possible to enforce the payment of these minimum prices to people who have fat or other cattle to sell.  I have been reading the leading articles that have appeared in some newspapers since this Act came into operation.  I read an article in the <i>Irish Press</i> the other day which rather surprised me, in which the writer proceeded to justify the increase of 2d. per lb. in the price of fresh meat <Col N="748" /> to the consumer.  I could understand the Editor of the <i>Irish Press,</i> or whoever wrote that article, arguing in justification of some increase in the price of fresh meat to the consumer if butchers had not forestalled the Act to the extent to which I know they have done.  I know a butcher who is also a farmer in my constituency&mdash;I am sorry that Deputy Finlay has left the House, because he is a friend of his&mdash;and I am reliably informed that he purchased 100 fat cattle and 100 sheep before the Act came into operation.</P>

Ours is the only Party in the House that he has not been associated with.  So far we have not received any application from him.  There are some points on which I agree with Deputy Belton, but there are more, perhaps, on which we agree to differ.  The Minister has taken steps to reduce in the future the amount of bounties that will be paid out to those previously engaged in the <Col N="750" /> export of our surplus live stock.  The Minister has introduced and passed through the Oireachtas this Act, which will increase the demand in the home market.  While on this subject, may I say, for the information of Deputy Dillon, that I am not in the least ashamed, as he apparently thinks I should be, of being associated with the Minister and with this Government in passing an Act which provides free meat for the poorest of the poor? Deputy Dillon suggested in the speech that he made here the other evening&mdash; I had not the pleasure of listening to it &mdash;that &ldquo;Deputy Norton and Deputy Davin, who did not know one end of a cow from the other, were partially responsible for the brilliant scheme of giving free beef to the poor.&rdquo;  I would be glad if Deputy Dillon would come down to my native parish&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Strange as it may appear, I am advocating, if necessary, and I believe it will be necessary, the establishment of a marketing organisation rather than the paying out of these bounties to people who will not honour the undertakings they have given to the Government.  There may probably be some doubt as to the desirability of that proposition, but I was amazed to find that there is a motion on the Order Paper in the name <Col N="751" /> of Deputy O'Higgins and Deputy Belton who has now left the Party. The motion to which I refer has to it the names of Deputies Patrick Belton, Thomas F. O'Higgins, Sydney B. Minch and Alfred Byrne.  It proposes &ldquo;that the Dáil requests the Government in order to maintain the present area under tillage and to prevent wholesale unemployment, to take immediate steps to secure a market for our 58 per cent. of surplus stall-fed cattle&rdquo;&mdash;and here is the point that I want to bring out&mdash;&ldquo;and failing to do so, to purchase the said cattle from the feeders at the price ruling in the British market.&rdquo;  I am glad to see from the reading of that that I have with me the extinguished and distinguished spokesmen of the Fine Gael Party, and that in putting forward the suggestion for the establishment of a marketing organisation the Minister will have the knowledge that he will have all parties in the House backing him whenever he finds it necessary to take such action. There is the proof of it on the Order Paper.</P>

      <P>Thanks very much.  It is decent of you.  The unfortunate thing about it is that not alone have they not let Deputy Davin into the know but the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Agriculture have not even let the Minister for Industry and Commerce into the know.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>He has been kept in the dark also, because if the economic war is over, as the Minister for Industry and Commerce said, it is rather peculiar that to-day we are engaged in this motion to provide bounties and subsidies in order to fight this economic war, because that is what they are for.  Before we provide bounties and subsidies it is up to us as responsible people, and as Deputies of this House, to examine the situation, firstly to find out if those <Col N="753" /> bounties and subsidies are a necessity; secondly to find out&mdash;and this is the more important thing&mdash;if a solution of the present conditions and the present circumstances can be found in any alternative way.  Consideration of the second really comes before the first. We must satisfy ourselves firstly that this economic war, which is the immediate cause and the only cause, I maintain, of the necessity for bounties and subsidies, is of itself a necessity, and that it cannot be ended favourably to ourselves.  Are we satisfied of that? Now there are some people in this country who so far forget the responsibility of those who are opposed to them in politics that they seem to imagine there is only one thing to be done in this matter, and that is that everybody should support the Government because we are having a fight with our old enemy, England.  I want to examine that question.  As far as I am personally concerned, and I can speak for my colleagues here, we feel that citizenship, much less being elected a Deputy, carries not alone its privileges, but its responsibilities.  We feel that we have our responsibilities in this House; that we have our responsibilities as citizens of this country, and that if anybody attempts to do anything which to our minds means the ruination of the country it is our business&mdash;even in face of unfair criticism and even though we may be a minority&mdash;to condemn it.  Even though I might be a minority of one, if I felt that the Government were doing anything which to my mind would ruin the industry upon which the country was standing, it would be my business to stand up and say &ldquo;You are doing wrong.&rdquo;  That is the position.</P>
      <P>Are we satisfied that the present conditions must continue?  Are we satisfied that they cannot be ended? The Government ought to satisfy itself on that before it further attempts to bolster up the position of the farmers in this country by bounties and subsidies. What steps is the Government taking to end the economic war?  Have they taken any?  What steps have they taken to see that this country gets a decent quota on the British market?  Have they taken any?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="754" /> Have they in any other respect, dealing with any other country, treated the industries of this country in the same manner as they have treated the farming industry and the agricultural community?  Take, for instance, quite a short time ago, when America went wet this country thought it was good business&mdash;and rightly so&mdash;to send across to America the secretary of one of the Departments to see that the interests of this country were properly watched with regard to the fixing of a quota for the export to America of drink and spirits.  We have had quite a lot of money expended in expeditions of one kind or another to Germany. What have we done with regard to Great Britain?  Have we done anything? Is it not an extraordinary thing that although in 1931, out of our total exports amounting to £37,000,000, the British market took £35,000,000 worth, yet that is the market we propose to ignore.  I do not know whether Dr. O'Higgins was right when he said it was lack of courage or lack of statesmanship. I do not know what it was, but certainly there appears to me to be a wanton neglect of the interests of the main industry of this country. Even in 1933, after the economic war had continued here for about a year and a half, our total exports amounted to £19,500,000.  Of that £19,500,000 Britain took £18,500,000 pounds.  Somebody will reply, as the Minister did last night, &ldquo;But Britain has fixed her quota.  We could not get over that.&rdquo; Have we any evidence to show that we could not?  What attempt has been made by the Government or anybody else on behalf of the agricultural community of this country to see that we got a favourable quota in the British market.  It was worth an attempt in the case of America and in the case of Germany for a very small sum, and surely to goodness it is worth doing in the case of the one market which absorbed practically all our exports. It is surely worth doing there.</P>
    <P>After all our searching for alternative markets, what do we find?  In the returns for 1933 the net effect of all the searching for markets was that the purchases of countries other than Great Britain amounted to £200,014 <Col N="755" />&mdash;less than they did the year before. Considering these figures and the situation that confronts the Government, is it not time that they took stock? Does the Minister, does Deputy Davin, or anyone else think that the main industry in this or in any other country can be supported by bounties and subsidies?  It cannot be done.  It is absurd.  Agriculture is the main industry, here, and no matter how long this goes on the main industry will determine the purchasing power of the people.  There is no use in erecting factories all over the country unless we have somebody to buy the products. If the Government is convinced that we cannot get any more cattle into Great Britain than we are getting now, and if they are convinced that the economic war must continue, then I say the only logical thing to do is to drop the bounties and subsidies at once, and to bring down the standard of living here, to bring down the prices of boots and clothes and to pay labourers a wage that they will barely be able to live on, as the farming community cannot afford to pay more. You are coming to that.  Every bounty and subsidy provided for the subsidisation of agriculture, unless the phase is temporary&mdash;and according to the Minister it is not&mdash;unless we are going to get back the British market, is a further load on the back of agriculture.</P>
    <P>If the main industry in the country is the gathering of cockleshells you cannot afford to subsidise it indefinitely.  A country may be likened to a man in a business which includes ten departments.  The owner could well afford to make up a loss on one department out of the profits on the others, but he could not afford to subsidise the main department out of the others.  That is impossible. When the Minister for Agriculture was dealing with a kindred motion, condemning the Government for neglecting to secure a quota for the export of cattle, he took very good care last night that he kept far away from this question.  He did not say what the Government had done, or had tried to do; whether they failed or succeeded, or what representations they made <Col N="756" /> regarding the securing of an adequate quota in the British market.  Why did he not do so?  Is it because it would be a humiliation for the President to have to ignore what he said on a previous occasion, that the British market, thank God, was gone?  Was it to save Senator Connolly, who said it would not take long to kill the cattle trade; was is to save the Minister for Finance, who talked about traitors in this country; or was it to save the Minister for Agriculture, who stated definitely in this House on the Estimate for Agriculture last year, that he was perfectly well aware that any increased tillage meant increased live stock? The Minister repeated that statement. Were these the reasons why they did not approach the British Government? The present Government is bound by the chains that they have forged around them.  They cannot do it.  We have information though that certain representations were made with regard to cattle, and according to information which I received only two days ago they were successful.  I put the following question to the Minister on 21st March last:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Míchéal O Braonáin asked the Minister for Agriculture if he is aware that exporters of cattle to British markets whose cattle have been confiscated for alleged wrongful classification, have in addition been compelled to pay the special duties on the same cattle, and if he will state what representations, if any, he has made to the British Government to have this hardship remedied.</P>
    <P>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan): The reply to the first portion of the question is in the affirmative. Informal discussions on the subject have taken place between representatives of my Department and of the British Ministry of Agriculture. It is understood that the matter is under consideration by the British Government.  I do not propose to consider what action may best be taken until the decision of that Government is announced.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am informed&mdash;and the Minister can correct me if I am wrong&mdash;that the decision of the British Government <Col N="757" /> was that they would refund and did refund to those cattle exporters the amount which they had collected by way of penal tariffs.  Is that so?</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, they have not given a decision yet.  As a matter of fact, I have been told that we may expect a decision in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>For the Minister's information I may say that I met the gentleman who gave me the information on which I based the question at Roscommon cattle fair yesterday morning, and I asked him if there was any result.  His answer was: &ldquo;Yes, we have been paid back our money.&rdquo; So that there is evidence that satisfactory representation can be made to the British Government with regard to the cattle trade.  There is evidence that it is not idle to do so.  The Minister for Agriculture did one thing last night.  He admitted that the Government is not able to retain in this country the £5,000,000 which they thought they would retain.  Of course, at any time the idea of retaining the £5,000,000 here was idiotic.  It could not be done.  You could not actually retain the money and put it into circulation. Some people imagined that the retention of the money meant holding it here.  That could not be so. The £5,000,000 included annuities and other items.  That money was earned by Irish farmers before being paid to anyone.  It was earned on the British market.  As it is not being earned now it is not there.  The Minister admitted that it did not really matter whether we paid the money out in cash or paid it by way of live stock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has the same notions as other people.  I should like to hear the views of the Minister for Finance on that&mdash;that there was no difference between the tariffs which the British put on our cattle and the tariffs put on here on coal and other commodities.  The Minister for Finance endeavoured to make the case here that if the Irish people had to pay the tariffs which were imposed by the Irish Government on coal, then the <Col N="758" /> British Government had to pay the tariff on our cattle.  That seems quite plausible, but, is not the incidence of both tariffs absolutely different?  A man who imports coal or any other British commodity pays at this side, but, in the case of our cattle, the exporter pays at the other side.  Is not that what is happening?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is absolutely what happens, and the Minister knows it. The exporter of the cattle, the gentleman who is named as the exporter from this country, has to pay the tariff beyond; he has to give the cheque.  In the other case the gentleman from beyond sends his coal here, and the importer pays the cheque.  The Minister need not try to put it across the House that there is any similarity in the two cases.  Although I had a great personal regard for him, after the exhibition he gave last night I have nothing but the greatest possible contempt for the Minister for Agriculture, absolutely the greatest contempt.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is really no wonder that agriculture has got to the pitiable condition in which it is with such a pitiable Minister in control.  Last year this gentleman told us that he firmly believed that any extension of tillage meant an extension of live stock.  On another occasion he said that anybody who declared that the Government was out to injure the live stock trade was either a fool or a knave.  As was pointed out last night, he ought to have pulled up Senator Connolly who was a very serious offender in that matter. The Minister made that statement that he knew perfectly well, as well as I or other Deputies, that any extension of tillage meant an extension of live stock, and he stood up a few minutes afterwards and said that he did not think that way at all.  I would like to ask the Minister what are we going to do with our produce if we have not live stock?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like Deputy O'Reilly and the Minister to compare the population in England and the arable land there with our population and our arable land, and see if in Great Britain they will be able to cultivate the land to such an extent that they will be in a position to feed all the people they want to feed there. Let them then consider the Irish position and observe where we are likely to be landed if we produce food off the land in this country for our population. If they investigate that matter they will find that the figures will be very staggering.  There is absolutely no contradiction of this, and the Minister for Agriculture knows it as well as anybody else, that you cannot have any extended tillage in this country unless you have live stock.</P>

That must be the fundamental basis of your policy. There is only one thing that could induce them, and that is a better price. I have never used foreign bacon; I use my own bacon, but I do not see anything wrong with the farmer who sold his excellent pig to make excellent bacon for sale on the British market, the farmer who got £5 for that pig, and who bought enough bacon, no matter where it was made so long as it was good and sound, for £4 to feed his family.  There was nothing economically bad about it.  What was the net effect of keeping out the foreign bacon? I am not making the case that it ought not to be kept out.</P>

      <P>The Chair would be interested to know what case the Deputy is making.  The subject before the House is export bounties. The Deputy referred to an alternative which might obviate the need for export bounties.  He has dealt with the burden of rates and annuities, with cattle quotas&mdash;the subject of the next business on the Order Paper&mdash;and with the retention of land annuities which, if my recollection serves me aright, was discussed for a score of days in this House within the last 12 months.  Now, the Deputy has proceeded to discuss an embargo on the import of bacon.  It is really difficult for the Chair to know what aspect of the export bounties he is now dealing with.</P>

      <P>I desire to be strictly in order and I do not want to follow the Minister's line of argument. Indeed, I would be sorry to follow him in some of the ramblings into which he went last night.  Before we agree to a further replenishing of the war chest for the purpose of bounties and subsidies, I think we are obliged to ask the Minister for Agriculture if he is perfectly satisfied with the way in which the sums from that particular fund have been administered up to this.  I remember one occasion on which a judge of the High Court commented adversely on the way in which the fund was manipulated.  I think the Minister ought to tell this House what steps he has taken to correct the alleged dealings by people who hold licences and who get the bounties in the cattle trade.  I think we are entitled to know that.  The Minister ought to tell us how he proposes to deal with it in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt that in relation to this, as in relation to other matters which the Government is endeavouring to carry out, and which are most difficult matters, there is a tendency and an inducement, not deliberate on the part of the Government, but by the very terms of the work which is being done, to fraud by people who hold licences, and, under the new Slaughter of Animals Act, I am afraid there is a further inducement.  What guarantee can the Minister give the agricultural community that, although he fixes a price of 25/- or 22/- a cwt. for the people to hold the licences, we are going to get that price?  He says he is relying on the honesty of the farmers.  I met a man in Dublin this day week who was in the cattle market and who, to the best of my belief, is a supporter of the Minister. He told me that he had a certain number of cattle at the Dublin Market.  They were good cattle but they were not first-class cattle.  We <Col N="763" /> discussed the price of 25/- and he told me honestly that if he got a man to take them off his hands, it would not be 25/- a cwt. he would be looking for.  I am not blaming the Minister for that; I am not blaming anybody, as a matter of fact, but I believe that behind all that there is any amount of fraud being perpetrated and that the thing itself lends itself to it.</P>
    <P>Before we agree to this money being voted, I think we are entitled to know from the Minister what steps he proposes to take to tighten up the machinery which he has to deal with this.  I should like to say that, so far as I am personally concerned, I have no faith whatever in bounties and subsidies as a cure for our ills at the present time.  As I said a while ago, there is only one alternative, one sensible alternative, to the present position.  If we cannot get our cattle on the British market, and if we have no other market, drop the bounties and subsidies and come down to hard facts, to which you will have to come in a year or two and come down to a standard of living we can afford.  You may keep it up as long as you can, as long as you have money to do it, but if we are going to do what the Minister for Finance threatened in his Budget speech before last, but which he did not carry out because it was impossible&mdash;to borrow on the asset created by our retained annuities for the purpose of providing bounties and subsidies&mdash;we are simply mortgaging the future of agriculture in this country, if agriculture is our main industry and the Minister says it is and I say it is.  We are all agreed on that and the Minister ought to get it into his head, once and for all, that subsidies for wheat and subsidies for beef, bounties for cattle and for sheep and all the rest of it cannot by any manner of means, or by any stretch of imagination, put agriculture on its feet or into the position in which it will be able to determine, which it must eventually determine, the purchasing power of the people.  It cannot be done.  We may, of course, continue for some time borrowing upon <Col N="764" /> the resources of the country.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce tells us now&mdash;a great change, of course, since he was on these benches&mdash; that the adverse balance does not count and that it is really of no importance in this country.  We may borrow for bounties and subsidies but all our borrowing is adding a further burden to this country and the sooner we realise that the better.</P>
    <P>The Minister said last night that the country is behind Fianna Fáil in this policy.  I do not like to say what I really believe about all that.  It was natural, of course, that the people of a country like ours, who had been so long fighting for freedom in one form or another, should be carried away by the cry of war and by the glory of war. The President, being a good psychologist, knew where to strike and he struck, and I tell the Minister for Agriculture and I tell the President that there are plenty men down the country who are supporting him in his war with our old enemy England on the cry: &ldquo;England must be fought; there is a war on.&rdquo;  That is the cry, and that is what got the people, but they are not behind the Government's agricultural policy and they do not believe a bit of it except that the glory of fighting a war must be secured.  I say that somebody will have to answer for this some time.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is very much more I have to say except to state that, so far as I am concerned, I am prepared to give any assistance&mdash;and so are all the people on these benches &mdash;to any aids that agriculture needs or any other industries in this country may need.  There is no use in the Minister or anyone else saying that we are endeavouring to sabotage the industries of this country.  They know that that is all nonsense.  We ought to recognise that we are all citizens of this country and that we are all endeavouring to do our best for it so far as we can.  If a genuine mistake is being made and if somebody endeavours to point it out it is quite all right and, not alone that, it is their business to do so.  Because we endeavour to point out, as we believe firmly, that the present policy of the Government <Col N="765" /> is absolutely ruining this country, we are told that we are West Britishers; we are Englishmen and we are everything but Irishmen.  We ought to get away from that, and we ought to get down to hard facts and stare the situation in the face, and the Government should not say that we cannot get any more cattle on the British market until they are able to show us that they have made some effort to get more cattle on the British market.  I hope that when the Minister comes to reply he will at least be able to give this House some assurance that with regard to bounties and subsidies there will be no need for people to be afraid of fraud.  I do not know that he can do it.  His own personal ability may, perhaps, be very good, but I do not think that the Act or the whole system is such as to lend itself to any kind of administrative effort without a lot of difficulty and I do not think it can be carried through without a lot of fraud.</P>

      <P>My contribution to this very interesting discussion will be very brief indeed.  We used to hear in the old times that the three great crimes in this country were: killing a man, robbing a church, or stealing a cow.  It seems to me that at the present time the sacrifice of a cow is considered a very trifling and negligible affair.  Yet the cow is the most useful of animals.  It supplies us not only with milk, cheese, beef and butter, but even with the very comb with which Deputy Davin trims his hair every morning.  Unquestionably, the cow has been, from the earliest ages, a most important asset to the human race; and it has always played a very important part in the history of Ireland. I need not go back and tell you of the veneration in which it was held in India, Egypt and other countries. I am sure you all know that one of the greatest Nabobs of Hindustan is the Gwaekar of Baroda, and Gwaekar means cow-keeper.  The Italians who built on the yellow Tiber the eternal city of Rome were so called because they were calf or cow-men.  To come down to our own times.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Or should be.  I really think that my remarks so far have been perfectly relevant.  To come down to our own times, even the very name of his Excellency the Governor-General means a cow-boy.  I was simply quoting these remarks and will not go any further with them.  I could speak for hours on them, if the House were anxious to hear, without coming to the real object of the few words which I intend to say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are certain matters in reference to which undoubtedly bounties and subsidies are necessary, legitimate, and useful, but I do think, and I am sure the majority of the members of this House realise, that in the case of the staple and key industry of this country they are a confession of failure.  I would ask the Minister for Agriculture, in all sincerity and in no partisan spirit, what is the meaning and object of these bounties?  Is the object to retain or maintain our hold on a market which we have been assured is gone, and which we have been told is dead and damned and thank God for it?  There can be no other object.  If the Minister for Agriculture were called in in the morning and found a man suffering from a bad pain which had probably been brought on by himself, I have no doubt that the first thing he would do would be to give him an injection of morphia or some other palliative.  The same applies to bounties.  Bounties simply relieve the symptoms.  They put off the evil day; but they do not get down to the rock-bottom, and they do not effect a radical cure.  That is, <Col N="767" /> I am sure, evident to every thinking and sensible man in this House.  Any country cannot long survive on bounties, doles or subsidies, free beef, free milk, or anything else of that description; and the sooner the Government, or any Government that may be in power, realise that fact the better it will be for this country and for its future.</P>
    <P>There is, in my humble opinion, one and only one cure, and that is the settlement of the economic war, or the so-called economic war.  I believe that it can be settled by peaceful negotiations and without any sacrifice of principle or compromise of national dignity or national honour; that peace would be the result of a real conference at which the people would gather round a conference table with a real will to peace.  Nations as well as individuals are bound to forgive; it is a Christian duty to do so.  It will make for the welfare and advancement and progress of this country to have it done and done immediately. By the map of the world, and by the decree of Almighty God himself, England and Ireland are next-door neighbours.  We carry on, or have carried on, extensive dealings with each other; and it will pay both, and it will be honourable and an advantage to both to come to a settlement that would reflect honour on the good sense and patriotism of both countries.</P>
    <P>I am not going to continue any longer; I have trespassed too much on your time and patience; but I do say in conclusion that the attitude of the present Government reminds me of a fellow who meets another in the street and, whatever he means it or not, gives him a clout in the eye.  That is what the Government has done to the farmers of this country.  They may not have meant to do it; I am not charging them with any <i>mala fides</i> whatever.  They may have done it in what they conceive to be the very best interests of the country.  But, having given the farmers a clout in the eye, they get the Minister for Agriculture, as a medical practitioner, to give them a soothing plaster and some French powder as a palliative; something to <Col N="768" /> soothe the pain they are suffering from as a result of the attitude of the Government.  I hope an end will be put to that state of affairs.  I appeal to the Minister for Agriculture and the Executive Council, in no spirit of partisanship, bias, or prejudice, but as Irishmen and Irish citizens and as people who, I am sure, are as much interested in the welfare of the country as I am.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I only intervene for a moment to ask for more definite information than seems to have been forthcoming from the Opposition during the last hour or so.  The last speaker, for instance, finds fault with the whole question of the bounties: and Deputy Brennan gave the impression that he has a very strong objection to subsidies as well as bounties.  I would like if some speaker would try to reconcile that attitude with the Motion down on the Order Paper in the names of two Opposition Deputies:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the Dáil is of opinion that owing to the increasing distress of the farming community arising out of the continuance of the economic war, the Executive Council should take steps to relieve agricultural land of rates during the financial year 1934/ 35.&mdash;Thomas O'Higgins and T.J. O'Donovan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder if both these things are genuine?  I wonder if the attitude of Deputies Burke and Brennan on the bounty question can be reconciled with the attitude of Deputy O'Higgins and Deputy O'Donovan, whose names are on this motion?  If both are seriously meant, how is one to reconcile them? In one case there is an objection to Government assistance and in the other case there is a demand for Government assistance! In one case there is an objection to receiving a bounty, which means an increased price for agricultural exports, and on the other side we have a demand that owing to the distress that prevails amongst the farming community the farmers should be relieved of the ordinary liability to pay their rates! It does not look as if these two things could sleep in the same bed. <Col N="769" /> I listened very carefully to Deputy Brennan's speech.  That speech was apparently very carefully prepared and was very admirably uttered.  But to my mind the Deputy is very much astray with regard to the whole position in this country, and he is very much astray with regard to what is likely to prevail in the future.  The Deputy wants the Government to consider and take immediate action on this line&mdash;that if we cannot find an opening in the British market for the whole of our surplus agricultural produce, we should cease to give bounties or subsidies and take steps to reduce the standard of living in the country.</P>
    <P>That is surely a counsel of despair. But is it a reasonable counsel?  Is it not likely that, even if the economic war were favourably settled tomorrow, there would be for a period, and probably for a prolonged period, a surplus of some particular item of agricultural produce that would have to be exported?  We cannot make a price for our surplus agricultural produce. The question before the country would be&mdash;would the country abandon the production of a surplus?  Or would it not be the duty of the Government to ask the population generally to give some help towards making the production of that surplus a paying proposition? There is nothing inherently unreasonable in offering a bounty on surplus agricultural productions.  In my opinion, it would be very much to the advantage of the country, rather than have a number of people entirely unemployed, that they should be producing a thing which they might not be able to market in this country but for which there might be a market abroad under certain conditions&mdash;say, at a low price.  Surely anybody with responsibility for the population as a whole could not find fault with the proposition that items of agricultural surplus should be subsidised, under these conditions, so far as it is expedient.</P>
    <P>It is quite easy to arrange between the different sections of the population with regard to the price at which goods which are intended for the home market should be sold.  But when it comes to the items for export I cannot see anything unreasonable in saying <Col N="770" /> that a subsidy should be given if ther is a net advantage thereby.  It is the most natural thing in the world.  I wish there were other things which we should produce in this country at a reasonable cost and which could be exported under a subsidy.  It would be a very much better thing to have resources of that kind rather than to be paying out the sums that are being paid in unemployment assistance and from which no returns come.  The Deputy who dreams that we will have in the near future a Government in power that will not find it necessary to take steps of that kind is living in a fool's paradise.  I take the item mentioned by Deputy O'Neill on yesterday for which he asked for a subsidy&mdash;shell-fish.  Will Deputy O'Neill say that shell-fish would be a paying proposition apart from the economic war?  Shell-fish is an article for which a subsidy should always have been given if the people engaged in that industry were to enjoy a living wage.  I do not think that Deputy O'Neill would hold that the people engaged in the shell-fish industry were ever given as reasonable return.  Similarly as regards any items of agricultural or industrial production, the time may come when we will have to decide between the closing down of such an industry and asking the population generally to come to its help.  It seems to me that, so far as the theoretical arguments advanced here against bounties and subsidies on exportable surplus goods are concerned, these are unconvincing arguments.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brennan, in order to support his argument against bounties and subsidies referred sneeringly to guaranteed prices and subsidies for wheat. Deputy Brennan did not explain why it is reasonable for a manufacturer to sell his goods at a price fixed by him&mdash;a price which gives him a fair margin of profit&mdash;and why it is unreasonable for the State to intervene with regard to wheat to ensure a suitable price in order that the farmer may get the cost of production?  Surely if the Deputy were going to dethrone the whole business of subsidies for beet and wheat and so on, and the whole idea of guaranteed prices, he might have <Col N="771" /> gone further and tried to convince us where it is wrong.  To very many people in the world at the present time subsidies are simply the obvious things. It seems to them right and proper that the main producers of the country&mdash;the people who are producing things that are most required by the general population&mdash;should be guaranteed a price, and that the State should see that they get that price.  I did not hear any speeches other than the speeches of Deputies Brennan and Burke.  So far as my poor judgment goes, I am satisfied that these two Deputies, at all events, have not made a case for the rejection of this Estimate, but that, in fact, the bulk of Deputy Brennan's remarks were an absolute justification of export bounties and subsidies, and were really support for the Government in this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillianRKent" hpid="Mr. Kent Mr. Kent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kent</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot understand why any Deputy in this House, especially farmer Deputies, should have any opposition to this Estimate.  If it comes to an actual reconsideration of the question I hope the Minister for Agriculture will increase the Estimate to a far greater figure than that at which it stands.  A great deal has been said about the bounties which have been paid to the farmers for the past few years.  A great deal was said about the grievances which the farmers of this country had when they sold their cattle to buyers in the fairs and markets.  It was said that not one penny of the bounty which was paid by the Government ever came near the pockets of the farming community. Deputy Burke has spoken about the sacred cow.  Everybody knows that the cow and calf were always the mainstay of the farmers of this country.  When two big political parties get hold of that cow, when the Fianna Fáil Party get hold of her horns, and the United Ireland Party get hold of her tail, they dismember her in a very short time, and leave the Centre Party looking on in utter helplessness.  We cannot go to the farming community's rescue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am going to support and vote for this Estimate.  In doing so.  I may say that the Minister for Agriculture is <Col N="772" /> doing a great deal to assist the farming community to go through the trying times in which they find themselves just now.  We had a subsidy of 5/3 a barrel for wheat last year.  I grew nine acres of wheat last year and it was a profitable crop.  It returned nine barrels to the statute acre and I sold the wheat for 18/- a barrel.  I am now waiting for my bounty from the Minister.  I also grew beet, and that has to be sent on to the Mallow beet factory.  By extra tillage I was able to employ extra labour.  As regards the tillage policy of the Minister, farmers who are in strict opposition to the Government at present have shown a considerable number of acres of wheat during the past couple of months and they are going to increase appreciably the area under wheat and barley. It may be said that the Government find it difficult to obtain an alternative market for our surplus cattle.  There is an alternative market to be found, and that alternative market is here at home.  If the Government would give full de-rating in respect of agricultural land, it would enable the farmers to kill and consume some of the surplus stock which they are trying to export to England.  There is no doubt that the farmers of this country are badly hit at present.  They have a very poor market for their cattle.  They get a very poor price from the co-operative creameries for their milk.  Deputy Davin said that, were it not for the subsidy given by the Government to the dairying industry, milk would be selling at 2d. a gallon.  He may be right in that, but is 4d. a gallon an economic price for milk supplied to the co-operative creameries, when the farmer has to employ labour to milk the cows and to send the milk to the creameries, considering that the consumers in the towns and cities are paying up to 2/- a gallon?  I think that it is time for the Prices Tribunal to examine the whole of this profiteering business.</P>
    <P>As regards the economic war, I believe that, were it not for the action of the two big parties, it would have been settled long ago and the farmer would not be looking for subsidies or bounties.  This country is torn to pieces <Col N="773" /> by political intriguers and it is not for love of the people that these spouters, politicians and orators are going around the country.  Nor is it for love of country or for the welfare of the farmers that they are keeping on the dispute when they ought to be united as one man and put forward a united demand for our just and lawful rights which, I think, we are bound to get from Britain.  We were paying £5,000,000 a year to the British Government.  Will that have to be handed down to generations yet unborn?  Are we to place a millstone around the necks of future generations? This economic war could be settled if the two big parties would come together, as they will have to come together sooner or later to find a solution and present a united demand to the British Government.  Everybody in this country must remember that the soil of Ireland belongs to the Irish people &ldquo;without rent or render, faith or fealty to any foreign power under heaven.&rdquo;  If we had our just rights, for which we fought for several generations, there would be no need for the Minister to bring in a Supplementary Estimate of £763,000 for subsidies and bounties to enable the farming community to eke out an existence.  I hope that, in the very near future, these bounties and subsidies will cease and that the farmers will get an opportunity to work out their own salvation, to earn a decent livelihood and be put in a position to pay a decent wage to their workmen.  Then there will be no necessity for any further bounties.  So long as the present state of affairs continues, I see little hope for the farming community or for the building up of industries.  I see little hope for the future so long as we have the Dublin politicians engaged in mud-slinging and abuse on every occasion degrading and disgracing the Irish people.  I hope that, in the near future, there will be an end to all the abominable nonsense that is going on at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it difficult to say whether I agree or disagree with the last speaker in his attitude towards these bounties.  I certainly agree with him that the necessity for <Col N="774" /> these bounties arises from the economic war and that, were it not for the political policy of the Government, there would be no need for these Supplementary Estimates, because it would not then be impossible for the Government to know where they were at the beginning of the year in reference to such important items of expenditure as this item.  When the Deputy speaks in favour of the bounty system, and, in the next sentence, declares that the main grievance of the farmers is that not one penny of the bounties goes into the producers' pockets, it is obvious&mdash;apart altogether from the economic war&mdash;that that is a rather severe indictment of the bounty system. I know that the Minister for Agriculture takes up the attitude that there is nothing in that charge.  But the charge is made by more than the Minister's political opponents.  I do not know, at the moment, whether or not I can number Deputy Kent amongst the Minister's political opponents. However, I think that any appointed public body in Kerry can be described as being wholeheartedly Fianna Fáil. Yet, in the newspaper of yesterday or the day before, I found the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Kerry County Committee of Agriculture called upon the Government to reconsider the whole question of bounties with a view to ensuring that the producers get the benefits.  Mr. Hegarty said that, undoubtedly, the farmer did not get the benefits.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therein he agrees with Deputy Kent, so that even those loyal bodies can see the futility of the present Government policy, if they have a policy.  I always confessed a certain amount of sympathy with the Minister for Agriculture, because I believe he is not allowed to have a policy for agriculture.  In certain matters he has&mdash;the growing of wheat, the subsidising of wheat&mdash;that is the Minister's policy, and he believes in it. But when it comes to agriculture as a whole, I do not believe he is allowed to have a policy.  Otherwise, I find it impossible to understand how, when it comes to a question of the general Estimates and Supplementary Estimates, he enunciates, at different <Col N="775" /> dates, entirely conflicting policies. Listening to the Minister in the summer of 1933 we might consider that we knew where we were; and listening to him later, in March, 1934, and not remembering what we heard in the summer of 1933, we might still think that we knew where we were.  If we listened to him yesterday we, and all those people in the country interested, would certainly find it difficult to know where we were as regards agriculture. The House is not so short in its memory as not to remember the solemn statement of the Minister in the summer of 1933, when he twitted members of the Opposition on not seeing what he said was patent to everybody. According to the Minister, in 1933, what was patent to everybody was that his policy then, and previously, had been more tillage, and, therefore, more cattle.  Yet some nine months afterwards he told the same House, speaking from the same bench, that the policy of the Government was more tillage, less cattle.  From the report of the newspapers to-day I gather that his latest policy is, &ldquo;let the farmers produce as good cattle, and as many cattle as they can sell.&rdquo;  I believe that the policy of July, 1933, is what the Minister really believes in, because he admitted the force of the argument that more tillage inevitably meant more cattle.  He admitted that that particular argument was insuperable. How then his policy of last March is to be brought into conformity with his policy of more tillage, more cattle, is more than I can make out.</P>
    <P>It must be remembered this is the same Government which asks for these bounties in order to enable us to keep our hold on the British market, but that at the beginning of the year indulged&mdash;I think that is the proper word to us&mdash;in a policy of calf slaughter in order to ensure that in the future we would not have that exportable surplus which cannot now be exported at a profit owing to the economic war.  What is the Minister's policy?  I have my own views as to the policy of the Government in regard to the agricultural industry, and so far <Col N="776" /> as it is concerned.  Most of us complain that the Government have no policy. As I say, I do not blame the Minister for that.  I sympathise with the Minister, because, in these matters, I believe he is not allowed to have a policy.  He thinks it a sound agricultural policy for this nation that the more cattle they were able to export the better, because he admitted that in the summer of 1933; but he is not allowed to have that policy.  That sound policy, from his point of view, was sacrificed in order to win the economic war at any cost.  That is the reason of all the chopping and changing and the killing of calves; that is the reason of the obvious inconsistency and incoherence in the actual agricultural policy outlined by the Minister.  I do not think that the Government of which he is a member is capable of framing any sane agricultural policy at the moment.  Anything that the Government has done in that respect in the last 18 months, apart from what I might call its sheet-anchor, such as the growing of wheat, so far as existing agricultural economy is concerned, has been done as a hasty expedient, not as an assistance for agriculture, but to hide, for the moment, the disastrous effect of its general policy.  That general policy is making impossible, not merely an economic policy as a whole, but is certainly making impossible any consistent policy on the part of the Minister for Agriculture.  It practically means that no man in the position of the Minister can frame any same economic policy.</P>
    <P>In his capacity as Minister for Agriculture he must believe in what he proclaimed in the summer of 1933&mdash;more wheat and root crops, therefore more cattle, and the more cattle the more wide the markets necessary.  But that is cut across by an entirely different set of considerations.  There is the policy of winning the economic war, which, in the minds of every member of the Party opposite, from the President downwards, means we must get rid of the cattle trade at any cost.  That policy was enunciated by the President as far back as 1927.  It was reiterated by him and his colleagues when they rejoiced in the destruction of our <Col N="777" /> foreign trade.  They rejoice in the destruction of our foreign trade, while, at the same time, they are paying bounties in the hope of holding that trade.  Why these increased Estimates? In order that we may get into markets that we believe to be worthless.  We are spending millions in order to keep our hold on markets which we are told are worthless.  Why should we continue to spend money to get into these markets when we are told that those markets are gone?  What is the real view of the Government?  Is it that the English market is gone, and gone for ever, and, thank God, that it is gone for ever; or is the real voice and policy of the Government, what one would imagine would be the policy behind a system of export bounties&mdash;to get into that market and no other market?  How is it, if that market has gone&mdash;how, even if it is disappearing as a commercial asset&mdash;that the other Dominions are able to increase their imports very substantially, as they have increased them in the last three or four years to the extent that we have lost?  How is it that they have been able to increase their exports to that market that is gone, or, if not gone, that we are told is going?  The thing does not bear examination.  Either you have belief in the particular policy that the English market has gone and that we cannot get it back, or else you believe the policy that we must pay, as we are paying indirectly, the land annuities in order to keep our hold on that market.</P>
    <P>I understand that yesterday the Minister referred to the wisdom of certain bacon producers in this country in refusing to sell at a satisfactory price here in order to keep their hold on that market&mdash;that market which has gone and for which a bounty is now given in order to enable them to keep their hold on it.  Is the policy of the Government more tillage, less cattle; or more tillage, more cattle?  Is the policy: Keep out of the English market which has gone, or keep in the English market and pay very heavily for it?  Remember&mdash;and Ministers were particularly alive to this particular argument before they became <Col N="778" /> Ministers&mdash;remember that, when you have bounties of this kind got out of the public purse, it is the producer that will pay in the end.  Here, still, the farming community is the producer. We may wish to change that. We cannot do it in five or ten years to any appreciable extent.  Farming, unless we go into bankruptcy, must continue to be the main producing factor in this country.  That being so, the Minister's own doctrine should have told him that if we come to the assistance of the farmers by means of bounties, it is the producer that will pay in the long run&mdash;in other words, the farmers will pay it themselves. And all for what?  To get into a market that we are kept out of on account of the economic war.</P>
    <P>Let us leave aside who is responsible for that war.  It is none the less obvious that no effort is being made to settle it, and the country pays for that.  The Government goes from expedient to expedient and the farmer is, more or less, like the camel, living on himself.  He is eating up the resources he had put aside.  When I say the farmer, I mean not merely the big farmer but the small farmer, if by him you mean the farmer with 30 or 40 or even 10 acres.  The small farmers are hit as hard as the big farmer.  Deputy Moore spoke of a certain inconsistency. He must know that there are complaints, and complaints not confined, as I have already pointed out, to the opponents of the Government, not confined to the neutral Party&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Well, the Centre Party, as Deputy Kent called it.  Deputy Moore must know, as I was saying, that there are complaints that these bounties do not accrue to the advantage of the producer.  Take the question of relieving rates.  The farmer gets the direct benefit there and it is idle to say that that is not a heavy charge.  Within the last couple of weeks I have met a couple of farmers whose rates in Kerry formerly, under the Commissioners, were between £15 and £16, but which have now gone up to between £30 and £40. That relief, surely, would be direct <Col N="779" /> benefit to the producer.  Are the Government serious&mdash;or is the President, as the only director in the last resort and every resort of the policy of the Government&mdash;are they serious in maintaining that the English market is not worth holding and that it has gone?  What other market are you going to get?  It is obvious&mdash;these very bounties are a confession of it&mdash; that there is no other market, and it is equally obvious from the trade returns for every month that there is no other market.  These bounties are being used&mdash;must be used&mdash;to get us into the one market and into that market only.  Look at the trade returns for the month of October and see our trade with other countries. What do our exports to other countries amount to?  They amount to a few thousands in comparison to our exports to Great Britain.</P>

    <P>We have some countries, I admit, where there is an increase of exports and imports.  For instance, let me take the case of Russia.  I will admit that our import trade from Russia increased from £14,000 in October, 1932, to £53,000 in October, 1933, and to £80,000 in October, 1934.  I will admit, further, that our export trade with Russia increased also.  It increased even four times&mdash;from £1 to £4. Surely it is not the serious policy of the Government any longer, whatever they may have said at election times about alternative markets, to hope to secure alternative markets! These very bounties show that they have no hope of any alternative market, and we know perfectly well that there is no alternative market.  The trade returns, published every month, show that not merely has no alternative market been achieved, but that there is none in the offing.  And remember, it is a long time ago, at least it is a long time as the minds of Ministers work&mdash;it is a long time ago comparatively since the Minister told us he had got these alternative markets.  I think that was in the June of 1933; but when he was asked what these alternative markets were, modesty overcame him and he refused to reveal them.  He would not reveal them to the Opposition, because <Col N="780" /> the Opposition might crab them! He was challenged to mention where the markets were.  He would not tell the Opposition, because they might sabotage the markets! The farmer has waited, and the exporter has waited the 18 months between that time and this, and the export returns issued every month fail to reveal any such alternative markets.  The returns show very often an increase in our imports from other countries besides Great Britain, but they show no increase worth speaking of in exports to them.</P>
    <P>Now, what is the purpose of it all? These bounties help to pay the land annuities.  Indirectly, they help the farmer of this country to pay to Great Britain the land annuities.  Therefore, although the economic war is taking place on account of the land annuities, the land annuities are being paid with the help of these bounties and the tariffs that are being imposed by Great Britain.  Remember, it is not the game of the Irish farmer that is being played by this Government.  The game that is being played by this Government is the game of the English farmer, or at least of a small set of English farmers.  It is to their interest, as was pointed out on one occasion by the Minister for Industry and Commerce and again and again by other speakers&mdash;it is to the interest of a certain number of English farmers to keep Irish cattle out of England.</P>
    <P>The Ministers have helped them, and we have played their game for them. The Government has played their game for them, so that they are consolidating their position.  So far as the cattle we are exporting are concerned, we are helping them to build up their herds and make them more independent than they are at present of Irish cattle. That is not playing the game of the farmers of this country.  It is playing the game of the English farmers or a certain knot of the English farmers, at all events.  This question of bounties is merely an attempt not to deal with the position.  It does not get to the root of the situation.  It is merely an attempt, together with other measures of the Government, to prevent the wound smarting for the time being. That is all, practically, it comes to.  It <Col N="781" /> is not dealing with the real evil that is making the position of any farmer in this country intolerable, so far as he is a farmer.  Agriculture has ceased to be an economic proposition.  No farmer, great or small, of five acres, ten acres or 50 acres, can live at present if he confines himself to his farm.  He has to seek help elsewhere.  He has to get work on the roads or on something else to keep him going.  His farm no longer supports him.  Road work and all that may be extremely useful, but in the ordinary sense it is not productive.  We are losing our trade, losing it not merely steadily but quickly, and the unfortunate farmer in the long run will have to pay these subsidies himself, while the taxes to meet them need not have been imposed were it not for the policy of the Government.</P>
    <P>At the present moment the farm of a man holding 30 or 40 acres cannot pay. He cannot make it pay.  That is the situation that confronts him this year, as far as he can see, as long as the Government continues this policy. Unless there is a very radical change in the policy of the Government, that is going to be his situation next year, and for some years to come.  It is not merely that he is ruined or that his farming is uneconomic for him at the present day.  He might be able to tolerate that and to meet extra expenses out of any sum he has been able to put aside, if he has been fortunate enough to have put something aside out of more fruitful years, if there was any prospect of improvement, but his prospect for the coming years has driven him into a position of despair.  To meet him, and to cope with that particular frame of mind into which he cannot help getting, you have nothing except contradictory statements and continued somersaults on the part of the Government as regards the main industry of the country.  One policy in June, 1933, or in the summer of that year, quite definite; another policy in March, 1934, equally definite but absolutely contradictory of the policy of June, 1933, and then the policy of yesterday that nobody can understand.  Unless the real situation is faced, there is no prospect for the farmer of this country and that, <Col N="782" /> Deputies of all parties had better see and face squarely.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cleary</NameTxt>
      <P>When one finds a substantial farmer like Deputy Professor O'Sullivan so enthusiastic about the subject of agriculture it gives one great courage here and it should be a source of great encouragement to the Minister.  The Minister appears to have done one thing anyway and that is to make agriculture a very interesting subject, even for a University Professor. But even as a University Professor, speaking of agriculture in the role of a Deputy, one would think that he would take some kind of trouble to make some little suggestion upon which the dummy of a Minister for Agriculture&mdash;to use the words of another statesman on the Opposition Benches, Deputy Dillon&mdash;might be able to go on.  Having listened to Deputy Professor O'Sullivan I have been trying to make up my mind whether at one moment he was speaking as a farmer, substantial or otherwise, another moment as a University Professor, another moment as a Deputy or another moment as a private individual. However, I thought he might, even by accident, let slip some sort of suggestion by which the dummy Minister for Agriculture might find some way out of the present crisis, but he was just as futile as some other speakers on the subject from the Opposition Benches, although I think he is just as qualified for the position of shadow Minister as any other speaker who appears to have spoken with that end in view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are handicapped here at the moment in that the Party who are criticising our policy have no leader who could outline a policy.  They have four big men, four leaders, with no policy or four different policies but they have no shadow Minister for Agriculture, unless we are to regard Deputy Professor O'Sullivan as shadow Minister and, to my mind, he would be more a blot, speaking physically, than a shadow in that respect.  I think it is rather hard on the Minister for Agriculture, if we are in such an apparently hopeless position, that the Opposition would not be able even as a result of <Col N="783" /> our huge failure from that particular point of view, to formulate some kind of policy.  Even if they had not our huge failure for the past two years to go on, they had ten years of office themselves and might they not try to attempt to formulate the policy they had during these ten years or the policy they wished they had tried during the ten years they were in office?  It is a hopeless mess both for the Government and the Opposition&mdash; the position of this Opposition.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bennett, who is an experienced agriculturist, stated that this question of the cause of economic depression here, should and could be easily removed.  He did not tell us how it could be done.  He did not know himself apparently.  The cause of agricultural depression is a very serious thing, and if it is so apparent as they appear to think it is, why not tell us about it?  Why not expound it here and, if it is too precious a policy to be discussed across the floor, why not ask to meet the Minister for Agriculture in private and tell him the wonderful plan they have for building up agriculture? On their statements their policy as far as the present Government is concerned is a policy of non-co-operation. It was stated months ago that their policy was absolutely one of non-co-operation.  They have since that expounded that policy.  It was first expounded by Deputy Dillon in my own constituency and they have carried it out to the letter.  They have carried it so far that their supporters now are able to go out and smash the country in every possible way they can and hold, at their private meetings, that they are carrying out the policy of non-co-operation enunciated by their leaders.  Their leaders, because they have tied their hands with these statements, have been forced to remain silent when they might otherwise condemn such action of smashing up the country.</P>
    <P>Deputy Professor O'Sullivan appears to have a very long memory as far as thinking of things that were said or supposed to have been said by the Minister for Agriculture or the President is concerned.  Sometimes a long <Col N="784" /> memory is a blessing and sometimes it is a very great cause of worry and trouble to the people gifted with that long memory.  I think if there is anything that some members of the Opposition might try to get away from it is the long memory that they appear to have, because if they continue to cultivate it it will bring them back to the time when they put into operation a certain policy that was absolutely turned down by the people.</P>
    <P>We have heard many speeches from the Opposition condemning the policy of the Minister for Agriculture, referring to the ruination that this Government have brought on the country, how the Irish farmers have been destroyed and so on, and yet it is strange that we heard no challenge from them to go to the farmers and go to the country.  It used to be a great gag with the Opposition: &ldquo;Go down to the country, go down to the people; we insist that you face the people.&rdquo; In spite of all the condemnation that we have heard from them of the policy of the Minister for Agriculture, they have not issued the challenge: &ldquo;Go to the people.&rdquo;  I think they are wise in that respect.  They would be wiser still if they realised that, when in the recent past the Government did go to the people, when the question of bounties and subsidies, the agricultural policy of the Government, the economic war and all the rest of it had all been thrashed out here for almost a year&mdash;when all these questions had been explained to the people&mdash;the Opposition Party was absolutely wiped off the map.  Surely that ought to be sufficient lesson for them.  It is no consolation for the country to learn that the Opposition, having been wiped off the map by the people, should begin to destroy themselves under the pretence that it was they themselves were the cause of the whole mistake or that it was their leader or their shadow Minister for Agriculture ruined them at the last election.  It is no consolation for the country to be told that only for these two they would have got back.  Having listened to the Opposition for some time I am encouraged more than ever to feel certain that the policy of the Government <Col N="785" /> and of the Minister for Agriculture is absolutely right.</P>
    <P>There is no challenge now from the Opposition about going back to the people.  We hear them talk about the English market being gone, thank God.  We can thank God that there will be no going back on the old policy that was in force in this country in their time.  There has been a complete change in our economic policy, and I am disposed to believe that there are members of the Opposition who are just as thankful for that as we are. If they got back to office again I believe many of them would be just as enthusiastic in pursuing that policy as we are.  One of their leaders, Deputy Bennett, stated in Limerick some time ago that they were in a political fight; that no matter what policy the Government adopts, be it good or bad, they had got to be against it because their hands were tied in a political fight.  They are not out for the good of the country.  They are in a political fight, as they say themselves, and their whole policy is to destroy the Government even though in doing so they destroy the people.</P>
    <P>The question of the bounties is an important one.  I believe myself that there are many matters in connection with it that could be better regulated. I think that if we had a helpful Opposition, with a national outlook and policy, that we could, having accepted the economic policy of this Government, as the Irish people have accepted it, make very rapid strides forward. I do not agree with the view expressed to-day by Deputy Brennan. He said that if only in a minority of one he is entitled to continue to obstruct the policy of the Government. I always thought it was the policy of the Opposition that majority rule should be accepted.  Since the vast majority of the people of this country have accepted the policy, agricultural and otherwise, of this Government, I think the Opposition, as a minority, and a vast dwindling minority, should agree to that policy.  They might criticise it, but they should not obstruct its being put into operation. I think if we had a nationally-minded <Col N="786" /> Opposition that, with their co-operation and our work as a Government Party, this bounty question could be regulated in a more satisfactory manner.  It has not been satisfactory and even the Minister for Agriculture has stated that at times.  I have the greatest sympathy with the Department of Agriculture.  The Minister and his officials have had to tackle one of the biggest problems which this country has ever had to face.  It was preceded by a struggle that politically brought about great changes in the whole economic situation.  The people had to be gradually accustomed to these changes.  In view of all that it was impossible to have a perfect bounty system from the start.  What I am convinced of is that this bounty system could have been better regulated and have been much more satisfactory to producers if we had got decent co-operation from the Opposition.</P>
    <P>I do not deny that many farmers are in a precarious position, particularly those who are supporters of the Party opposite.  I know quite a number of farmers, political supporters of theirs in the County Mayo who, in this present month, would be awaiting a cheque of from £17 to £22 from the beet factory in Tuam were it not for the fact that they acted on the instructions they received from their leaders. They prevented these farmers from growing beet, not because the price that was offered was uneconomic but because it was a Government scheme. They also prevented these farmers from growing wheat and barley for the same reason: not because the price offered was uneconomic but because these were Government schemes.  I know many farmers in Mayo, supporters of theirs, who are very sorry men to-day because they accepted the advice that was given to them by their political leaders and did not grow beet, wheat or barley.  I had a meeting in part of my constituency and I encouraged these men to grow beet. I got the names of over 60 men who were prepared to do so.  Some nights afterwards their local political leader from Kiltimagh held a meeting and he got these men, who are members of <Col N="787" /> the Fine Gael, or whatever they call it now, to withdraw from the scheme. These men are grousing and grumbling to-day, not against the Government but against the political leaders who misled them.</P>

      <P>I have consulted my Party.  I should like if Deputies here would consult their intelligence, if they have any.  I should like to hear reasons advanced as to why this Vote should be referred back.  I have not heard any.  The whole gamut of the agricultural policy has been traversed, and the whole cause and effect of the economic war have again been discussed here.  I think the Government have laid a snare in which some people have been caught; whenever any matter of a particular nature is raised here, useful criticism of it is lost by bringing too many matters under discussion.  We have a situation here produced by the economic war.  I am opposed to the economic war.  I have given as much effort in opposing it on political platforms as anyone, but I admit the contention made here that in at least two successful elections the country has voted for the economic war.  I would vote against it to-morrow if it were a political contest, but here we are not engaged in politics.  We are engaged in administration and law making, and in working the country in the political situation in which we find it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should be less surprised if an amendment were introduced that the bounty instead of being increased by £763,000 should be increased by £1,500,000.  In considering this matter we should confine our attention to the object of the bounties.  Wheat, beet, peat and the agricultural policy generally have, in my opinion, no relation <Col N="788" /> whatever to the subject of bounties. When an ordinary agricultural Vote is on, a Deputy is entitled to criticise and justified in criticising the agricultural policy, but in the matter of bounties, as I understand them, they are given for one reason, and one reason alone.  I am inclined to agree with the last speaker, Deputy Cleary, that the bounty system has not been handled properly.  I suppose it is a matter on which opinions can be given here.  Are there alternative ways of meeting and easing the situation other than by bounty-feeding exports?  In my opinion and, as I view the situation, bounties have arisen in this way: Certain payments that had been made to England were withheld and a dispute arose which has been called the economic war.  The responsibility for that economic war, as far as it rests in this country, is a matter, I think, which should be fought at the polls, but while the economic war is on, the country is losing a certain amount, and sections within the country are losing a greater amount than they should be called upon to lose.  I would have been glad if the criticism of those bounties was directed to that point, instead of rambling over the whole field without hitting any point.  The payments that were withheld from Britain amounted to about £5,000,000, which included over £500,000 for sinking fund.  When those payments were withheld, the British set about in their own way to collect those payments by special tariffs.  The audited figures of their collection, on the authority of the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, show £4,500,000&mdash;to be correct, £4,552,000.  I put it to the Minister for Agriculture that the principle underlying the bounties is that as far as the exporters of produce and ultimately the producers of produce are concerned, an amount equivalent to that taken from them by the British tariffs should ultimately find its way into their pockets.  In other words the equities of the case demand that if this particular situation is to be relieved by a bounty system, it can only be relieved 100 per cent. by voting £4,500,000 for bounties instead of £3,000,000.</P>
    <P>In the matter of bounties, without <Col N="789" /> questioning or opposing the principle of the bounties, or without opposing the policy of the Minister in principle, I should like to hear from the Minister why his contribution to the agricultural community to meet a loss acknowledged at £4,500,000 should be only £3,000,000. There is a loss there of £1,500,000.  An equal quantity or value of goods consumed in this country produces a similar loss to the agricultural producers in this country, and produces it in this way: the general price level is lowered to the extent of an amount represented by the difference between the British tariffs and the total bounties given by the Government.</P>
    <P>If the consumption of agricultural produce in the Free State is equated 50 per cent. with the exports, the total loss to agricultural producers would be £3,000,000.  A great deal has been said, and I agree that it has been justifiably said, about attempts to obstruct the collecting of annuities that are here acknowledged to be collected by the British Government.  Our Government is after going through the farce of putting up the case to this House that the £3,000,000 are to be given for bounties.  But they are collecting these annuities again or, if it is a Parliamentary word, I should say they are carrying on the plunder by collecting them from an industry that is being robbed to a greater extent than it was ever robbed in our grandfather's time by rack renting and absentee landlords.  Statements were made about communistic efforts being made to bring the law into contempt, by the obstruction of roads and by the felling of trees.  I am not one of those who believe in preaching one thing and doing another thing.  One hundred per cent. of my sympathy is with those who went out to block roads, and who were men enough to stand up to it when they were up against the Tribunal.</P>

      <P>What has produced the cause, or has given rise to the bounties is something that we cannot get away from.  If there was no economic war there would be no case for bounties. These bounties are not in the same category as subsidies for wheat growing or for beet.  Wheat and beet are, if you like, new lines of agricultural policy that cannot be dealt with except by subsidies.  Here is a trade interfered with to the extent I have mentioned&mdash;the figures I gave are incontrovertible&mdash;to the extent of £4,500,000.  I will not develop that aspect of it any further, because there are motions on the Order Paper on which it can be more appropriately developed.  Although I do not agree with bounties, still as the paying of bounties, in the circumstances that have arisen, is a fixed policy, I see no reason why I should not vote for this increase.  While we have bounties I am satisfied that we should have this increase but I believe it should be for another £1,500,000.  Therefore, unless a very good case is put up, I must vote for increased bounties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take it that under this heading other important matters dealing with the cattle trade properly come under discussion; those who got licences to export cattle and got the export bounties. The Minister knows by now that the producers, the farmers, who, theoretically he claims he set out to benefit by the bounties, and their first cousins the licensees, did not get the benefit of either.  When the question of licences arose during the stall-feeding season of last year the Minister dished out licences to the dealers&mdash; not to the stall feeders.  The dealers swarmed around him and apparently convinced him that they were &ldquo;it&rdquo;; that no one else counted.  The Minister &ldquo;fell&rdquo; for that.  To give him his due, when a case was put before him, the Minister remedied the situation, but I have still to learn why he changed the policy which he decided on <Col N="791" /> partially on February 1st and finally on February 8 of this year, namely, to give the licences to the producers.  Though licences are not mentioned here, indirectly they are affected because the bounties go to the exporters.  I should like to hear the Minister defending his future policy on licences.  Perhaps on some of the motions on the Order Paper he might get more scope there. Deputy Cleary talked very wildly about politicians preventing farmers growing crops that would pay them. The politicians have fooled the farmers considerably for a long time but it would take more than any politician I know to prevent any farmer growing a crop that he was satisfied would pay him.  Incidentally, I should like to know what area Deputy Cleary had under beet in the newly discovered gold mine in Tuam&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I can understand voting against the principle of bounties or voting for a lesser sum. That would be a negative to the motion.  I can understand an amendment asking for a larger sum or asking to have the proposal referred back for reconsideration, if it was based on the ground that £763,000 is not enough. I would vote for such an amendment. But, unless some tangible reason is given for referring it back, I must vote for increased bounties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to be very brief.  I cannot help, by way of preface, remarking that Deputy Davin, whose speech I listened to with a good deal of attention, suggested that there had been no constructive proposals put up during the debate on this Vote for export bounties and subsidies. Deputy Cleary stated that the Opposition had not formulated and could not formulate a policy, and he went on to suggest, in one of the wildest statements I think I ever heard Deputy Cleary making&mdash;and he is rather remarkable for making wild statements&mdash; that the Opposition was wiped off the map.  The question I would like to <Col N="792" /> address to the Minister, particularly as I believe he is one of the few Ministers with any sanity left, is this: Is there anything to be gained by wild statements of that character?  Analyse the position of this House, and all it means is that the Government of to-day are kept in office by the Labour Party.  They have exactly a majority of one.  Let me appeal to that highly-intelligent Deputy, Deputy Kelly. Does he suggest that that connotes that the Opposition to this Government is entirely wiped out?</P>
      <P>We should have some regard for the value of words.  A little knowledge of the King's English would do some Deputies on the Government Benches a lot of good.  Deputy Davin and everyone of his colleagues must know that the most constructive suggestion that can be put up, which would have for its object the ending of these export bounties and subsidies mentioned in the Order Paper, is to bring about a settlement of the economic dispute with our neighbours across the Channel.  Surely it is not beyond the range of possibility to get four or five sensible, intelligent men from the Government Party to sit down and discuss the ways and means by which this dispute can be ended?</P>
      <P>We must also have regard for the capacity of this country to pay.  How long does the Minister believe this country will continue to be able to pay out subsidies and bounties to the extent of £1,500,000 per annum?  How long does he think the country will stand it?  Have we illimitable financial resources?  Have we any wonderfully capacious pool into which is poured, through the productive efforts of our people, millions upon millons of pounds to enable us to continue to give this kind of dope to the farming community, for it is nothing less than dope?  It galvanises, perhaps for a few weeks or a half season, representing two or three months, the agricultural activities of the country.  The agriculturist is allowed to fall into a sickness, a stupor, and an attempt is made to rouse him temporarily by means of these subsidies and bounties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have heard a lot said about the home market.  Deputy Kent and, <Col N="793" /> perhaps, other speakers have talked about the home market.  The Minister has admitted that the requirements of our home market at present and for many years to come will be rather easily satisfied.  It will be relatively easy, at any rate, to satisfy home market requirements.  We have been told about alternative markets.  I believe that these subsidies and bounties are meant to enable us to get across to the other side of the Channel our agricultural produce, to get it to the country whose market we were told was gone for ever.  I do not want to repeat these phrases, because they have been repeated <i>ad nauseam</i> in this House.  Obviously, this sum of money is required for the purpose of getting our produce into the English market.  I am anxious to know from the Minister or his advisers where are the alternative markets.  The only alternative market I can see and that the ordinary student of politics and economics in this country can see, is the British market.  Do we expect to get a market for our surplus agricultural products in Germany, China or Peru?  All the alternative markets that we heard about from the public platforms are rather slow in coming to the front.  Some time ago I examined trade returns and I found that most of those foreign countries we hear so much about in the Dáil and outside take very little of our produce but that we take a relatively large amount of their produce.  That kind of adverse trade balance is not good for any country.  Added to that, we have a continual drain on our resources in order to get into a market that we said was already gone.</P>
    <P>I would like to give the Minister some idea&mdash;possibly he must have observed it in his Department&mdash;of the kind of market that exists for one commodity, namely, poultry.  I have seen, no later than this week, an order given to one trader by a very large firm of importers in London to supply him with at least 15,000 turkeys for the Christmas season, guaranteeing to that trader at least 11d. per lb., and if at any time the price went below 11d. the trader would not be disadvantaged; but if and when the price <Col N="794" /> would rise to even 1/6 a lb. the trader would get that 1/6.  I would like to know of any alternative market for that commodity or of any other business man in any country such as Germany, China or Peru who would deal in the same way with our business men as the English trader to whom I have referred.  I feel sure the Minister will agree with me that all these subsidies and bounties come out of the pockets of the ordinary people of the country.  In that connection, I would like to commend to the sound&mdash;it may be otherwise&mdash;common sense of the Labour Party that every penny that is taken out of the common pool in this country, whether it be for subsidies or for any other purpose, represents money that certainly will be diverted from the purpose which the Labour Party pretend to serve, namely, social services such as widows' and orphans' pensions and other matters of that kind.  Out of the common pool, as I have suggested, you can only take as much as is in it.  You cannot get more out of a pint pot than a pint, and if this continual frittering away of the nation's financial resources is to continue, I certainly feel that it will be a very nervous and anxious time, not alone for traders and business people and the agricultural community but for the workers of this country.</P>
    <P>There is another point which I should like to emphasise before I sit down.  I feel that the ordinary consumer or citizen in the cities and towns of Saorstát Eireann is in exactly the same position as the farmer who says, and says with a good deal of reason and truth, that he is paying his annuities twice over.  I feel that the ordinary citizen is now paying twice over.  For instance, in the boroughs, he has been taxed to the extent of 1/6 in the £, imposed on the ratepayers for the purpose of the operation of the Unemployment Assistance Act.  That Bill had hardly passed through the Dáil when the price of beef in the cities and towns to which I refer was put up by 2d. per lb.  Let us take the case of Mr. Consumer in the city, who, for his wife and family purchases, let us say, nine pounds of beef every week.  That would be a <Col N="795" /> fairly small consumption for the average family of five.  He is now paying 1/6 extra for that meat which proves that he is paying not alone the 1/6 extra on his rates for the operation of the Unemployment Assistance Act, but 1/6 extra for his meat because, as a direct result of that Act, Mr. My Friend the Butcher puts up the price of his commodity of beef by 2d. per lb.</P>
    <P>I say that the citizen and the townsman, the ordinary working man here in Dublin, the man who lives in the slums and the man who is not in receipt of unemployment assistance, has every bit as big a grievance against this Government as the farmer.  I sympathise very deeply indeed with the lot of the farmer to-day, but I have always felt that the townsman is suffering, and he will not be met with any brass bands or Brian Boru pipers or Phil the Fluters if he is evicted out of his tenement house, while the farmer will have all that panoply of war, and all the decorative pipers, etc., if he is evicted from his farm.  Remember that in thousands and thousands of cases, the poor struggling working man in the city and the town has paid in rent the purchase price of his little home three or four times over, and still, there is no sympathy for him if he is thrown on the roadside.</P>
    <P>I do not want to take from the position of the farmer.  I come from farming stock myself, and I am not taking from or belittling his sufferings in any way, because I think he has been made to suffer very severely by the present administration, but I want to suggest to the Minister that if he cannot go on <i>ad infinitum</i> paying these bounties and subsidies, there does not appear to me, or any student of present-day politics or economics, to be any chance of an early settlement of this economic dispute.  I feel on this matter that the term of our endurance of this position will be measured only by the patience of our people in being prepared to adopt a system of robbing Peter to pay Paul, and it is certainly robbing Peter to pay Paul to ask the taxpayers of this country to vote huge sums of money to get our goods into the British market, a market which the <Col N="796" /> spokesman of the present Government told them was gone and gone for ever. It is a dishonest policy and a policy that can only end in disaster for this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>I find myself in agreement to a very great extent with the last speaker in dealing with the lot of the townsman.  Theirs is not the lot to be acclaimed with brass bands or pipers' bands in the sufferings and the ills that have been theirs for so long that they seemed to reckon that there was to be no salvation for them, but I recognise that, under the new system, certain alleviation has come to the town worker, notwithstanding all that has been said by the previous speaker, which may largely be attributed to the bounties and subsidies with which we are now dealing and which represent, in my opinion, the weapons that had to be adopted to make the transition from a system which enslaved our townspeople in perpetual bondage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Anthony wonders how the Labour Party, with their common-sense otherwise, can reconcile themselves to the inevitable fate that is going to come on the people whom they profess to represent if this system is persisted in.  He can see the widows' and orphans' pensions, which have not yet come into operation, being robbed in advance and coming to a nullity.  I should like to suggest that, previous to the time when bounties and subsidies were found necessary, when we had no economic war and when the cattle trade and our export business with Britain was at its peak, it was not found possible by the Government then in power even to consider seriously the lot of the widows and orphans in this country.  We had not reached a period of prosperity sufficient to warrant giving any relief to that particular class of the citizens.  Notwithstanding all the &ldquo;Dismal Jimmies&rdquo; and all the terrible things we hear&mdash;that bankruptcy stares the country as a whole in the face; that you cannot take more out of a pint pot than what is in it; and that there is only a common pool from which we all draw&mdash;those town workers and widows and orphans of town and country, have had to look blithely or <Col N="797" /> patiently at a very small section of the country who were prosperous because of the old system without any hope of their sharing in it.</P>
    <P>The process that is taking place now, in my opinion, is one which causes certain pre-natal pains in transferring from one system to another, but, even in anticipation, we find that social services are improved and that the lot of the town worker is improved.  I am intervening in the debate particularly because of the references of the last speaker that he, while springing from farmer's stock, is mainly concerned with the workers of the cities and towns.  I share a very similar position with him.  I am the second generation only in the town and there are very few people in this country who are remotely removed from the land and who can forget their connections with the land, but my sympathies are with the poor both in the towns and in the country.  I recognise that the present system of subsidies and bounties paid by the Government is incidental to, and necessary, if they are going to pursue to a successful issue, the determination of the people of this country as a whole to transfer from the position in which we were for many years of being a rich farm for the produce of beef to be exported to just one customer, with all our eggs in one basket and at a price which could not be measured by the price paid to the producer.  The price had a bigger reaction than that for it meant that we, in the towns and cities, were doomed to be the importers of the shoddy manufactures of other countries which were paid for by the fat of the land and to which we were denied access.</P>
    <P>We who have been evicted from those lands and doomed to live in the towns and cities, in slums and hovels, found the small farms growing into ranches and the number of wealthy people becoming fewer while the number of paupers was becoming greater.  We are expected to have a miracle performed and to have this position changed in a night.  It is only natural to expect that this change-over to a position of self-sufficiency and to a different form of agricultural economy which would make for the <Col N="798" /> producing from the soil of Ireland, which is essentially agricultural, the maximum benefits on behalf of the maximum number of the population and not for the few, was bound to entail certain hardships on some sections of the community.  I am quite sure that the Government, who have come back here on a couple of occasions with the overwhelming voice of the people behind them, to give effect to a new policy and a new doctrine, are applying their remedies to the best of their ability and skill in order to cause the minimum of hardship to any section of the people in their efforts to bring about that desired ideal.</P>
    <P>I think it is manifestly unfair to select a single instance like the price of turkeys.  Deputy Anthony speaks not only of British merchants but of British philanthropists who are prepared to give a guarantee of a maximum of 1/6 per lb. to the Irish exporter and that the minimum will not fall below 11d, even though they are only worth 9d.  These philanthropists are rare and I know lots of people who would be glad to get in touch with the particular gentleman of Deputy Anthony's acquaintance.  I think it is manifestly unfair to relate the activities of one particular day or one particular month to a matter which is nation wide in its application and which seeks to remove an age-old grievance from which our country has been suffering. It was referred to last night in another debate and very trenchantly dealt with by Deputy O'Reilly of Meath who pointed out that as long as we had the old system of agriculture, depending almost completely and entirely on the raising of beef for export, we had a dwindling human population.  I regretted to hear last night from the Opposition Benches a titter of laughter when the Deputy complained that our trouble was that we had not sufficient people.  I think that was thoughtless laughter.  We want more people here. Anybody who has read the history of this country or any other country will have to admit that as the cattle population increases the human population correspondingly decreases.</P>
    <P>Whether we like it or not, we are faced with the maintenance of an additional <Col N="799" /> population of from 25,000 to 30,000 per year, the best and bravest of our boys and girls, who hitherto regretfully had to be exported, as we exported our cattle, to build up the fortunes of other countries.  Now they are left on our hands to be maintained. They are entitled to the best the country can give them.  There certainly was no hope for them under the former regime.  If there is a hope held out that Ireland can improve its human population and that we can by any means whatever provide them with a decent livelihood, in the development of the soil, in the promotion of industries, then even if these bounties or subsidies are being paid for the moment, I believe that any sacrifice is justified as a temporary measure.  I am certain, as I said at the outset, that the Government, or any Government charged with the administration of this particularly difficult time, will use the subsidies and bounties carefully and well, imposing the minimum of hardship on any special section of the community, for the realisation of that ideal.  If, as has been said earlier, there was any kind of unification of thought amongst the rival political sections as to whether or not it was desirable that we should increase our human population, that we should distribute the wealth of the country more equitably than it has been hitherto, then the application of the remedies would be much more easy, would cause less hardship to any particular section of the community during the time when we are striving to achieve our economic independence.</P>
    <P>It is suggested that the economic war is one which can only be fought by this country for a very brief period; that if it is not brought to a speedy determination, then we automatically must lose.  I think that is a very wrong conception on the part of anybody entering into a fight, whether economic or physical.  I should rather hope that the people who have entered into this test, not lightly, but as a solemn duty which has been conferred upon them to do the best possible, according to their way of thinking, for the majority of the people of the <Col N="800" /> country, are not reckoning on a speedy end to this particular war or conflict, but that they have set their feet on this path in the belief that it leads to the rightful solution by extracting from the soil and the wealth of the country its maximum, whether the people on the other side like it or not.  We have had just one market.  We are told that we are now paying subsidies and bounties to get a depleted amount across to that market, which somebody is alleged to have said was gone, thanks be to God, never to come back. I do not quite share this view, but I go this distance: that if that market was only to be maintained at the price at which it has hitherto been maintained, namely, the constant and continual diminution of our human population, then I fervently thank God that it has gone.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is the function of any Government to exploit the riches of our soil to make rich a small and dwindling number through ruining the greater majority of the people and reducing them to pauperism and desperation.  That, too, would have its retribution, and, with or without a brass band, the hungry people of the towns and cities would demand their rightful place in the sun from any Government in power.  I am glad that the Government have seen fit in time, and before the situation became too desperate, to take the necessary steps, by providing such bounties or subsidies as they considered necessary for the transition period, to bring us from the position that we were in, a position of helplessness, solely depending on that one market.  We are prepared to send them as much as they are prepared to take from us.  We are prepared to exploit any other alternative markets; but, above and beyond all, even with that market or any alternative market, we are determined that Ireland will be exploited to the maximum of its capacity for the production of wealth from the soil, for the manufacture of the things we can manufacture for our own use, and in the sincere hope, which we already have evidence of, of an advance and improvement in the social standard of our people in the towns and cities and rural areas, who hitherto <Col N="801" /> have had little part in the wealth and prosperity of the country as a whole.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion before us deals with the question of the postponement of this Vote moved by the Minister for Finance.  I hope, in dealing with this motion, that I will get some little latitude in replying to Deputy Keyes on the matters to which he referred.  Before answering Deputy Keyes, however, I should like to mention the reasons which have prompted me to support the motion to refer back this Vote.  I do so from the point of view of an ordinary, humble type of Irishman, who does not go about the country, like some of my friends on the Fianna Fáil Benches, exploiting their great patriotism and, what I consider, their sham Republicanism.  I oppose the giving of bounties and subsidies, because I am convinced that if the Government would only display a little commonsense in dealing with the British Government there would be no necessity to-day for bounties and subsidies.</P>
      <P>Before I give a vote&mdash;even if this Estimate never appeared on the Order Paper&mdash;I would like, as an ordinary, humble Irishman, representing a county which has always been loyal&mdash; just as loyal as Limerick&mdash;to the national traditions and to the national sentiments of our people, to have an expression of opinion from the President of the Executive Council of the Irish Free State, that he will come here to this House and make a statement to the effect that he could not make a settlement with the Government of Great Britain unless he was prepared to lower the dignity of the people of the Irish Free State.  I should like to know from the President whether the real reason for this economic war is the fact that he has refused to transmit the annuities which were transmitted by the previous Government, or whether the President has introduced other matters outside the question of the annuities altogether, namely, the complete independence of this country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason I should like to have that statement from the President is this: that as an Irishman I would be prepared <Col N="802" /> to live on potatoes and salt if the President were man enough to come here and state to the members of this House that the reason he will not settle the economic war is that he is out for the complete independence of this country.  Is the President or his Minister for Agriculture or Deputy Cleary or Deputy Smith, or Deputy Rice from Monaghan and the others who go through this country and talk at the cross-roads about Republicanism and about the Republic they themselves have let down&mdash;prepared now to come here, and state that the reason they want this Vote passed is because they want to fight for independence and to restore to the people of this country their complete independence?  If the President does that, we will know who are the Irishmen and who are not Irishmen in this country.  But until the President does that I shall certainly vote against the giving of either bounties or subsidies, because I am convinced that an honourable settlement of this economic war could be effected if the President had only the courage of his convictions.  There would be a settlement honourable to the people of this country if, in a word, the President would look for the co-operation and the goodwill of the vast majority of the Irish people.  But to my mind, the President prefers the cheers of that very small minority of the people who are out for what they themselves call an Irish Republic of the Soviet type&mdash;a Republic which, I am sorry to say, if not publicly supported, is at least, privately supported by the members of the Labour Party, including Deputy Keyes.  I, as a worker, as one who knows as much about the miseries and wants of the workers as any member of the Labour Party, am here to tell Deputy Keyes that the policy as adumbrated and pursued by the Government for the last few years has not been any advantage to the working classes.  In proof of that, I can point to the recent motion introduced here by the Labour Party, in which the words appear that owing to the abnormal amount of unemployment prevailing and owing to the terrible want that is prevailing amongst thousands of our people, the <Col N="803" /> Government should forthwith take the necessary steps to put into operation large schemes of employment.  Now, they cannot have it both ways.  Even the Labour Party cannot have it both ways.  They must have one thing or the other.  They must be manly and honest in this thing.  They have not been so up to the present, because when it suited them they have criticised the Government, and when it suited them they have praised the Government.</P>
    <P>What I want to know is this: can this economic war be settled, and thereby the introduction of this Vote avoided? Is the British market of any use to the farmers of this country?  I was listening last evening to Deputy O'Reilly from Meath talking about the prospects of the British market as it exists at the moment.</P>
    <P>Whilst I do not want to be discourteous to any Deputy, I should like to tell Deputy O'Reilly that, as far as the cattle industry is concerned, if he had been a success at that industry there would be no necessity for him to be a T.D. to-day.  But when he gets up in this House and states that the British market is of little or no use to the farmers of this country he is saying a thing which in his own mind he knows is absolutely false.  Deputy O'Reilly took good care, when making comparisons as between the prices paid for Irish cattle and the prices paid for cattle in Great Britain that he referred to the prices paid for cattle in Wales.  He figured that price at from £2 to £3 lower.  He also quoted speeches made by the British Minister of Agriculture.  Both he and Deputy Corry told us that the position of the British farmer was such that the British Minister of Agriculture was bound to take the steps he is now taking in order to preserve the industry in Great Britain.  But Deputy O'Reilly and Deputy Corry forgot to tell the House here that in addition to the restrictions placed upon the cattle industry there was also the tariff, which amounted to £6.  There is no mention of that by Deputy O'Reilly or Deputy Corry or by other Deputies on the Fianna Fáil Benches. Do not the Ministers and do not the back-benchers on the Fianna Fáil side <Col N="804" /> know that a cattle dealer who buys a 10 cwt. beast at 25/- a cwt. pays £12 10s. for that beast.  On top of that he has to pay a duty of £6.  In addition, there is £1 10s. for freight, etc.  These three items make £20.  Unless the cattle dealer is a lunatic, philanthropist or millionaire, he has got to get £20 for that beast in the British market before he can call a halfpenny of that his own. Yet we have on the Fianna Fáil Benches well-educated men like Deputy O'Dowd stating publicly that even if the economic war were ended in the morning there would be no difference between the price received here now and the price that would be paid on the expiration of the economic war.</P>
    <P>We are asked by the back-benchers on the Government side to have a little charity and to display a little co-operation. I have, on many occasions, gone out of my way to show that charity and sympathy and to give a little co-operation.  But in return what do I find?  Nothing but insults from the Government Benches.  We have things said here that have absolutely no relation to the point at issue, and have absolutely no relation to the condition of affairs that exists in the country at the moment.  Why cannot the members of the Fianna Fáil Party be honest like the rest of us, and admit once and for all that the British market is the only market in which the Irish farmer, be he United Irelander or Fianna Fáil or Labour, can get a fair return or a fair price for his surplus agricultural produce?</P>
    <P>Again, we are told by the members of the Government that, during this transition period, it is necessary that the people should make some sacrifice. We are told also that, if the people want to be free, they must be prepared to make sacrifices.  I am one of those who would be prepared to make any sacrifice for country and always was prepared to do so but I am prudent enough to ascertain beforehand whether these sacrifices will be made in vain. I want to have some information from those in power that, at the end of a given period, there will be some prospect of bringing to an end the present <Col N="805" /> deplorable state of affairs.  There is absolutely no doubt that, if the situation develops as it has been developing for the last two or three years, there will be only one end to it.  I do not want to adopt the rôle of pessimist but, in my opinion, that end will be bankruptcy for a very large section of our people.  That may not be a matter of regret to certain people.  I know, and many of the men on the Government Benches know, that there is a type in this country who would be glad to see other people go bankrupt to-morrow, who would be glad to see the big farmers or the ranchers, as they call them, go bankrupt so that they would have to leave their lands and these people would get in in their stead. Having nothing going in, they do not care three straws if they have nothing going out.  That is the philosophy that is being preached behind the closed doors of the Fianna Fáil clubs.  I am perfectly certain of that.  I charge them now that they tell their dupes down the country &ldquo;When So-and-so, the big farmer, goes bankrupt, you can take possession of his house and lands.&rdquo;  That is the policy pursued and that is how the Party opposite are getting the votes.  It is not on their national policy or on the question of fighting England that they are getting votes but it is on the doles&mdash;free milk and free beef.  &ldquo;Vote for the man who gives the free beef.&rdquo;  We hear a lot about the dignity of labour from the Labour Benches.  It is a peculiar characteristic of the Socialist that he loves doling out other people's money but, at the first sign of danger, he is the first to skip, as was the case in Austria.  Deputy Davin, being near Dun Laoghaire, would not have far to go to catch the first boat for Holyhead.</P>
    <P>I am opposed to any more subsidies or bounties because I am convinced that the President does not want any settlement.  He is afraid.  He has not the moral courage to stand up against that very small section of shouters who call themselves &ldquo;Republicans&rdquo; and with whom the members of Fianna Fáil and, in particular, the back-benchers flirt in secret, not having the courage to come out into the open.  That is the reason why the decent element <Col N="806" /> amongst the Irish people, the hardworking honest people are being completely robbed at the present time. That is why the section of the Irish people that specialised in the raising of cattle are suffering.  Everybody who knows anything about farming knows that the cattle industry is to the whole agricultural industry what the keystone is to the arch.  Remove the keystone and you at once destroy the whole solidity of the building.  In like manner, destroy the cattle industry and you destroy the whole fabric of the agricultural industry.  That is an aspect of the question that has not received sufficient attention from the members of the Government.  They say that they secured the confidence of the people even at the recent county council election.  Again, everybody knows how votes are got.  Sixty per cent or 70 per cent. of the votes cast for Fianna Fáil are not cast because of a desire to fight England.  We know how they are got.  I am not speaking from the point of view of a West Britisher.  I am not speaking from the point of view of a traitor.  I am speaking the honest sentiments of one who loves his country as well as President de Valera or any member of the Fianna Fáil Party does and who is prepared to fight, suffer and endure for his country.  But I am not prepared to make others suffer for the mere sake of suffering or to enable people to have their way in continuing a war which, in the opinion of all right-minded men, can have but one end&mdash; the utter collapse of the agricultural community.</P>
    <P>We may continue for some time. The financial resources of the country were great.  One must pay tribute to the late Government for that.  When they went out of office they handed over a country that was financially very rich.  That has been proved up to the hilt by what the present Government have been able to do.  They have been able to do these things because of the sound financial position established by their predecessors.  I say that persons who have any love or respect for their country should endeavour to inflict as little hardship as possible on any section of the community. <Col N="807" /> I go further and say that it is the duty of the President and members of the Executive Council and, to a lesser extent, of the members of the Fianna Fáil Party not to impose any hardship that can be avoided even on one individual, not to speak of the thousands on whom hardship has been inflicted as a result of this dispute with Great Britain.  I, as a humble member of this House, will not support the giving of any more bounties or subsidies until I hear from the President's own lips what is the real cause of the prolongation of the economic war and whether he has taken any steps to arrive at a settlement that will be honourable to the people of both countries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I expected yesterday that the Minister, when introducing this Estimate, would have told us something more about the details or would enlarge on them, so as to give us sufficient information in order to make a comparison with the paper issued.  We are told that this £750,000 is required in addition to the sum of £2,250,000 already voted for export bounties and subsidies.  The statement of the details set out that &ldquo;additional provision&rdquo; is required &ldquo;for bounties and subsidies on agricultural and industrial commodities exported from Saorstát Eireann and for expenditure connected with trial consignments of such commodities to external markets. The payments will be made,&rdquo; we are told, &ldquo;in respect of such commodities at such rates and subject to such other conditions as the Minister for Finance may from time to time approve.&rdquo; I asked the Minister yesterday, by way of segregating one item, what were the industrial commodities on which bounties were paid and for which portion of this sum was likely to be required in the future.  He promised to get these items.  I would, also, expect that he would come prepared with the statement as to the trial consignments upon which this money is to be spent.  In that connection one would think that we should hear something as to the results that have accrued from these trial consignments up-to-date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="808" /> We do know that the Minister sent cattle to Belgium and lost on that transaction.  Here we have a Minister, not operating as an ordinary commercial man, and, I presume, not subject to the ordinary circumstances that surround a trade concern in the ordinary way, having everything of the best, yet he did definitely confess a loss, which was infinitesmal compared with the losses incurred every day in big matters which form a very big percentage of the amount of money risked on such consignments.  We know that butter was sent to the Continent and we know that in certain consignments of butter trials there was serious loss. But no one told us the true story about certain butter which certainly was prepared for export to the Continent.  The circumstances, as I heard them detailed, are that a certain biggish consignment of butter, lying in Cork for some time, was opened, and was discovered to have round it a thick black scum.  When an attempt was made to take it off, it was then found that the scum went deeper than the mere opening of the receptacle revealed at first glance.  The story went on that this consignment of Government butter was sold, at a big loss by the Government, to certain blenders in this country on the condition that they would not export any of what they had blended.  In other words, that this partly decomposed substance was to be blended with certain other butter in this country and then sold to consumers in this country.  That, in every sense of the word, was a dirty trick, apart from the fact that that loss was incurred.</P>
    <P>Again I do not know if there is complete truth, or some truth, or any truth at all, in the rumour which gained great currency in Berlin regarding a certain trial consignment sent out to Berlin in charge of a rather respectable, highly paid civil servant acting, more or less as a commercial traveller.  I understand that one of the items in this consignment was geese.  We had a reputation for &ldquo;wild geese&rdquo;; they were known on the Continent before. But we sent some domestic ones this time.  They were apparently not taken <Col N="809" /> there in the height of their bloom, or apparently the bloom had gone off. The story was current in Berlin that the geese went high.  That was only to be expected, as they had been kept a certain time not in a refrigerator; so the articles of this trial consignment had, in fact, to be destroyed.  They were not condemned as a nuisance.  I understand they did not go to that point.  Have we had any estimate of the loss incurred there?  There certainly was a loss, a financial loss and there was a terrible loss of prestige.  I do not know whether that is to be regarded as an indication of the success of other activities such as cow testing activities, butter grading activities, and so on, with a view to preparing for market produce of the highest possible standard.  But these are the trial consignments one has heard of.</P>
    <P>We heard in relation to a Vote discussed here last night that statistical experts who visited this country during the year were regaled with great stories as to the magnificently progressive department of statistics there was in this country.  They used to be progressive, and they used constantly to turn out figures which Ministers are rather sorry to see.  These figures we get no more.  They are not presented to us as information when the information is requested here in the House.  We are left without any indication as to what has been the result of the trial consignments which the Minister has ventured to send abroad.  We have no balance sheet and we have no idea as to whether the consignments were sent in such condition as indicated that they had a chance of success, apart from financial success, in exploiting foreign markets in which we have to sell.  I do not mind about financial success&mdash;because nothing has been done on a financial basis&mdash;if you can get our produce in a good condition, have it sold or slaughtered or given away, so that, by some method, you can get rid of it.  It does not matter a whole lot who pays if some ordinary commercial consideration is brought to bear upon it, some activity as to costing and prices, and some attempt made at striking a balance between <Col N="810" /> these things.  The Minister did, however, tell us one very interesting thing last night: that this country had a unique experience in the summer of this year, when there arrived the millenium in one small matter.  He said that we had reached a position in this country in regard to some article of pig production when it was more profitable to sell at home than to sell abroad.  And the Minister immediately took steps to redress that.  He found that although it was more profitable to sell at home, a certain factory&mdash;and he described this as one that took the long view&mdash;preferred to sell even at a less profit abroad, which in this instance meant England.  It can hardly be said of the Minister for Agriculture that he wants to destroy our trade with England.  The people with the long view decided it was desirable to sell at a less profit in England, and he complimented them by describing them as the people with the long view.  He did more than compliment them with having that view.  There was a bigger bounty given to ensure that when they took the economic circumstances into account, which made it more desirable to develop that trade than to sell at home, they would not lose, and there was an extra inducement offered to those who wanted to take the long view.</P>
    <P>Now, why should it be regarded by the Minister, with all his other activities, as having the long view when one decided to sell, not at more profit at home, but at less profit in England? We had to keep the quota.  Whatever figure had been given, we had to see that that was filled.  Otherwise, there was the chance that the British might take us at our word when we said we did not want their market.  They might take us at our word when we said that at times it was more profitable to sell at home and they might decide to leave us to our home market. Why is a thing right in regard to pigs and wrong in regard to cattle or to cows?  What is the terrific difference? If self-sufficiency with regard to wheat and beet is a proper aim, and if it is so definitely the aim that we have got to slaughter surplus cattle, why should we not be content with self-sufficiency <Col N="811" /> in pigs, particularly when we get to the stage that it is more profitable to sell at home than abroad?  Why not try to develop that and see that that circumstance will always last instead of being a very odd phenomenon?  How is it reconcilable to say of people who produce pigs that those with the long view will keep open the British market, and then to speak, of those who wanted to take the long view, say, in regard to cattle, in the way in which the Minister did?</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon already referred to this speech.  It is worth reiteration. The Minister, as reported in the <i>Irish Press</i>, on the 30th June, said: &ldquo;The Government had been accused of being in favour of tillage and out for the destruction of the live stock industry.  The person who made that accusation,&rdquo; said the Minister&mdash;this was the striking speech he made before the Irish Farmers' Protection Association&mdash;&ldquo;was either a fool or a knave to think that the live stock industry is to be destroyed, for if we till we must have live stock; otherwise the farmers cannot use up their barley, straw, or other products, or get manure.&rdquo;  And the conclusion was drawn that we must at least maintain the amount of live stock we have.</P>
    <P>That was the 30th June.  When the Minister began to speak this year on the Slaughter of Cattle and Sheep Bill, he gave us a somewhat different picture, but I think that all the while he held on to that&mdash;that it was necessary to keep cattle, at the present level, or, as the odious phrase has it, that the cattle population of the country should be kept more or less what it is now.  Deputy Dillon had already called attention to the contradiction, within a year, by a colleague of the Minister, Senator Connolly, who, at Kilcock, said that although it had taken one hundred years to establish the cattle trade in the country, with God's help it would not take 100 years to kill it.  That was on the 9th June and, as if that were not sufficient, he hied himself away to Strokestown, in the West, within ten days, to say that it was a damn good thing that the market for cattle in England was disappearing. <Col N="812" /> We need not go, however, to these rather minor lights of this House for examples.  The President said that the market had gone and he thanked Heaven for it.</P>
    <P>That is one side of it.  We are told, in relation to cattle, by the Minister for Agriculture, that we must at least maintain the live stock that we have. His colleague, Senator Connolly, who has been reduced to the woods and forests of the country, speaks differently. He wants to kill it; and the President, if he does not exactly want to kill it, at any rate explains what is happening, with the best possible grace, by saying that the market has gone and thanks Heaven for it.  The answer may be that we must maintain the live stock of the country, that as we have them in their numbers there will always be an exportable surplus, but that there need not be dependence on England.  Hence the trial consignments and hence the extra losses.  That thought ran through many a head before the elections.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kennedy sometimes bills himself as an agricultural expert on the Fianna Fáil side.  Speaking in 1931, in the month of October, he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;They tell you you have no market but the British market.  It is an extraordinary thing that Canada is sending cattle to France and every other European country as fast as they can send them, and we are within two days' reach of these places.  Why should we not do the same?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I wonder does Deputy Kennedy stand in an interrogative way in front of the Minister for Agriculture from day to day, when he is talking of subsidies and bounties with regard to exports to Great Britain, and remind the Minister that Canada is sending cattle to France as fast as they can and that we are only within two days' reach of the country; and I wonder has he answered satisfactorily as to why we cannot do what Canada is doing?</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Reilly, I think, is recognised&mdash;his solitary qualification is agriculture, I think&mdash;as the real agricultural expert in the Fianna Fáil ranks.  I think that his biography says <Col N="813" /> that he has travelled many countries in search of information on agriculture. The weight of his information on agriculture in 1931 was declared to this effect:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There were people in Meath who would say that Fianna Fáil means to destroy our present market, the only market which gives us a living.  It was not their intention to destroy that market.  It was their intention and business to develop any market which would buy from them to the fullest extent possible.  That was their policy and their duty.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is rather in line with the Minister for Agriculture, who wants to maintain live stock at their present level; but it is contrary to what Senator Connolly and the President desire.</P>
    <P>Is there really a policy with regard to this cattle matter?  I think it was on the Slaughter of Cattle and Sheep Bill that the Minister for Agriculture, in answer to an interjection, said that he had always admitted that in respect of cattle the farmers of the country are suffering, and that when one touched on that article of the farmers' production and its sale, he had to admit that there was a definite setback for the farmers of the country.  In the speech that has been referred to, however, he has to join up cattle with everything else.  If they till, they must have live stock.  Otherwise, he said the farmers could not use up their barley, straw and other products, or get manure.  So when the Minister for Agriculture says, as he has said from time to time&mdash;and which he must still hold if he has not changed&mdash;that his view is that the live stock industry is the only thing in which the farmer can be set back, he is pointing to the basis of all agriculture in this country, judging by his own comment.  He has said that tillage and the live stock industry go together.  Surely, he must realise that when these two things are so related, and when he says that it is only in relation to live stock that the farmer is suffering, he must also recognise the deduction that if there is suffering in that, all of agriculture is suffering.</P>
    <P>Now, is there a policy that sooner or later, and the sooner the better, we must stop exporting cattle to <Col N="814" /> England?  The Minister for Defence says &ldquo;yes,&rdquo; because he at any rate has realised this&mdash;I think it is the only economic argument he has indulged in&mdash;that as long as we continue to send cattle to the English market, so long will England be able to exact the land annuities and that, therefore, we must stop exporting cattle to England if we are to be able to hold the land annuities. Is that the policy?  If that is the policy, is it also the policy that we must maintain live stock at around about their present price?  If so, and if that means an exportable surplus, does it mean the further addition to policy that we must get a market elsewhere? If all these things are correct, where is the market to be got?</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon pointed out the other night that not merely are we suffering because there has been exacted, in a rather roundabout and destructive way, the full amount of money that used to be paid without any of this obstruction or destruction of the market.  Deputy Dillon pointed out that not merely is the money being taken from us as before but that, in addition, there is a serious change taking place.  The Deputy pointed out that there has been a quota put from time to time on various types of cattle but that the British, at any rate, have not been so blind to their advantage as to do one thing, that is, they have put no quota or restriction on the export of the herds of the country&mdash;the milch cattle of the country.  One has only to count and to get an analysis of what crosses from time to time to find out that within a comparatively short time we shall not merely have paid, up-to-date, the annuities and the R.I.C. pensions; we shall not merely have done that at a greater cost and suffering to ourselves than if the moneys had been handed over freely, but we shall have made an exchange of greater value to the British, and at a greater loss to ourselves, than is represented by the cash value at the moment.  For years the British have been driven back upon this country because their herds were deficient. They are now getting, as more or less worthless animals, all the carefully-selected and bred herds of the country. <Col N="815" /> If it is recognised that that is happening and if it is agreed either that we cannot prevent its happening or that it is a good thing that it should happen, why do we not get at any rate the best value for the animals?  They are worth more than merely sale as they are going out at the moment. Why would not the Minister make an offer to the British that we would transfer from time to time, say, quarter by quarter, so much of the herds as the English want?  Let us openly and clearly know what the sacrifice is and what the future is going to be.</P>
    <P>It is very hard to discern any deliberate line of policy through the activities of the Government.  In a debate here the other day, one of the Deputies, who ordinarily speaks on these matters, said that, at any rate, the export of money from this country had been stopped.  Almost immediately there was the revelation made, that as far as money is concerned, all the money he talked of, in italics, all the annuities and the R.I.C. pensions, is being collected on the other side. Everybody knows it is being collected except the Fianna Fáil supporters, who blind themselves to it.  In addition to that peculiar view, which is accepted from time to time by Deputies who do not want to see the opposite&mdash;the truth &mdash;we get the other type of phrase which was used in the debate quite recently: &ldquo;There is no good in our sending cattle to England at the moment, the Englishman cannot get a fair price for his own cattle in his own market, and if that market were free and open and there were no tariffs, it would not pay.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The obvious answer to that is the Border.  Are we to assume that cattle are being driven and smuggled across the Border just simply for love of excitement?  There is no bounty that we know of being paid on smuggled cattle.  There must be some inducement to send them across, and the inducement, presumably, is the ordinary one of gain.  But Deputies will seriously use, apart from the <Col N="816" /> restricted market, this further argument, dealing only with the value we may get in the English market for whatever scope it may have, that it is no good, because the price to be got at present for cattle in England is so small.  Unless there is going to be the allegation that in the Six-County area they would fetch a higher price than they do in England, or that the Six-County buyer, through sheer bewilderment or some peculiar idea of self-sacrifice, pays a higher price than our cattle would fetch in England&mdash; unless that argument is put up, there has been as yet no attempt to meet the argument which faces Ministers immediately.  Cattle are being regularly run across the Border.  There is no bounty paid on them.  They are sold simply on account of the ordinary law of supply and demand.  We must conclude that they are sold at a more advantageous price than could be obtained here.  The ordinary law of supply and demand rules the price.</P>

      <P>We shall take that argument, that they are not going. The Minister cannot see cattle crossing the Border, but he can see factories where other people cannot.  He has a blind eye and a good eye, and that results in a distorted vision in most things.  So that is the new argument: there are no cattle getting across the Border! Is that seriously argued?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, that is the way out, to deny there is even 100! Deputy Haslett first made that case here one night.  There was nobody present to put the answer that the Minister for Industry and Commerce has now made. The more brazen that particular reply of the Minister, the more effectively people can assess the argument at its true value.  There are no cattle sent across the Border! Is that believed by anybody?  There are not even 100 going, because 100 will justify the argument I am using.  Have there been any prosecutions in respect of smuggled cattle that would tot up to 100, revealed in the Press?  If so, why have these cattle been sent?</P>
      <P>We have the other side of the argument that the market is restricted and that it is not restricted by any activity on the part of a British Government necessarily hostile to us, even thinking about us at all, but just simply because they want that market for themselves. I think that is another side to it. When we speak in this House of the Ottawa arrangement that might have been made but that has not been made, we are told that the British Minister for Agriculture has said something rather derogatory of the market as a market for exporters.  That is waved here as if it is an answer to the argument that was used.  Has the Minister for Agriculture looked at the figures of the increased entries into Great Britain of Dominion goods?  Does the Minister realise that the other Dominions have in the last 12 months got, through export to Great Britain, at least the £15,000,000 odd that we have lost?  Has the Minister any idea of what we used to sell to Great Britain and of what Great Britain used to consume, and will the Minister tell us just how far the gap has been narrowed between what the British used to produce themselves and what they consumed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the matter of meat products alone, I will go back six years to get <Col N="818" /> figures.  In 1928, in meat of all types, eggs and butter, the British imported £330,000,000 worth of goods.  They produced about £140,000,000 worth of their total consumption of goods, amounting to that £330,000,000, plus the £140,000,000 worth produced and consumed at home, we supplied some. The entire import into Great Britain of meat of all types, eggs and butter, was £33,000,000 worth.  We sent in less than £30,000,000 worth.  Let us assume that the British are narrowing the gap between that £140,000,000 of what they used to produce at home and their consumption.  Have they got to the point that we are narrowed down from the £30,000,000 worth that we used to send in in 1928&mdash;meat of all types, eggs and butter&mdash;and, if not, until we come to that point, can it be said that the market is unnecessarily and by nature, by circumstances over which we have no control, restricted against us?  How is it in those circumstances, with the British expanding their own production, that the other Dominions have been enabled to send into Great Britain in the last twelve months £15,000,000 worth more of products than they used to send?  Why cannot we enter into that market except for the simple reason that we are making the British take from us in taxation on our goods what they used to get openly?</P>
    <P>Now we are going to give export bounties.  We are going to have trial consignments.  I am assuming that these two things are divided: that the bounties mean, just as the Minister had to do in the summer when he found that big economic circumstances had come about, that it was more profitable to sell at home than to send abroad and had to meet that by extra bounties, and the bounties are to induce either the continuance of the same sales or of more sales to Great Britain at more cost to us.  The trial consignments mean the same sort of business about sending, or attempting to send, bad butter to Belgium, high geese to Berlin and cattle at a loss to Belgium.  How are we developing these trial consignments?  This is a big sum that is being asked.  It is <Col N="819" /> somewhere about £750,000.  Is there in mind any very big experiment through trial consignments, and what is it going to relate to?  Is it industrial goods?  I think the Minister for Industry and Commerce at one time thought that we were going to supply the whole of Europe with confectionery. That was in the very early days of the tariff régime.  Are we going to have trial consignments of sugared buns to some place on the Continent? Is there any industrial activity looked to in connection with these trial consignments, or is it all allocated to agriculture?  Where is the philosophy, where is the proper policy, the line of thought that enables the Minister for Agriculture to say that we must maintain our present number of live stock as it is at the moment, and that enables the Minister for Woods, or whatever he is, to say that we have got to break down the cattle industry, and that enables the President to say that the market in Britain for cattle is gone, and thank heaven for it.</P>
    <P>These things are not reconcilable in themselves.  Are any of them reconcilable with this taking of sums of money from the people of the country through taxation and spending them so as to enable people to sell in a market which, in the main, we regard as failing?  The Minister for Agriculture alone is sticking to the other policy.  We think it is degrading and that it is nationally weakening to have it there.  We look forward to the day, and we want it to be speeded up, when we will no longer either be able to, or need to, sell in that market.</P>
    <P>I may be told that this is, of course, a transition period.  We are building up a vast industrial structure here.  We are getting in, according to the newspapers, all sorts of capital goods which the Minister cannot segregate.  We are going to build up a huge industrial community here, and we will require probably some of this live stock now going abroad for the feeding of this new industrial population.  But while the transition is on we must keep in the British market.  Is that the situation <Col N="820" /> that we are at?  We were told by the Minister last night that we had an enormous increase in the acreage under wheat and under beet.  We were told that the farmer had gained enormously by that change.  From the Minister's statement it seems that even for wheat and beet we must maintain the amount of live stock that we have. But, supposing that is not an embarrassment and that we can leave live stock aside, the Minister says that there is a big improvement now in relation to beet and wheat, and a big improvement in the farmer's income.  If that is so, and if it is desirable to get speedily to the position in which we will not have a surplus of live stock to send to England, why not take the time to reach that when the farmers are well off and when they have gained enormously under these schemes as the Minister said when defending another proposal last night?  But has there been such an increase as that which the Minister talked of last night, and are the farmers so much better off?  Is there any sign of that?</P>
    <P>I have seen the latest statistics published with regard to the acreage under crops of different types.  From these you can certainly see an increase in wheat and some increase in beet, but if you look further down the list you can see that, in the main, it is only substituted tillage, and that only a very small percentage of it is new tillage.  So that what we have is this: we are substituting for a particular type of economy in which people produced what paid and sold under ordinary conditions a certain acreage with some increase in crops that do not pay unless the consumer or the taxpayer subsidises them.  While we are doing that, the taxpayer is still asked to put up certain extra moneys in order to assist in maintaining, I suppose it is, the numbers of live stock at their present figure.  We are assisting in doing that by selling in this market which we recognise as disappearing, and which we want to disappear even faster.  We are doing it in the teeth of the difficulties that Fianna Fáil Deputies will speak of from time to time&mdash;that the price in <Col N="821" /> the British market is no good, and that, in addition to that, whatever market there is even at that small price is being gobbled up by the British themselves, and the other Dominions.  Was there ever a more illogical programme than that, and was there ever greater folly than to ask people to pay for the carrying out of that programme?  If the prices were so bad, as Ministers tell us, for all those things in the British market, why are the Dominions so keen on getting their footing in that market? They are being cut out.  They are still anxious to get in.  They are further removed from it than we are.  We are told it is not worth our while sending beasts to that market.  The Minister tells us to-night that he does not think there is even sufficient inducement to make people smuggle across the border, and yet we are now being asked to pay in order to keep that bad and decaying market open.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture, when it comes to speaking of pigs, says it was people with the long view who decided to take less profit on the sale at home and to keep the quota open. There must be some line of thought; somebody must have a reason for all this; somebody must be able to tell us that the trial consignments on which we already spent money had sufficient results to make us want to go on again. As far as I remember, when this talk of alternative markets first came along, the President frankly said that there were no foreign markets available, and that he thought it was going to be a matter of extraordinary difficulty to get them.  The Minister for Finance said first of all that the British market was gone, joining, of course, in the thanksgiving in relation to that, and then said that he wanted to warn people of the difficulty of getting alternative markets.  Six months later he said that we were not without hopes of getting them.  We can always get markets in the way in which the Minister for Agriculture gets them&mdash;by simply exporting irrespective of whether there is a price paid equal to what we send out.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce in the old days had a completely different view <Col N="822" /> of this matter.  He never envisaged subsidies.  The Minister must remember the interview he gave to the <i>Daily Express</i>, in which he said that nobody could believe that the British would ever put on any tariffs against our goods, because everybody knew that we were in such an extremely advantageous position in relation to exports to Great Britain; we were the only people, in relation to trade with England, with whom there is a balance favourable to England, and the Minister said that we could go to Ottawa able to exact more than any other Dominion a good settlement and a good trade agreement.  In the <i>Daily Express</i> article he said that of course some people thought if the annuities were retained at home the British might retaliate by putting duties on exports from this country, but that everybody knew that was mere nonsense.</P>
    <P>In those days the Minister did not think that the British market was a disappearing one; the Minister did not think that the British market was not a desirable one, but the Minister did think that the British could not get their supplies from anywhere else. Now, if Deputy Corry were here he would tell us, of course, that the difficulty is that everybody wants to export to Britain, that apparently everybody is likely to be treated better than this country, and that we have no hopes of a market there.  Deputy Donnelly and others will join in saying that even if the market is open to us it is open to us on such disadvantageous terms in relation to actual price that it is not worth while sending our goods there.  However, apparently we have got to export.  We have got to have the long view.  We have got to have people praised in relation to their activities towards the British market, and we have got to have further, apparently, not merely praise but material consideration.  £2,250,000 is the first amount of money asked for in relation to those export bounties, and now we have a request for an additional £763,000, bringing the revised estimate up to this tot of £3,000,000.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="823" /> Can the Minister tell us, before he closes to-night, whether it is merely because there is a transition period that this money is required.  Is it a transition period between our present situation and the time when we will not want to export surplus cattle at all, or is it only a transition period between whatever we are at at the moment and the time when we will have another market than Britain to which to export our surplus?  Whichever of those situations we are moving towards, will the Minister tell us how fast we are going?  When will we have reached the stage when we will not want money like this voted for export bounties?  We may want it for trial consignments, but we will not want it for export bounties because we will have reached the stage of either having no cattle to export or of having another market.  If we are going to have another market for the cattle at present exported to Great Britain any further questions, as far as I am concerned, do not arise, but if the situation is that we are moving towards a time when we will not have an exportable surplus of cattle at all then what is to replace the cattle?  Is it subsidised crops, and if so, would the Minister tell us when this expenditure has disappeared what will be the expenditure proportionate to it in relation to subsidised crops?  If our aim is to get away from what the Minister said on the 30th June&mdash;that we must maintain the amount of live stock we have, and that we are not going to export at all as far as cattle are concerned&mdash;then what is going to be the agricultural economy here, and how will the Minister meet the situation that will then develop?  As far as that situation is concerned, he said on the 30th June that only a fool or a knave would think the live-stock industry is to be destroyed, because if we till we must have live stock; otherwise the farmers cannot use up their barley, straw or other products, or get manure.  Where is the live-stock industry going to end?  If it is going to be cut down below the present supplies how are we going to provide manure?  How otherwise are farmers <Col N="824" /> to use up their barley, straw and other products?  Instead of the moneys that will come in from the sale of cattle what moneys are the farmers of the country going to live upon?  Is it the moneys they will derive from wheat and beet?  If so, are those going to be subsidised for a long time, and what will the amount of the subsidy reach at the time when that change over in agricultural economy will have been made; when the cattle industry will have disappeared as far as exports is concerned, and we are self-sufficient as far as wheat and beet are concerned?</P>
    <P>If there is a plan with regard to agriculture, which does not include the perpetuation of these subsidies as long as the economic war lasts, there should be some detailed idea with regard to the time and with regard to the results of the things I spoke of.  Surely it is time in the third year of the attempt to change the economy of the country from what it was to something new that we should have a clear statement as to what is the aim, when we will arrive at the objective, and what it will cost us when we are in the new situation.  Nobody objects to the payment of this amount of money.  People who take a long view take a different attitude to that of the people who take the long view of the Minister.  I think it is wise to keep that market for whatever it is worth, even at a big cost.  I say that because I see that market there to be expanded and developed. We should pay something in this awkward situation that we have got into, in order to keep a position at any rate upon which someone else can build in future.  If the Minister has not that view will he tell us if that expression of his about the long view was limited to the situation at the moment, or brought about by other considerations or, will some attempt be made to clear up the mystery of an agricultural policy which makes us appear foolish in the eyes of people who consider the situation, because we appear to be paying money to send goods into a market which is valueless, and which is being destroyed in ordinary circumstances, and which we rejoice to see destroyed? That is a supremely foolish piece of <Col N="825" /> work, and there must be some other explanation of it than merely folly.</P>

      <P>In a rather long speech Deputy McGilligan asked for certain particulars to which I think he is entitled. I promised to get a list of industrial goods for which an increased vote is required, owing to the fact that the exports of these goods have been higher than was anticipated.  They include linen and cotton piece goods, woollen and worsted manufactures, feathers and curled hair, horticultural and nursery goods, biscuits, margarine and edible fats, smoking pipes, sausage casings.  Certain animal feeding stuffs and mine and quarry materials.  The Deputy also asked for particulars with regard to tripe.  That item is not very large.

As regards No. 2, eggs for Spain, a definite arrangement is being made under which we will sell a considerable quantity of eggs there during the year.  We sold <Col N="826" /> there during 1934, and will export during 1935, because, as Deputies are aware, a quota has been put on eggs going to Great Britain, and it is quite possible that we may have a surplus of eggs which we will have to get rid of.</P>

      <P>I do not know.  It would be got under many headings.  Deputy McGilligan asked a question which he was entitled to ask whether any big amount was contemplated in this Vote for further trade consignments.  There is not.  I do not think there is going to be any great loss on further trade consignments, certainly not more than £100 or £200.  There was no loss bigger than £200 to any country.  It should be remembered that sometimes ordinary traders will not take the risk of exporting to these markets, and the Government has got to do it, to see if there will be a loss or not.  When the Government proves that we can sell eggs in Spain or cattle in Belgium at a profit then the private trader comes along and takes over the trade. The Government does not get a chance of recouping its losses, because it hands over the business at the time it begins to pay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Not now.  They are buying cattle in competition in the Dublin market.  They are buying at the ordinary price and doing business on the ordinary basis. That is all that arises on this particular Vote, on Deputy McGilligan's speech.  I attempted last night to instruct Deputies on the opposite benches as to the policy of this Government with regard to cattle. Evidently Deputy McGilligan did not take in what I said.  I shall be speaking again when we resume on the other motion, and I do not mind reiterating what our policy is regarding live stock.  It is on that motion it should be done.  That, of course, will come on in about half an hour and I expect Deputies will have some patience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Anthony wants to know how long can this country continue paying out these subsidies.  I do not know, but at any rate it is able to pay them for the present.  We are asked further&mdash;two or three Deputies raised the question&mdash;whether this is <Col N="828" /> purely what might be termed an economic war measure&mdash;this payment of export bounties.  I do not think it is, exactly.  There is no doubt what Deputy Moore said is true.  Even if the economic war were over, and if there were a collapse in bacon, beef or some particular item, it is quite possible any Government might pay export subsidies in order to keep the level of prices in that particular commodity up for a temporary period, if there was any expectation that prices might improve.  We sometimes have a product which we may be consuming to the extent of 75 per cent. at home, exporting the remainder, and a small export bounty might keep up the export price and at the same time keep up the home price and in that way it would be of benefit to the producers.  Take potatoes, for example.  We produce a great deal of potatoes in this country, but we export very little, comparatively.  By paying an export bounty of a small amount, £12,000 or £15,000 a year, we keep the level of prices up.</P>

      <P>I was taking potatoes as an example and evidently Deputy McGilligan is now learning something. Where you have an export surplus, as in the case of potatoes, <Col N="829" /> the price of the exported article does rule the home price, at least to a great extent.  In the case of potatoes there may be some little difference as between Dundalk or Dublin, but the export price has a very big influence on the home price.  If there is an export at Dundalk the export price rules absolutely the price at Dublin. By paying an export subsidy, in that case, it may amount only to a small sum but it not only raises the price for the person exporting, it also raises the price for those selling in the home market.  If there was no economic war, and if we thought world prices were not sufficient for our home producers, there is no reason why we should not continue to pay export bounties.</P>

      <P>It must have been, because they know you would believe anything of that sort.  Even if the economic war were to stop, that does <Col N="831" /> not mean that export bounties would stop.  I believe, with Deputy Anthony, that they would probably be reduced to a great extent, but a number of export bounties would have to remain. I think practically every country has been driven to the policy of export bounties in order to maintain a level price in the case of some of their commodities. Deputy Coburn wants an expression from the President that he could not make a settlement with Great Britain unless he were to lower the dignity of the people of the Irish Free State.  As he said he wanted the President, there would be little use if I were to say anything about it.  I am quite sure though, that if the President were here, he could give the Deputy that assurance, but I do not think that that would make the Deputy withdraw his support from Deputy Dillon.  The Deputy says he believes that the whole trouble is that President de Valera will not give in on the question of the Irish Republic.  At the same time he says that Fianna Fáil Deputies are suffering from a sort of sham republicanism. If he is right about the President, then it is no sham.  If it is true, as Deputy Coburn says, that the President will not give in on the question of the Irish Republic, that is no sham.  It is very serious.</P>

We hear about nothing but the poverty of the people.  Deputy Bennett was indignant because I said that down at an auction of his own cattle in Limerick he said that he could pay but would not.  I had to look up the <i>Cork Examiner</i> to see what he really did say.  I may have wronged him somewhat but he started his speech by saying that the reason his cattle were sold was that he was in a political fight.  That was a good start for saying he would not pay his land annuities.  He would not pay his land annuities; he was standing behind Deputy Cosgrave and Deputy MacDermot in this political fight in not paying his land annuities.  That was the inference and the inference also was that anybody listening to him who wore a blue shirt or was a follower of the United Ireland Party was to resist, as Deputy Bennett did, because he was in a political fight.  &ldquo;His cattle were sold because he did not find it convenient to pay,&rdquo; according to the <i>Cork Examiner.</i></P>

He will not have them at any cost and he is going into the <Col N="834" /> division lobby against this Vote, whether Deputy Dillon leads him into it or not.  He will not have any continuation or extension of bounties. When he was asked by Deputy Davin what the farmers would get for their milk, if Deputy Bennett had his way, he said that the cure for all this was to have no economic war, no tariffs, no subsidies and no bounties.  That is what the Deputy wants and he represents Limerick constituency.  Deputy Davin asked him what would the farmer get for his milk in Limerick during the last year, if he got his way. The price of butter here was 67/- per cwt. and the average expense of working a creamery is 20/- a cwt., which leaves 47/-.  It takes two and a half gallons to make a pound of butter, which means that they would be getting 2d. per gallon for their milk.</P>

      <P>Deputy Bennett complains also that the ordinary consumers in this country are paying 5d. too much for their butter on account of all the levies and subsidies we have here, and he afterwards said that, to make the thing pay, the farmers in Limerick should be getting 150/- instead of the 102/- they are getting, so that he would not mind asking the consumer to pay 4d. more if he got his way.  I quite agree with Deputy Keating that it is very difficult for the farmer to carry on and it did happen, as he said, that the price quoted for bacon in the <Col N="835" /> papers one day was 40/- a cwt., and the day after, when the farmers brought out their pigs, they found it had dropped to 33/-, a fall of 7/-.  It is very difficult for a farmer to carry on under those circumstances, but, as Deputies are aware, we are preparing legislation on that matter in order to try to make the price more stable. That Bill was prepared as a result of the work of the tribunal set up to enquire into it.  The tribunal was set up as the result of a motion introduced in this House opposing which Deputy Dillon, during Spring Show week, to the delight of his friends in the gallery, made a very brilliant speech and led his Party into the Division Lobby against it.  That is another indication that the Party opposite are anxious to promote the interests of the live-stock industry. There is nothing ever done in this House for the benefit of live stock that Deputy Dillon and those with him does not oppose and bitterly oppose.  However, in spite of them, we have done these things and we need not thank them for them.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Higgins made his usual speech &mdash; common honesty, courage, open diplomacy.  The first thing we found after coming into office that was not done by open diplomacy was that Deputy Dr. O'Higgins was getting £600 a year for being nominally on some board in England which was never told to the Irish people.</P>

      <P>Deputy Davin wanted to know in regard to the Cattle Act, the number of those who signed the undertaking to pay the fixed price and the number who dishonoured that undertaking. The number who signed was practically 100 per cent. of the exporters <Col N="836" /> in this country&mdash;I think only about 7 per cent. refused and said that they could not export cattle at that price.  So far it has not been proved definitely that any of those exporters has disobeyed.  Some of the export licences have been held up, pending investigation of complaints made, but so far it has not been definitely established against any of them. If it is, of course, the licences will be withdrawn for all time from these exporters.  Deputy Davin thinks it would be better if there was a Government organisation set up to deal with the cattle export business.  That is a very big question and, I think, a step that no Government would take except as a last resort, and if we are able to compel or induce those cattle exporters to give as fair a price as they can, under ruling conditions, I think we would prefer to leave the matter in their hands, rather than to set up a Government organisation for exporting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Brennan asked a question which, I think, would also be better answered on the next debate, as to whether we have taken any steps to end this economic war or to get an increased quota.  In connection with the Cattle Act, some other Deputy mentioned that, before the minimum price was fixed, farmers were able to dispose of their cattle at 15/- and 16/- a cwt., but that since the minimum price was fixed, they cannot dispose of them at all.  That was said fairly generally both in newspapers and by many people throughout the country, but there is really some fallacy behind that argument, because our butchers are killing all the cattle they require. There is no doubt about that.  The export licences are being used to the full, so that we could not dispose of more cattle, either by killing at home or by exporting, if there was no minimum price fixed, than we are able to dispose of at present.  If we kill all we can and dispose of all we can under the quota, it is the most we can do, and we have the advantage that those who are selling are, at any rate, getting a minimum price, so far as we know. <Col N="837" /> There may be, as was alleged here, a great deal of evasion of the minimum price.  Possibly there is, but Deputies will realise that we, in the Department of Agriculture, are working under a very severe handicap, because we estimated in the beginning that it would take 120 inspectors to get this Act working properly, and these inspectors are not yet available.  They are being appointed and will probably be at work within a couple of weeks. They are not, however, yet at their jobs.  If they were there, it would make a big difference because they could attend fairs and markets and see the cattle weighed.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brennan advocated the dropping of all subsidies and bounties.  Of course, there is no subsidy in the ordinary sense on beet. Beet is regulated very much the same as a manufactured product, that is, by protection of the market.  By a certain protection duty on sugar coming in, it is possible to produce sugar at home and sell it against the imported article.  The price of sugar is regulated in that way and the price of beet is regulated in that way also. There is not a subsidy as understood in this connection, at any rate.  There is a bounty paid to the producer of wheat.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is all right if you hold that view, and I would not be surprised if you did hold that view. Deputy Brennan advocated that we should cut out all these subsidies and bounties and let the cattle and everything be exported at whatever price <Col N="838" /> they might get in the British market. He said we should be satisfied with the world price.  We would not get the world price in the British market for some of these things, because the British market is itself protected and quotaed and so on, so that in many cases the price there might be higher than the world price and in many cases&mdash;it is not lower, of course, but it certainly is as low in the case of butter and other things like that.  There was a good lot of talk that more tillage means more live stock, or that more tillage means the present live stock.  I thought I had made myself sufficiently clear on that matter last night without having it brought up again.  If I have not made myself sufficiently clear it can be dealt with on the next motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Belton said that the country voted twice for the economic war and that we should accept that vote and go on and fight it to the best of our ability.  He is evidently a man of sense and intelligence which explains why he has left the Party opposite, because he probably could not stand it.  At any rate, I want to refer to the figures he gave.  He says that we are withholding from Great Britain £5,000,000 and that according to some return which he saw they have collected £4,500,000.  I am not sure if these figures are correct, but I will assume they are.  He says that the producers should get the same amount in bounties, that is £4,500,000 instead of the £3,000,000 that we have voted or are voting.  He appears to be satisfied that the farmers would be getting what is due to them if £4,500,000 were paid in subsidies and bounties.  Of course, he does mention the fact that if the farmers lose the £1,500,000 difference between what they pay on tariffs on the other side and what we pay in bounties here that they are not only losing £1,500,000, but also losing by the reduction in prices here, and might be losing £3,000,000.  That is true, of course, if, as I say, his foundation figures are correct.  I am not sure if they are correct.  I want, however, to put this to Deputy Belton&mdash;that we are giving the farmers back more than the £4,500,000, because we are giving <Col N="839" /> £2,000,000 in the reduction of annuities and £3,000,000 in bounties, which amounts to £5,000,000 as against £4,500,000 which Deputy Belton claims they have lost; so that the farmers have gained really.  That is, of course, on Deputy Belton's argument.</P>

I said last night that Deputy O'Reilly had expressed my attitude exactly when he said that we should rear only the best cattle and rear as many as the market can absorb.  That is quite a good policy.  We should improve our cattle as far as possible&mdash;improve our agriculture and rear as many cattle as the market can absorb, that is as many as the home market and the foreign market can absorb, it being understood that we will get as far as possible foreign markets, including the British market, which will take our cattle.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that probably fault is being found with the Government for not making a sufficient attempt to increase our quota for the export of cattle to Great Britain. Deputy Brennan read a letter here to-day.  He wanted to prove that my Department made representations to the British Department of Agriculture on a certain matter and that we were successful.  He tried to prove that if <Col N="844" /> we made the same representations with regard to these quotas we would also have been successful.  That is not right.  We have never accepted a quota from the British Government without doing what we could to have that quota increased.  We have in many cases got an increased quota.  We have not, so far, succeeded in getting an increase in the fat cattle quota and I do not know that we are likely to succeed, because the British point out to us that there are terrible difficulties in this matter. They point to the glut of fat cattle in their own market.  They point to the prices for fat cattle which are lower than pre-war prices.  They say to us: &ldquo;How, in face of that glut, can we take any more?&rdquo; If we were in the same position here producing, say, sugar and if the price of our beet was ruled by the price of sugar which was coming in, we would say to the British: &ldquo;For goodness' sake, let us use up our own producers' beet before we increase your quota.&rdquo;  Anybody can see that the British Government has a perfect right to take up the attitude it has taken&mdash;to look after its own producers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there is a surplus of beef in the market there is no use in talking about frozen and chilled beef.  It is the fresh beef that matters.  We could put up the argument that if the chilled beef market were improved that would make the position easier on the fresh meat market.  It is very usual for Deputies opposite to get up and say that if we made the slightest attempt we could succeed in this matter of securing an increased quota.  But we have tried and we have not succeeded.  It was said here, when introducing the Estimate last night, that we had to give a special inducement to bacon curers to export their quota; even though they were getting more in the home market they took the long view.  We are as anxious, and more anxious, to hold our quota in the British market as we are in the Belgian or German markets.  If we get one penny more in the British market than in the Belgian market then we are going to go to the British market. Nobody need now get up and say that we have changed our attitude, because <Col N="845" /> we never had any other attitude. Deputy Dillon wanted to know what Deputy de Valera said&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, President de Valera. I want to make it clear so that there need be no debates here as to what the attitude of the Government is on this matter.  The attitude of the Government is plain.  We want to produce agricultural products to our full capacity and as far as the market can absorb those products.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are blamed for not making an attempt to carry it out.  We did our best to carry it out and if Deputies opposite can help us we will be delighted.  That is not so easy as Opposition Deputies have said.  They said before the last election that it could be done in three days.  They themselves knew that it could not be done and the country knew it too and showed that it knew it.  The people of the country showed that.  They know it is a difficult problem.  It is difficult to get an increase of these quotas.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce has quotas for certain manufactured articles.  He would be very loath to do anything against an Irish manufacturer no matter what appeal a foreign country might make to him to allow in more motor cars or tyres or anything else.  He would be very reluctant to do any injury to our own factories by allowing in a bigger quota of these articles.  We are in the same position in relation to Great Britain.  She is not going to allow us to increase our quotas if it injures her own producers.  We cannot blame her in any way for that part of her agricultural policy.  The Government is blamed because we did not get alternative markets, to any great extent, to the British and the home markets but we have increased enormously our consumption of beef here.  The figures of slaughterings in the Dublin abattoir show that for the last 12 months, ended 31st October, the number of cattle slaughtered for consumption in the City of Dublin <Col N="846" /> increased by 75 per cent.  That was before the free beef scheme started. If there is as much free beef given out as we expect, the increase will be 150 per cent.  That is to say, where there was 1 lb. of beef consumed in the City of Dublin in 1931-32, there will be 2½ lbs. consumed in 1934-35.  That is, of course, conditional on the free beef going out in the quantities that we anticipate. If the position is the same all over the country, it shows that there has been a big expansion in the home consumption of beef.  I think that the expansion in beef-consumption in the country would be greater than it has been in the City of Dublin but I have only these figures at the moment.  If we get that expansion all over the country, it will mean that we will be killing more cattle for consumption here than we have lost under the British quota restriction. If the figure were increased by 150 per cent., it would mean that almost 220,000 additional cattle would be slaughtered here, whereas we are losing under the British quota about 120,000 fat cattle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from that, we are, as I stated in reply to a question to-day, negotiating for the establishment of a meat meal factory in Roscrea. That factory will absorb about 50,000 old cows in the year and will relieve the market to a certain extent, at any rate, of cows that are at present going into human consumption.  These will be only few.  Most of the cows will be unfit for human consumption and suitable only for conversion into meat meal&mdash;what the factory is intended for.  One item of policy referred to with the greatest contempt by the Opposition is the slaughter of calves. We have too many cattle at the present time.  Whether the increased slaughtering of beef for our own consumption will make that right, I cannot say; it will, certainly, improve things.  If we have too many cattle and are going to continue to have too many cattle, it is a sensible thing to limit production to some extent.  If we can foresee that three head of cattle will be just as valuable as would be four head if allowed to <Col N="847" /> remain on for two years, is it not prudent for the farmer to slaughter one and keep three, if he is going to get as much out of the three as he would get out of the four?  We have succeeded in getting farmers to kill calves to the extent of about 130,000. Sixty thousand calves were always killed in this country.  Some may, perhaps, have died naturally; others were about to die naturally and others were killed for the veal trade.  We checked the number of calf-skins exported and we found that they amounted to 60,000 a year.  That showed that 60,000 calves lost their lives somehow or other.</P>

      <P>Dropped calves are included in my number because dead calves got the bounty whether killed or not.  In the 130,000 there is included the 60,000.  The only impression would be on the difference&mdash;70,000 a year.  That is probably not sufficient and it may have to be revised and encouragement given to a greater extent.  Is it not wise policy for a Government to feed its own people well, at any rate; to see that its own people get enough beef and mutton?  I should have mentioned, in speaking of the Dublin abattoir that, in addition to the 75 per cent. increase in the killings of cattle, there had been an increase of 100 per cent. in the killings of sheep.  That shows that the people are getting much more meat to eat in the city than they previously did.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should say a couple of thousand in the past year.  Our first duty should be to see that our own people get enough to eat.  Having satisfied the requirements of our own people to a reasonable extent, we should, naturally, try to get an export market for our surplus.  We have done that as far as we could.  We have tried to get that export market, and it is because conditions in Great Britain do not allow them to let more cattle in that they cannot give us an increased quota.  That is the position.  I want Deputies opposite to realise that.  They want to throw us out and come in in our place.  If they do that they will probably have the same difficulty that we have in getting an increased quota. I am asked why certain people said that the British market is gone.  I explained before what was meant by that.  You sometimes say that a thing is gone when it is not actually gone. The simile I used before here does not apply now.  I said then that we might say: &ldquo;Cumann na nGaedheal is gone, because it is going.&rdquo;  It has gone since.  I might say now that the United Ireland Party is gone, because it is going downhill rapidly and is likely to go.  If I said that the United Ireland Party is gone, it would not mean that it had actually gone, but rather that it was sure to go.  In the same way, one might say that the British market is gone.</P>

If Deputies opposite were as near the truth as we are in the use of that phrase, we could hardly find fault with them at all.  It is quite permissible to say that the British market is gone.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Lands was talking about the hundred years that it took to build up the cattle trade.  What the Minister was talking about, in that speech, was the cattle mentality of the people; he was alluding to the people who said there was no salvation for this country except through cattle. There you have the cattle mentality of those who tell us that the farmers cannot live except on cattle alone.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">

      <P>I did not say the Deputy said that, but there are certain people who say that the farmers must live on cattle alone, and that all other produce, pigs, poultry, butter, and so on, are all subsidiaries.  The Minister for Lands said that it took a hundred years to build up that cattle mentality but that it did not take a hundred days to destroy it.  He was quite right. Now I am asked to explain myself.  I am asked why I said that the Deputy who stated this Government is out to kill the live stock trade is either a knave or a fool.  Is it not quite obvious what I meant?  We are out for tillage and to get the largest possible market for all the live stock we can produce. No one will deny that.</P>

I said that we are out for increased tillage and for the biggest complement of live stock that this country can maintain.  I was laughed at because I sent cattle to Morocco.  Because I tried to sell cattle for the farmers they laughed at me.  That shows there are either knaves or fools on the other side; there are not many knaves on the other side. When I lost a bit of money&mdash;not my own because I have none to lose&mdash;but when I lost a little money sending cattle to Belgium they laughed at me. When I try to sell cattle for the Irish farmers they say I want to kill the live stock trade.  When I sent cattle to Morocco or Belgium, I was trying to find a market for that trade.</P>

When I want to do anything for the live stock trade Deputies opposite say níl.  Every measure I bring in in support of the live stock trade is voted against by the Party opposite.  When I brought in the Butter Stabilisation Bill the Opposition voted against it.  They did not want butter stabilisation.  That was before the economic war started.  They did their best to defeat that Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next thing was the resolution to set up a tribunal to encourage the pig industry.  On that occasion Deputy Dillon had a few friends from the Spring Show in the gallery and he made a speech for their benefit, and divided the House against the resolution. As a result of the findings of that tribunal a Bill is being prepared which I hope will stabilise the trade, and will obtain for the farmers better prices for their pigs.  Deputy McGovern would agree with that, I think.  Deputy Holohan said he would support me through and through on the Cattle Bill, yet, when it came to <Col N="851" /> the Second Reading, the Deputy voted against it.  They are all now in favour of the stabilisation of the pig trade. In fact, they are in favour of the whole Fianna Fáil policy only they think they could utilise it better than we could.</P>

Under that cattle Government the numbers went down and now, under what they call anti-cattle Government the number has increased.  I never heard such nonsense talked.  Deputy Bennett says that the quota for bacon is too high.  I am censured because the cattle quota is too low.  Is Deputy Bennett going to bring on a Censure Motion because the bacon quota is too high.  He says it is too high; then let him bring in a Censure Motion.  The Party opposite have one motion to the effect that the tariff is too high and another that it is too low.

Someone said I played cards.  I only played cards on one occasion when I was in Ottawa, and that was in a public place.

      <P>I am afraid that I am not prepared to give way to the Deputy again.  I propose, Sir, to make a brief speech and to restrict myself to the terms of the motion. The Minister for Agriculture asserts that this motion is inspired by Party spirit.  It appears to me that that reproach is entirely unjustified.  The terms of the motion are reasonable and moderate.  In fact, I think we could have gone so far as to censure the Government, not merely for having obtained an insufficient quota, but for ever having brought about a state of affairs in which the quota system was applied to Ireland at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are really two questions that are raised by this motion.  One question is whether the live stock trade, and the British market in connection with the live stock trade, are of value to us or not.  The second question is whether the restrictions which have been imposed&mdash;and I am referring now only to the quotas and not to the tariffs&mdash;were inevitable, or whether the <Col N="855" /> Government are to blame in connection with them.</P>
    <P>If I had only to deal with the Minister for Agriculture it would not be necessary for me to say anything as to the value and importance of the live stock trade and the value and importance of the British market, because he has fully admitted it.  He has gone the length of stating that he is in favour of keeping the cattle population as high as possible, keeping it at as high a point as a market can be found for, either at home or abroad.  Unfortunately, however, the line that the Minister for Agriculture takes here in the House is not the line that his Party in general takes through the country, or the line that his Party in general takes here in the House.  I have listened to several speeches on this motion and I have not heard one from those benches opposite that was in entire accord with the opinions expressed by the Minister for Agriculture.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Reilly and Deputy Keyes, for example, associated a high cattle population with a low human population. They maintained that the two were necessarily connected and that it was the prosperity of the Irish cattle trade which had brought about Irish depopulation.  Obviously, the Minister for Agriculture cannot accept that point of view, and I think he is perfectly right not to accept it.  There is no evidence that the prosperity of the cattle trade makes for a decrease in population&mdash;none whatever! The decrease in the Irish population may have been due, if you like, to failure on the part of the British Government to encourage other industries in this country.  That, however, is not the same thing as to say that it was due to the prosperity of the cattle trade.</P>
    <P>Similarly, Deputy O'Reilly went so far as to say that the cattle trade had created no wealth to this country; that it had left no tangible wealth available.  I wonder if he recollects the financial position of this country as described in the Budget speeches of the Minister for Finance.  I wonder if he recollects the facts with regard to the immense volume of Irish savings <Col N="856" /> that exists, of deposits in Irish banks, of investments overseas.  Where does he suppose all that wealth has come from?  Has it not come, in the main, from the Irish farmers and from the prosperity in past years of the Irish cattle trade?  The Irish live stock industry is not a modern, imperialist innovation.  When the Minister for Lands and Forestry talks about its having taken 100 years to build up, he is understating the case altogether. The cattle industry goes back for many centuries in this country.  If you read the history of Ireland in the reign of Charles II, for instance, you will find that a turmoil was created in this country by the fact that at that time restrictions, and eventually prohibition, were imposed by the British on the export of cattle from this country.  The Irish cattle trade was a big thing for this country at that time, just as big as it is now, and naturally so, because&mdash;why should we shrink from boasting about it?&mdash;this country is the finest cattle-breeding country in Europe, and instead of regarding that as something to be ashamed of, it is something to be proud of.</P>
    <P>I may add to that the fact of the geographical advantage that we have in being near to the densely populated island of England, the only large food-importing country of the world, and it is perfectly obvious that the thing that has developed here has been something natural, not something artificial, not something imperialist, not something to be ashamed of, but something, on the contrary, to rejoice in.</P>
    <P>I am sure those sentiments are shared by the Minister for Agriculture but they are entirely inconsistent with the type of argument that has been presented to the country.  We have heard a quotation from the Minister for Lands and Forestry with regard to its taking 100 years to build up this trade and that, fortunately, it would take nothing like that to pull it down.  Here is another quotation, in case that should be disputed, from a speech delivered by the same Minister at Strokestown in my own constituency, in which he said: &ldquo;It is a damn good job the English cattle market is gone.&rdquo;  In view of what <Col N="857" /> the Minister for Agriculture confesses here with regard to his own ideas and his own policy, in view of what he is actually doing in the way of giving bounties and so forth, it is absolutely unscrupulous for Ministers or Deputies on the other side to go through the country preaching doctrines by which they expect to excite prejudice, but which they must know do not correspond with the actual policy their Party is attempting to carry out.  I say that the cattle trade of this country has been a precious source of wealth to us in the past.  I deny that it has been connected with depopulation or that it has been the cause of depopulation. I agree with the Minister for Agriculture that in doing your best to maintain that trade at the present moment, you are not doing something that is wicked or that is against the interests of the human beings who inhabit this country.</P>
    <P>What about the present and the future?  Is it true that though the British market has been of great value to us in the past, those days are gone and that it is something we can no longer look to?  I deny that.  It has been pointed out that the imports into the British market from the Dominions have been increasing during the period that ours have been declining and, by a coincidence, have been increasing very much to the extent that ours have been declining.</P>
    <P>I have other figures here that are of some interest.  Taking the first nine months of the last three years&mdash;1932, 1933, 1934&mdash;the total beef imports into Great Britain have steadily increased &mdash;increased not very much, but yet increased.  So have the meat imports, taking meat of all descriptions.  Of course, I know that the live stock industry is in a bad way in most parts of the world, but will anyone tell me what branch of agricultural production is not?  What branch of agricultural production is to be relied upon as a money earning occupation, apart from Government assistance, in these times?  The depression that has prevailed in the live stock trade has prevailed in other <Col N="858" /> branches of agriculture too, and the big tillage farmers in America, those who relied most on tillage, have found themselves in a worse plight than our farmers here who relied mainly on live stock.</P>
    <P>There is a quotation from Mr. Bruce, the Australian High Commissioner in London, which I ventured to read once before in this House.  I venture to read it again because it appears to be so appropriate to our discussion. Speaking in Ottawa last May, he said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;that, although the economic nationalism with which the world was now obsessed would burn itself out in time, the British nations must take stock of their position and frame their policies for the interim period. It was obvious that the Dominions would find their most profitable economic association within the British Commonwealth group.  Agricultural countries, such as Canada and Australia still primarily were, must find their best economic alliance with an industrial country needing foodstuffs.  The United Kingdom offered by far the most receptive market for these... For Dominion exports of beef and mutton there was no other export market than Great Britain which was also the largest available market for wheat and wool... Mr. Bruce declared that he did not share the apprehensions felt in many quarters in the Dominions about the consequences of the new British policies for the revival of agriculture.  He was convinced that there were very definite limitations to such policies because, first, Great Britain was still dependent on her export trade for the sustenance of large masses of her population and could not afford to raise the cost of living and production beyond a certain height; second, because Great Britain could not afford to destroy the purchasing power of the agricultural communities oversea who were her good customers, and, third, because she could not expect these communities to pay their debts or absorb British immigrants if they could not sell their products profitably.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These remarks appear to me well <Col N="859" /> worthy of consideration.  Although it is argued that the public taste for meat, and especially for beef, is something that is declining in Great Britain, the figures I have already given to the House suggest that that decline has been considerably exaggerated and that it is balanced, to a large extent, by the growth of population which is still going on in Great Britain.  I think that, taking together what the Minister for Agriculture has said, and what I have ventured to say about the value of the live stock trade and the value of the British market, I can depart from the question as to whether a free entry into that market would be desirable and I can assume that it would be.</P>
    <P>The second question, then, that we have to consider is whether the Government are to blame because we have not got that free entry.  I am going to try to steer clear of the economic war and the question of tariffs and to confine myself to the matter of these quotas.  Of course, I realise that so far as the quotas reduce the number of cattle imported into Britain, they actually conflict with the British policy of obtaining moneys, which they claim are due to them, by imposing tariffs on our exports. Therefore, I propose to treat the quota as something apart from the actual economic war.  The question I want to consider is whether it is true that these restrictions were, in fact, inevitable, because that is what the Minister for Agriculture contends, that the Government could not avoid them, that they were coming to us.  I think it is fair to ask, when a statement of that sort is made, whether it is what Ministers always said.  It is obviously very much in the interest of Ministers to say so now, because, if it be true, it is a complete defence for them.  But in considering whether it be true, it is fair to ask whether it agrees with what they used to say, whether it agrees, for example, with what they used to say before they came into office.  I have heard a whole series of allusions from the opposite benches to the alleged lack of foresight <Col N="860" /> of the Cumann na nGaedheal Government and the Cumann na nGaedheal Party because they did not see all this coming.  Did the Party opposite see it coming?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>Did they?  I shall await with interest the production of a single quotation which shows that they saw it coming.  I spent an idle hour last week in looking over the files of newspapers of three years ago, examining the speeches that were being made by those who are now Ministers and I did not find that they were saying the sort of thing at all that, according to the Parliamentary Secretary, they should have been saying. They were saying this: that our custom for her goods was so important to Great Britain and also our supply of cattle in time of war would be so important to Great Britain, that it was inconceivable that even under the strong provocation which they were about to apply by withholding the land annuities, and by doing the other things that they knew the British would intensely resent&mdash;they held it was inconceivable that the British would take steps to apply any restrictions that might have the effect of destroying the Irish cattle trade. That is what they were saying.  So much for their foresight, and so much for their charges against the Cumann na nGaedheal Government of lack of foresight.  Now they were wrong because provocation of the sort which they offered to the British is bound to make any nation take angry action, even action perhaps against its own interests.  But, nevertheless, I agree with them in this: that there were tremendous arguments in existence why the British should not impose restrictions on our agricultural exports, tremendous arguments from the British point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us try to put ourselves in the frame of mind of a British statesman considering this question, a British statesman who had come to the conclusion that agricultural protection had to be introduced for the benefit of British farmers and that quotas must be applied to New Zealand, Australia and Canada, and who was trying to <Col N="861" /> decide the question of whether quotas should also be applied to Ireland.</P>
    <P>Now what would he have said to himself?  He would have said, in the first place: &ldquo;Let us consider the question of a possible war.  Owing to Ireland's geographical position, is it not extremely important for this country that her cattle trade should be kept alive and flourishing, so that we may have the benefit of her food supplies if there should be a war.&rdquo; I think he would say that.</P>
    <P>Secondly, I think he would say to himself: &ldquo;These people owe us a lot of money; these people are paying over £5,250,000 a year to meet interest on the land bonds and to provide for various other purposes; a country cannot pay its debts unless it is allowed to maintain an export trade.&rdquo;  He would say: &ldquo;We, ourselves, and all other European nations have failed to pay America her debts.  America has made it impossible for us to pay her debts, because she put up such tremendous tariffs that we could not export our goods to America.  Are we going to make that mistake in relation to Ireland?  If we impose quotas they may have the effect of shattering the financial position of the Irish farmer. Is he going to be able to pay his land annuities, and is the Irish Free State as a whole going to be able to pay over these sums of money year by year, to Great Britain?&rdquo; I think on that ground, also, he would have come to the conclusion that the application of quotas was an unwise thing.</P>
    <P>Take a third point of view&mdash;the balance of trade.  This supposed English statesman that we are talking about would have compared the state of Great Britain's trade relations with the various Dominions and the state of her trade relations with Ireland, and he would find that Ireland was the one part of the Commonwealth that was taking from Great Britain more than it was sending to Great Britain.  He would find that Ireland, in fact, had what we know as an adverse balance, and he would say: &ldquo;In these circumstances surely Ireland is a special case: Ireland is entitled to better treatment than any other part of the Commonwealth in this matter of <Col N="862" /> cattle quotas.  More than that, Ireland is not only so entitled but she is in a position to make herself extremely nasty if we do impose cattle quotas because she can take steps to abolish or cut down that adverse balance.&rdquo; That, again, would, I think, have been a very sensible point of view for a British statesman to take.</P>
    <P>Finally, there are political considerations. He would have said: &ldquo;Here is an alleged Republican Party just coming into office in Ireland, a Party whom it is obviously desirable to make friends with and to conciliate, so that kindly relations may exist between the two islands, and would it not be a political error of great magnitude to proceed to introduce a system of quotas that would have a bad effect on the mentality of the Irish people?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now I am perfectly satisfied, and I think any honest man who considers the question will be satisfied, that those arguments would have been sufficient to weigh with any supposed British Cabinet Minister considering this problem so long as we were on friendly terms with them.  Of course, the whole thing was altered when we ceased to be on friendly terms with them.  I do not think it was so much the withholding of the annuities as the general attitude of jingoism and hostility and the particular line that was taken up by the Government in relation to the Crown that did the damage. It was those things, I think, that made it inevitable that British statesmen should not make a differentiation in our favour as compared with the other parts of the Commonwealth which, under ordinary circumstances, I am satisfied, political wisdom would have compelled them to make.</P>
    <P>Now so much for the British point of view.  Let us think now of the point of view of an Irish statesman who a few years ago learned that there was a probability of the English introducing protection for their own agriculture. Again, when you talk about lack of foresight it has got to be remembered that protection for English agriculture was introduced suddenly and unexpectedly, that Mr. Baldwin had held a general election on that very <Col N="863" /> point, and had been defeated, and so it looked as if English agriculture was not going to get protection.  If it had not been for the crisis about the gold standard and the formation of a National Government it is more than doubtful whether British agriculture would have received any protection up to this moment so that I do not think, to tell the truth, that either side in this country was to blame for not foreseeing that British agriculture was going to be protected.  But, supposing, somebody had foreseen it, what view would he have taken?  Would he have been horrified, annoyed, disgusted and dismayed?  I do not think so.  I think under normal circumstances he would have been perfectly delighted.  He would have said &ldquo;Here is something for which Irish statesmen have been wishing for years back.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In the days when Joseph Chamberlain first started his protectionist campaign in Great Britain there was a large volume of opinion in this country which had a great deal of sympathy with it, so far as protection for agriculture was concerned, and the only reason that this country subsequently lost interest in it was because the agricultural side of the policy was dropped and it became a purely industrial policy.  Protection for home agriculture was something that would have delighted an Irish statesman who that period, and I think would have delighted any Irish statesman who thought about it three years ago, but who did not know we were going to plunge into an economic war, or into any sort of unfriendly relationship with Great Britain.  He would have said: &ldquo;Here is our chance.  We have these various grounds&rdquo; (which I mentioned a few minutes ago) &ldquo;for demanding that we get in the British market the same treatment which the British farmer gets.  We are, therefore, in a position to be more secure in that market than we ever were in the past. When the world depression, which admittedly exists at the present time&mdash; a world depression which prevents any market from being all it ought to be&mdash; is passed,&rdquo; he would say; &ldquo;this protected British market is going to be of <Col N="864" /> enormous value to use&mdash;of greater value even than the British market has been to our export cattle trade in the past.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not thing I am being unreasonable in the argument I am presenting to this House.  The Minister for Agriculture accuses us all of being infected with Party spirit.  I am trying to speak calmly and reasonably, and carry Deputies opposite with me.  If I am saying anything that seems unreasonable, or if I seem to be straining an argument, I shall be greatful to them for pointing it out to me.  I find that what I am saying is, at any rate convincing to myself; I hope it may be convincing to some others.</P>
    <P>What then is the real cause of those quota restrictions?  I maintain that they are not inevitable&mdash;that the considerations which I have just laid before the House show they are not inevitable.  They could have been avoided.  Why have they not been avoided?  They have not been avoided for a reason which was mentioned by Deputy Coburn a little earlier this evening in this House, and that is, that the Government insist upon keeping up the sham of republicanism.  It is that sham republicanism&mdash;which gets us nowhere, which cannot be realised so far as a 32-county Republic is concerned, and which will not be realised by the Government as far as a 26-county Republic is concerned&mdash;that has brought about the disasters and discouragements which are at present afflicting the Irish farmers.</P>
    <P>I confess that I see no cure for the present situation&mdash;for the quotas and many of the other ills from which we are suffering.  I see no cure for these things until that sham republicanism is once and for all abandoned. The Government spokesmen's reply to every argument is that they have the people behind them&mdash;that the elections show that the people are behind them. Well, a great deal might be said upon that subject, and upon the particular kind of argument by which they succeeded in winning elections, but I would remind Deputies opposite that parties can sometimes be so good at winning elections that they are no good at anything else.  After all, <Col N="865" /> statesmanship in a Government is a great deal more important to the people of a country than skill in winning elections.  The Government may win elections by their clap-trap, but they will not win renown by it, and I am satisfied that, unless they change their course, history will deal with them as men who have deserved badly of their country and who, instead of throwing bouquets at themselves, ought to be clad in sackcloth and ashes doing penance for the wounds they have inflicted upon the kindly mother that bore us and nurtured us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>A Leas Chinn Comhairle: Before this debate concludes I should like to say a few words. Last night Deputy O'Reilly said that the farmers should do something else instead of producing cattle.  He said the cattle trade was the trade of a few people.  Did anybody ever hear such nonsense as that coming from any responsible Deputy?  In the past, was it not a well-known fact that people who had not cattle on their land were described as broken farmers?  According to the policy of Deputy O'Reilly, the man who has cattle on his land to-day is a broken farmer.  The Minister talks about the people having a cattle mentality.  The people are the best judges, and neither the Minister nor any of those associated with him is in a position to teach the farmers of this country what would be the best policy for them to adopt, because the farmers have the experience of years. They know that if you have not cattle in this country, as the Minister himself said, you do not require tillage. He stated that anybody who said you should not have cattle was either a fool or a knave, because the farmers required the cattle to consume their surplus barley, oats, and so on.  There is no good in talking about any special kind of farming in this country.  The farmer must have a trial at every kind of farming.  I myself this year had 23 acres of oats.  I am talking now from practical experience.  In the harvest of 1933 I also had 23 acres of oats, and from that I got a return of 260 barrels.  This year from the same acreage, age, to the weather conditions, <Col N="866" /> I had a return of about 130 barrels, and if the Minister for Agriculture comes out I will show him some of that oats rotting in my fields.  I challenge him to say it is due to neglect on my part.  I wonder if I were depending on my income from that oats what would be the position of my employees to-day.  Could I pay them&mdash;as I am paying them&mdash;the highest rate of wages paid in the district?</P>
      <P>The late Minister for Agriculture said on many an occasion in this House that he was not an advocate of tillage as a cash crop; he was an advocate of tillage in order that the food produced should be fed to the cattle or pigs, walked off the land and sold in the best market.  We are told that there is a depression in live stock, but as I said a while ago, when I put a question to the Minister for Agriculture, if the people in Kerry and West Cork, who to-day are receiving from £1 to £2 10s. for two and a half and three year old cattle, were receiving the full export price of £6 apiece more for their cattle, would not they be happy? We do know that but for the policy of the Government with regard to the land annuities and the clash with Great Britain some of those farmers would have reared eight or ten cattle for each year, and, as a result, the man who reared eight cattle would receive, in addition to what he is receiving to-day, the sum of £6 apiece, or £48.  Is it not a well-known fact that the annuity on the bulk of those farmers would not be more than £10 a year?  I do not want to exaggerate, but I would say that generally speaking all over Kerry and West Cork it would be less than £10.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Reilly talked about the promises of the Government.  I do not want to go into that question now, as I do not want to bring the anger of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle on my head.  The Deputy referred to the fulfilment of their promises by the Government.  What about their promises to settle the economic war if they were returned to power?  Did they not realise that it was important to settle the economic war?  Was it fair to describe as Imperialists those who made that demand?  What is the position to-day?  Conditions were <Col N="867" /> never worse in the Dublin cattle market. I have it on the best authority that to-day's market was the worst ever seen there.  What about the promise to secure alternative markets for our agricultural produce?  What about the promises to solve the unemployment problem, and to reduce taxation? When we are accused of making political propaganda, I say that the majority of the Deputies on these benches are people who have to live irrespective of politics.  We are not in politics for what we are going to get out of them.</P>
    <P>Speaking for myself I should say that on my milk returns for the month of October last, as compared with same month in 1933, there was a difference to my loss of £30.  My question to Deputies on the Government Benches is: can farmers carry on under such conditions?  I cannot get an allowance in my rates unless I employ a staff.  Am I to be driven into the position when I will not be able to pay decent wages to my workmen? Will I have to try to get cheaper labour and to employ eight men instead of four in order to be able to secure a larger allowance for rates?  Does the Government think that that is going to better the condition of the working classes?  I say that it will not.  Those on the Government Benches know as well as I do that that policy is not in the best interests of the country.  A question arose last night as to what was to be done with the pulp.  The Minister's explanation was that we were going to feed it to our cattle.  I made an application for pulp some time ago and I was informed that none was available, but that if I applied again in February it was quite possible I might secure a small quantity.</P>

      <P>The question arose in the debate last night, and I thought I was entitled to refer to it.  We are asked to do everything except what we think is in our own best interests.  That is the policy of the Government.  As well as building factories and asking farmers to till more, farmers were told <Col N="868" /> that phosphates would be available at cheaper rates.  Does the Minister agree that that promise is being acted up to? When I made an application for pulp I was refused, while thousands of tons are being sent out of the country.  The Minister also stated last night that he had advised farmers to keep their fat cattle, and he said that those who took his advice had benefited.  I am sorry to say that I am one of the casualties, as a result of taking the Minister's advice.  I had six young cows for which I was offered £51.  I fattened them and then sold them for £50. That is what I achieved by taking the advice of the Minister for Agriculture. I appeal to the Government to turn around now and to accept this motion, and try to secure a trading agreement with the British Government, so that we may be able to carry on and make our business a success.  Although we may not be able to secure as high prices as we secured in the past, we can produce more cattle and have more production as a result of the increased tillage policy.  Unless the Government does that, this country is heading for destruction.  Even though we are called Imperialists, I say that until the Government secures the one and only market available to us, there is no hope for and there will be no prosperity for this country.</P>

      <P>If the Minister will allow me to interrupt him, my recollection is that British Ministers merely pointed out that the quota was something separate from the economic war and was not imposed as a retaliation for non-payment of the annuities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>That is exactly my point, and I hope the Deputy will keep to that, that the quota and the present British restrictions on Irish cattle, which form the subject of the Deputy's motion, arose primarily out of British statesmen's desire to look after their own agricultural industry.</P>

      <P>Deputy MacDermot has admitted that that is what British statesmen said.  If the Deputy can go and convince British statesmen of something else, well and good.  That is what they said.

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>If I may interrupt the Minister again, I might point out that he is overlooking the fact that I contend that the present Government have destroyed all the arguments which would protect this country from such quotas.  In other words, the various considerations I described as coming to the mind of our supposed British statesman, if what has occurred had not occurred, could not come into his mind in the present circumstances.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Is now, and definitely now, and I go further and say that even if they have not said it in public, and openly, the circumstances of the times we live in would compel them to adopt their present policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>Not towards us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Not towards us?  The British people for generations have lived by exporting their manufactured articles, and taking in return agricultural produce from the ends of the <Col N="870" /> earth.  The Deputy must be perfectly well aware that their exports during the last four or five years have dropped by practically one-third. Seeing that their exports had dropped, they had to turn to some other way of paying for their agricultural produce, and naturally enough they decided to pay their own agricultural community to produce it.  As to the plea that the British put on quotas on our agricultural produce because of republicanism, that does not hold water because, first of all, the British declared that their quota restrictions are for the benefit of their own people.  The British never act on sentimental reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a bigger campaign in England against the anti-God policy of the Russian Government than ever there was against Irish republicanism, and yet the British are making a reciprocal treaty with the Russians. Why?  Simply because it suits them. Notwithstanding all the propaganda against the Russians, they made a trade treaty when they thought it suited British economic policy.  They are exchanging their manufactured goods for agricultural and other products from Russia which they cannot produce themselves.  If the British home territory was covered with forests they would not have made the same agreement with the Russians as they have made, allowing them to send wood into England in exchange for manufactured goods.  The reason they have imposed quota restrictions on our cattle is because they can produce cattle themselves; seeing that they cannot export manufactured goods to pay for cattle products, they have determined that they are going to set their own land to producing cattle.  Anybody going through England and seeing the derelict state of their farms can quite easily realise that the Sinn Féin policy of the British Minister of Agriculture is the proper one for England.  Nothing that we can do will divert them from that policy because it is, from the British point of view, the real policy for England; that is, to protect their own agriculture and produce the food for themselves off their own land that they <Col N="871" /> cannot pay for by exporting manufactured goods.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacDermot talked about the increased agricultural imports into England for the last few years, but he did not advert to the fact that the British are, at the present time, in process of putting on tariff duties and import restrictions against the agricultural produce of New Zealand, Australia and other countries.  They are doing that to protect the British farmer.  The fact that the price of beef on the British market fell below the cost of production compelled them to do something if their farmers were not to be completely put out of production and they adopted the quota restrictions against us and other countries.  Seeing that even the quota restrictions were not sufficient, they went so far as to give a bounty on the production of fat cattle in England. Deputy MacDermot is very easy to convince if he thinks that if we accepted his whole-hog Empire policy in the morning, the British would throw their arms round our necks and take our cattle.  The British do not look upon their economic trade with us, or their trade with any other country, in a sentimental way at all. They are quite hard-headed about it and all Deputy MacDermot's senti-mentalising about it will not get them to be as sentimental as he is.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave very solid reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>They trade with Russia because it suits them to do so and they will only trade with us now or in the future because it will suit them to do so and not because of any love for us.  The only reason why we are concerned about foreign trade is that we want to get something in exchange for our goods.  When we came into office we were importing agricultural produce from the ends of the earth, produce that we could quite well be producing for ourselves.  At the moment, we are holding a large portion of our agricultural produce at prices that are even greater than world prices.  Our farmers are getting more for their butter than the British farmers or any other farmers are getting; they are <Col N="872" /> getting more for their pigs and for their eggs than the world price and they are also getting here a market that foreign farmers used to hold. They are getting into their pockets the £1,500,000 that used to go out for foreign butter.  They are getting well over a £1,000,000 that used to go to foreign farmers for bacon.  Similarly, the market that used to be filled here with foreign eggs and other agricultural produce has been given either wholly to or is available for the Irish farmers as soon as they put themselves in the way of taking it.  It would suit this country a lot better if the Opposition Party looked facts in the face.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be much better if they told the country without equivocation that the economic war that exists between ourselves and England is only part of the world economic war that is going on, and the only way to end it is for our farmers to cease sighing after the cattle trade that they had ten or 12 years ago, and to realise that cattle are not saleable on the world market or in England to the extent that they were ten or 12 years ago.  It would be wiser for them to sell the things which they can sell at a profit and that can be protected.  We cannot get, and Deputy MacDermot cannot get, the quota from the British that the Irish farmers would like to see. That is not a matter of opinion; it is a matter of fact.  If Deputy MacDermot cannot convince himself that that is so, he had better read up the British Ministers' statements about it, and open his eyes to the general world situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>We have set ourselves to ease the burden on our farmers as far as it is possible to do so under the circumstances. We are keeping the price of their butter above world prices by <Col N="873" /> subsidies; we are keeping the price of eggs above world prices by subsidies; we are keeping the price of bacon above world prices by subsidies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>What about cattle?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>We are keeping the price of cattle as high as this country can afford by subsidies.  The reason we have to continue to export cattle and other things in spite of the difficulties is that we are importing so much and if our farmers would only grow the wheat we require we could afford to do without exporting at least £3,000,000 worth of cattle at a loss.  We are looking at the cattle trade, as we look upon every other trade in the country, with a calm appreciation of what is required in the present circumstances.  We cannot stop the economic world war that is going on.  There is not alone an economic war going on between ourselves and England, but between England and Germany, Germany and France, France and England and, indeed, between every country in the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position is that every country is trying to cut down its imports in view of the practical difficulties of selling in a foreign market and to substitute by native products the goods which they formerly imported and paid for by exports.  That is a sound policy for us here&mdash;to continue to sell what we can while it is necessary to sell anything in order to import.  The sound policy is for our farmers to concentrate as quickly as they can on producing what is required by the Irish people.  God did not give us our land here and tell us to concentrate upon producing things to sell abroad.  He gave us the land for the sustenance of the Irish people, and, notwithstanding the fact that we have the finest land in the world for producing everything, including cattle, we are in the horrible position that if, to-morrow, there was a blockade of our ports, we have not sufficient food in the country&mdash;flour and other things like that&mdash;to support our people for more than a couple of months and that, notwithstanding the fact that the Fianna Fáil Party has over a number of years urged the people as strongly as they could to produce the wheat and other products <Col N="874" /> which our people require for a good and healthy life.</P>
    <P>Instead of all this crying out against the facts; misrepresenting the situation, either deliberately or stupidly; and telling the people that we can sell in the future cattle to the extent we used to sell in the past to England or to any other place, the Opposition Party would be doing the national thing and the patriotic thing if they helped us to encourage the farmers to produce what the country requires&mdash; to produce the wheat, vegetables, fruit and every other agricultural produce we import at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>

Deputy MacDermot can, of course, say &ldquo;Those are not my brothers,&rdquo; but the fact of the matter is, and everybody in the country realises, that all the brains and energy of Cumann na nGeadheal or the United Ireland Party for the past six or seven years was put to the work of stopping the national production of wheat.  Every footy argument that could be used against it was brought forth.  Deputy Hogan, who was to have moved this motion to-night, and who is not here&mdash;I wonder where he is? &mdash;used to sneer at the growing of wheat and say &ldquo;We can grow wheat and we could grow tea, too.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Deputy McGilligan can make a speech afterwards and point out the fallacies in mine, if there are any.  I have been dealing with what Deputy MacDermot said.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have been told that there is a British policy announced by the British Minister of Agriculture in relation to quotas.  It is not momentary.  Then there is a policy with regard to the Irish Free State specially directed against us because of the nonsense carried on on the Benches opposite.  Will the Minister take this as a guiding line? There were £330,000,000 worth of goods brought into England about 6 years ago to be consumed&mdash;meat, butter, and eggs.  We put into England £30,000,000 worth of these.  Are they at the point that we cannot get that £30,000,000 worth in even with the restrictions and the protection of British agriculture? Until you have got to that point I cannot see that we are ruled out by their general policy.  When you have not got to that point, you cannot say that we are specially ruled out by a particular policy applicable to us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Deputy will keep quiet.  The British Government have quotas in regard to every country in the world, and in regard to this country.  The Minister for Agriculture has gone into the figures and the quota restrictions against the Free State&mdash;the quota restrictions, not the extra tariff.  The quota restrictions are fair, judged by the former imports of countries into England.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy says that <Col N="879" /> he must also remember that Great Britain, as well as being concerned with the development of her industries, has also a very big investment of capital abroad.  In order to get back the interest on that capital, it is necessary for her to allow in produce from countries which owe her money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is any investment equal to the trade investment here?</P>

      <P>The Minister certainly invited questions, but he should be allowed to answer them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should know that one country can only pay another by goods or gold.  If Australia, New Zealand, and the Argentine have sent all their gold to England in order to pay the interest on the debts they owe to England, they have to pay for the future in goods.  The people in power in England, the people who always control the British Government, are more concerned with the receipt of the interest on the capital they invested abroad even than with the general good of the British community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Or even with trade?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>Or their own export trade?  The Minister is overlooking the fact that there is a tremendous volume of British exports to Ireland that they would naturally wish to continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy MacDermot can live on the interest of his investments and get a beter living out of that than out of production, would he produce?  If the British can get a better living from their investments abroad than by producing from export, they would be damn fools if they did not live on their investments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>A lot of them think they can do much better that way.  One of the main differences between the people who are in control in England has been between the interests of the manufacturers who want to export all they can in order to make profits and the financial people who want to get the interests on their investments.  One of the reasons that the British are <Col N="880" /> taking goods from the Argentine as against taking them from the Dominions, such as Australia, New Zealand and Canada, is that the British have very big investments in the Argentine.  If there is a big argument in favour of their taking them from the Free State from the military point of view as against Canada or Australia, there is a very big argument from the point of view of their world protection, their world military policy, to take them from Australia, Canada and New Zealand rather than from the Argentine.  Notwithstanding that, they are taking more meat from the Argentine than from Australia, New Zealand and South Africa.  If Deputy MacDermot is easy to convince, I want to emphasise that he should make up his mind that he is not going to talk himself into coming to a foolish conclusion as easily as he did this evening, because the people of this country, if Deputy MacDermot is convinced by a foolish policy, are not going to be convinced by it.  They have seen the world situation; they have seen foreign trade decrease during the last five years down to 30 per cent. of what it was previously.  They know that there is no smoke without fire, that there must be some cause for that.  They see every country in the world, as well as ourselves, adopting a Sinn Féin policy; that is, utilising its own resources for the benefit of its own people.</P>
