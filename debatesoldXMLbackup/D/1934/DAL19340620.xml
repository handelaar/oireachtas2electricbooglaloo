      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether he is prepared to issue instructions to returning officers throughout the Saorstát that, in the appointment of presiding officers and polling clerks for the purpose of the local elections now pending, preference should be given to unemployed persons capable of performing the duties attached to these positions.</P>

      <P>The appointment of presiding officers and polling clerks is a function of the returning officers.  I have, however, in a circular letter of the 18th April, directed returning officers to pay particular attention to applications for these posts received from unemployed persons.  My letter pointed out that the duties of a polling clerk can be discharged by any person of average intelligence and that&mdash;while competence must be the first consideration with regard to presiding officers&mdash;as between competent persons, applicants without employment should be given preference.</P>

      <P>Legislation dealing with fisheries and fishing rights in the Shannon, which have been affected by the operation of the hydro-electric scheme, will be introduced in the present session.  I am fully aware of the facts concerning the Abbey fishermen. An arbitrator has, I understand, been appointed to enquire into certain specific claims for compensation for interference with fisheries, due to the construction of the works.  These claims have been heard and determined. Any claimant who desires to appeal to the arbitrator in advance of the contemplated legislation may do so in accordance with the provisions of the Shannon Electricity Act, 1925.</P>

      <P>The question really that the House is asked to decide is whether we shall allow in shoddy.  I do not know whether the Minister intended that or not.  There are very good manufactures and great furniture artists in this country.  This may hamper and restrict their work.  The various tariffs imposed have not materially assisted such persons, but this section may possibly injure their business. <Col N="699" /> There is no indication as to what is meant by the section except the one example given of a violin.  Surely it was not necessary to draft such a wide section as this to allow in a single violin?  Even a violin is not an antique, I would say, if it were only 100 years old.  If you were not likely to injure some furniture makers here, I would have no objection.  If people are foolish enough to pay for Victorian furniture and import it here, that is their own affair.  But that it should be allowed in to compete with furniture makers here when efforts are being made to stimulate production all around to meet our requirements is another matter altogether.  In this case, as I said, there are persons engaged in this business who are real artists.  Is there to be further competition allowed in respect of their work and all for the sake of having a particular violin imported?  For whom is it?  Have we to legislate now so that a single article can be brought into the country?</P>

      <P>Yesterday the Deputy complained that most of the speeches of the Minister for Finance were after-dinner speeches.  I think we have just listened to a &ldquo;morning-after&rdquo; speech because, except on a morning after, I never heard so much confusion of thought expressed in a few sentences as we have listened to from the Deputy. There was a period when the Deputy had very little regard for antique furniture. I think there is on the records of this House pronouncements to that effect.</P>

      <P>At any rate, I think he regarded a certain assembly then as an early Victorian collection. We are told that there are great artists in this country who are going to be injured because we are allowing in shoddy early Victorian furniture.  There are great artists in this country, and I am perfectly certain that every one of them will resent the imputation conveyed in Deputy Cosgrave's speech that, if people had their choice between purchasing their handiwork <Col N="700" /> and what is regarded as early Victorian rubbish, according to the Deputy, they would, even to the extent of the duty, prefer furniture of the early Victorian period to the fine specimens of the cabinet-makers' art which they turn out.  If I wished to be uncomplimentary to the cabinet-makers I would put them on the plane Deputy Cosgrave has put them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose we are now a lot wiser than we were before.  I am, fortunately or unfortunately, in the position that I put money into that particular form of manufacture in this country.  If the Minister had done the same thing he would probably concern himself more with what is here before us.  But, unlike him, I act as well as talk.  There was evidence in this Chamber of one particular artist's work long before the Minister ever gave up his nonsense and came in here to admire that work.  The purpose of this section, as far as the House is concerned, is to allow a single violin to be imported here. That is all we are told about it. As it is drawn, it will allow in furniture which is 100 years and a day old.  As I said, there were four and, perhaps, five notable manufacturers of furniture in Great Britain&mdash;Adam, Chippendale, Sheraton, Hepplewhite and possibly Shearer.  The last of these died in 1820 and probably the work was done previous to 1800.  There was a gap filled up by what is called the Nelson period, during which a ropework design was used.</P>
      <P>We are now invited to allow in furniture manufactured from 1800 to 1834 free of duty.  That is not antique furniture. I suppose the silver work during the time of the Regency would be very artistic work, but that would last only until about 1812.  In this section we are going 32 years beyond that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this section has no other purpose than to allow of the importation of a violin, then a very poor case has been made for it.  No matter what the Minister said in criticism or otherwise of the furniture manufacturers in this country to whom I have referred, no damage can be done to their work. The people who patronise them and purchase their work know the value of it, and no empty criticism of any kind <Col N="701" /> will affect it, even if it were to come from a much more authoritative source than the Minister.</P>

He told me that there was absolute rubbish manufactured from the end of the 18th century up to the Victorian period.  If we want that to come in, very good, this is the way to get it.  If the excuse for this section is the letting in of a single violin, it is a very poor excuse.</P>

      <P>Once more we are faced with the misrepresentation which Deputy Cosgrave makes his stock-in-trade. I made it quite clear in introducing the precedent resolution on this matter that it was intended to allow the importation into this country of antiques of all kinds.  I did not specifically mention a violin, nor did I specifically mention furniture.  Deputy Cosgrave, however, for some reason or other, assumed that the only article of virtu we had in mind was a piece of furniture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I told Deputy Cosgrave that the matter was originally brought to my attention in connection, not with a piece of furniture, but in connection with a violin.  I certainly did not say that the sole purpose of this was to secure importation free of duty of a violin.  If I were to come to the Dáil and put down a proposal of that sort to cover one specific article I would be lacking in my duty.  That is not why the legislation is brought in&mdash;to cover one specific case.  It is because one specific instance brought to our attention a condition of affairs that had existed here for a long time under the administration of the Deputy, who is so concerned about furniture of this kind. He never gets up to make a speech but he reminds me of Poo-Bah clinking <Col N="702" /> his money bags or making a parade of the little knowledge he has.  I merely repeat that I would not put on the same level as Deputy Cosgrave has put them the artistic cabinet-makers of Dublin. Deputy Cosgrave put them on a level with the manufacturers of early Victorian furniture.  There may be quite good specimens of that furniture.  The Deputy has referred to the Nelson period.  It is not to be despised.  It was carried on until 1834.  The point is that, if an article is 100 years old, it is a fair presumption that it has an artistic value.  If it has survived the vicissitudes of time for that period it must be because it was highly valued by somebody, and I am perfectly certain if it has not artistic merit no person is going to spend his money bringing it into this country.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Minister will tell us if the period of 100 years is based on the violin or on any general principle.  The Minister has put us into a difficulty in that no reasonable amendment can be moved, because it may be ruled out of order on the ground that it imposes additional taxation on the people, as it were.  I think some explanation of the 100 years is desirable, and the question arises as to whether there ought to be this kind of sliding period at all. Again, I will ask the Minister whether, in fixing the period of 100 years, he was influenced by the fact that he had made any reciprocal agreements with other countries.  Yesterday the Minister told us that two Tan-Sad chairs had been imported for use in the Galway Telephone Exchange.</P>

      <P>With regard to Section 17, the Minister, when dealing with the Financial Resolution on which this section is based, had something, but very little, to say with regard to the tobacco industry.  In view of all the circumstances, I think it would be most desirable that the Minister should tell us something of the position of the tobacco industry and give us some idea as to why the continuance of a rebate of this kind is necessary.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce was unable to tell us to-day the number of people who were employed in the tobacco industry on the 1st March of this year. It was possible from 1925 to tell the country every half year the number of persons employed in the tobacco industry until the Fianna Fáil Party came into power.  Then the figures were smothered.  We got them, with a certain amount of difficulty, in March, 1933, but they are again smothered to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Free State came into being, employment in the tobacco industry, in terms of full time employment, was given to 500 people.  By November, 1925, the industry gave employment to 1,600 people, showing an increase in full time employment of 1,100 persons.  There was an increase in 1926 and also in 1927, in which year employment stood at the figure of 1,868. That meant 50 persons had been added during 1926 and 218 during 1927.  Then there was a kind of flat period.  There were 12 less employed in September, 1928, and 15 less in September, 1929. In September, 1930, the total employment was 2,081.  There had been an increase in the preceding 12 months of 240 persons.  In September, 1931, the total number of persons employed in the tobacco industry was 2,317, an increase during that year of 236 persons.  Then we come to blind spots and the last figures given us by the present Ministry show that the total number employed was 2,245, or 72 <Col N="704" /> persons less than were employed in the last period of the administration before Fianna Fáil came into power.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us, when he was dealing with the Financial Resolutions, that a considerable increase in employment had taken place since he introduced his Finance Bill in 1932.  There is no evidence good, bad or indifferent in regard to that.  The Minister indicated that he has safeguarded, to a very large extent, Irish capital that was invested in industry here, but he has given us no information as to how much Irish capital is invested in the tobacco industry.  He has given us no information as to what are the circumstances which make it possible for him to reduce the rebate from 7d. to 3½d., and no information as to why it is necessary to give a rebate of 3½d. now. The only information we have is that in that industry the total value of the production, according to the census of 1926, was £5,033,000.  According to the 1929 census the figure was £5,215,000.  According to the census of 1931 the amount was £5,746,000, out of a total value of industrial production amounting to about £60,000,000.  Since Fianna Fáil came into power employment in connection with that industry has been reduced.  The Minister should have something to tell the House about this industry.  He had a lot of talk as regards what he is doing.  The only evidence the House has had is that in this very important industry there is a falling off of employment.</P>

      <P>The Deputy may have got one, but if so, it is a deep secret in his own heart and that of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, because this House has not been able to find out whether he has or not. Speaking on the 23rd May, 1934, the Minister for Finance, as reported in Column 1607, Volume 52, No. 4, said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;There have been one or two concerns that lay on their oars, and refused to do anything.  I do not know what their fate is to be in the future.  There is only one thing I have to say and it is this: That this Government and people have no use for any manufacturer in receipt of special facilities and privileges from the people of the country who fails <Col N="706" /> to take advantage of them.  We do not care whether such a manufacturer closes his doors and folds his tent and departs like Gallahers.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In the face of the reduction in employment in the tobacco industry, and in face of the attitude the Minister takes up with regard to the leaving of this country by Gallahers' factory, I should like to ask him is this a gentle hint to people that they can expect to see a further reduction in the amount of employment in that industry, and that there are a couple of other firms that are going to close their doors and fold their tents?  I think that, if the Minister has any difficulties in the matter, he ought to take the House into his confidence and say in the first place, why employment has so fallen off in the industry and, in the second place, what it is that he fears in the future that may bring about further unemployment in that industry?</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 14, standing in my name and that of Deputy Dr. Davitt:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete sub-sections (1) and (2) and substitute the following sub-sections:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Sub-section (2) of Section 20 of the Finance Act, 1932 (No. 20 of 1932), shall apply only to tobacco which is shown to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners to have been grown before the first day of January, 1935.</P>
      <P>The excise duties on tobacco imposed by sub-sections (2) and (3) of Section 17 of the Finance Act, 1933 (No. 15 of 1933), and the duties mentioned in sub-section (4) of the said Section 17 shall be charged, levied and paid on all tobacco which is grown in Saorstát Eireann and is not shown to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners to have been grown before the 1st day of January, 1935.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 15 is connected with this amendment, and amendment No. 21 is consequential.  I hope that the Minister is in a more congenial and peaceful frame of mind than he was in a few minutes ago, because I hope that he will see his way to accept these amendments.  The purpose of these amendments is, roughly speaking, to preserve for the coming financial year the privileges, such as they were, which had been gained by the Irish Tobacco Growers for the last financial year. The wording of the amendments may be rather obscure to some Deputies, but, in fact, they amount to putting us back to the position in which we were this time last year when the Minister made certain statements in this House which gave hope to the growers of Irish tobacco that their case would be favourably considered by the Government in the course of the last financial year.  Unfortunately, statements which have been made since, and the rumours which have been met with, have rather discouraged those who expected to receive favourable consideration from the Minister as a result of his statement last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A year ago, when speaking on the 10th May, 1933, in this House, the <Col N="710" /> Minister, in referring to the scale of charges which were to be imposed on tobacco in this country, said&mdash;I am quoting from volume 47, column 737, of the Official Debates:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I should like to emphasise that it is the desire of the Government to establish this industry on a firm basis.  With that end in view an experimental period has been allowed during which any person who thought he could make a success of the crop might try his hand at it with the assurance that his venture would be a financial success.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Later on he said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It has been decided to impose an excise duty on all Irish tobacco grown after the 1st of January, 1934. This duty, however, is fixed at such rates that a very high measure of protection indeed will be given to the native product.  The standard rate of the duty will be 6/8 per lb. as compared with 9/4½ per lb. on foreign grown tobacco.  It will be charged on all Irish tobacco sold to manufacturers who use both the native and the foreign grown article.  As an additional concession a preferential rate of 5/6 per lb. will be charged in the case of tobacco sold to manufacturers who use only Irish tobacco for their products.  It is hoped that this special reduction will encourage some people to specialise entirely in the manufacture of home grown tobacco.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister said that last year; and then there were rumours that legislation was to be introduced to control that and to regulate the growing of Irish tobacco.  It was announced that a Bill would be introduced last January, but that announcement was not carried out.  On the 6th of February last there was an announcement that a new restrictive policy was to be introduced by the Government to prohibit to a certain extent the growing of tobacco except by certain privileged persons.  Since then we have had these further announcements by the Government that they would introduce a Bill, but so far no Bill has appeared.</P>
    <P>The purpose of these amendments is to continue the present state of affairs until such time as the Government announce their policy.  By embarrassing <Col N="711" /> the growers of tobacco, they are putting them in a false position, and they are, in fact, breaking faith with them in view of the fact that they are not carrying out the undertaking to produce a permanent Government policy with regard to encouraging the growth of tobacco.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested by supporters of the Government throughout the country that the failure of the Government to carry out its promises has been due not to the Ministers themselves but to permanent civil servants.  The statement has been made throughout the country that the Ministers are innocent of any hostility to the tobacco growers, and that it is the permanent civil servants&mdash;the Revenue Commissioners and others&mdash;who have usurped the powers of the Minister and have imposed their will against the better judgment of the Ministers themselves.  These statements have been made publicly in various parts of the country, and they have not been contradicted by any Minister.  That naturally raises the question as to whether the Minister agrees with his supporters in the country that it is the permanent civil servants who have interfered in Government policy and have prevented a generous and adequate consideration of the claims of tobacco growers, or whether the Ministers themselves are prepared to stand over their own actions.  It is not fair to them to hide behind the permanent civil servants and to suggest or to allow their supporters to suggest, that it is these civil servants who are preventing proper Government assistance being given.  I wonder if the Minister would be willing on this occasion to state whether there is any ground whatever for the statements that have been made throughout the country by their supporters that he, in this case, has been overruled and impeded by permanent civil servants in respect of intentions which were publicly announced by various members of the Government to encourage the home-grown tobacco industry.</P>
    <P>The three amendments roughly can be taken together.  It has been pointed out by those interested in the tobacco growing industry that the price offered <Col N="712" /> under the present Government régime is inadequate and certainly is not likely to encourage those who have been interested in the matter to continue their efforts to grow tobacco.  The price offered is a price which would be remunerative only in a very few cases, with exceptional land, exceptional circumstances and exceptional technical skill on the part of the grower.  For the average grower, the price available under the present arrangement is not a paying price.  I see no reason why the Government should not continue the <i>status quo</i> until such time as they are prepared to bring before the House and before the country a reasoned and thought out policy for the encouragement of tobacco.  They started off first with a gesture in remitting all duty. They then found that that was rather an unscientific way of approaching the situation and they put on certain duties.  They are now increasing those duties.  First, the tobacco growers were treated generously, or over-generously; then they were treated perhaps fairly reasonably; and now they are being treated definitely unreasonably and in the Fourth Finance Bill by this Government next year, we may look for regulation and taxation which will practically amount to prohibition and the closing down of these experiments in Irish tobacco growing.  Every year has been worse than the year before.  That has been the experience we have had during the three financial years of the present Government.  The suggestion in these amendments is that they should at least maintain the situation as it was a year ago until such time as they come forward with their permanent proposals for the regulation of this industry.</P>

      <P>Just before last Christmas, at the invitation of the Meath Tobacco Growers' Association, I went down to a place called Randalstown, near Navan, to attend the formal reopening of the tobacco rehandling station.  This reopening was carried out by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  There was the usual ceremony, followed by a social function and it was all very pleasant and I left with the impression that a new era was in <Col N="713" /> store for the Meath tobacco growers and that so far as the rehandling station at Randalstown was concerned, under the guidance and benevolence of the Minister for Finance, it need have nothing to fear for the future. All the speeches that day, including the speech of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, tended to give the tobacco growers of Meath that impression. Since then the actions of the Government have been such as to destroy any hopes that might have existed at that time amongst those who, at the instigation, one might say, of the present Government, had gone into the cultivation of tobacco on a large or small scale, as the case might be.  So great was the indignation that resulted from the change in Government policy that one of my colleagues in County Meath, Deputy O'Reilly, who was here a few moments ago, but who has left, was driven&mdash;and, naturally enough, because he is a man who has always been intensely interested in the cultivation of tobacco in County Meath&mdash;to comment unfavourably on the changed policy of the Minister for Finance.  I think, however, that if he was correctly reported, it was unfortunate that he attempted to save the Minister for Finance by putting the blame for that changed policy, as Deputy Esmonde said, upon the civil servants.  I think the Minister for Finance made a slight effort to correct that impression, in reply to a question by Deputy McGilligan here, but I do think it should be made quite clear to the tobacco growers in Ireland that if the Government changes its policy with regard to tobacco, it is because the Minister for Finance directs that policy and not because he is ordered to do so by civil servants under his control. The fact, however, remains that the tobacco growing industry is in a very precarious position at the present moment.  If we just look over the history of tobacco growing during the last few years we will see that, whereas when Fianna Fáil were in opposition, people like the present Minister for Finance were enthusiastic in their condemnation of the treatment by the last <Col N="714" /> Administration of the tobacco growing industry, but notwithstanding their vehemence in opposition, they have, since they came into power, done more by their chopping and changing to destroy permanently the future of the tobacco growing industry in this country than one would have thought possible.</P>
      <P>Under the British régime there were various subsidies given to tobacco growers.  I think no name is better known in connection with the efforts to establish tobacco growing in this country than is the name of Sir Nugent Everard.  He was a pioneer in that line.  His old rehandling station at Randalstown was formally reopened last Christmas, and there is there a modern readaptation of the old rehandling station which he started himself. Subsidies were given by the British under the old régime of about 1/- per lb. or a limit of £50 per acre, and later of £25 per acre.  In those days there was no settled policy with regard to tobacco growing, and the tobacco industry suffered accordingly. Now we have changed again.  First of all, we took off the excise duty altogether in 1932.  The Finance Bill of 1933 put on a duty of 6/8 per lb. on the manufacture of foreign tobacco or 5/6 per lb. duty on Irish tobacco to be used by manufacturers.  That is a duty of 5/6 on firms manufacturing Irish tobacco and 6/8 per lb. on firms using both foreign and the native leaf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This time last year I moved some amendments in order to see if we could persuade the Minister for Finance to reduce those impositions from 6/8 and 5/6 to 3/4 and 2/8 respectively.  He refused to accept those amendments, saying that it would cost the Exchequer a sum of about £500,000.  It is a peculiar thing that when the question of tobacco comes up the Minister for Finance falls back upon that argument which he regards as a final declaration. But if such an argument is used against any imposition of taxes on any other industry, the people using it would be called traitors to the country, and people opposed to the development of industry.  That kind of remark comes very often from the mouths of the leaders of the Front Bench opposite. <Col N="715" /> We should, consequently, be entitled to regard the Minister for Finance as an enemy of the country because he says he will not give more protection to the tobacco industry because it would be a loss to the Exchequer.  It is strange that that kind of argument should be brought in by a Fianna Fáil Minister. This year we have taxed the Irish grown tobacco to practically the same extent as the imported leaf.</P>
    <P>The position, therefore, is that in the space of three years there has been a change from the time when there was no tax at all on Irish grown tobacco to a tax of 8/6.  Whatever may be the position as regards the economics of providing the whole Irish market with Irish grown tobacco&mdash;and I believe that matter has not been fully inquired into &mdash;the fact remains that this change from year to year is bound to have a very detrimental influence upon the tobacco industry in Ireland.  According to the Fianna Fáil spokesmen during the 1932 election, previous legislation allowed Irish tobacco growing to drift into utter neglect.  If that is so their present attitude is going to kill it. Taking off the tax was a great stimulus to the farmers to enter into tobacco growing, thereby making up for the losses they had incurred in their main industry.  The present change of attitude is a more severe blow to the farmers when they had been promised such an era of prosperity, but that cup of prosperity is now to be dashed from their lips.  Such action is bound to do more harm than if no steps at all had been taken in 1932.  Even the most enthusiastic supporters of the Government who have gone into tobacco growing will be disgusted with the whole thing.  Before the experiment has been properly tried out those who were persuaded to go into tobacco growing will probably be fed up with the whole procedure.  We had a statement by the Minister for Agriculture some months ago about tobacco growing.  That statement was to the effect that the Government aimed at the production of 10,000 acres of tobacco in the Free State.  Whether he stated that that would be an advantage this year or not, the fact remains that <Col N="716" /> the impression given to the people in the country was that the Government wished to attain to that stage as soon as possible In other words, 10,000 acres of Irish grown tobacco would supply all the tobacco consumers in the Free State. The people in the country naturally believed that it was the policy of the Government to reach to this stage of production as soon as possible, and that that policy would not be interfered with by any such trifling thing as the loss of money to the Exchequer.  Undoubtedly that provided an outlook for those farmers who have been so badly hit by the economic policy of the Government.  At any rate we thought that was one single gesture towards the farmers, one rift in the cloud, the only one thing that the Government were doing for the farmers.  We got the impression that they were going to develop the production of tobacco in the country.</P>
    <P>Then their next announcement is that there is going to be a limitation of the growers of tobacco to a figure of 750 or 1,000, and a limitation from 10,000 acres to 1,500 acres.  I presume that is roughly correct.  I wonder what the exact number of farmers in the Free State is, and what proportion would 750 or 1,000 bear to the total number engaged in farming?  If the policy of the Government, as regards tobacco, is only going to benefit that many farmers, I should like to know how the Government can expect such a policy to be of any real benefit to the country as a whole?  I do not wish to say that those farmers who are getting the privilege of growing these 1,500 acres would disapprove of it.  They have taken their chance of growing it and I am glad for their sake.  But we must remember that the policy is only benefiting the few and that it is not much good for the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>That announcement of the limitation of the acreage under tobacco was considered by the people of the country as a deliberate betrayal of the promise given to the farmers in 1932 and 1933 as to tobacco growing in this country. I leave the matter to the intelligence of the Deputies here to say whether it is or not.  I do not think that anybody can deny the fact that the Minister for <Col N="717" /> Finance has changed his policy with regard to tobacco growing in this country.  It is a great pity, however, that this change of mind should be accompanied by such distress to the tobacco growers, and that it should result, as it will undoubtedly result, unless he changes it back again, in killing the enthusiasm which existed up to last year, and to a certain extent exists up to the present time, for the revival of the tobacco industry in this country.  What happened really, of course, is that, in their anxiety to achieve power in 1932, the Fianna Fáil Party flung out promises wholesale, amongst which was this promise about tobacco.  They fulfilled their promise for one year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Davitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course. these statements were made.  The fact that I cannot quote a speech made by a Fianna Fáil Deputy in 1932 does not prove that they were not made.  In any case, I was going to congratulate the Minister on carrying out the promise during the first year.  He remitted the tax for one year.  Then, when he had more experience, he found that he had to save the revenue to a certain extent, and he is now again bringing it back to the position where there is practically no protection given to tobacco growing.  That hurried legislation is typical of a lot of the policy of Fianna Fáil in other respects. <Col N="718" /> It would be a pity, however, if hurried legislation of that kind resulted in breeding a feeling of disgust amongst those who, no matter what Party may be in power, are genuinely interested in the promotion of such an industry as tobacco growing.</P>
      <P>It is on that account, therefore, that I wish to support Deputy Esmonde in these amendments.  If it was right to give that protection of the difference between 5/6 or 6/8 and the 9/4½, which was on the imported leaf last year, surely it should be the proper thing to keep it at that rate for this year, especially until we have a pronouncement made by the Minister for Agriculture, after due consultation with the Minister for Finance, as to the considered opinion of the Government with regard to tobacco growing here. A commission was set up before, over which the last speaker, I think, presided. That commission was limited to a certain extent.  I think it had no power to consider the marketing of tobacco.  Would it be unwise to suggest that, before changing the duty on tobacco back to 8/6, the Government should institute another commission of that kind to inquire into the whole system of growing tobacco, the selection of proper seeds, the cultivation of types of leaf which would succeed in attracting smokers in this country, and the marketing possibility of native-grown tobacco?  If an effort of that kind were made, it would have the effect of giving a fillip to the growing of tobacco here and of persuading growers already in the industry that the Government mean to benefit the industry and not merely to get out of a promise made some years ago for the purpose of catching votes.</P>

      <P>If Deputy Mulcahy had been interested in tobacco growing in the ten years prior to 1932 he might have grown tobacco to satisfy himself that the President of his Party at that time was wrong when he said that if any man told him tobacco could be grown in this country it was time to call a cab and take him to a lunatic asylum.  That statement is on the records of this House.  To that statement every member of that Party subscribed. For the ten years they were in office, their cry was: &ldquo;It is nonsense to talk about growing tobacco; it could not possibly be grown here.&rdquo; They saw to it that no tobacco was grown.  Now we have the academic tobacco growers attacking the Minister on his tobacco policy.  They know nothing about the history of it at all. Deputy Esmonde, of course, had some academic experience of tobacco growing when he presided over that commission. He also represents an area in which a great deal of tobacco continued to be grown when it was discontinued elsewhere, and in his constituency at present, and for a number of years past, a great deal of employment has been given, not only in tobacco growing, but in the manufacture of cheroots and tobacco from pure Irish-grown leaf.</P>

      <P>The Deputy cannot make any definite statement.  He read out from his notes suggestions from A to Z that he was going to make. What is the position?  When the Government came in they decided that they would try one year of tobacco growing.  They had to face the opposition of the Party opposite, who advised <Col N="720" /> the people not to grow tobacco and told them it could not be grown.  The Government allowed the people to grow tobacco without any restriction, and in that year a certain acreage was grown. Every person who grew tobacco during that year made a great deal more money than he ever expected to make out of the growing of any crop.  That cannot be denied.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Every person who grew tobacco which was marketable or useable. I make this statement, which cannot be contradicted, that anybody who, in the first year of the Fianna Fáil Administration, grew tobacco which was useable for the purpose of making something to smoke, made a very great profit on what he grew.  In some cases, as much as £200 an acre was made.  What happened?  The first year's experiment proved to the country that tobacco could be grown as a useable commodity, a marketable commodity, a profitable commodity, and the danger was that the Cumann na nGaedheal farmers who listened to the gentlemen opposite might in the following year go into the growing of tobacco as they had gone into the raising of cattle&mdash;they might have ranches of tobacco&mdash;and then we would have a country of tobacco and nothing else.  The Government wisely said that they would have to restrict the growing of tobacco, not for the purpose of the revenue as the Deputy suggests but for the purpose of getting tobacco grown here on a firm basis; first of all, to decide on what classes of tobacco were to be grown; secondly, to make sure that the farmer will get a price that will pay him; and, thirdly, to see that the tobacco grown would be used in this country and thus lead on towards the aim and object of this Party, namely, that eventually a certain acreage of tobacco would be grown here and that we would go as far as possible in supplying our home requirements of tobacco.  The Government then said this year, the year that is causing so much comment, that they would allow only those people who had grown tobacco in the free year to grow tobacco in the succeeding years. They limited them not only to acreage <Col N="721" /> but to those who had taken a licence out in the previous year and had grown tobacco.  Anybody who cannot get a licence now to grow tobacco has no grievance, because he never grew tobacco.  The point is that the man in former years who thought the people who were growing tobacco were only lunatics now discovers that he was really the lunatic for not growing it.  He now has a grievance.  The other fellow took the risk, and the claim is now made by Deputies opposite that he should be shoved out in order to be replaced by the fellow who never grew tobacco before and who is now endeavouring to take advantage of the fine opportunity that is being offered by the Government.</P>

We must get the people's tastes accustomed to the home-grown tobacco and, by a gradual process, we will reach the position where our tobacco will be grown to the full limit and used here <Col N="722" /> to the full limit.

      <P>I do not know who is your Front Bench agriculturist at the moment, whether it is Deputy Hogan of Galway, Deputy Belton or Deputy Curran.

      <P>Deputy Mulcahy will himself be surprised.  I hope he will not be putting forward the excuse submitted by Deputy O'Higgins, that all their voters had died and that was why they did not win.  I have great sympathy with Deputy Esmonde in putting down this amendment.  The reason I sympathise with him is because the leader of his Party at one time described any person who suggested the advisability of growing tobacco as a lunatic, a dangerous lunatic, and he would almost go to the extent of calling a cab immediately to have that person brought to Grangegorman.  That is why I am sympathetic with the Deputy.  So far as Deputy Davitt is concerned, he does not know the first thing about tobacco growing in a practical way.  On the subject of tobacco, I think, if possible, greater profits should be given to the growers in Ireland, but it should be all done with a certain amount of care.  Care is advisable in order that you will not have the whole country growing tobacco.  We have heard Deputy Mulcahy's suggestion about the people of Dublin growing it in window boxes.  Tobacco can be grown anywhere in this country, in front or back windows or in gardens.</P>

What class of weed is going to give the best results to the growers, manufacturers and users?  Until we get to the most satisfactory quality of weed I think the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Agriculture are quite wise in moving slowly.  Nobody is losing anything. This year I was precluded from getting a licence because I did not grow tobacco last year.  I wish I could get a licence to grow an acre of tobacco.</P>

      <P>I agree entirely with all that is being done by the Minister for Finance in connection with tobacco growing.  Regulations will have to be made.  Deputies opposite must not forget that they built up a system whereby the country receives some £1,750,000 to £2,000,000 per year by way of duties on tobacco.  We are not anxious to destroy that means of indirect taxation.  We are gradually building up the collection of that taxation without any disturbance of home-grown tobacco.  The Deputy said that people will not grow tobacco.  I throw out this challenge.  If the Minister for Finance were to increase the acreage, with the present restrictions, to the extent of another 1,000 acres I will guarantee that that extra 1,000 acres would be planted immediately.</P>

      <P>Deputy Davitt can be satisfied, first of all, that the policy of the Government, in spite of these repeated changes, will not send the tobacco growing industry back again to nothing.  Tobacco growing will continue.  The Deputy's colleague over <Col N="728" /> here cannot grow enough.  He is growing it this year, and he will make a profit this year.  As I said, if the Minister would increase the acreage you would have double the amount grown under the present circumstances, which is sufficient proof that there is nothing wrong with regard to the future of Irish tobacco.  Some people, of course, will want to get the same profit as they got in the first year, when the tobacco was free of tax.  That could not be allowed.  What happened was that they were prepared to sell it for 3/- a lb. the first year, but when the tax was put on, the gentlemen who had held on want to get the 5/8, which would have been 8/8.  I am not doubting Deputy Davitt's seriousness in putting his point, but I believe that he has been misinformed and does not understand tobacco growing from the practical side of it.  When he said that the Minister for Agriculture had stated that 10,000 acres would be grown he is right, but only in so far as the Minister used the word &ldquo;ultimately.&rdquo;  The Deputy took good care to leave that word out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertEDavitt" hpid="Dr. Davitt Dr. Davitt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Davitt</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, then, there is no dispute between us.  The Government is going to carry out that promise and to increase the acreage every year until we get the 10,000 acres which it is assumed will cover our total requirements without interfering in any way with the efficiency of the present tobacco manufacturers or discommoding or inconveniencing tobacco smokers.  As far as I can see, neither Deputy Esmonde nor Deputy Davitt need worry at all.  The Minister is not doing anything at all that is going to kill tobacco growing in this country. In fact, he is doing the one right thing, and that is to see that tobacco growing in this country is going to be on a <Col N="729" /> fundamentally sound basis, and that from that fundamentally sound basis they are going to see that it is put on the basis of a permanent crop and not merely something that is going to come this year and go away next year. Eventually I hope to see the Minister definitely fixing the price and the quality of the tobacco that is to be grown, and to see that each year a proportion of Irish tobacco will be mixed with non-native tobacco until eventually we get a tobacco that will satisfy the needs and the requirements of the industry and the taste of the consumer, and that will cover our requirements from every point of view. If the Deputy would take my advice he would withdraw his amendment.</P>

      <P>I am very glad to have had the opportunity of getting a lecture on this question of tobacco from such an authority as Deputy Briscoe. I do not know how many acres in Dublin City he has under tobacco.  I know he is a man who has a lot of interests.  He started his speech by telling me that I knew nothing whatever of what I was talking about, so I think I am entitled to get a little of my own back.  Deputy Briscoe, of course, is an expert on gold-mining in Wicklow and motor car racing in Bray, but I did not know that he was such an expert on the growing of tobacco in the City of Dublin.</P>

He offered to have a side bet with Deputy Curran that he would go out with Deputy Curran outside the House and give him the figures&mdash;under the portico, I suppose&mdash;and that Deputy Curran could come back here and tell us the figures if Deputy Briscoe was wrong.

I am as much entitled to do so as Deputy Briscoe is.  I learned nothing from his kindly criticism except where he said that if they did not limit the number of growers in Saorstát Eireann some Fine Gael supporters might grow tobacco in such a way as to become graziers of tobacco.  I think that is the word he used.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say a brief word or two as to Government policy with regard to tobacco, since it has been raised on this amendment. It will be remembered that, in 1932, following a decade during which the cultivation of tobacco had been continuously and strongly discouraged in this country, we came into power, and in our first Budget we granted complete relief of duty in respect to Irish-grown tobacco.  That was continued in last year's Budget.  We felt that it was necessary to take some exceptional step&mdash;such an exceptional step as this was&mdash;in order to overcome the effect of the preceding ten years and to arouse interest once again in the cultivation of Irish tobacco.  The results far surpassed our expectations, so much so that the area which was going to be brought under tobacco this year would have been so large that there would have been a great deal of difficulty in disposing of the crop, in the first instance; and secondly, the effects upon the revenue <Col N="731" /> would have been serious, but more serious still, the effect of putting on the market and compelling the Irish consumer to smoke what would have been, in the circumstances in which it was produced, a very inferior product, for it might have aroused among the consumers of tobacco a complete antagonism to and distaste for the Irish article.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, looking at all the facts as we saw them, we felt it was necessary to recast our policy, or, rather, not so much to recast our policy but to adopt a new means of attaining the end which had been enunciated for us by the Minister for Agriculture of ultimately putting about 10,000 acres under Irish tobacco.  The new method by which we proposed to attain that end consists, firstly, of taking control of the growing, curing, importation and manufacture of tobacco and, should such eventuality arise, its exportation also; secondly, of making it compulsory&mdash;and this is an important element in the scheme, and it is a novel element, an element never introduced into the tobacco-growing policy in this country before&mdash;on manufacturers to purchase all marketable tobacco.  It is quite true that quite a large amount of tobacco was grown last year and the year before, but one of the difficulties which we were faced with was the disposal of the crop in some instances.  An important element in the new scheme is that all the crop which is marketable will be purchased by tobacco manufacturers. No man who grows a consumable article will be left with that article on his hands.  Thirdly, the average price at which tobacco must be taken by the manufacturers will be fixed; and fourthly, the imported and the homegrown leaf will be put on the same footing with regard to duty, due regard being had to the costs of production. That, in short, is the scheme and a Bill is at present being drafted and will, I hope, be introduced soon, to give effect to all its provisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no doubt whatever that the scheme is acceptable to the great majority of tobacco growers&mdash;all the skilled tobacco growers at any rate, and all those who are concerned to go in for the crop on a permanent <Col N="732" /> basis and not those who merely want to go into tobacco growing as a catchpenny venture to get what quick profits they can and then to get out, leaving the industry to fend for itself after they have taken their pound of flesh out of it.  I say that I have every reason to believe that the new policy is going to be acceptable to the tobacco growing industry as a whole for the following reasons.  It was first announced in February of this year before the seed-beds had gone in and before the plants were ready.  Deputy Esmonde, I think, said that because of the change of policy on the part of the Government, communications had been received by him pointing out that the price offered was inadequate and not likely to encourage the cultivation of tobacco.  The price for Irish-grown tobacco was originally fixed in February at ? per lb.&mdash;this Bill will enable the average price to be raised to ? per lb. but the original announcement was that the average price would be ?.  Did the people who had been growing tobacco in the preceding years think that was an inadequate price and was the effect of the announcement to discourage the cultivation of tobacco?  On the contrary, between that announcement and the end of March applications were received from over 7,000 prospective growers for licences to grow tobacco. They would have wanted to grow the 10,000 acres but, as I said, one of our problems is to secure the production of a consumable crop and accordingly, when we came to the allocation of the licences, the licences were only allocated to people who had grown tobacco in the years 1932 and 1933 as it is quite reasonable that they should.</P>
    <P>One of the facts to which the Government, as I said, had to give consideration was the undesirability of allowing an unsuitable crop to be grown and, accordingly, we very wisely decided that only people who had previous experience would be allowed to grow it this year.  We did not know what the political affiliations of those people were.  We never asked what they were, and Deputy Finlay has already testified here that he is one of the people who is growing tobacco.  He received a <Col N="733" /> licence along with a considerable number of others, including, in County Cork, at any rate, a certain number of prominent members of the Blueshirt organisation, some of whom made as much as £200 out of tobacco last year. I merely rose to put before the House the scheme which the Government had in mind and to indicate that, before the end of the present year, a Bill which will give effect to our comprehensive proposals will be brought before the Dáil.</P>

      <P>We were promised this Bill in January, in February and in March.  The Minister has announced that before the Budget was introduced he received thousands of applications for licences, but I do not think he has received many since the Budget was introduced.  In any case, the object of these amendments is that the <i>status quo</i> should be preserved until such time as the Minister produces his Bill. This is his third financial year and one might have thought that he and the Minister for Agriculture could have made up their minds as to the relative claims of the revenue and of the tobacco growing industry and could have struck a medium.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has not in his remarks contradicted the statement made by his associates throughout the country with reference to the improper control of Government policy by civil servants.  It is a matter which he should approach. I am not only referring to what has been said in Meath, but to public statements made in the County Wexford and to which there has been given wide publicity&mdash;that the Minister and his colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, however willing they might be, are overridden by the action of the permanent civil servants.  This is a matter which really deserves an answer from the Minister.  He is responsible for Government policy.  According to <Col N="734" /> his supporters in the country his policy is decided by permanent officials.  That is a matter that should be cleared up, because it is not right.</P>

      <P>Whether it was untrue or not, the Minister has not assumed the responsibility and he does not disclaim the statements of his <Col N="735" /> associates and supporters.  I will just leave it at that because I do not think that one could do much in the way of comment on such a situation which is quite unsatisfactory from the point of view of the responsibilities of the Minister.  The Minister has announced to-day the provisions of the Bill which is to come in some time before the end of 1934.  Probably it will be postponed to 1935 or 1936.  The provisions of this Bill include the fixing of prices and the compulsory purchase of the crop by the manufacturers in this country. It is not right for us at this stage to discuss its proposals.  We can only wait for the Bill when, if ever, it arrives.  The whole object of those amendments is to preserve the <i>status quo</i> until such time as that Bill is introduced. If we do preserve the <i>status quo</i> we should certainly manage to give certain concessions to tobacco growers at some slight expense to the revenue; that might hasten up the process of persuading the Executive Council to put forward their permanent proposals.</P>
      <P>The statement made by Deputy Briscoe here would lead one to believe that the restrictions on tobacco growers were brought about because of political reasons and that there was to be a Fianna Fáil political monopoly in tobacco growing.  The Minister has disclaimed that.  I do not think that was the ultimate intention of the Government, but certain statements made by Deputy Briscoe were to the effect that the prohibition against extending the number of tobacco growers was in order to prevent supporters of the Opposition from becoming tobacco growers and restricting the monopoly to members of the Government Party.</P>

I would not like it to go out that that is the real Government policy and that the reason why the restrictions had been brought in was in order to close the doors and to preserve the monopoly for supporters of the Government policy.  During the last ten years I have on many occasions brought forward motions in this House in favour of tobacco growing. I have insisted on divisions against my own Government and I will certainly insist on a division against the present Government.  I upheld the claims of the tobacco growers when the Government Party were sulking outside and not attending to the duties they undertook on behalf of their constituents.  I certainly think that the Government should preserve the <i>status quo</i> until such time as they release their permanent scheme for the cultivation of tobacco.</P>

      <P>I am not going to permit Deputies Esmonde or Davitt to misconstrue any statement of mine. What I said was that the Party opposite advised their followers not to follow our policy and not to grow tobacco.  They did not, consequently, avail of the offer of the Government in the matter of tobacco growing and they got no licences in previous years. If licences are now to be given to those who grew tobacco, the majority of them will be given to Fianna Fáil supporters because they availed of our policy last year and the year before and grew tobacco.  I say good luck to them.  I am glad and happy about it that our supporters have got something for once.</P>

    <P Just="Center">SECTION 19.</P>
    <P>As on and from the 10th day of May, 1934, entertainments duty within the meaning of Section 1 of the Finance (New Duties) Act, 1916, as amended by subsequent enactments, shall not be charged or levied on payments for admission to any entertainment as respects which it is proved to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners that the entertainment consists solely of an exhibition of any game or sport which is played or contested out of doors by two or more persons or by two or more groups of persons and does not involve the use or participation of horses, dogs, or other animals or the use of mechanically propelled vehicles.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 16, in the name of Deputy Morrissey and myself:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In line 21 to delete all words after the word &ldquo;persons&rdquo; and substitute the words &ldquo;or that the entertainment consists solely of a race or a number of races between greyhounds released from a box-trap in pursuit of a mechanical hare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of the amendment would be to relieve greyhound racing from the entertainments tax.  Greyhound racing is to-day the only outdoor sport in the Saorstát subject to this tax.  Section 19 after the word &ldquo;persons&rdquo; states &ldquo;and does not involve the use or participation of horses, dogs or other animals or the use of mechanically propelled vehicles.&rdquo;  In fact, horse racing is to-day relieved of the entertainments tax and, as far as mechanically propelled vehicles are concerned, I understand that if there are any such contests in the Saorstát now, onlookers have not to pay for witnessing them. So that it is true to say that greyhound racing is now the only outdoor sport in this country that is subject to the entertainments tax.  It has been removed from horse-racing on certain extremely good grounds.  But horse-racing is, after all, the sport rather of the more well-to-do part of the community. Greyhound racing is the sport of the plain common people to whom Deputy Rice referred last night.  It is the sport of the poor people, the small farmers and labourers in the country districts.  A concession was made in the <Col N="739" /> case of horse-racing in order to give a fillip to horse-breeding, which is an important industry.  Greyhound-racing is just as important to the greyhound industry as is horse-racing to the horse-breeding industry.  The greyhound breeding industry is nothing to be sneered at.  In 1931 our export of greyhounds had reached, in the very few years of its existence, the extraordinary figure of nearly £500,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1931 our export in greyhounds reached in value almost half a million, and it would be fair to say if it had gone on unrestricted by the tariffs imposed across Channel it would have reached very nearly the million standard to-day.  The economic war has undoubtedly been the big factor that has killed that export.  But apart from England, other countries are taking to this sport.  Continental countries have taken it up.  I see the latest recruit is Spain, and that is a particularly friendly place in the hearts of the Front Bench opposite, especially if we are to take cognisance of the very tactful Mr. Hugh MacLean who spoke on a platform at Letterkenny last Sunday. He told us there that presumably the President's ancestors were some of those Spaniards who had helped Ireland in the past.  Probably they produced the Spanish ale that brought such hope to dark Rosaleen. Anyhow, Spain has now become one of the countries that has taken to greyhound racing, and we can hope to export dogs there if the tracks throughout this country are allowed to carry on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Minister said, in the course of the Budget debate, that some 70 per cent. of the greyhound racing tracks in the country were exempt.  I do not know whether the Minister had consulted anybody before he made that statement, but the fact is that every licensed track has had to pay tax.  The exemption put forward on the Report Stage of the Finance Bill had no effect so far as last year was concerned.  It came into operation on the 1st November when the racing season was over, <Col N="740" /> so that every track in existence here got no exemption for the year 1933-34.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister flourished something last year as if it were a concession. Some of those tracks have paid comparatively small amounts by way of tax, but whether the amount is small or large it is injurious to greyhound breeding.  The persons who breed greyhounds are mostly very small farmers and labourers.  Around a certain belt in North Kerry you will hardly find a labourer's cottage without some greyhounds about, and almost every small farmer throughout County Kerry goes in for greyhound breeding.  The track at Tralee is, to all intents and purposes, their shop window.  It is the only place where they can show their dogs.  Running a dog carries with it a considerable amount of expense.  The dog has to be trained, certain fees have to be paid for entry, and so on.  Every penny taken from the tracks by way of entertainment tax means so much taken away from the prize money. They depend on winning a prize with their dogs in order to be in a position to carry on.  If you reduce the prize money below some figure that would make it attractive to them, you will eventually succeed in killing greyhound breeding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A remission of this tax will not mean such a great loss to the revenue.  As the Minister admitted, it would be almost negligible.  I think the Minister said the amount was about £6,000. Last year the figure was actually £8,720, most of which was paid by the two Dublin tracks.  There was a sum of £6,124 paid by Shelbourne Park and Harold's Cross.  Other tracks paying smaller amounts included Clonmel, Cork, Dundalk, Mullingar, Limerick, Tralee and Enniscorthy.  If Tralee is liable for only £106 in the next year, presumably the £100 will be refunded, but only that amount.  In the case of Shelbourne Park, Harold's Cross and Clonmel, they will be liable for the payment of substantial sums.  I think the provision is that a sum not exceeding £100 will be refunded.  That will still leave Clonmel, if its figure remains <Col N="741" /> the same&mdash;in 1933-34 it paid £543&mdash;paying £443.  That would be taken from the money available for prizes.</P>

      <P>Or from dividends if you like.  You may take it the dividends will probably be secured, and it is the prize money that will suffer, and every penny taken from it will make the racing less interesting to the persons who indulge in that sport, and it will consequently be detrimental to breeding. I cannot understand what is the mentality behind retaining this tax on greyhound-racing when it is gone in the case of horse-racing.  There is no justification for it.  Exactly the same arguments that were used for relieving horse-racing can be made in the case of greyhound-racing.  Greyhound-breeding is an industry that was never subsidised.  It never got any State help.  Contrast it with the horse-breeding industry.  The greyhound industry is a non-subsidised industry. It is merely looking for fair-play, and if it is put on an equal footing with other outdoor sports it bids fair to become an extremely important industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
      <P>I learn now that the track in my constituency, in Clonmel, which I may say I have never attended yet, has paid over £500 by way of tax. I was simply astounded to realise that it was possible for what I consider an important industry to be taxed to the extent of £500.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was rightly said by Deputy Fionan Lynch that greyhound-racing is an industry in this country, and that the amount realised from the sale of greyhounds was very considerable; that it was a business that was likely to expand very much, but that like a good many more things, the economic war <Col N="742" /> has given it a very serious setback.  I notice that the Minister is smiling, but he knows that that is true.  I want to tell him that in the town of Clonmel, in my constituency, it is the one industry that has been started there of recent years.  It is self-supporting and employs up to 50 people.  If there were another industry put up there and supported by or under the régime of the Government, what a flourish of trumpets there would be if it had given employment to the same extent!  That is the one live industry that has been established there, and it is only reasonable to expect that it should get a fair deal from any Government.  The least that could be expected in connection with this greyhound-racing is that it should be put on the same basis as horse-racing.  The tax was withdrawn from horse-racing owing to the fact that it was found very difficult to carry on on account of the tax.  I know that the present situation in connection with greyhound-racing is just the same. They are finding it very difficult to carry on, and I think that on this occasion the Minister ought to accede to our request in this amendment, and put greyhound-racing on the same basis as horse-racing and other sports.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not directly concerned with greyhounds, but with another branch of dog&mdash;gun dogs.  We generally find, on the whole, that the dog-breeding industry, in both branches of greyhounds and gun dogs, is carried on by very small men on the average&mdash;very good men who pursue it purely and simply out of the native love of dogs.  I am sure that that applies to greyhounds, and I know that it certainly applies to gun dogs.  In connection with the training of gun dogs, a man may win an occasional stake in field trials and so on, but the winning of such stakes would never recompense him even if he trained the dogs himself, and if he did not train them himself it would simply rob the ordinary man to enter dogs for these trials.  Deputy Fionan Lynch said that greyhounds are honoured by sporting men and by the poorer classes such as labouring men and small farmers.  As a matter of fact, these are the classes <Col N="743" /> who have put money into this, and they have done that out of pure love of dogs.  If in a small place like Clonmel&mdash; small as compared with towns in England&mdash;they pay £450 annually, surely that is a very considerable sum which is taken from the poorer class of the community in order to try and maintain an industry.  It may be said that there is nothing in this thing.  I am of opinion that there is a whole lot in it. I saw in the newspapers where a man from the city here was fined, I think, £250 in London the other day for the smuggling of a dog, and the man who had bought the dog from him had to pay a very large sum in duty.  Hence the value of the dog in that case was very considerable.  Apparently the dog was smuggled across the Border and then shipped to London.  Take the case of the famous dog, &ldquo;Mick the Miller,&rdquo; and all those other famous dogs.  The tariffs were not on when that dog was exported, but we can take it that we will be able to breed as good dogs in the future.  If the value of such a dog can be £1,000, that is a very considerable sum of money, and it is a sum that might easily go into the pockets of a very poor man.  £400 is deducted in tariffs.  Does that not represent a fortune to a poor man?  I think that when there is a general remission of this tax it is only right to see that it should be remitted in the case of dogs also.  The dogs with which I have been connected are gun dogs.  Nearly the entire export of Irish red setters was done through England, at least indirectly. That is, the people who had these huge kennels in England went to the various shows and saw Irish dogs on exhibit there and bought them from Irishmen or else put some foreign agents in contact with the Irish owner of the dog.  That industry is killed now.  There is not a solitary kennel worth twopence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am perfectly certain that the Deputy is not in a position to get a statement which would be authentic on the matter.  At any rate, the total value in 1931 could not have exceeded £200,000, if it was that much.  Then the Deputy proceeded to say that exports had been killed by the economic war.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>What stopped the export of greyhounds was the fact that the English Government had decided to prohibit the Totalisator on the English greyhound racing tracks.  Since the prohibition was partially lifted in regard to some tracks the price has gone up, so that one person alone succeeded in disposing of a number of dogs&mdash;I would not call them first-rate dogs&mdash;in the last three weeks at a good price, and the economic war is still going on.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. F. Lynch Mr. F. Lynch">

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact of the matter is that the moment the British proposed to permit the Totalisator to operate on the tracks, the export trade has revived, and very substantial sums <Col N="745" /> have been got for greyhounds.  These greyhounds were not fed by small farmers or labourers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am merely shattering one of the arguments advanced here.  Like King Charles' head, the economic war is dragged into all this, when it has nothing to do with it. What stopped the price of greyhounds going up was the British decision to prohibit totalisators on their tracks. When speaking on the Resolution, I said, in effect, that virtually all the small tracks in this country&mdash;I did not say all tracks&mdash;are free from the greater portion of the duty.  I still stand to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>You suggested all the licensed tracks, of which there are ten.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I said that virtually all the smaller ones, the ones outside the large cities, have been virtually released of this duty.  It is quite clear that some of them in the end will not have to pay any duty this year.  They have to pay duty in the first instance, but they claim exemption, and get a rebate up to £100, if they fulfil the terms.  An attempt has been made to draw an analogy between our treatment of greyhound racing and the treatment of horse racing.  The fact is this, that greyhound racing is an entertainment, just the same as horse racing.  The difference between them is that when we came into office we found horse racing in so perilous a state that virtually all the race meetings were losing money.  That does not apply to greyhound meetings.  Most of the tracks have made substantial profits, and as they are entertainments, making substantial profits, why should we forego the Entertainment Tax?  The plea was made that the smaller tracks met the needs of small farmers and labourers, because they were living close to these meetings, and that these were tracks upon which the puppies could get preliminary trials, before the owners decided to send them to Dublin, or before they attracted sufficient attention to induce other people to pay the tax and to bring them to run in <Col N="746" /> Dublin or Cork.  In order to meet that objection, we granted a concession last year, and substantially relieved the smaller tracks of the Entertainments Tax.  For the others, there are no such reasons.  They have been making substantial profits.  If dogs are any good they will be sent there to run.  As Deputies know very well, the attraction is not the prize money but the amount which might be secured by betting, and by the price subsequently got for the dogs.  In any event, we have not any guarantee that if the Entertainments Tax was taken off the prizes would be increased.  We never had any guarantee to that effect, nor have we had proof that the prizes have been reduced owing to the incidence of the Entertainments Tax. The sport is as popular as ever.  The same numbers go to see it.  The majority of the people who go to these tracks do not own dogs, and do not go because they are interested in dogs. They are interested in getting good bets and in picking winners.  It is they would be relieved, and not greyhound breeders.  The people who go there for entertainment would be relieved. And, since greyhound racing is an entertainment, it is a proper subject for this tax.  As the attendance at the meetings is substantial, and as many tracks are making substantial profits, there is no reason why we should forego the amount of tax we are getting out of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has made some extraordinary statements.  He challenged my figure of £500,000, although he has nothing whatever to put forward in the way of a figure.  I quoted the man who keeps the Greyhound Stud Book, who is secretary of the Irish Coursing Club, and who is an authority on Irish greyhound racing. He should be in a position to know what he is talking about.  He says that in 1931 our export figure for greyhounds was in the neighbourhood of £500,000, and he estimates that were it not for other matters, which have arisen since, presumably the decision as to the totalisator, to which the Minister referred, and including the economic war, the figure for exports would be £1,000,000.  The Minister says that the economic war has nothing <Col N="747" /> whatever to do with this matter, that it was like King Charles' head brought into everything.  Is the Minister suggesting that seriously?  The Minister mentioned a person who had sold dogs in the last few weeks at a good figure. Does he seriously contend that that man got the same price that he would have got if there was no economic war? Does he seriously suggest that the person who bought the dogs did not deduct from the purchase price the amount that had to be paid in tax? It is rubbish to suggest that he did.</P>

      <P>Next in order is Cork which paid £526 last year.  I suppose it will have to pay £426 this year. Dundalk paid £406 last year.  Supposing it keeps at the same figure it will pay £306, allowing for £100 as a rebate.  Mullingar paid £370 and will <Col N="748" /> now pay £270; Limerick with £392, will pay £292.  Enniscorthy paid £121 last year.  That is one track which will benefit by having to pay only £21. Galway paid £190 but will only pay £90, and Tralee, which paid £106, will only pay £6 if they keep at the same figure. There are three tracks, Enniscorthy, Galway and Tralee, out of the ten tracks which will be largely relieved of the entertainments tax.  The remaining seven licensed tracks will continue to pay very big sums.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I said smaller tracks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>There are eight small tracks, outside of Shelbourne Park and Harold's Cross.  As a matter of fact, Clonmel is bigger than Cork from the point of view of entertainments tax.  Five of these will not be relieved to any great extent.  If Galway keeps to the same figures it will be relieved to the extent of 50 per cent. of what it paid last year.  I do not consider this rebate as of great relief to the industry as a whole.  The Minister said the position in regard to horse-racing was different, and he adumbrated an extraordinary principle. He said that they found that horse-racing was being carried on at a loss at various race meetings.  No industry is to be given a fillip, or a leg up in the way of putting it on an equal footing with other sports, as this one undoubtedly is, unless it is dying.  If an industry has been able to stand on its own feet and to develop without a subsidy on the capital invested and without any Government help, then it is to be kicked as much as possible.  But a subsidised industry, which may also be a sport, if it is sufficiently moribund may get relief. I think we ought to see that an industry such as greyhound breeding should get every encouragement.  I would be more inclined to encourage it than even horse-racing, because of the fact that, unlike horse-racing, it has never required a subsidy and it is never likely to require one.  All that it requires is that it should get a fair chance just as other forms of sport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not at all agree with the Minister that the attraction of greyhound <Col N="749" /> racing is not the prize money but the bet which a man is going to have.  I know a big number of persons who run dogs on the Tralee track, labourers, and I can tell the Minister perfectly plainly that they breed very good dogs and get very good prices for them.  If the Minister said that the attraction in racing was to show how their dogs could run, I might agree with him.  The attraction of the greyhound racing track is that it is the shopwindow, as I said before, for their products.  It is the place where they can display their dogs and where agents from abroad are present to see how the dogs shape on the tracks. That is the main attraction but a very large part of the attraction is the prize money because these men could not afford to run their dogs-afford the entrance fee, etc.&mdash;if there was not some hope of winning a prize or if there was not a fair likelihood of winning a prize or two during the season.  The betting end, as far as most of the breeders are concerned, is negligible because most of them could not afford to have a five shilling bet on their greyhounds.  I have been on a greyhound track only three or four <Col N="750" /> times in my life but I understand that the odds one gets on dogs are very small.  You rarely get three to one on any dog, unless he has no earthly chance.  Betting is not the attraction. The prize money is the attraction. No matter what the Minister says there is no question of doubt that the entertainment tax has interfered with the amount of prize money.  Naturally, these are commercial concerns and I wish them well of it, if they are able to pay dividends.  They certainly have a right to see that they get dividends on the money they have invested. Nobody can find any fault with them for that.  Of course they will continue to see that their dividends are paid. The dividends will be the last things presumably to suffer.  The prize money will certainly suffer before the dividends suffer and when the prize money suffers greyhound breeding will also suffer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 17:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 33 to insert as a new Part of the Bill a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P Just="Center">PART IV.</P>
      <P Just="Center">Corporation Profits Tax.</P>
      <P>Section 52 (which relates to charge of corporation profits tax) of the Finance Act, 1920, as amended by subsequent enactments is hereby repealed and it is hereby enacted that no corporation profits tax shall be chargeable, leviable or paid in respect of any accounting period ending after the passing of this Act.</P>
      <P>In moving this amendment I would point out to the Minister that the corporation profit tax is really an anachronism.  It was introduced during the war period and was really an additional income tax.  At the time it was called a corporation profit tax and put on industry, when industry was making good profits, in order that the Government might be able to say that the income tax was no more than 5/- in the £.  Now times have changed and in other places the corporation profit tax has been abolished.  The position here is that, with the 4/6 income tax and 6d. corporation profit tax, there is really a 5/- income tax on industry at a time when industry is not doing very well.  It hits manufacturing firms in this country exceedingly hard, because it has to be paid out of the residue of their profits, and, really, comes out of a fund which is very largely used to finance extension, repairs to plant, etc.  I would like to appeal to the Minister to take this into account.  Some Irish manufacturing firms go even further than this and consider that Irish manufacturers should be granted more extended privileges than they enjoy at present, and that they should receive favourable consideration in income tax and various other matters. While I agree with them, at the same time this is a tax that I might describe as a flagrant injustice at the present. I would like to urge the Minister to consider how far he is really hitting industry in this country by continuing this tax.  Many firms have to go to considerable cost to prove that they are exempt from corporation profit tax, and, although the procedure is very largely along the lines of the income tax procedure, still it is not the same. Considerable sums have to be expended, even where firms are not liable.  I would like to urge upon the Minister, taking all these circumstances into account, that the time has arrived when the corporation profit tax should be abolished.</P>

      <P>A good deal might be said to justify the retention of this tax upon its merits and, consequently, to justify the rejection of the amendment. But I think the really practical argument is that if we were to accept this amendment it would mean that we should have to sacrifice over £400,000 of revenue.  I think that renders the proposition an impracticable one from my point of view.</P>

      <P>I think it is high time that this tax was justified upon its merits, if it has any merits.  The fact that the tax produces £400,000 in revenue is not sufficient excuse for it.  It appears to me to be an unjust tax and an inexpedient tax in a country which is trying to organise an industrial revival.  If there is anything to be said for the tax on its merits, the Minister ought to say it.</P>

      <P>The time of the House is valuable, but it is not so valuable as all that.

It appears to me to be a penalty on people who wish to use their money in a specially productive way.  It taxes the same profits twice over.  It seems to me to be an immoral and unjustifiable tax, and, if the Minister has anything to say for it on its merits, it is time he said it.</P>

      <P>The Minister is here putting a duty on boilers and cylinders. When those are made in the country I shall not have a word to say against protection being afforded to them, but I want to put this to the Minister: that a number of ranges and grates which are not manufactured here are being imported.  At the moment there does not seem to be any prospect of their being manufactured here.  I would like to point out to the Minister that the boiler dealt with here could not be manufactured in this country.  It would mean that special tools and appliances would have to be made for a very small number of special boilers if a decision to manufacture were come to.  In opposing the amendment the Government are really only adding to the cost of a building without in any way promoting industry.  There is no use, I would point out, in giving Irish industry a bad name by putting up the cost of items coming here and which cannot be made here at the moment. In saying that, I am not suggesting to the Minister that if certain types of ranges and grates are about to be manufactured here he should not extend his preference to them if the boilers are also going to be made in the country.</P>

      <P>It was not intended that the duty in reference No. 4 should apply to boilers which were an integral part of a range or grate, and I understand that the reference was so interpreted by the Revenue Commissioners. On examination, however, it does appear that there is a doubt as to what is the proper interpretation of the reference, and in order to remove that doubt I am prepared to accept the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to make some observations on reference Nos. 5 and 6. Reference No. 5 deals with &ldquo;articles of any of the following descriptions made wholly or mainly of galvanised wrought iron or galvanised steel,&rdquo; and then follow a number of items.  Reference No. 6 deals with &ldquo;cast-iron articles,&rdquo; and then follow a number of items.  I would like to point out to the <Col N="756" /> Minister that, apparently, galvanised cast-iron is not provided for at all, and would, therefore, appear to be duty free.  In reference No. 6 there is mention of &ldquo;smoke pipes, ventilation pipes and other similar pipes.&rdquo;  That is cast-iron. Apparently, wrought iron smoke pipes would be free.  I would like the Minister to consider these two points. I take it also that the articles under reference No. 5 are subject to a 30 per cent. duty, and those under reference No. 6 to a duty of 25 per cent.  I take it that the emergency duty on steel is gone, and that there is no question of an after duty.  I should like the Minister to deal with that point.  I take it that these are the only duties these items are subject to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as the Deputy's remarks relate to reference No. 5, it is correct that the duty does not apply to galvanised cast-iron goods. It applies only where wrought iron or steel galvanised is used in the construction work.  With reference to his remarks on reference No. 6, it is correct that the emergency duty no longer applies to these goods.  In so far as the general emergency duties on manufactures of steel are concerned, they apply only to machinery.  It does not apply to any of the items enumerated in that reference.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Thrift</NameTxt>
      <P>The ordinary interpretation of cast-iron would be anything that is cast-iron whether it is galvanised or ungalvanised.  I suggest that the Minister should look into the <Col N="757" /> point, because it is open to question on the present wording.  Provided that the article is cast-iron, it remains cast-iron, and, under the strict wording of that Schedule, is liable to duty, whether galvanised or ungalvanised.  It is cast-iron still, whether galvanised or not.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it, following Deputy Thrift's remarks, that that would be so if they were not in two separate sections, but the Minister obviously treats galvanised articles as one section&mdash;and I think I know the reason for that&mdash;and cast-iron articles as another section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Thrift</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not challenging the Minister's interpretation.  I have no doubt that what is intended is that it should be galvanised wrought iron and ungalvanised cast-iron, but I suggest that the meaning of the English word &ldquo;cast-iron&rdquo; is that so long as it is cast-iron, it remains so, whether you galvanise it or not, and as cast-iron galvanised, in the strict interpretation of the words, it becomes liable to duty. I think that a change in the wording to show the Minister's intention is necessary.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 19:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In the second column opposite reference No. 13 to insert the words &ldquo;or educational&rdquo; before the word &ldquo;nature&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to take very long over this, particularly because I think the principle underlying the words I propose for insertion is already admitted. That is made perfectly clear in various places in our Finance Acts, but I think the words, as they appear in reference No. 13, &ldquo;technical or scientific&rdquo; would be improved by the addition of the words &ldquo;or educational&rdquo;.  The word &ldquo;educational&rdquo; only brings in films which are of the same character as the technical or scientific ones, but I think that the word is necessary to make it explicit.  Of course, I should like to go a great deal further and press on the Minister that this particular tariff is one of the most irritating and vexatious <Col N="758" /> of tariffs, while being productive of very little useful result.  These films are very frequently used in ordinary parochial work.  They are used sometimes for mere entertainments and very frequently for entertainments of a semi-educational nature and often for entertainments of a truly educational nature, and it is extremely vexatious to find, when you want to get up some small semi-educational entertainment, that your costs are raised because you must import from abroad slides of that particular kind.  They are not made here at all, and they are frequently used for such lectures as I am referring to.  The position, however, would be improved if the Minister would agree to the insertion of the words I suggest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the introduction of the words, instead of having the effect of making the definition explicit, as the Deputy suggests, would have quite the contrary effect.  The term &ldquo;educational&rdquo; is obviously a very wide term, and could be used to cover a multitude of things.  We are excluding from the scope of the duty slides or films of a technical or scientific nature, and that, I think, is as far as we could go, leaving it to the Revenue Commissioners to determine what is a slide or film of a technical or scientific nature.  Apart altogether from the administrative difficulties that would arise from the use of a general term, such as the Deputy suggests, there is the fact that Saorstát firms engaged in the production of these goods, for whose benefit this duty has been imposed, claim to be in a position to supply whatever educational slides and films may be required.</P>

The main objection, however, to the Deputy's amendment is the administrative difficulties that would arise from the insertion of such a very general term as the Deputy suggests.  I think he can rely on the fact that the Revenue Commissioners will give a liberal interpretation to the words that are, in fact, used.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 20:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In the second column opposite reference No. 22 after the word &ldquo;towelling&rdquo; but within the bracket to insert the words &ldquo;and webbing cloths used in the manufacture of collars and fancy piqué used in the manufacture of dress shirts.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Yesterday we dealt with some of the general aspects of the effect of the Minister's general proposal on the shirt manufacturing industry and, to some extent, I dealt with the class of industry that is carried on in the City of Dublin.  This amendment proposes that there shall be excluded from the tax &ldquo;webbing cloths used in the manufacture of collars and fancy piqué used in the manufacture of dress shirts.&rdquo;  The Minister declares that licences will be issued to persons until such time as they are able to get the material that is tariffed here in the <Col N="760" /> ordinary way.  Whatever may be said about the fabrics that were mentioned yesterday, it is stated very explicitly by people in the shirt industry, and who have been in touch with manufacturers, that the fabrics mentioned in this amendment have no chance of being produced here, the market for them is so small and the cost of production would be so great and that the fact that, to a large extent, that part of the shirt industry which is using these, particularly here, is dependent for its well-being on a certain amount of export trade means that the tariff remaining on those particular classes of goods is going to do them a very considerable amount of harm.  The people who were particularly affected and who I understand are affected in the whole of their trade very much are the Donegal shirt manufacturers who make the better class of tunic and shirt collars.  They have already approached the Minister and laid their case before him.  They want exemption from duty in respect of linen for dress shirts and webbing cloths for collars and marcella fabric for dress shirts.  The immediate difficulty that some of these manufacturers suffer under is enormous.  I told the Minister yesterday that there are firms here in which the workers are standing idle because they cannot get the material for which they are waiting and which is not a large part of the material used.  The Minister was very emphatic yesterday in saying that if persons did not get licences and get them rapidly it was their own fault. I have here a long statement from a Donegal firm, in which they say that they applied for a licence on the 4th June for five pieces of webbing for the making of collars and at the time of writing&mdash;12 days afterwards&mdash;they had not got an acknowledgment of their application.  That manufacturer told me this morning that on the 16th June, 12 days after, he had written to the Minister for Finance without having received an acknowledgment he wrote again.  He has had no acknowledgment of the second letter since.  Here is a man who is dealing with the export trade in which he gets ten days for delivery of the goods and <Col N="761" /> he is waiting now since the 4th June for a licence to get some of his material coming to him to carry on his business and he has no acknowledgement from the Minister for Finance.  The Minister has had represented to him by people engaged in the trade that those goods set out in this amendment are not made here and are not likely to be made here in view of the amount of stuff likely to be used.  The part of the industry that is particularly hit is that part of the industry depending upon exports. In imposing a tariff like this and doing it in this particular way and giving this industry the kind of shock that it is getting now, the Minister ought to bear in mind the type of industry with which he is dealing and the history of it.</P>
    <P>The position with regard to the shirt making industry is that in 1924, before the original tariff was put on, there were 410 persons employed in shirt-making. That is, the employment given in the shirt-making industry was equivalent to 410 whole-time employees. At that time there were imports of shirt material to the extent of £345,000.  The previous Administration put on a tariff and the number of persons employed in the industry rose very rapidly so that in September, 1926, instead of 410 persons there were 1,572 persons employed.  The imports of shirts had fallen in that year to £105,000.  There was a general kind of fluctuation and a gradual rise until in September, 1930, the total number employed was 1,844 persons.  The imports for the year 1930 were £59,000; so that you had an increase in the shirt-making industry from 410 to 1,844 persons between 1924 and 1930. Then there was a slight fluctuation downwards and there were 82 persons less employed in September, 1931.  The position with regard to the industry in the country in 1931 was that we imported that year £64,000 and we exported £75,000 worth of shirts.</P>
    <P>The Minister I think will generally agree that as far as the market here was concerned, beyond a certain amount of imports that might be cut off, nevertheless, we balanced all the <Col N="762" /> imports to a greater extent so that the situation here was saturated as far as the industry was concerned and there was not much room for expansion. During the last few years there has been a certain amount of expansion. According to the Minister's latest returns the total number of persons employed in September last was 2,066 or an increase over the 1931 figures of 280 persons.  But it is an industry saturated like that, dependent on an export market and situated in a district which the Minister will admit cannot very easily be provided for by any other type of industry, that is being hit.</P>
    <P>The position with regard to our exports has been that the exports for shirts for 1929 was £67,000; 1930, £83,000; 1931, £75,000; 1932, £38,000 and 1933, £13,000; so that during the last two years the exports have fallen from £75,000 to £13,000.  We have one particular branch of the industry and an important branch situated in Donegal and this portion of the industry is to a large extent depending on its export market to enable it to carry on; yet it is being prejudiced at this time of the year and terribly upset by the imposition of tariffs.  In the matter of an essential part of their material, however small, they are going to be tied up looking for licences quite unnecessarily or they are to be forced to accept a class of material which is not the class that they are expected to use and which will be dearer than that which they are accustomed to use.  They are being forced into this position when they are competing in the outside market for the better class tunics.</P>
    <P>If the Minister will turn to the issue of the Trade Journal for January, which is not the latest issue, he will see that there are 17 shirt factories in Dublin, 9 in Cork and 14 in Donegal. No doubt the same complaint will be made by the collar makers in the City of Dublin as is made by the Donegal manufacturers at the present time.  The Donegal manufacturers have a terrible grievance.  If the Minister is going to take reasonable precautions to attract their export trade there is no other way out of it but to remove this type of <Col N="763" /> fabric from his Schedule.  I cannot say how much the total value of the imports of that material would amount to.  But compared with the Harvard shirt, the Oxford shirt and the Drill shirt the import of this particular stuff will be negligible as far as the cost is concerned. As far as these other items run the whole cost of the imports as shown by the 1929 Census returns runs to about £60,000.  They are the main shirtings used, particularly in the City of Dublin where the heavier shirts are turned out.  The others are only the webbing and stiffening for particular classes of shirts and collars.  The effect on the manufacturing trade here of the new cotton goods can be nothing, but the amount of upset which can be done to an industry which, I suggest, is in a somewhat perilous position or can be easily put in a somewhat perilous position, is very great.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's case is based on the information supplied to him that the licensing section of the Department of Industry and Commerce is not functioning as efficiently as it should.  These cloths are not made here, but a licence can be got for their importation and any firm engaged in the manufacture of shirts and collars requiring this importation can get a licence for that purpose without difficulty. It would be impossible to accept the amendment in so far as it affects webbing cloths, because the definition is one which those responsible for the administration of the duties would not be prepared to accept, as they could not identify the cloth contemplated.  It is to meet definition difficulties of that kind that the licensing provision is there, as well as to provide for the <Col N="764" /> temporary importation of the other classes of cloth until home production has been increased to the point at which it can supply the home demand. The position might be different in respect of piqué cloth, but I hardly think it is worth while to provide for the specific exemption of that cloth from duty, in so far as the licensing provision has been operating to permit of free importation.  That is a matter which can be examined further.</P>
      <P>The principal item to which the Deputy has referred is the webbing cloth and it is not possible to get for the cloth which is used by collar manufacturers a precise definition which would permit of its identification from all other cloths to which that definition might apply.  The Deputy can be assured that if there has been any temporary delay, due to absence or illness of staff, in the licensing section&mdash;and I am not aware of any&mdash;it will be very speedily remedied and firms dealing with that section of the Department will have their representations very expeditiously attended to.</P>
      <P>The particular case to which the Deputy referred of a firm in Donegal, who wrote to the Department and received no reply for ten days, is one which I should like to investigate, and if the Deputy will give me the name of the firm I will be very glad to look into the matter and find out what is the cause of the delay in that particular case.  On the whole, I must say that very few complaints of the kind are received in the Department, which is a noteworthy fact, having regard to the position which arises immediately after the imposition of new classes of duties in each Finance Act, when a number of people, who never before had experience of dealing with the Department in these matters, came for the first time seeking facilities, and occasionally caused delay by not knowing the precise procedure to adopt.  The procedure, however is rapidly regularised, and so far as I know the staff of that Department is quite adequate to deal with the work coming to it at present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister seems to admit the position.  Here we <Col N="765" /> have in County Donegal a most important industry being strangled because of the limitations of an alien language.  The Minister cannot, within the framework of the English language, provide a description for a certain type of cloth that must be very well known to the manufacturers and could easily be very well known to the revenue officials.  I think we might leave the question of licences aside for the moment.  If there is a case for exempting this class of cloth from the tariff list, because the amount imported is very small, because the likelihood of its being made here is very slight, because if there was a likelihood of its being made here the profit to the manufacturers would be very small compared with the rest of their trade, then there certainly is a case for making a clean sweep of that fabric from the tariff list when the Minister takes into consideration the interests involved in it.  There is no doubt, from all I can hear, that the interests of the Donegal manufacturers as a whole are very seriously jeopardised by the difficulties they are going to be placed in with regard to these cloths. In the first place, if there is an attempt to manufacture them here, they will have to be bought at the prices and in the qualities made here.  I do not think that the matter has been sufficiently considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I will undertake to consider it further and see if we can get a definition which will exempt them.  I think that can be done for the piqué cloth all right, but I am not very hopeful about the webbing cloth.  We can administer the licensing system with a certain amount of elasticity, but once you put a definition in the Act it becomes much more difficult to administer it if there is any looseness in the definition.  In so far as we put anything in the Schedule, it must be a precise definition about which there must be no uncertainty.  That is why we prefer to operate the licensing provision rather than have a definition. If the Deputy will leave the matter over I will consider it.</P>

      <P>With regard to reference No. 39&mdash;whiting&mdash;I should like to point out to the Minister that he has put a duty of £1 per ton on this article. No doubt that is with the object of encouraging the native product, but there seems to be some doubt as to whether the native product will be suitable for putty in all instances.  I suggest to the Minister that he ought to look into that and see how far he can stand over the native product for all the uses for which whiting is intended.  I am not in any sense asking him to come to a decision at the moment, but I am asking him to look into the question.</P>

      <P>We delayed imposing this duty on whiting for some time, while certain experiments were being carried out with the Clare product. The stage has now been reached when we can say that the whiting is suitable for most purposes, but there is some doubt still as to whether it is altogether satisfactory for use in connection with the manufacture of putty, although there is reason to think it is when mixed with certain proportions of imported whiting.  At present we permit under licence the importation of whatever quantities of whiting are required in the manufacture of putty, and we will continue to do so until it is clear that the Clare whiting can be used without difficulty.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to see that one of the Deputies who came into the House interested in the fate of this Bill is a Deputy representing one of the constituencies that it is now proposed to abolish.  In fact, she is the only private member on that side and she represents a University!  Possibly that is the reason she is interested <Col N="770" /> in the fate of the Bill we are now discussing, as perhaps she is looking for a haven elsewhere.  That may be the reason for her interest, but at any rate I suggest that it is very typical of the Government's methods that that is the only person who, at the moment, is showing the slightest interest in the fate of this particular Bill.  When this Bill was introduced into this House there were many objections to it.  The Minister will remember that many weighty objections were made.  The whole purpose of the Bill was canvassed and it bore on its face, even on the occasion of its original introduction into this House, the marks of one of the most extraordinary efforts at gerrymandering that any parliament has been asked to consent to. Needless to say, the majority in this Dáil consented to this Bill, as they would to any other Bill, no matter how outrageous, that was introduced by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of the discussion many arguments were put forward, but hardly any case, in connection with any of the more outstanding scandals of the Bill, was controverted by the Government.  That is, possibly, a foretaste of what we may expect when legislation will be controlled by one House only.  Recently it has been the habit of the Ministry to introduce measures and merely to indicate their will to the House on those measures, taking up the attitude of not bothering to meet any case that may be put up against their particular point of view, knowing perfectly well that whatever is said on this side of the House or on that side of the House, except in so far as it is an indication of the will of the Ministers, is not likely to affect the ultimate decision. As I say, this Bill already had on it, when it was introduced, all the marks of a supreme effort at gerrymandering. I will say for the Government that the method in which it was done was barefaced, unashamed and cynical.  If there were a few principles, to which occasionally they might adhere&mdash;but not always, because they had to change their principle from constituency to constituency&mdash;if there were <Col N="771" /> a few principles that might appear still to be left standing on which the Government might base their defence of this Bill as it was introduced, many of these principles, if not most of them, have by now been wiped away.  I doubt if there is any principle now left on which the constituencies of this country are divided.  The alleged principles of revision have been so upset that they are made to apply to one county but not to a neighbouring county, though there is nothing to distinguish the two cases.</P>
    <P>No principle of solid representation of any kind is observed from beginning to end of this Bill.  Right through it bears, as I say, the marks of Party expediency&mdash;a calculation, obviously, on the part of the Government and their Party that in this way they may hope to save a certain amount of seats from the wreckage. It is hard, really, to understand it, when a person looks at the Schedule of this Bill, on any other supposition than that.  The principle of proportional representation is preserved still so far as the letter goes, but anybody who is acquainted, as I presume the Minister must be well acquainted, with the system of proportional representation must know that a three-member constituency is almost incompatible&mdash;I do not say altogether incompatible&mdash;with the idea of the working of proportional representation, and that it does not give the principle of proportional representation a fair chance.  Theoretically, undoubtedly, the larger the constituency the better from that point of view of allowing that principle of proportional representation to which the Government still, apparently, acknowledge that they are prepared to pay a certain amount of homage.  The larger the constituency the better, it being recognised of course that there are certain obvious commonsense limits such as, for instance, where we had on one occasion a constituency representing the whole of Ireland, as we had for the Seanad, which proved to be altogether unwieldy and impracticable.  To go to the other extreme, however, is practically <Col N="772" /> wiping out the idea of proportional representation altogether.</P>
    <P>I ask the members of this House to look at the Schedule of this Bill, or rather I ask the members of the majority Party in the House to look at the Schedule, and I think they will find that there are altogether about 33 constituencies in this Bill.  My arithmetic may be at fault, but I think that is the number, and they will find that almost one-half of them are three-member constituencies.  To be exact, 15 constituencies out of 33 are three-member constituencies-cutting across anything like a proper working of the principle that is still preserved, apparently, even at this stage in this particular Bill.  Seven are four-member constituencies, which is almost equally objectionable.  I admit that owing to the distribution of population and to geographical considerations, they cannot wholly be done away with; but there are seven of these four-member constituencies.  Altogether, therefore, two-thirds of the constituencies are either three-member or four-member constituencies, and yet the Government pretend that they are honouring the principle of proportional representation. You have only eight five-member constituencies, and, strange to say, you have three seven-member constituencies left.  Now, there were anomalies in this Bill as it was first introduced into the House.  I will say for the Government that, in so far as their actions could indicate their mind, they made no effort to conceal what their purpose was; but the way in which they have dealt with the principle of not splitting up counties where it could be avoided, or with any other principle of dividing counties where there was no necessity to divide them as well as the particular points I have mentioned is unique in its cynicism.</P>
    <P>Counties have been carved up, and as little respect has been shown to old affiliations between different portions of counties, as has been shown by the Government in another instance&mdash; they treat them as casually as they might treat the rights of the Irish people in connection with the fundamental principles of the Constitution. A more chaotic method of <Col N="773" /> treatment it would be difficult to imagine.  I do not see that there are any grounds, any real reason, any justification for it.  That there are motives impelling the Government to do what they have done nobody questions. We have not the slightest doubt that there were motives, and strong motives.  Portion of Galway is taken away and put into Clare.  Portion of Roscommon is also taken. Then, as if Cork were not sufficiently divided up, portion of it is taken and put into a county with which that particular portion of Cork has little connection.  It is not even neighbouring it in the ordinary sense.  Anyone who knows that portion of Ireland knows that Youghal is separated from Waterford by the estuary of the Blackwater.  In some respects that is one of the most clear pieces of carving up, regardless of historical connection, to be found in this Bill.  Of course, Carlow is an outstanding example.  They are not satisfied with the position which they found &mdash;a position established before anyone knew the strength of the different Parties.  Carlow-Kilkenny, which was a joint constituency, disappears, and Carlow is divided between Kildare, Wicklow and Wexford.  Even to the principles in the Bill to which they pretended to attach some importance when it was introduced, they did not remain true in committee.  Take three counties in the South of Ireland-Tipperary, Limerick and Kerry.  At present these are seven-member constituencies. The Government proposed to divide Tipperary and Limerick. The House refused to divide Tipperary and Limerick but did divide Kerry.  All were seven-member constituencies and exactly the same reasons applied to County Kerry as to County Limerick and County Tipperary. In fact, a stronger case could be made for the division of Tipperary owing to its division into North and South Ridings, than could be made in the case of County Kerry.  It is true that the Minister who is at the moment in charge of the Bill was also in charge when we were discussing Kerry.  I ask Deputies, even the one member of his Party present, and the <Col N="774" /> other 50 per cent. in the person of the Minister for Finance, to look up his speech on that occasion, when the only case the Minister could make for dividing County Kerry was that when he was down there the roads were bad.  Still this obedient House followed the whim-I am sure the Minister will admit that it was nothing better than a whim&mdash;and went into the Lobby with him.  It was an excellent foretaste, when he had such an excellent argument to put forward, of what we may expect when we have that great ideal&mdash;Single-Chamber government. He suggested that there was a reason why you might divide Kerry but not Limerick.  That reason was put up only for the occasion, I suggest, because it struck at the very root of one of the descriptions that Ministers themselves gave to this Bill, that it was one to diminish the number of members in this House.  When we were discussing university representation, even in the presence of some members representing universities, the argument was put forward that as one of the purposes was to diminish the number of members in the House, why not start with the universities and abolish them.  Thus we should get a smaller House.</P>
    <P>The Minister will remember that he put forward as a reason for not dividing Limerick that if he did so that county would lose a member. In a Bill, one of the purposes of which, as announced by the Minister for Local Government, was to secure a smaller number of members in the House, simply because he has to make a case for not treating County Kerry the same as County Limerick, an excellent reason is suddenly found for not dividing Limerick, because it would otherwise diminish the number of members, and therefore it ought not to take place!  Similarly in this Bill, the purpose of which is to cut down representation in the House, Youghal is filched from County Cork and put into County Waterford to prevent Waterford losing a member!  I wonder what principle is now left in the Bill.  I am speaking of principle now, not motives.  The motives that influenced the Minister are, no doubt, <Col N="775" /> as strong as ever, but I wonder what principle is now left in the Bill as far as the Government is concerned. Counties are to be cut up.  There are to be 15 three-member constituencies, and seven four-member constituencies. There are glaring anomalies, one principle applying to Counties Tipperary and Limerick, and an entirely different principle to Kerry.  Notwithstanding the intimation of the wishes of the House on that matter, a different principle is applied to Donegal and to Kerry.  What is left in the way of principle in this Bill?  What is the reason for this, except a cynical calculation by the Government that it will benefit their own Party?  That calculation may prove to be wrong. It is based on previous election figures. I notice that all calculations of this kind are based on the assumption that no change of public opinion takes place, and that the figures got at the last election can safely be relied on for the future.  A little reflection should convince the Ministry that that is not so.  Otherwise there would be no point in general elections.  The normal assumption is that there is a change, so far as figures are concerned. Therefore, it is probable that even the motives which actuate Ministers may prove to be as weak as the expediency upon which they seem to rely, and upon which they seem to change from county to county, and from one portion of the Schedule to another.  The Bill was bad when it came to this House.  It is improved to this extent, that its badness is now more apparent.  That should be even more apparent to the Minister now than it was before it came to the House.  There is all the evidence of a very sloppy piece of legislation, and of no principle to guide the Government in their actions in this matter. Undoubtedly they have the power to put a Bill of this kind through the House, but the way they will persist in doing what is, on its face, a very unashamed piece of gerrymandering, is a certain augury for the future, if the time ever comes when Single Chamber legislation is to prevail in this country.  Even at this late hour I think the House should exercise a <Col N="776" /> certain amount of wisdom and commonsense by rejecting a Bill that, even on the face of it, is bad and contravenes every principle of decency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I referred to certain details in the Bill, in relation to names I proposed on the Committee Stage. When you look on the Bill as a whole, and consider the speeches made in its favour, you see very obvious tricks. In relation to a Bill or anything else, you can set up a principle as a guiding motive, you can demonstrate the rightness or the desirability of making such a principle applicable and you can apply that principle rigidly.  Or you may say that there is more than one consideration to be taken into account and in that case you must necessarily establish what I might call, a hierarchy between these principles. Thus the Government say: &ldquo;We are desirous of maintaining proportional representation.&rdquo;  Again they say: &ldquo;We want to get county units.&rdquo;  Further they may say: &ldquo;It is desirable that constituencies should be small so that a Deputy may be able to look after his constituency and be intimately in touch with it.&rdquo;  But to put forward three principles that are on completely different planes and establish no hierarchy amongst them, is a very effective way of making a swindle and deluding people who are incapable of thinking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is perfectly obvious that there is no relationship between the desirability of proportional representation, the desirability of having county units and the desirability of having small constituencies.  To begin with, these principles contradict each other.  Proportional representation is contrary to the idea of the small constituency. What has the Government done?  It has taken three things, all of them you may say desirable, viewed in a certain light, but if you regard any one as most desirable, life being just a series of choices, you must abandon the other two.  The Government has said: &ldquo;We want to keep proportional representation.&rdquo; In this Bill it abolishes proportional representation.  It is perfectly clear to all who will take the trouble to think that even with the appallingly bad system of proportional <Col N="777" /> representation we have had in this country, if you admit that what it aims at is a desirable thing, we must have constituencies returning not less than five candidates.  Anybody can see how it works out.  In County Wicklow you have a three-seat constituency.  That means that any Party which gets one vote over half the number of votes cast will get two seats out of the three.  In that case proportional representation is not in operation at all.  Under the old system that operates in England, anybody who gets one vote more than half the number cast gets one seat and the other person, of course, gets none. So far as that system is concerned, the seats go to the one Party.</P>
    <P>In County Wicklow you give two seats to one Party and one seat to another.  That is to say, a representative can be put in by getting, in effect, only one vote.  The whole idea of proportional representation was to make the number of Deputies in the Dáil roughly proportionate to the number of their supporters in the country.  When you establish a three-seat constituency or a four-seat constituency, you are abolishing that.  If the Government had faced up to the thing and said: &ldquo;It is necessary in certain cases, in 22 of the constituencies, to have them so small that you cannot have five seats,&rdquo; one could understand their attitude.  They then should have recognised that the principle of proportional representation, however desirable it may be in one aspect possibly, must be abandoned. What they do is, they assert that principle at the same time as they assert the desirability for small constituencies. When it is apparent that a certain Deputy or Minister of the Fianna Fáil Party would be almost inevitably wiped out, if a small constituency were maintained, or if the county unit were maintained, they twist round and say how desirable it is that the constituency should be so large as to make proportional representation operative.  Their adherence to these three unrelated principles, without any order established amongst them, is merely a fatuously dishonest attempt to pull the wool over the people's eyes.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="778" /> With regard to the constituency I represent, the Government say that it is undesirable to have two counties associated in one constituency.  If they applied that principle and said: &ldquo;We want county units all over the country; each county is going to be a constituency, and where proportional representation conflicts with that principle in some of the counties, we shall forego it in favour of the county constituencies,&rdquo; we could understand their attitude.  But they put up the argument that it was desirable to separate Carlow and Kilkenny. The Minister for Agriculture scraped in without a quota at the last election.  Had Wexford remained by itself, and returned the number of Deputies it is due to have, his prospect of being elected would indeed be very remote.  It was necessary to give the Minister for Agriculture some chance, as the Government thought, of being elected.  In order to do that, they cut a part out of Carlow and associated it with Wexford.</P>
    <P>There was no other ground for that except that the unfortunate Minister for Agriculture should get some sort of look in at the next election.  If the Government had said that honestly one could have a certain amount of respect for them.  But the Minister for Local Government got up to defend that and he introduced a totally new principle.  He went back, as far as I remember, to old Gaelic times and said that somewhere about the time of Con of the Hundred Battles Wexford was intimately associated with this part of Carlow.  Surely they do not propose, as a principle, that we must have our eyes cast back to ancient Irish times, and regard the intervening period as a mere accident which is obliterated as completely as it is possible to obliterate it?  It is the contemptible dishonesty of bringing up such bogus arguments that makes one so disgusted with this whole Bill.  If the Government had got up and said: &ldquo;We are the Government; we feel that we want to be the Government after the next election, and we feel that if we have a majority in the country, we should not be forced into the position of having to govern under circumstances <Col N="779" /> where we are always in jeopardy; where an accident may demolish our majority; the majority Party has a right to special privileges in the country,&rdquo; I would have found it very hard to argue against that.</P>
    <P>I would have thought it a perfectly good argument if the Government had said that the majority Party must be given certain rights under the Bill which will give them an assurance that the illness of a couple of Deputies or some accident like that, would not put them in jeopardy of being thrown out of office, but it is a contemptible trick to come along and operate three different principles as it suits them. They said that one of the principles was the county unit.  County Carlow is one of the smallest, if not the smallest county in the country.  Yet the Government has divided it into three parts.  Why have they done that? First of all, the interests of the unfortunate Minister for Agriculture have to be looked to and part of the county is put in with Wexford.  In County Wicklow where if you take the results of the last election you will find that the Government combine got more than their due representation&mdash; they got two out of three seats although they have not two-thirds of the votes in the constituency&mdash;the Government require to maintain that position.  If they had joined Wicklow with some other constituency they would have inevitably, assuming, as they seem to admit, that the last two elections represent the final assessment of the Irish people's political opinions, lost a seat.  If County Wicklow remained alone there would be only two representatives and two representatives are just as good as three, as far as proportional representation is concerned. The Government then would have lost a seat.  In Kildare also, if I remember aright, as the result of the last election, the Government combine had two out of three seats.  If they put the two constituencies together, assuming there was no change otherwise, they would have lost another seat.  Therefore Carlow is divided up into three parts. A bit has to be provided for the Minister for Agriculture and another bit is <Col N="780" /> put in with County Wicklow to justify, under the Constitution, the maintenance of three seats there.  The Minister, speaking in regard to County Wicklow, said this part joins fairly closely with County Carlow.  I have travelled that district, and I know how difficult it is to get from what I may call the really large populative parts of Carlow to Wicklow. It is true that it is difficult to get from one part of Wicklow to another. A totally different arrangement would be conceivable in these circumstances by abandoning the idea of county units altogether, taking part of Wicklow, on the west side of the mountain, and attaching that to a constituency on the west side of the mountain.  There would be reason for the breaking up of Wicklow in that it is divided by mountains but the Government had to find a case that would keep them a seat.</P>
    <P>They divided Carlow and Kilkenny which was a five-seat constituency, where proportional representation operated adequately.  They made Kilkenny a three-seat constituency by destroying proportional representation and they attached the other part of Carlow to Kildare.  That was probably part of the representation made by Deputy Norton, who wanted to retain his seat, and they put part on to County Wexford and part on to County Wicklow.  I do not know why the Government could not come in here and say, quite frankly, what they wanted.  But they were possibly afraid that a little political propaganda would be made against them.  They could have come in here and said: &ldquo;In the last two years we have received a majority of votes in this country; we assume that position will continue, and we feel we are justified in making an arrangement that would guarantee us an adequate majority instead of one which leaves us dependent upon the Labour Party, which we have to placate now and again in one way or another.&rdquo;  That would be a legitimate proposal.  In regard to Clare they were putting it in the position that Carlow-Kilkenny was in and making it a five-member constituency.  Carlow-Kilkenny has been, up to the present, <Col N="781" /> a five-member constituency.  Clare, in order to be a five-member constituency, required another part of another constituency added to it.  Consequently Clare, and portion of Galway, are brought together in order that President de Valera would be able to get an enormous poll.  If the constituency was reduced to four members that would not happen.  It was necessary to separate Carlow-Kilkenny and do away with it as a five-member constituency, at the same time that it was found necessary to combine portion of Galway to Clare in order to get a five-member constituency.</P>
    <P>There was a peculiar thing noticeable during the progress of this Bill. There were times when the Government withdrew the Whips and other times when they kept them on very rigidly. It was perfectly obvious to everyone at all observant that the Whips were withdrawn when a number of Fianna Fáil Deputies insisted, say, in the change proposed by the Government, on the danger of their not being able to hold their own personal seats.  In that case the Government withdrew completely from the three unrelated principles that they have in mind.  But on other occasions, when the change proposed was something not in the national interests, but merely calculated to benefit Fianna Fáil, as against the Opposition, there the Fianna Fáil Whips were rigidly maintained. An individual Deputy might feel that it would be advantageous for him to support the line taken by the Opposition because it would be more flattering, or more pleasing to those people who support him, but the interests of the Fianna Fáil Party&mdash;and if it was not their positive interest, then the negative interest of attempting to injure the Opposition&mdash;operated to such an extent that the Whips were rigidly maintained in such instances. Deputy J. M. O'Sullivan referred to the declared purpose of the Fianna Fáil Party when they introduced this Bill. It was, he said, to reduce the size of the Dáil.  If one observes it closely he will see, in regard to the provisions of the Constitution, that this Bill is one to keep the size of the Dáil as large as possible.  The Minister for Local <Col N="782" /> Government and Public Health referred to the fact&mdash;I do not remember the circumstances or facts of the case&mdash; that when we left office we had a Bill in draft that would reduce the size of the Dáil to 120 members.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil manifesto at the last election was issued although roughly for 12 months they had that information available in a Government Department at their disposal.  They consequently knew that our proposal&mdash;I am now speaking from memory&mdash;had been to reduce the Dáil to 120 members, yet they brought out a paragraph in the early part of their manifesto, saying how much they were seeking for economy.  In one paragraph, as far as I remember, they indicated two lines on which they were anxious to economise, and that paragraph dealt with the Dáil and the Seanad.  They indicated that they were very concerned that the people had to pay high taxes and that they therefore proposed to economise on the Dáil and on the Seanad.  They said, with regard to the Seanad, that they were going to abolish it in its present form, and that if it was decided to maintain a Second Chamber it would be one with much less members than the present Seanad. The implication in that was that their proposal in regard to the Seanad was influenced by concern at the expenditure. That was coupled with a statement with regard to the Dáil.  They said in the same paragraph, as far as I remember, they proposed to reduce the membership of the Dáil.  The implication of these statements was that the Government stood for economy; they called on the people to vote Fianna Fáil rather than for the Opposition, on the ground that the people would be serving themselves by voting for a Party that wholeheartedly stood for economy, with regard to the Dáil and Seanad as compared with others who stood for a large Dáil and Seanad.  The Government knew that their statement, about reducing the numbers of the Second Chamber, was only humbug, and that in reality they were proposing to get rid of it <i>in toto,</i> in order to clear the way for Mr. de Valera to set up as a Dictator.  They said that they proposed to reduce the <Col N="783" /> numbers in the Dáil, in the interests of economy, whereas they had before them a Bill in draft which they inherited, but refused to accept for the reason that it made the Dáil smaller than they were prepared to accept. They introduced a Bill for making the Dáil larger than it would be if they had accepted the Bill which they found in draft.  In face of that they put out this manifesto which was typically dishonest, calling upon the people to vote for them because they were going to save expenditure by reducing the size of the Dáil.  It is quite evident all through this Bill that enormous ingenuity has been exercised in order to enable them to have a comparatively large Dáil.</P>
    <P>For many years, I have indicated clearly that I disagreed on principle with the present system of proportional representation which, to my mind, puts the adjective in a more important position than the noun, makes representativeness much more important than government and tries, in a way, to defeat the whole idea of government, which aims at the unification of a people who are necessarily divided. The purpose of proportional representation is to produce in a Parliament an exact replica of all the divisions and differences of opinion that exist amongst the people and to maintain that divergence instead of creating a unity. Consequently, I have been consistently against proportional representation. The Government may like proportional representation.  They may think that they have tried to maintain it but they have done nothing of the sort.  Once they departed from the principle of proportional representation, they could have said: &ldquo;The population of Wicklow has diminished; on the previous basis it had three members; now it shall only have two.  In that way, we will keep the county unit intact, which is one of the principles for which we stand.  It will also be in accord with the policy of economy which we announced at the last election.  It will save the cost of one Deputy so far as Wicklow is concerned.&rdquo;  I think that Wexford would have had to be reduced, too, but I may be mixing it up with another <Col N="784" /> county.  Waterford would have had to drop also.  In my own constituency, Kilkenny&mdash;I have not the figures at the moment&mdash;it will take 3,000 more votes to elect a man than it will to elect a man in the portion of Carlow joined with Kildare.  Yet, the Constitution says there shall be not less than one Deputy for every 30,000 of the population and not more than one Deputy for every 20,000 of the population. Since the Government issued a manifesto saying how much they stood for economy and how, as one of the first steps towards economy, they proposed to reduce the size of the Dáil, one would have thought that they would have aimed at having the number of population per Deputy rather nearer to the 30,000 than to the 20,000 mark.  So far as Wicklow and Kildare are concerned&mdash;and, again, I speak from memory but if it does not apply here it certainly does apply to other constituencies&mdash;a very small decrease in population will require another reconsideration of the constituencies because a comparatively small drop in population will mean that the requirements of the Constitution will not be fulfilled because there will be more than one Deputy for every 20,000 people.  If you take the population per constituency and see how many people there are per Deputy, you will find that the Government has approached as closely as it could in many cases to having one Deputy per 20,000 whereas the Constitution allows them a margin of from 20,000 to 30,000.  Sometimes, they do require rather more to elect a Deputy than the minimum 20,000.  In County Kilkenny, as I said, it will take 3,000 more people to elect a Deputy than it will in Carlow-Kildare or Wicklow.</P>
    <P>Here is a Bill which I shall not say is shameless.  I should have had much more respect for the Government if it had been shameless.  The Government wanted to bring in a corrupt, gerrymandering Bill in such a way as they thought would completely benefit their Party and would give them more Deputies to ratio of the population than any other Party would get. Personally, I do not mind a great deal because, with an ostrich-like point of view, the Government assume that the <Col N="785" /> last election represents the permanent decision of the people.  I quite agree that the majority Party, which has to take over the responsibility of government, does require to have that fact recognised, that it should be put in a position where it will not be in daily jeopardy and should claim, in some form or other, a representation that will give them an adequate majority, even though they are only elected by a small majority.  That, I admit, but the elaborate gerrymandering of the Government is contemptible.  It is done in the interests of a specific Party instead of in the interests of the country.  It is particularly contemptible because they have tried to hide their object by mouthing certain contradictory principles.  There is an additional element of contemptibleness in their conduct in that the very thing they are trying to achieve will, probably in a short time and certainly ultimately, have a completely opposite effect to what they think.</P>
    <P>So far as this Bill aims at giving the majority Party more than its normal representation in the Dáil, it would have served Fianna Fáil in the last election and the election before that.  I regard it as practically certain that it will not serve Fianna Fáil in the next election.  We know that, with the fluctuations that take place amongst the people, it is inevitably going to operate against Fianna Fáil as soon as Fianna Fáil becomes a non-majority Party.  The mentality which is always looking around for crooked and devious ways for benefiting a Party, while mouthing high principles to the country, is bound to make a mess of everything it does and, ultimately, I think that this Bill is going to injure Fianna Fáil.  But I think that the Bill is bad, whether it will injure or benefit Fianna Fáil.  This Bill, with its contradictory principles, with its destruction of everything that is good in any of these principles, with its exaggeration of everything that is bad in any of these principles, is a thoroughly bad Bill.  Everybody who does not stand for corruption and gerrymandering will necessarily vote against it.  The debate has proven <Col N="786" /> what its purpose is.  Independent of the debate, the very articles of the Bill, to anybody who reads them carefully, show clearly that the Bill is brought in for a corrupt purpose and for a corrupt purpose only.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to have a few more words on this Bill.  One outstanding characteristic of it, as has already been pointed out, is that it does not fulfil the policy of the Party opposite as expressed before it came into office.  Deputy Fitzgerald has just been drawing certain inferences from the phraseology of the Party manifesto, but it is not necessary to draw even implications.  Various of the most prominent members of the Party opposite&mdash;and, I think, the President himself&mdash;declared themselves, before they came into office, in favour of a House of 100 members.  It is unnecessary to point out how much this Bill differs from the views that they then held.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Local Government was deeply pained because anyone should assert that this Bill was an attempt at gerrymandering, but if that has been asserted it has been asserted for the reason that nature abhors a vacuum, and it has not been possible to discover any other principle informing this Bill except the principle of gerrymandering.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce laid down some principles that he said had been in the minds of the Government, and on examination it turned out that those principles had not been embodied in the Bill at all, barring the attempt to increase the number of three-member constituencies.  I cannot think of any principle at all that can be said to be preserved or attended to by the actual terms of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now a chain is said to be only as strong as its weakest link, and the respectability of the Government's motives in drafting this Bill may, perhaps, be judged by some of the more outstanding crimes that it contains.  To my mind&mdash; I may possibly be a little prejudiced &mdash;the worst blot of all in this Bill is the treatment of the County Roscommon. The treatment of the province of Connaught, as a whole, is very bad.  The province of Connaught has <Col N="787" /> one piece carved off it and presented to the County Clare, and another piece carved off it and presented to the new monstrosity that has been created called Longford-Athlone.  In consequence, the province of Connaught is to have two members less than it would have had if these operations had not been performed, and three members less than it is really entitled to have, comparing its population with the population of the other provinces.</P>
    <P>It is true that the County Carlow has been passed through the mincing machine, but the County Carlow did present a problem that had to be handled some way or the other.  The County Roscommon presented no problem of any sort or kind.  It had four members&mdash;it was entitled to have four members&mdash;and there was no need to disturb it in any way.  So far as I can make out there was absolutely no motive for disturbing it except that it looked to the Government as if they could not hope to improve their position in the County Roscommon, and they thought they might conceivably improve it by cutting a piece off it.  The figures that have been produced show that, as a result of this Bill, the County Roscommon will have a smaller representation in proportion to its population than any other county in the Saorstát. It will take more voters in the County Roscommon than in any other county in the Saorstát to elect a member to this Dáil.  That is a fact.  As I have stated, there was no need to interfere with the County Roscommon at all.  It was entitled to four members and it should have been left intact with its four members.  The County Sligo, another county in which I am deeply interested, has had a piece cut off it and given to the County Leitrim.  It would have been far preferable to have retained the County Sligo and the County Leitrim in a double-county constituency as they are at the present moment.</P>
    <P>We object to this Bill because it does not seem to be built on any respectable principle at all.  If you are in favour of proportional representation you cannot like this Bill, because it cuts out any good there is in proportional <Col N="788" /> representation.  If you are against proportional representation you cannot like this Bill, because you have not got back to the simplicity of the other system: to the system which gives a chance to the individual trying to break in through the Party machine that corresponds to the chance he gets under proportional representation.  That chance can be got under the old system of single-member constituencies, but, to my mind, the hope for an independent is made definitely less by the terms of this Bill and that is one of the numerous reasons why I object to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I remember reading in the <i>Irish Times</i> an article before this Bill was actually circulated and just after it had been introduced.  It said that whatever the Bill was like we might very well be sure there would be charges of gerrymandering. Of course we were quite certain that we would be accused of gerrymandering in connection with this Bill, no matter how we might try to draw it up.  The Deputies on the opposite side would see that no matter what kind of a Bill we brought in they could not get a majority on their votes.  It would take a genius to draw up a Bill that would give the Opposition a majority.  We are not able to do that even if we wanted to.  The Opposition is really expecting too much.  We have Deputy Fitzgerald and Deputy MacDermot, both of whom have to go back to three-member constituencies, objecting to the Bill. Naturally, they feel that things are not as bright looking for them as they would like.  If you are going to have a Redistribution Bill at all you must naturally change some constituencies, and by accident these two constituencies, Kilkenny and Roscommon, came in for alteration.  There was no problem, it is true, in Roscommon, but there was a problem in Westmeath. We could not leave it as it was, because it would not carry three members. Something had to be taken in with Westmeath, and the result was that Roscommon came in for a little bit of carving, as Deputy MacDermot has put it.  I know that these charges <Col N="789" /> have been made about gerrymandering, but I do not think that any single instance has been given where there has been gerrymandering.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputies opposite know as well as we know that representation all over the country is fairly evenly distributed. There is not a county where you could say that it is ten to one Fine Gael or one where you could say that it is ten to one Fianna Fáil.  In practically every county the percentage of Fianna Fáil votes would be between 40 and 60, and I suppose one could say also that in practically every county the Opposition votes would number between 40 and 60 per cent. How can anyone make a charge of gerrymandering in circumstances such as these?  The position is quite different in other countries where you might have one whole district entirely on one side and another district going solidly on some other side.  In such countries you might, by a process of carving up, be able to do a certain <Col N="790" /> amount of gerrymandering.  I put it to the Deputies opposite that even if they were given a free choice and allowed to draw up a Bill on the lines that they liked, that it could not be done.  It is ridiculous, therefore, to talk about gerrymandering.  We had the usual talk from Deputy Fitzgerald about dishonesty and corruption.  It is from one such as the Deputy that we get such talk.  The Deputy cannot think, act or talk honestly in this House or out of it, and he is certainly the last Deputy that should talk about corruption.  With regard to the point made about Kerry, Tipperary and Limerick, I did not advocate, when I was in charge of the Bill, that we should let Limerick go back to one constituency and divide Kerry.  On a free vote the House decided in the case of Tipperary and Limerick that they should go back to one constituency, and that Kerry should be divided.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration.&rdquo; This is a very remarkable Estimate to be presented to this House for approval by the Party opposite, whether we think of them as a Party passionately eager for economy, or as a Party engaged upon breaking all the shackles with which this nation is afflicted, or as a Party devoted to the proletarian point of view and objecting in principle to anything like a Governor-General.  Large numbers of the Party opposite are absent to-day, presumably engaged in galloping around the country boasting of their performances and of their intentions in the matter of breaking shackles.  They could be more usefully employed here.  The shackle breakers could be doing their stuff on this Estimate, of which the House is asked to approve.  It has got to be realised that apart from the sums included in this Estimate there is paid to the Governor-General a salary of £2,000 out of the Central Fund, and furthermore a sum of £190 is paid in respect of the expenses of the Gárda Síochána; £35 in respect of Posts and Telegraphs; £25, stationery and offices supplies, and £5 for printing. I suggest that for what the Governor-General does the sums that are provided outside this Estimate are more than adequate and that the sums contained in this Estimate are a sheer waste of the taxpayers' money.  In the total, £2,246, they include £621 for household staff; £1,200, allowances for expenses; £75 for travelling expenses; £50 for telegrams and telephones, and £300 allowance for a motor car.  It is not even as if he had to pay the chauffeur, for the chauffeur is provided by the Gárda Síochana and the payment <Col N="793" /> to him is borne on that Vote.</P>
      <P>Where is the need of any one of these items?  The functions of the Governor-General are, on the one hand, clerical, and, on the other hand, ceremonial. The clerical functions are of the most modest description.  Nobody would think of paying anybody more than a few hundred pounds a year for clerical work corresponding either in volume or the nature of the work to that performed by the Governor-General. What about the ceremonial duties? Owing to the policy of the present Government no ceremonial duties were left to the Governor-General except the reception of Ministers representing Foreign States.  That last remaining ceremonial duty is now being undertaken by the President of the Executive Council, who has overcome any objections he might have been expected to entertain towards acting as personal representative of His Majesty the King when new Ministers arrive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where then is the need of these new sums of money we are asked to provide for the Governor-General?  Why is there a need for a household staff? What are the expenses for which we are asked to provide £1,200 a year? What is the occasion for travelling expenses and for telegrams and telephones; and for what purpose does the Governor-General use a motor car?  So far as we know the Governor-General is somewhat in the position of what used to be called a remittance man, the black sheep of a family who was despatched to Canada or Australia and paid so much a year on the strict condition that he never came back to this country.  In the same way the Governor-General is marooned out in, I think, Monkstown.  The most important feature of his duties is that he is to remain invisible.  He can do that much better by sitting at home in his parlour than by driving about in his motor car for which we are asked to pay £300 in addition to his chauffeur. This Estimate strikes me as simply preposterous.  I am not to be taken as holding that there should be no such office as that of Governor-General.  I consider that the Governor-General can perform very useful functions.  In the first place, from the point of view <Col N="794" /> of anybody who believes in the Commonwealth connection&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Indeed, it has been laid down that the actions and functions of the Governor-General may not be discussed in this House at all. This is the Vote for the Governor-General's Establishment.  His salary is not on this Vote.  It is on the Central Fund, and is to that extent, statutory. The Deputy, so far as he relates his remarks to the establishment is in order and under the terms of Article 60 might refer to the question of &ldquo;suitable provision.&rdquo;  The point to which the Deputy refers might have been properly raised on the Vote of the President of the Executive Council on which the Government's general policy was open to debate.  This Vote bears no relation to Government policy.</P>

      <P>I accept that completely. The Governor-General has certain functions which we will not discuss, as it has been ruled that they could not be discussed.  It does seem to me, however, if I might say so with great respect, that there has been a change in his functions, in his activities and so on.  I should think it might be argued at least that when the functions or activities of the holder of a certain office are changed, the mere fact that there is that change made raises a different situation. First of all, the functions are different from what they were and, consequently, I personally would like to talk about the change in function of the Governor-General.  It is not the actual function which he fulfils but the transition from one condition to another which has taken place within the last year.</P>

      <P>There was an opportunity of discussing the whole question on the President's Vote when Government policy was discussed.  The Deputy would be in order in arguing that this Vote is not required, but he may not discuss the functions of the Governor-General.  Whether the status has been changed does not arise on this Vote.</P>

      <P>I only want to say a very few words.  You will, no doubt, stop me if I transgress.  What I want to say is that I would not object to the Vote for that establishment if certain objects that I can think of as desirable were, in fact, being attained by having that establishment.  One of those objects would be what I might call <i>liaison</i> with the various parts of the Commonwealth.  I have always doubted whether it was a wise policy for us to have an Irishman as Governor-General.  I am quite sure that it would not be a wise policy to have an Englishman as Governor-General for obvious reasons, because of the reactions that it would provoke <Col N="796" /> among portions of our population.  It does seem to me, however, that it would be a good plan if, say, a French-Canadian or an Irish-Australian or a South African were Governor-General here, and if that sort of interchange were the general practice throughout the Commonwealth, in order that cordiality of relationship might be furthered by having Governor-Generals from various parts of the Commonwealth operating in that way. Secondly, if the Governor-General's establishment were a sort of centre of culture, if it was a focus for the culture of the country generally, if it was a place where people were brought together who had intellectual interests, and if it helped to further education, the spread of knowledge and culture in this country, I would consider that desirable.  If, again, the Governor-General's establishment was a place where members of political Parties were brought into friendly relation with each other, where an effort was made to appease political passions&mdash;the King serves such a purpose in England, for instance, as between various political Parties&mdash;if there was an establishment of an official kind in this country where those opposed to each other in politics would meet normally and inevitably on a friendly basis I think that that would be a very great gain to the political life of this country.  Finally, as a matter of interesting the more uneducated of the population in the State, of attaching them to the State, exciting their enthusiasm about the maintenance of ordered and dignified conditions, if there was a certain display of ceremonial that appeals to the mind of the people, I would think that that was a desirable thing that would justify the expenditure of such sums of money as are proposed in this Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But, things being as they are, I come back to the position that the money we are asked to vote in this Estimate is going to serve no useful purpose.  It is a sheer imposition on the taxpayer for which he gets no return.  I cannot imagine what the object of it is, even from the point of view of members of the Party opposite, seeing that a very <Col N="797" /> adequate salary has been provided for the Governor-General out of the Central Fund.</P>

      <P>That being so, this debate on the Governor-General's Estimate is going to be confined within a very narrow margin indeed and there will be very little to say from any part of the House.  I had hopes that I would be able to make use of this occasion as I did last year, but your ruling, Sir, will always be treated with the greatest respect by us on this side of the House, and I presume by every member.  In the meantime, I suggest that the way to eliminate this Estimate from future discussions in this House and to prevent it from being introduced again this time next year is for the President boldly and manfully to abolish the office of Governor-General.</P>

      <P>By the Constitution, or by the law of this country, there is a Governor-General who is head of the State and who has a salary of £10,000 per year.  Year after year there was an Estimate for the Governor-General's establishment presented here which was very severely criticised, not only here, but all over the country.  We had the sort of remark that Deputy Cooney threw out a while ago about pomp and all the rest of it.  To my mind, it is necessary, or at least desirable, in every State that there should be a head of the State who is somewhat detached from the political Parties, from the political turmoils of the State, to whom is attached what Deputy Cooney would call a certain amount of pomp, what Deputy MacDermot calls ceremonial and what I would call a certain amount of symbolism.  As the situation was, the <Col N="798" /> £10,000 a year and the other payments were made and, except those people who dishonestly wish to misrepresent the situation, one knew exactly what the purpose was and one knew also that that purpose was fulfilled.  It is a tact that the present Governor-General is drawing more money for himself than the late Governor-General.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not mention salary; I said more money for himself. The part of this Vote that I have in mind is the allowance to the Governor-General for expenses.  Previously there was also an allowance for expenses.  The allowance for expenses has in mind expenses which necessarily flow and arise from the fulfilment of the office.  I maintain that, under the previous régime, it was demonstrable that certain expenses necessarily flowed from the performance of the office.  As a matter of fact, the Revenue Commissioners considered the salary and, going into the accounts, realised that £6,000 of the salary went in expenses arising out of the office, leaving only £4,000.  I think it was last year the President informed us that, whereas previously £10,000 was paid, now only £2,000 is paid.  That £2,000 in some very complicated fashion&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very sorry, Sir. I merely want to point out that, if you take this allowance to the Governor-General for expenses, I think that even the President would not deny, but will rather glory in the fact that the arrangement he has made precludes the Governor-General from having expenses in relation to his office.  I have no doubt everyone of us in our private lives may give tea parties for our families or something like that, but I understand that the allowance for the Governor-General cannot include a tea party in relation to his office because he is not permitted to do such a thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="799" /> I do not want to transgress, but I would have liked to point out that if we take the £1,200 and add to it £2,000 we get £3,200.  The late Governor-General was assessed for income tax on £4,000 and the income tax amounted to £1,006, leaving less than £3,000. Here we have the case of a Governor-General who has no expenses whatever. I understand a house is provided for him.  We have salaries, wages and allowances of a household staff and an allowance for expenses, all coming to £1,821.  We have this sum of £1,821 plus some salary which is not here, plus travelling expenses and a motor car.  Normally we recognise that anybody who becomes a Deputy has certain expenses that he would not have in private life.  If a person becomes a Minister he has still more expenses than he would have as an ordinary Deputy.  If he becomes the President one recognises it is quite conceivable under ordinary circumstances that he would have more expenses than a Minister.  The Governor-General, as conceived by the Constitution, would rightly and necessarily and properly have more expenses than any of the categories I have mentioned.  But in the last year or so a complete change has taken place and the Governor-General draws whatever he does draw for the purpose of doing nothing in relation to his office except sign Bills. Consequently, he has no expenses whatsoever.  I defy any member of the Party opposite to indicate any expense that he has by virtue of his office that he would not have as an ordinary private person.</P>
    <P>What is the purpose of all these payments here?  He gets £1,200 for expenses independent of money that comes under the Central Fund.  He has £621 for salaries, wages and allowances of the household staff. What is it all for?  Originally it was recognised here, as is done in every civilised country and as is recognised by all civilised people as necessary&mdash; of course, it is recognised as undesirable by Deputy Cooney&mdash;that there must be a certain dignity, a certain symbolism in relation to holders of such a high public office; but here the <Col N="800" /> whole policy of the Government is rather to degrade this office.  The only argument I ever heard for degrading the symbolic figure in this State&mdash;and that is, to my mind, a form of sedition&mdash;is the saving of money.  Now, we come here and we are asked in this impoverished and certainly overtaxed country to impose taxation on our people to hand over to a person who only nominally holds an office which was intended by the fundamental law of this country to be conducted in a certain way.</P>
    <P>The Government, in defiance of the Constitution and in defiance of the loyalty and obedience of those who are anxious to defend the State from any attempts to degrade and defame it, asks us in effect to vote money out of the people's pockets as a sort of compensation for indignity.  Heretofore the Governor-General's Vote was regarded as a necessary payment for dignity.  We are now asked by the Government to tax the people for indignity.  It is a scandal that we should be asked to spend these moneys in this way.  What is achieved by it?  The President will say that he would like to get rid of the Governor-General's office, but in view of the Treaty and the Constitution he is not able to do it.  What is he doing but actually trying to get behind the Constitution, to reverse the Constitution and to make what the Constitution intended to be dignity, nothing but indignity?  It is absolutely scandalous. When the Governor-General had a very important function in this State &mdash;of course, Deputy Cooney would not understand its importance&mdash;he was actually paid less than the present holder draws.</P>
    <P>We are asked to increase the emoluments of the Governor-General. Why?  What purpose is served?  Suppose none of the money was voted; suppose the Dáil, facing up to its responsibilities as custodian of the people's purse, refuses to pay any penny on this Vote, could the President say that the refusal to pay that money interfered with the fulfilment of a necessary function, a function which he himself would rather was not fulfilled, but which is made necessary <Col N="801" /> by reason of the Constitution?  If not one penny is voted, still much more money will be spent upon this office than should be spent in view of the condition in which the office is now. That, to my mind, is completely unarguable.  There is no work, no function, no dignity attaching to this office.  There is no need whatsoever to pay any money at all.  We are already paying ten or twenty times as much as should be paid out of the Central Fund.  The President asks us to give another £2,246 on top of the money that we are already pitching into the gutter.  One can argue whether there should or should not be such an office.</P>

      <P>It was a sort of rhetorical remark of mine.  I cannot see how any justification can be put forward for this payment.  These moneys are not necessary to dignity or to the fulfilment of any function. They are purely gratuitous payments which the President may possibly be paying in order to salve his own conscience for degrading a human being into a position which it is almost unfit for any human being to occupy.</P>

      <P>All I want to point out to the House and to the country is that in voting this £2,246 it would be just as well to pitch that money into the gutter.  It is a crime against the Irish people to bring this Vote in here.  Not one State function, not one additional attribute of dignity will be removed by the complete refusal of the House to pay the money.  There is no need for it.  It is a gratuitous payment out of the pockets of the Irish people into some fund or to some person.  It is purely a personal matter for the President.  If that money requires to be paid I suggest that the President ought to pay it out of his personal pocket instead of having it come from the public purse.</P>

      <P>I should like to add my protest also against the amount of this Vote.  As Deputy Fitzgerald pointed out, this Vote originally was intended to provide for an establishment on a much more pretentious scale, to say the least of it, than that on which it is now carried on and, to those of us on this side of the House at least, it certainly appears that the amount of the Vote here is not necessary for the establishment as it exists at present. When one is presented with a Vote like this for the establishment of such a person, one has to envisage that there is such an office as that of the Governor-General.  As far as any ostensible evidence of the actual existence of the holder of this particular position is concerned, there is none apparent to the ordinary citizen. I, personally, as a Deputy, am not aware that the Governor-General&mdash;I will not say exists; I know that he is a very respectable man and I hope he exists&mdash;but as far as I personally am concerned, I have no evidence that he is in the country or that he has been in the country for a long time.  The majority of citizens have hardly any evidence of his existence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we are presented with a bill of £2,246 for the establishment of a certain officer of this State, we do envisage that he is a man of importance and that his establishment is a place where one might expect to find him.  We certainly envisage him as an important person in the State.  As it happens, as I say, we do not know.  As far as I know&mdash;I only know it from hearsay&mdash;the Governor-General lives very quietly somewhere in the suburbs of Dublin.  I think it is at Monkstown, but I am not sure.  I know that he lives a very estimable and quiet life away from the people, that he has not an extravagant expenditure to meet, and that there is certainly nothing in connection with his establishment that requires a large expenditure of money.  For instance, I see here&mdash;and I say it without any bad motives&mdash;that £150 is provided for a <Col N="803" /> chaplain.  Originally, under the large establishment of the former Governor-General a chaplain was necessary, but I do not see how the present Governor-General, living quietly as he does live, and under the present circumstances, has any more need for a private chaplain than, say, the President has. In fact, I think it would be much more apt that the President should have a chaplain.  He certainly&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Well, no, I would not say that, but he certainly has a more onerous job and has a lot more to do than the Governor-General.  I could envisage, quite possibly, a period when the President, with his numerous and arduous duties, would find it difficult to attend Service on a Sunday.  It would be possible that the President, having so much to do, might need to have a clergyman at hand, but one does not at the moment see the necessity for providing a chaplain for the Governor-General.  I presume, and, as a matter of fact, I know, that the Governor-General is a very estimable and good-living man, but that does not make it any more necessary for him to have a private chaplain at the present time than for the President to have one; nor does it make it any more necessary than it would be for any Deputy of this House that he should be provided with a private secretary to perform the duties which he does now at £285 a year, which I notice is an increase of £15 over last year.  I do not say that the private secretary should not have that salary.  Then there is an allowance to the secretary of £75.  Lastly, there is a bonus of £111, and it does not say to whom the bonus goes.</P>

      <P>Yes, it might be the chaplain.  I do not know who gets the bones of the establishment, but somebody gets the bonus.  Then there is a provision of £1,200 for the maintenance of the official residence and establishment of the Governor-General.  Now, there are many residences in this State kept up unofficially at a very high <Col N="804" /> standard, which give huge entertainments, provide employment for a lot of people, buy a lot of goods from shopkeepers, and so on, and certainly their expenses would not amount to more than £1,200.  We have no evidence that the Governor-General keeps such an establishment or that it is necessary.</P>

Apart from that, however, the Governor-General must be a very busy man because I see that his bill for telegrams and telephones comes to £50.  To whom he is telegraphing or telephoning, I do not know.  I do my duty as well as any other Deputy and £50 would do me for I do not know how long for telephones and telegrams.  Does the Governor-General telephone to the President every second day to say: &ldquo;You have copped another bit of my job, and I think you should leave me at least some little nominal part of my job to enable me to hang on to some of these little perquisites here for the maintenance of my establishment?&rdquo;  I can imagine him saying to the President: &ldquo;Now, be careful.  You allowed me £2,246 last year and if you take away any more parts of my job the public will demand that you withdraw that money.&rdquo;</P>

A good many Deputies do not know whether he is there or not or whether he has been there for a long time.  I, for one, do not know and many citizens have no knowledge of when the Governor-General was there or even of what he looks like, because many citizens never saw him.  One would imagine that a person who gets so much for the maintenance of his residence would be a person that would be seen some time.  In the name of every kind of commonsense, and from the ridiculous point of view if you like, I protest against the expenditure of this particular amount of this establishment.</P>

      <P>It is extraordinary that the very brave people we have on the opposite benches would not take their courage in their hands by coming along with a proposition to negative this Vote.  It would be more definite than asking to have it referred back for reconsideration.  Why is it that those people who look for so much courage on our part are themselves <Col N="806" /> so timid?  Is it not quite obvious that this method of dealing with the Estimate is resorted to because they would not take responsibility?  They might suddenly find that the Government would agree with them, and that the money would not be provided. This Vote is introduced because by an Article of the Constitution an officer, called the Governor-General, is necessary for certain things, the signing of Bills and matters of that kind.  The Constitution provides that an officer of this sort should be provided with a salary of a like amount to that which is provided for the Governor-General of Australia, £10,000 a year.  That difficulty has been got over in our case by the officer in question returning a sum of £8,000 to the Treasury. By the Constitution we are also compelled to make provision for the upkeep of his establishment.  Now, we have, from the opposite benches, the complaint that this money is being voted for an officer who, in fact, performs no real necessary function.  We agree, and it is our determination to end that office, and to end money being provided for it with all possible speed.  It is remarkable that the very people who criticise this expenditure did not criticise an expenditure of five times the amount formerly.  Oh, of course the former occupant performed very necessary functions.  He went to occasional race meetings and things of that sort.  These were very necessary functions, and it was necessary to provide a sum of £25,000 for salary and expenses in the year before we got into office.  Since we came into office there has been a reduction of the amount by £21,430.  A further saving, which does not appear on the Estimates has been effected since the Estimates were printed, arising from the appointment of an officer of lower grade than previously as private secretary. In spite of all these savings the country is to be told that the sum provided here is too much, and that these functions which the former Governor-General exercised were so valuable to the country that it was worth paying over £25,000 for them.  The sum provided was £25,665 in 1931-32.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="807" /> I ask any Deputy, and I ask the people of the country, to judge whether the extra functions would be worth the difference between the total sum provided, of £4,000 odd, and the £25,000.  Our attitude towards the whole office is known.  We would get rid of it to-morrow if there were not certain obligations involved in the Treaty, in the first instance, and in the Constitution, in the second instance. It is our hope to end them.  We think they are ridiculous.  The very title Governor-General is obnoxious to the whole Irish people.  If people in other countries regard themselves as developing from a certain Colonial status, and if they are satisfied with Governor-Generals, as I have said previously, that is their affair.  We are not satisfied with that position.  It is our intention with all possible speed to change that, and as a preliminary to getting rid of it completely, we took the step of depriving it of as many functions as possible, leaving only those that we could not, at the moment, readily get rid of.  We got rid of certain functions, and there are Bills to get rid of others.  There is the difficulty of the immediate signing of Bills.  We think that even that can be got over, and the moment we have arranged to get rid of these functions, we can get rid of the office as a whole.  I am afraid I have been led into a speech on this debate.</P>

      <P>I called upon the President to conclude as no other <Col N="808" /> Deputy offered even after an appreciable pause.  I have made the position clear on several occasions.  Up to 1927 I know of no instance in which the Minister did not conclude on his Estimate. Since 1926, on two occasions, apart from those in which the closure was given, a Minister did not conclude. I shall consequently put the question. A question may be asked now, but there must be no further debate.</P>

      <P>In moving this Estimate I should like to take the opportunity to announce that it is intended that the rate of interest on all issues from the Local Loans Fund made on, or after, the 1st October, 1934, will be at the rate of 4¾ per cent.  That is, 1 per cent. lower than the rate hitherto charged, and three-quarters per cent. lower than the preferential rates on such services as Gaeltacht Housing, land improvement and drainage work.  The benefit of the reduction in interest rate will extend to all issues made on, and after, the 1st October next, regardless of whether the loan was sanctioned before or after that date.  It is not proposed, in future, that there should be any differential rate on the rates of interest charged on loans.  The rate of 4¼ per cent. will be of general application.</P>

Apart from that, moneys have been raised by means of Exchequer Bills, at times, at a low rate of interest&mdash;at a fraction over 2 per cent.  Can the Minister justify making money upon this transaction?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows as well as I do that there is no money to be made in a transaction of this sort because of the administration involved. In the matter of fixing the rate of interest, we have to take the long view.  We cannot vary the rates of interest up and down according as the market may fluctuate.  Having taken everything into consideration, I think 4¼ per cent. represents very favourable terms to the local authorities.  It is not our desire to encourage local authorities to come to the Local Loans Fund.  We would prefer they should raise the money elsewhere if they can get it on more favourable terms.  But the persons who come to us cannot raise money at less than 4¾ per cent. We have, as I said, to take the long view, and in the long view, it is not desirable that the rate of interest should fluctuate up and down.  The local authorities should feel that the rate we are fixing will remain for a considerable period and accordingly we fixed it with that object in mind. I do not think the Deputy is really serious when he asks that in fixing our rate we should have regard to the rate on which the Government has been able to raise short-term loans. <Col N="815" /> It would, I think, be one of the deadly sins to borrow short and lend long. That is what the Deputy suggests we should do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us understand each other.  This money was borrowed by the State at a shade over 3½ per cent.  The State is now charging the local authorities engaged in building houses and making sewerage and water works 1¼ per cent. over that rate.  When I mentioned that the Minister was in a position to borrow on Exchequer Bills at a low rate of interest, a fraction over 2 per cent., I wanted to emphasise that over a period&mdash;since the Minister took up office, if you like&mdash;the rate of interest has been much below what he now proposes to charge local authorities. Taking the long or the short view, one has no right to forestall in this matter. Last night we heard condemnation of business people who, with a certain amount of foresight, purchased goods. The Minister thought they were committing a grievous wrong by escaping certain taxation.  If the Minister looks up the authorities of the Catholic Church in connection with interest charges, he will find that the usurer comes in for very strong condemnation. Taking the long or the short view, it is now possible to borrow money at a fraction over 3½ per cent. A rate of 3¾ per cent. would be a rather elaborate or extravagant estimate of the price which should be paid. The Minister is charging 1 per cent. over that.  What are the costs that might be charged against the sending out of this money?  Is there provision for loss?  Is that what the 1 per cent. extra is charged for?  Surely it is not going to be argued by the Minister that the clerical charges in connection with the advancing of this sum of money will amount to 1 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Notwithstanding all the subsidies, grants and allowances made to local authorities in connection with house-building, the rents being charged for these houses are beyond the capacity of the people.  The report which was issued a short time ago by the Commission set up by the Ministry to <Col N="816" /> inquire into the feasibility of selling labourers' cottages disclosed one outstanding fact.  The rent charged is 1/2.  The contributions from the rates amount to 1/3½; State subventions about 8d.  These cottages were built within the last 30 years and the last of them was built about ten years ago. The price of building was then much lower than it is now.  The interest charged then amounted to £2 1s. 7d. and principal and interest were repayable by an annuity spread over 68½ years.  Is it put forward as a constructive proposition that, having regard to the high cost of building, local authorities can show any sort of proper balance-sheet while paying 4¾ per cent.?  I am prepared to admit at once that the advancing of this money does cost something, but ½ per cent. would be perhaps an extravagant charge in the circumstances.  I do not think that, even when money was costing over 5 per cent., the rate charged to local authorities exceeded 5¾ per cent.  In this case, the Minister is charging 4¾ per cent., taking, as he says, the long view.  During the last two years he has raised money on Exechequer bills at something over 2 per cent.  He raised £6,000,000 of a National Loan at a shade over 3½ per cent.  In these circumstances, to justify the charge to local authorities of 4¾ per cent. requires some greater explanation than a reference to the long view.  If, in a year or two or three years another National Loan has to be floated at a higher rate of interest it will be time enough to charge the extra price.  On the 1st April the sum of money in the Treasury amounted to about £5,000,000 and the Minister told us that there was some money in the Local Loans Fund, which cost him not a penny in interest. He got in 1932-33 £550,000 and in 1933-34 £550,000 from the taxpayers, levied in taxation, on which no interest has been paid by him.  That is to be lent now to local authorities at 4¾ per cent.  They are to be taxed first to get £1,100,000.  Having done that, the Minister says that the local authorities, which are struggling against the high cost of building, are to be charged 4¾ per cent.

      <P>I should like to know if this proposal will affect people who obtain loans under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act.  They borrow at the rate of about 6 per cent. and repay in about 35 years.  I should like to know whether the repayment period of 35 years will continue or not.  At the new rate of interest, these houses are entirely beyond the reach of the people.  They borrow nine-tenths of the value of the house and repay the local authority over a period of 35 years.  Many of these houses are beyond the reach of the average person.  The repayment amounts to about 2/7 per week per £100 borrowed. On top of that, you have the rates. They only get relief of two-thirds the rates for a period of seven years. Under the old Housing Acts, the relief extended over a period of 20 years.  In the first year, only one-twentieth of the rates was paid.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Cosgrave that the cost of building has gone up.  It has gone up very much owing to the tariffs.  There is a tariff on practically every article used in building, even ordinary flooring boards, so that there is a big increase in the cost of building. That is one reason why private persons and local authorities are not taking the advantage that they should of the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act.  We had the Minister for Local Government and other Ministers going up and down the country recently saying that the local authorities were holding up housing.  The local authorities are anxious to build and are anxious to give money for building but they are not able to advance the money at a rate of interest which will enable the people to build.  In the country, after allowing for the cost of site and of building, the charge under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act in respect of an ordinary £550 house works out at about 15/- per week.  There are very few, particularly in rural districts, who are able to pay that rent.  I would like to know whether the 35 years' repayment stands.</P>

      <P>The Minister has told us that after the 1st of October he is going to reduce the rate of interest, but as to what Government subsidy he is going to give local authorities in respect of housing he said that he was not committing himself in any way as regards that.  I would like to ask the Minister if the local authorities are going to be put into the position between this and October that they will not know how they will stand with regard to Government assistance towards housing after October.  What is the reason for his announcement here to-night that he proposes to reduce the rate of interest on local loans from the 1st October next?  In my opinion it will simply create a considerable amount of confusion in the minds of local authorities as regards housing, and as regards a lot of other people it will create a position that may lead to a cessation of work in many directions between this and October.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister say what is the necessity for this big amount to be voted for the secret service?  As has already been pointed out, the actual expenditure on secret service over a number of years has hardly been more than £2,000 a year. The House is now asked to vote a sum of £25,000.  Would the Minister say how much of that money has been spent out of the Vote up to date?  This Vote is an index of the whole line of policy that is being pursued by the present Administration.  They have created such a state of affairs in the country that they are forced to organise a new kind of secret service, to extend its ramifications in the form of spying into all kinds of organisations and in all kinds of directions.</P>

      <P>And the Minister as a student of history is also familiar with it.  The Minister for Justice is brazen enough about this on occasions. He was telling about one particular organisation in the country, and on last Sunday or the Sunday before he said that there was not a thing that happened in the organisation that he did not know inside 24 hours; that, of course, he was not taking action on everything he heard, but that he had his finger well on the spot.  The Minister and the Government are anxious to develop spying, as it were, in every direction, and they are prepared to leave nothing undone to develop that particular type of thing in the country.  I am sure that they are not getting much value for their money, but I think it is a terrible reflection on the type of Administration that is being carried on at the present moment when we have to have this particular type of Vote.</P>

      <P>This is a Vote for Secret Service and the money is being spent to get information of a certain type.  We know one of the objects for which the money will be spent is to get information on the various organisations through the country.  Here we have an organisation and efforts are made to get information in connection with that organisation and I suggest that nothing could be more relevant, when we see the attempts that are made to get that information, than an argument, which is debatable, whether we agree or not, as to whether this money should be used for that particular purpose.</P>

      <P>I cannot prove that a single halfpenny was paid from this Vote and on your ruling, as far as I understand it now, we cannot discuss any matter in which we cannot prove that money passed.  I do not know whether I would be in order in referring to the statement made by the Minister for Justice on Sunday week last that there was not a single thing which passed at a meeting of the I.R.A. that he did not know in 24 hours.  I am perfectly clear that that is a matter for the Secret Service and Secret Service money, but I could not prove it.  I do not know what kind of discussion can be carried on on this Estimate when the Minister for Justice <Col N="831" /> is performing in the way he is performing. The agents and employees in other directions of the members of the Government are also soliciting information from other people outside and offering bribes for information against an organisation politically opposed to the Government.  Men are taken in difficult circumstances and bribed definitely or have bribes dangled before their minds.  They are asked as members of the League of Youth to make some kind of a case that this organisation opposed to the Government is an armed organisation.  I cannot prove that a single halfpenny is passing for that particular class of transaction, but the transactions are widespread, and some of them, as I have already said, have been sworn to in testimony.  I think it a grotesque business, Sir, to be asked to discuss a Vote of this kind and not be able to make use of a document which is sworn to and which contains definite evidence that agents acting for the Government are seeking&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This Vote shows a very large increase on last year's Vote. I submit that the reason for that increase should be given.  I would like some information as to how it is proposed to spend this money and in what particular direction.  Some years ago, information was given to the Dáil that this money was not to be used for political purposes.  I would like now that some statement to that effect should be made on this Vote.  What is the reason for such a large increase &mdash;is it to deal with ordinary crime or is it to deal with political matters, and, if so, under what headings do those political matters come?  Some information should be given as to the way the money is being spent, whether it is being spent to find out what are the activities of the political opponents of the Government.  In that connection, I would draw the line if the Minister would discern between those who are suspected of being armed for the overthrow of the State&mdash;those whose object is to be achieved by bringing about a change of Government by force of arms&mdash;and those whose objects are constitutional. Certainly the House is entitled to know why there is this increase from £10,000 to £25,000.  I am speaking from recollection when I say that last year something like £3,000 was spent and now we have a sum of £25,000 asked for.  There ought to be some explanation of the increase.</P>

If you make any comparison with the Votes in previous years you will notice that this Vote has been increased two and a half times.  It is singular in that respect.  I suggest that there should have been a full explanation as to the reason for this increase.  In the absence of that information we can only speculate as to what precisely was the purpose of the increase in the Secret Service Vote from £10,000 to £25,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What has it led to?  We do not know how the money is being spent; we only see this sudden increase.  I presume, as there is no check on the details of it, that it is being spent to get information. <Col N="833" /> Supposing the information is being got, what is it being used for?  For the prevention of crime or for the punishment of crime?  Which?  Is there any evidence in the conduct of the Government that it is being used for one or the other?  I hope the Minister for Justice will not follow the fashion of practically every member of the Government in denying the report of his speech in the papers.  It is becoming almost epidemic with them. It is quite obvious that, taking the Minister as being reported&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Is this money being used for the detection or prevention of crime?  We have the statement of the Minister for Justice less than a couple of weeks ago that he knows every move made by a certain Party who openly profess that they are out for the armed overthrow of the Government of this country when the opportunity is ripe, but that he is not using that information against them.  He is a nice, quiet, mild man.  He is their friend but, &ldquo;God help them if other people get into office; as long as I am here you are all right.&rdquo;  Is the money being used, therefore, for the prevention of crime in the sense of getting information about crimes that are in danger of committal?  Is the money being used for the punishment of crime? What is the money being used for?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had various instances of extraordinary action and inaction on the part of the Government where crime is concerned.  Is the increase of this Vote from £10,000 to £25,000 helping that in any way?  They confess that where a certain organisation is concerned they know every move of it. If that is so, I suggest that for the mere getting of the information they have employed the money well.  But their purely academic interest in the matter is what amazes me and should amaze the House.  Having got the <Col N="835" /> information we gather that it is not going to be used.  I wonder if there is going to be a slowing down of the process where the members of that organisation are concerned, now that we know perfectly well all those terrible things which they are doing and plotting?  Is that the idea?  The money is not being used as far as we can see in a proper manner for the prevention of crime or for dealing with crime afterwards.  I wonder whether any of this money went to the celebrated&mdash;I presume he was in existence; I am not doubting that; I do not therefore call him fictitious&mdash; man who gave the information about Deputy Mulcahy.</P>

      <P>I am only using it as an illustration&mdash;I am not going to discuss the details of the matter, because I do not think it is necessary.  If that is the type of information for which the Government are paying money, I hold that this Vote ought not to be passed.  I suggest, so far as the information which the Government put before the public is concerned, that that information, where it has been put before the public in recent times, is not such as to allay the anxiety in the mind of the public as to how secret service and allied methods of dealing with political opponents are being used by the Government.  There is a feeling of nausea, so far as the great bulk of the people is concerned, with the conduct of the Government in these particular matters.  When we see the use that they are ready to make of an <i>agent provocateur</i> it is a very dangerous thing to increase this Vote from £10,000 to £25,000.  They have not shown any desire to avoid some of the worst abuses of a tyrannical Government in the use of an <i>agent provocateur.</i>  That being so, the money, of which they are being given complete control, and in regard to which they have tried to burke discussion in this House, should not be voted them too readily.  The House should be extremely slow to pass the Vote, and Deputies would be lacking in their duty to the country if, without very careful examination, in so far as examination is possible, seeing there is no voucher for this, this Vote were passed.  There is every reason, I suggest, why the whole thing should be fully ventilated.  I submit it will be impossible to close the discussion until we have had a rather exhaustive statement from some Minister.  It was the duty of the Minister for Finance to explain the increase in this Vote, but he has not done so.  I <Col N="837" /> suggest a proper discussion can only begin after the Minister has made that statement.</P>

      <P>I am also curious to know how this money is being spent.  I suppose the only way to approach the matter is by the process of elimination.  The first question that arises is, are they using this money to prevent naval secrets being stolen?  Are there numbers of foreign spies seeking information about our naval secrets, the construction of our guns, and the type of ammunition our navy uses?  I understand the only vessel we have is the &ldquo;Muirchu.&rdquo; Somebody said she had no gun and someone else said she had one gun. Is the money being spent to protect the secrets of the Army, the construction of our new guns, the types of new ammunition for those guns, or the character of the poison gas shells that are being made here for our Army?  Does the technical school where our laboratories are require protection? The Civic Guards are paid under another Vote.  I hope that none of this money goes to the Civic Guards in the nature of extra pay for the purpose of taking them away from the services for which they were normally engaged.  This House votes money to pay the Civic Guards full wages for their duties as policemen. We have a navy with one vessel and no gun.  We have an Army that is paid out of the Army Vote.  I understand the guns and ammunition are purchased abroad and we may take it any secrets in connection with them are well known to persons outside this country, possibly better known to them than to people here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What do they expend the £25,000 on except the collection of political information?  And what is the political information for?  Is the money spent in collecting information about a branch of this Party, what is being done by that branch, and what it is going to do?  The Minister for Justice, speaking in Connaught the other day, said that in 24 hours he knew all about the I.R.A. and what they proposed doing.  I do not know whether he is paying for that information <Col N="838" /> or whether it is given voluntarily. Perhaps he is acting as the friend and protector of the I.R.A. by telling them that.  He tells them freely, without any reward, that if he goes out of office, within 24 hours they will be abolished.  I wonder is the I.R.A. paying the Minister for giving them this information?  Yesterday his Eminence Cardinal MacRory, speaking at Maynooth, said that were it not for political trouble in this country we would be the most peaceful people in the world.  The general belief is that the £25,000 are being spent getting information of some kind or another about the political opponents of the Government.</P>
    <P>I know perfectly well that none of the Ministers will say to any individual: &ldquo;I will give you £100 if you get me a certain piece of information.&rdquo; What the members of the House are really doing by voting this money is offering money to any man who desires to degrade himself by giving information, true or false.  It is just the same as saying: &ldquo;Here are £25,000 voted by this House.  Do you want any of it?&rdquo;  This money is being voted by the representatives of the country who are ostensibly here to protect the interests of the taxpayers.  We are voting money to encourage people to degrade themselves by acting as spies.  When you carry out a process of elimination the only issue left is this: &ldquo;Get political information.&rdquo; Cardinal MacRory's advice yesterday was to eliminate politics.</P>

      <P>His Eminence said that if we eliminate politics we will be the most peaceful people in the world. There can be no doubt the £25,000 are being spent on collecting some political information.  Is it wise for the House to vote this sum in order further to embitter feelings in the country?  If the £25,000 are to be expended for the purpose of getting people to give information so as to create trouble, I submit the House should reject the Vote.  If they desire peace and happiness for the country, Deputies should definitely vote for its rejection.</P>

      <P>Dean Swift once referred to certain respectable persons who, when they were made bishops, lost their original virtue while making a journey across a certain famous heath and arrived in Ireland as highway robbers and desperadoes. In the discussion on this Vote we have seen the spectacle of men of experience who were in office for ten years leaving behind them their own disreputable past and passing into Opposition to assume there the robes of primeval innocence.  One would think, to hear Deputy O'Sullivan speaking on this Vote, that he had not at one time or another dipped his hand into the Secret Service pot, that there had never been before the Dáil a proposal to provide a certain sum for secret service.  In 1922-23, Deputy O'Sullivan and the Government which he then supported approved an Estimate for £220,000 and that was submitted to the Dáil.  In 1923-24 there was an Estimate for £50,000; in 1924-25 for £35,000; in 1925-26 for £20,000.  In 1926-27 there was an Estimate for £14,000, and since that date, and up to this year, the Estimate has been for £10,000, for the purposes which are set out fully on the face of the Estimate, for the purposes of the Secret Service.</P>

      <P>Thanks.  I was saying that the gentlemen over there had assumed the garb of primeval innocence.  It ill befits them.  There is many a dark episode in the history of this State which, possibly, would not have happened if it had not been for the manner in which secret service money was employed under former Administrations.  I am not going to enter into that.  We have heard <i>agents provocateur.</i> mentioned in this debate.  Is the memory of the Deputies so short that they do not remember the end of 1931, when a man was murdered here?  I am not justifying that murder.  I think that it was a dastardly thing, and that it should bring down vengeance on those who did it; but the action of the men who committed that murder was no more dastardly than the action of those who sent that poor agent of theirs into the circumstances in which he lost his life, and who paid him for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I call your attention, Sir, to <Col N="843" /> the fact that Deputy Mulcahy is not only brandishing a document, but showing by his action that such a thing exists?  The Deputy is referring to the fact that, possibly, some secret service money may have been paid to a person who was responsible for conveying false information to us.
