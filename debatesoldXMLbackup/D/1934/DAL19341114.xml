    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>The extension to rural districts of the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act has in some counties resulted in practical difficulties as to the security for advances, as the councils have been advised that the security must be that which first mortagees could ordinarily accept.  This involves, in many cases, not only the Irish Land Commission as regards annuities, but various other parties to the charges on the holdings. We have been concerned to devise some system which, on the one hand, will secure advances to councils, and, on the other hand, will not involve the applicant in great legal expenses.  The matter is very complicated, and discussions have taken place with the Agricultural Credit Corporation, the Irish Land Commission and the Registrar of Titles.  I have been impressed with the need for providing a solution, and no time has been lost.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that local bodies have refused to grant such loans, as the farmers are unable to give the security required, and that that is holding up building schemes in many rural areas? Would the Local Government Department guarantee such local bodies that a Bill will be introduced and made retrospective in regard to advances of money so made?</P>

      <P>Provisions which are contained in the Courts of Justice Bill, 1934, which was recently introduced in the House, will, it is believed, have the effect of expediting the hearing and determination of Circuit Court appeals. I take this opportunity of expressing my regret to Deputies that the text of this Bill has not yet been circulated. The drafting of the measure was completed some time ago, but at the last moment certain proposals were put forward which were considered worthy of acceptance and it was thought better to have them incorporated in the Bill now rather than have them introduced as amendments at a later stage.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state the total number of bus companies operating in the City of Dublin which have been acquired by the Dublin United Tramways Co. up to the 31st October, 1934; the total number of persons employed by these companies at the time of acquisition; the total number of these employees who have found employment in the Dublin United Tramways Company; the total number of such employees who have found alternative employment through the labour exchanges; and the total number of such redundant employees who have not yet been able to find alternative employment; and if he will say what steps his Department is taking to assist those persons to get suitable employment.</P>

      <P>The total number of omnibus companies acquired by the Dublin United Tramways Company up to the 31st October, 1934, was 23.  The total number of persons employed by these companies at the time of acquisition was, I understand, 705, of whom 598 have found employment with the Dublin United Tramways Company.</P>
      <P>Of the remaining 107 I have no information as to the extent to which alternative employment has been found by these persons, but I am informed that 27 did not seek employment with the Tramways Company.</P>
      <P>Of the 80 persons not employed by the Dublin United Tramways Company, eight were rejected on grounds of age; three were young boys, and 29 who had been employed for only a few weeks prior to acquisition were placed on the panels for consideration as vacancies arise.  Twenty-six persons were rejected on medical grounds, and the balance of 14 persons were rejected on grounds of general unsuitability.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state the number of appeals under the <Col N="21" /> Unemployment Assistance Act, 1933, now awaiting the decision of the Appeals Committee; the number of such appeals which have been lodged for more than two months; the number which have relation to the assessment of means, and the approximate date on which the appeals now pending will be disposed of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of appeals against either the refusal by an unemployment assistance officer of an application for a qualification certificate or against the determination by an unemployment assistance officer of the applicant's weekly rate of means corresponding to the annual rate calculated in accordance with the Unemployment Assistance Act, 1933, lodged at local offices of my Department up to and including the 3rd November, 1934, is 21,337.  Of these 12,142 are lodged for more than two months.  Up to and including the 9th November, 3,309 cases have been decided by the committee.  Without a full and careful examination of each appeal, which could not be carried out without causing serious delay, it is not possible to say the number of appeals which have relation to the assessment of means but, judging by the number already decided by the Unemployment Appeals Committee, it is estimated that approximately 70 per cent. of the total relate to the assessment of means.  Decisions of the Unemployment Appeals Committee constituted under the Act are final and conclusive. Having regard to the difficult nature of the questions involved, and to the fact that the decisions of the committee are final, progress is necessarily slow, and the Appeals Committee are unable to fix a time within which the appeals now pending can be disposed of.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, might I suggest to him that he should seriously consider the setting up of a number of appeals committees? It is quite clear from the number of cases on hands awaiting appeal, and the rate they are being dealt with, that it is going to be nearly nine months before some of these people can establish <Col N="22" /> their claim to benefit or their claim to an increased rate of benefit.  In view of the fact that many of these people are absolutely destitute, I suggest to the Minister that he should give immediate consideration to the question of increasing the number of appeals committees or of arranging the matter in such a way that some sub-committees should be appointed to assist the main unemployment appeals committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to support the appeal that has been made by Deputy Norton to the Minister.  You have a very large number of people in the country who are absolutely destitute. At the rate at which the appeals are being decided, it will be next May before their cases are heard.  In the meantime, these people will be left to starve.  I know for a fact that there are many families in a very bad state at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The persons concerned in this question are persons who have been determined by the unemployment assistance officers to have means which exclude them from the benefits of the Act, or to have means at a higher rate than they themselves contend.  It is, I think, to be expected that most persons who have been either refused certificates or have had means stated upon these certificates at a higher rate than they suggest, will avail of the right to appeal, because it costs them nothing to appeal and they stand to lose nothing by appealing.  It is not correct, of course, to say that persons who have received certificates and who are appealing against the means allowed&mdash; these constitute 70 per cent. of the cases according to the estimate&mdash;are denied benefit.  They are entitled to draw benefit at the rate decided by the unemployment officer until their appeal has been considered.  The consideration of these appeals is necessarily a complicated matter.  In each case questions of the interpretation of the statute and questions of fact arise, and I think it would be a very dubious procedure to take the work out of the hands of the Committee which has been engaged <Col N="23" /> upon it and which is laying down for the future administration of this Act a uniform series of decisions which will enable future cases to be decided without delay and without difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot understand the nature of the Minister's reply.  I can only ascribe it to the fact that the Minister has no practical experience of these cases, and that he has not made himself familiar with the operation of the Act affecting these people.  The Minister says that some of these people have been informed, in the first instance, that they have means greater than the amount of benefit allowed to them under the Act.  I think that if he consults his officials they will tell him, without the slightest compunction, that the original valuation of means was based upon a most fantastic figure. I can tell the Minister from my own experience&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy, I presume, rose to ask the Minister a supplementary question and not to impart information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I necessarily had to make that preamble.  If the Minister makes inquiries he will find that the information he has conveyed to the House is completely at variance with that of Deputies.  Is the Minister aware of the fact that these people who have been refused unemployment assistance, in the first instance, have been refused it because of the fantastic valuation of means?  Now the Minister proposes nine months delay to these people as his offer of a settlement.  I would again press him to reconsider the matter and set up further appeals committees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that there are cases in which a man and his wife, living in a labourer's cottage, have no means whatever except their cottage and the plot attached to it?  The husband may have been working on the roads for a considerable period, and then got knocked off.  Such a man may have been out of employment for the last nine months. There are many in that position who have a family of five to support.  The <Col N="24" /> Minister has now stated definitely that a man in that position will not get unemployment assistance, because it is held that he has some flowers or some produce from his plot to sell and make money of.  That, of course, is not correct, but because it is held that the man is in that position he is refused benefit.  The information supplied about that person is altogether incorrect. The Minister says that such a man can appeal.  But he must wait another nine months until his appeal is heard, and how is he going to support his wife and family of five in the meantime?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, would he inform the House whether there are not several tribunals operating under the Unemployment Insurance Acts?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is only one tribunal for the hearing of appeals under this Act?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no corresponding tribunal under the Unemployment Insurance Acts at all.  This committee deals with appeals against the decision of an unemployment assistance officer in respect of an application for a qualification certificate.  The tribunal which deals with appeals against the refusal of assistance is a different body altogether.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Bearing in mind what the Minister has said, that he saw an objection to the setting up of several tribunals because this particular one was laying down case law for appeals in respect of unemployment assistance. I submit to him that the tribunals before which persons go who claim unemployment assistance are numerous, and yet allow themselves to be guided by one another's decision in such cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The Deputy misunderstands the position.  The local courts of referees deal with appeals against the refusal of insurance benefit, but their decision is not final.  Their decisions are subject to a further appeal to the umpire, and there is only one umpire who finally determines the law.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest to the Minister that it would speed up the work of the tribunal if, in the early stages of the administration of this Act, he would ignore any income that might be derived from a plot attached to a labourer's cottage or from a plot given by a local authority to an unemployed person to work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister's difficulty that at the present moment he is required to put before the tribunal income derived, say, from a plot given to an unemployed man to work by the Corporation of Dublin, or from a labourer's cottage plot given to a man in the country by the local public health board: that the income from these plots has to be estimated and measured before the tribunal can decide whether a man is eligible for unemployment assistance or not?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it not be worth the Minister's while to introduce and pass through all its stages in 24 hours a small Bill to relieve him of the necessity of estimating income from those plots, at any rate during the first 12 months of the operation of the scheme, particularly in view of the distress which he knows to exist in so many parts of the country?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The functions of Courts of Referees under the Unemployment Assistance Act, 1933, are to consider and make recommendations to an unemployment assistance officer on any matter referred or reported to them, under Section 20 of the Unemployment Assistance Act.  All questions arising in relation to applications for unemployment assistance may be referred to them for consideration.  This machinery would not be suitable for the determination of questions relating to the statutory conditions for the receipt of qualification certificates. Holders of qualification certificates, whose appeals are pending, may apply for and receive payment of unemployment assistance, subject to the statutory deduction in respect of means, and subject also, of course, to the fulfilment of the statutory conditions for the receipt of assistance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, might I call his attention to the fact that in many rural areas there are people holding qualification certificates, and because of the fantastic valuation put on their means they are not getting unemployment assistance benefit?  They are being refused home assistance on the grounds that they are <Col N="27" /> eligible for unemployment assistance. In view of the fact that those people have already suffered considerable hardship on account of the delay by the Appeals Committee in deciding their cases, will the Minister do something between now and Christmas to expedite decisions in those cases which are the subject of appeal?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he is aware that a woman over 70 years of age, the wife of a wage earner, is precluded from receiving an old age pension if her husband is presumed to earn wages in excess of 30/- per week; whether he is further aware that the owner of substantial property, who on attaining the age of 70 years nominally divests himself of such property immediately becomes entitled to receive an old age pension even if the greater part of the revenue derived from his former property, and irrespective of its amount, indirectly reverts to him, and whether, having regard to the inequalities of this arrangement and the hardships inflicted on wage earners and their dependants under the existing legislation, he is prepared to introduce proposals for legislation to remove the inequalities complained of.</P>

      <P>The means of a <Col N="31" /> person who is one of a married couple living together is taken to be one-half of the total means of the couple. Where the husband's means are 30/- a week (£78 per annum) the pension of the wife is 1/- a week, and where the husband's means exceed £78 10s. per annum the wife is precluded from receiving any pension.</P>
      <P>If a person has directly or indirectly deprived himself of any property in order to qualify for the receipt of an old age pension, or for the receipt of a pension at a higher rate than that to which he would otherwise be entitled, the yearly value of the property so transferred is required by law to be taken as part of his means for pension purposes.  The existing scale of rates of pension is considered sufficient, and in the conditions under which old age pensions are granted it is not clear how the inequalities to which the Deputy refers could arise.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Defence whether he will state the period of service given (a) in the Army and (b) in the Army Reserve by William Thornberry, of Waterford; (c) his character in the Army; and (d) the date upon which he would normally be due for discharge from the Reserve; and whether he will state if he is aware that Mr. Thornberry was discharged from the Reserve on the 16th July, 1934; and if he will state the reasons for such discharge.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Aiken)</NameTxt>
      <P>Mr. Thornberry had five years Army and one year 266 days Reserve service.  His character in the Army was assessed as &ldquo;Very Good.&rdquo;  He would normally have been due for discharge from the Reserve on the 23rd October, 1936.  He was discharged on the 16th July last for the reason that his services were no longer required.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister say why a man whose character was very good, and who had five years' service, was discharged from the Reserve more than two years before due to be discharged from the reserve, without being told the reason why he was being so discharged?  Is the Minister aware that it is definitely prejudicial to Army men, who can be asked to produce their Army discharge papers; that it is apparent that they were discharged from the Army at a date prior to that on which they were <Col N="34" /> due for discharge?  Is he aware that a number of men discharged in this particular way complain that their position in seeking employment is prejudiced by the fact that they were discharged from the Reserve before their time and that no explanation was given?</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely, the Minister is aware that the normal employer will read all kinds of undesirable things into that when he finds that a man has been put out of the Army Reserve two years or, at any rate, some period before the date on which he was due for discharge?</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister say whether he realises the position of men looking for employment in the country at the present time?  Will he not consider whether he is not further prejudicing those men in getting employment by discharging them from the Army without any adequate reason? Will he say, plainly, as he said on certain occasions in the House, that they were discharged from the Army for political reasons?  The employers will then know where they stand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already explained the matter to the Deputy on several occasions, and given him a return of the number of men discharged for the reason that their services were no longer required.  The Deputy will remember that only a few out of the 14,000 men in the Army were so discharged. I am not going to keep in the Army people whose services are no longer required.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister also recollect that he said generally in his statement on those persons discharged that they were discharged because they were members of a political organisation of which he did not approve, and will he say that those men who have got their discharges <Col N="35" /> before their time were discharged solely on those grounds and not for any other reasons?  It would be fairer to the men, fairer to the Minister himself, if you like, and, at any rate, the Army and the Army Reserve would know where they stand.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill stands in the name of Deputy Cosgrave and myself and proposes to amend the Land Act of 1933 by deleting therefrom Section 28, which provides &ldquo;where any person has failed to pay money due and payable by him to the Land Commission, in respect of a purchase annuity, an annual sum equivalent to a purchase annuity, an additional sum, payment in lieu of rent, interest in lieu of rent, interest on purchase money, rent of a holding, or rent payable under an agreement for the letting of a parcel of land for temporary convenience, it shall be lawful for the Land Commission, if and when the Land Commission thinks proper, to issue to the county registrar of any county in which the defaulter resides, or has a place of business, a warrant in the prescribed form.&rdquo;  It amounted to this: That where the Land Commission had such a claim as I referred to, they were entitled to issue to the county registrar of the county in which the tenant purchaser lived a warrant on which the county registrar was entitled, as though it were a judgment of the District Court or the Circuit Court, to get the sheriff to make a distraint on the property of the tenant purchaser.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The history of that section is relevant to the Bill which is at present before the House.  The principle enshrined in the Land Act, 1933, was first adumbrated before the committee sitting on the Courts of Justice Act, 1929 or 1930. When the suggestion was mooted before that committee several lawyers, justices and, I think, judges were called upon to give evidence, and these gentlemen, with unanimous voice, condemned the proposal.  As far as I am <Col N="53" /> aware, it was supported and recommended to that committee practically by Mr. E. Herlihy alone, and in recommending it Mr. Herlihy qualified his recommendation in two very remarkable and pertinent answers.  In Question 6333 Mr. Herlihy was asked if under this scheme he would have to send the sheriff to the tenant purchaser who had habitually paid his annuities in the past, but who was now apparently withholding if for some unprecedented reason, and he replied:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;No.  We would not think of doing it.  We would send no case to the sheriff in which a tenant said that he had not the money to pay now.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Further on, Mr. Herlihy was questioned by a member of the committee as to what he would do under this new system, if there was default by a tenant purchaser (Question 6372):</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Under this new system of yours, would there be any such elasticity as that?&mdash;There would, precisely the same.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The elasticity referred to was the capacity of the courts to extend the time for payment in special cases.  Mr. Herlihy replied:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There would, precisely the same. The point is that we cannot kill the goose with the golden eggs; we cannot seize the cow or sheep or horse which would constitute the means of paying the next instalment.  We have to keep that in our minds; it is a recurring debt.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>So that we recognise from the evidence given before that committee, in support of the principle enshrined in Section 28, that that principle was advocated only with the qualification that this procedure of issuing a warrant to the sheriff to make distress would not be proceeded with against persons who were unable to pay.  When this Act was before this House as a Bill many of us pointed out that if people have no tribunal before which they could go, in the certainty that they will get a fair and impartial hearing, <Col N="54" /> when they believe themselves to be labouring under a grievance, instead of adopting the constitutional and correct procedure of which they had been deprived, they will resort to the only other procedure available to them, and that is direct action.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The object with which we are introducing this Bill at the present time is to provide every citizen of this State with a constitutional and legal remedy whereby to ventilate his grievance, if he believes himself to be labouring under one.  Bear in mind that President de Valera at the present time is waging war most vigorously, with the whole resources of this State, in order to vindicate before the eyes of the world his right to go into an impartial tribunal to decide whether he is liable to pay certain moneys that are claimed against him, and the very gentleman who is prepared to wreck the whole economic structure of this country in order to vindicate that right denies exactly the same right to his own fellow-countrymen when they ask nothing more than the right to appear before an impartial tribunal, to state their grievances, to get an impartial verdict upon them and to secure, in a constitutional and peaceable and law-abiding way, redress for what they believe to be a legitimate grievance imposed on them by the Government that seeks to collect these annuities from them.  It is interesting to observe that so long as President de Valera is spending in a lavish way the entire national resources, in order to vindicate an international right which the Fianna Fáil Government claims on behalf of this country, they are patriots, lineal descendants of Caithlin Ni Houlihan, but the unfortunate farmer who makes a demonstration in order to claim his constitutional right to the protection of the courts is a saboteur, a traitor, a gentleman who is trying to tear down the State, and the very people who call him that take from him the only method he has of appealing in a constitutional and law-abiding way to <Col N="55" /> the courts, that ought to be there, to protect his interest and to ventilate his grievance if he has one.</P>
      <P>Our position is simply this: Under the Land Act of 1933, there is a statutory obligation upon every tenant purchaser in this country to pay so much of his annuity as is described in that Statute and those who are able to pay are under a statutory obligation to do so, and we think that is a bad law.  We think it is a law that ought to be repealed, but the only way to get rid of that law is to have it amended by Oireachtas Eireann. At the same time, neither Oireachtas Eireann nor any other body or power in this country has the right to place upon the citizens of the country a statutory obligation to pay something they are not able to pay and, therefore, it is absolutely essential that the person making the plea that he is physically incapacitated from complying with the letter of the Statute should have some court to go into to secure an impartial decision on the merits of his representation, so that, after that hearing, the genuineness of his plea of inability to pay will be made clear before his neighbours and before the country at large, and so that it will be open no longer to Fianna Fáil T. D.'s, to arraign before the country the man who is genuinely driven to the border of destitution and who finds himself unable, for the first time, to meet the obligations that he originally undertook in respect of his land annuity, as making a false plea and as refusing to pay something he is well able to pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is much in this Land Act of 1933 that Deputies on this side of the House would like to amend, but this Bill, which is before the House now, seeks to amend the Act in no controversial particular.  It is deliberately drafted to extend no further than the very minimum of justice's demands, in order that public peace may be effectively preserved throughout the State; it is drafted with no other purpose in view than to secure for every citizen of the State the right to go into the courts of the country and defend his interests against a neighbour <Col N="56" /> or any Government Department that may make him a defendant.  It would be wasting the time of the House to labour the principle underlying this Bill at too great length. It is manifest to any reasonable man or woman in this country that it is absolutely vital that free men should have the right to go into the court, where they labour under a sense of grievance, and it must be manifest to any responsible man or woman in this country that if you take that right from them, free men, if they are free men, must and will&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;resort to the only other means available to them to defend their constitutional rights.  If a man believes honestly and sincerely that genuine injustice is being done to him, that the Statutes of the country are being used for a purpose for which it was never intended they should be used, that the written law of the country is being used to place burdens upon him that he, literally, is physically unable to meet, that man should have two alternatives.  One is the method of anarchy, and that is to resist the law by physical force.  No responsible man in this country will advise any citizen of this State to that course. On the contrary, any person coming for advice in such a dilemma will be told by any responsible man that his duty is not to take the law into his own hands, but to go to the courts of the country and there to state his case in the certainty that he will get justice and that nothing in the nature of injustice will be inflicted upon him by the judiciary.  If, on receipt of that advice, a citizen of this State replies: &ldquo;But the Land Act of 1933 has taken from me my right to go into the court and make my case,&rdquo; what answer can be made?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is for that dilemma, it is in order to end definitely that situation, that this Bill is moved.  It is in order to put it into the mouths of all of us to say, to any man suffering under a sense of deep grievance, to any man threatened with loss of patience, who may <Col N="57" /> be urged into unconstitutional and foolish and illegal methods: &ldquo;the courts are there and you have a right to go into them; there is a constitutional method of redress available to you, and it is wrong morally and physically to resort to direct action of any kind in the vindication of your rights while there is the machinery of the courts available to you.&rdquo;  It is in order to create that situation that we move this Bill.  I urge on the Minister, with all the emphasis at my disposal, to reconsider his opposition to this Bill and to reopen the courts of the country to the people and to provide free men with the opportunity of making their case.  I urge that on the Minister, in deep anxiety, in order to preserve the peace of the country and to secure that no individual or no body of men will have any excuse or any appearance of justification for going out deliberately for the purpose of breaking the law. This is a matter in which all sides in this country could co-operate in securing justice and in the preservation of public peace; but co-operation to this end can only be secured by providing for the people the elementary right of appeal to the courts of the country for justice.  I ask for that right to be restored to our people in order that all elements in this country may co-operate in the maintenance of law and order, peace and tranquillity, throughout the State.</P>

      <P>A chinn Comhairle, we ask the House to refuse a First Reading to this Bill.  It may be pointed out, and can be pointed out, that only last year the provisions of Section 28 of the Land Act of 1933 were discussed here exhaustively from every possible angle in the course of the debates on this Bill.  On that occasion Deputy after Deputy on the Opposition side made arguments against this section, but the Oireachtas decided in favour of the section and it duly became law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We suggest that the introduction of a Bill of this kind is an abuse of the parliamentary machine.  It is obviously put forward as an excuse to raise much wider issues.  Such issues ought properly <Col N="58" /> to be brought forward, where deemed advisable, in the form of Motions rather than Bills.  There are, however, other grounds in the nature of the Bill itself.  Section 28 has been in operation for a whole year and an opportunity has been given for the Land Commission to have that examined and see what the position is and how it operates in practice.  The Land Commission are satisfied that it has saved a considerable amount of money in legal costs and alleviated a good deal of hardship that arose in that way, and that it has also saved considerable time and speeded up collection.</P>
    <P>It must be borne in mind that the powers that were taken in Section 28 were in addition to, and not in substitution for, the powers that the Land Commission had in regard to collection of annuities already.  Now, there are a few facts to which the attention of Deputies might be drawn as to the operation of this particular section. For the first gale after the enactment of Section 28 of the Land Act of 1933&mdash; that is, the November-December gale of 1933&mdash;a total sum of £1,220,000 was collectable by the Land Commission under the head of land purchase annuities&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>£1,220,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, £1,220,000 was collectable from some 452,000 payers. At the end of October last there was in arrear only £192,000 of that sum, by 47,500 defaulters.  That is to say, roughly 84 per cent. of the annuities collectable had then been collected from some 90 per cent. of the payers. The comparatively small amount that is shown there as arrears is attributed to a great extent to the operation of this Section 28.  Acting under that section, the Land Commission&mdash;having sent out their usual six-day notices and having allowed ample time for payment much in excess of the six days&mdash;issued warrants to the county registrars in respect of some 57,000 defaulters who owed £1 or upwards on the November-December gale of 1933.  As a result, over 35,000&mdash;that is over 60 per cent.&mdash; of these warrants have now been returned as collected, representing a <Col N="59" /> total sum of over £180,000, and the remainder are gradually coming in.</P>
      <P>In many counties the warrants for this gale have been practically cleared up.  For example, in County Monaghan only one warrant remains in the hands of the sheriff; in County Louth eight; in County Donegal 20; and in County Leitrim 40.  Surely the Land Commission, taking those cases as a basis, can feel satisfied with the progress that has been made in spite of all the well organised campaign of obstruction and intimidation that has been carried on to prevent the collection of these annuities, and can feel well satisfied with the speeding-up facilities that have been given to them by the operation of Section 28.</P>
      <P>As regards the May-June gale of 1934, over 57 per cent. of the total amount of the land purchase annuities collectable has been collected already from 75 per cent. of the payers.  To illustrate the contrast between the burden of costs on the defaulter under the old system and the new, an actual case may be cited where a sum of £1 19s. Od. has been recovered under the Section 28 procedure at a total cost of 5/6 to the defaulter, where the cost of civil bill proceedings would have been 15/6 if recovered by the sheriff on a decree. If you compare the saving of 10/- in a single case with the total number concerned, the economies effected by the operation of Section 28 of the 1933 Act are apparent; and this saving is all a saving, not to the State but to the defaulters themselves.</P>

      <P>Now, with regard to the Revenue Commissioners, they have the same powers that are given under this section here and we have not <Col N="60" /> heard any complaint from any of these people.  Some of the farmers, in spite of all the sales, do pay income tax, I believe, and some of the farmers, about whom Deputies opposite are so much concerned, pay income tax, and there has been no protest against these powers being given to the Revenue Commissioners for the purpose of income tax recovery.  Deputy Dillon, in speaking on the introduction of this Bill, seems to try to convey to the House that this Bill is being introduced in order to avoid or prevent certain illegal activities that, he is aware, were carried on a good deal and for quite a long time in this country before there was any protest from any responsible person on the benches opposite.</P>

      <P>It is true.  As far as we have been able to discover, no protest was made until Deputy Cosgrave made his statement&mdash;less than a month ago, I think&mdash;a statement which, certainly, was not an unequivocal demand that these activities should cease, but was rather a sort of facing-both-ways speech.  Until that, nothing that had been brought to my notice or nothing that I have seen would show me that there was anything except silent encouragement; and whenever there was anything in the way of advice, it was a hint that the people were driven to this by desperation; in other words, &ldquo;Go ahead with it, and it will probably help to get this Government out of office.&rdquo;  Deputy Dillon's point is that the people who engage in these illegal activities are the hard-pressed annuitants; the people who cannot pay; the people who are in such a desperate position that they will go out blocking roads, wrecking railways and so on&mdash;that these are all annuitants. There have been a number of cases before the Military Tribunal.  Undoubtedly, these warriors have been very apologetic, very contrite and so on.  What is the position with regard to them?  Hardly a single case has arisen where an annuitant was involved or where they went to seize stock.  We had a batch of cases the other day and the whole defence was: &ldquo;We were led <Col N="61" /> into this; we were in this organisation&rdquo;&mdash;this wonderful League of Youth &mdash;&ldquo;we were misled into doing this in our innocence; we had no grievance ourselves; we had paid our annuities.&rdquo; Another man said that he had got time to pay his annuity.  There is no use in Deputy Dillon getting excited&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I suggest that the Bill has been introduced, not to try to do what Deputy Dillon suggested in his statement, but to do the very opposite &mdash;to give encouragement to these people to keep up the fight against the payment of annuities.  That is the whole reason and the whole objective behind it.  If not, it is a smoke-screen to try and cover up the activities of the illegal bodies which had been associated with the Party opposite.  I do not want to go into any further details in this matter.  I think it is obvious to anybody that the purpose behind the Bill is not to try and help what are described as the hard-pressed farmers, but to try and strengthen and give new life, if it were possible to do it, to the ever-simmering rabble that follows behind the Party opposite.</P>

      <P>I understand the constitutional provision is that you cannot let for more than 99 years, and you cannot evade that provision by having a letting for 90 years, with a provision for renewal for, say, another 90 years.  The amendment prohibits a letting for more than 99 years, and it also prohibits a letting with a provision for renewal.  These lettings are all governed by what is in the section already, namely, that there must be the approval of the Minister and the Minister <Col N="67" /> for Finance.  Why tie that down in such a narrow way that no lease can be made with a provision for renewal at all?  Why not cut out the earlier portions relating to the approval of the Ministers?  I suggest there has been a certain amount of error in this.  I suggest what is intended is that you cannot have a letting for more than 90 years, or one with such proviso for renewal as would bring the letting beyond the 99 years period.</P>

Then you go on in the new provision: &ldquo;nor to make any such demise or letting of the fishery to which Article 11 of the Constitution applies for any period exceeding 99 years or with a provision for renewal.&rdquo;  Surely that means no letting can be made with provision for renewal.

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move amendment No. 3:&mdash;</P>
      <P>At the end of sub-section (1) to add the following words:&mdash;&ldquo;Provided that the amount of any price payable by the Board under this Act for any fishing right shall be a capital sum of such amount as will equal twenty times the average annual net certified profits of the said fishing right; for the purpose of this sub-section the average annual net profit shall be determined by taking the average annual profit over the ten years ended the 1st day of January, 1934.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The object of the amendment is to provide some definite basis on which the price to be paid for fishing rights shall be determined.  Section 14 as it stands does not, I contend, give us such a basis.  The section says that the amount of any price or compensation shall be fixed under and in accordance with the Acquisition of Land (Assessment of Compensation) Act, 1919.  The relevant section of the Acquisition of Land (Assessment of Compensation) Act, 1919, is Section 2 (2) which reads:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The value of land shall, subject as hereinafter provided, be taken to be the amount which the land if sold in the open market by a willing <Col N="69" /> seller might be expected to realise; provided always that the arbitrator shall be entitled to consider all returns and assessments of capital value for taxation made or acquiesced in by the claimant.</P>
    <P>An open market for land is one thing.  There is always, even in the worst of times, a market for land. Land is continually on the market. But I suggest there is no such thing as an open market for fishery rights.</P>
    <P>In the first place, these fishery rights are seldom, if ever, on the market.  I do not suppose they go on the market once in 25 years.  Leaving the section as it is, with the basis of purchase price, or compensation, to be assessed on the basis of what a willing seller would realise for the sale of his right in the open market, means leaving the thing a complete blank.  There is no such thing as an open market, or any market at all, for fishing rights. That does not mean that these rights are of no value.  They may be of very considerable value indeed to the proprietors. There is one group of proprietors on the Shannon, the Abbey net fishermen, who think their fishing rights so valuable that they will not agree to any basis of compensation or to any price that might be paid for those rights.  They feel so strongly about it that they have created quite an agitation down in Limerick with a view to getting this whole Bill withdrawn. And apparently they are not satisfied with that.  I presume other Deputies have also been circularised from America.  Various bodies in America, friendly to the Abbey net men, have sent circulars to me asking me to try to have the Bill withdrawn. One can, of course, admire the persistence of the Abbey men in that attitude, while we may not all agree with them.  They say that their fishing right is so valuable to them that no money will pay them for its deprivation. I do not agree.  I believe that that is a ridiculous attitude to take up but that is neither here nor there. However, I believe that these men would have a distinct grievance if the Bill were allowed to remain in its present form and if the question of <Col N="70" /> compensation or purchase price which they are to receive were left in this vague way.  They would have a grievance if this were done and so would every fishery proprietor on the Shannon.  The references to an &ldquo;open market&rdquo; and a &ldquo;willing seller&rdquo; are too vague and the proprietors are left in the dark.  I presume that there will be an arbitrator to assess compensation or purchase price in these cases in accordance with the Acquisition of Land Act.  I suggest that the arbitrator, too, will be left in the dark in assessing the value of fishery rights unless the Oireachtas gives him some direction.  The general taxpayer may also suffer through the vagueness of this term, because the arbitrator, having nothing tangible on which to work, may assess the compensation at far too high a figure.  The general taxpayer will then be mulcted.  My amendment provides something on which the arbitrator can base his assessment.  I suggest 20 years' purchase. The Minister may consider that too high.  I have no doubt that the proprietors, especially the Abbey fishermen, will consider it much too low.  I do not tie myself to the figure of 20 years.  I am open to any amendment of that figure, either up or down I think that it might be equitable to treat the Abbey fishermen in a special way.  For them, there might be a figure of 30 years' purchase, or perhaps more, of their net profit.  The other proprietors could be treated differently.</P>
    <P>The Minister may say&mdash;if he did, I should have to agree with him&mdash;that it would be impossible to arrive at an accurate estimate of the net profits of the Abbey men.  That would not be so in the case of the other fishery proprietors. In almost all cases, they would be income tax payers and would have given each year returns to the Revenue Commissioners which would include the income from the weirs, or whatever fishery rights they have on the Shannon.  The State would not be wrong in the figure which would be determined from those returns, because it may be taken for granted that nobody exaggerates one's income when <Col N="71" /> making returns to the Revenue Commissioners. It would be hard to estimate the profits of the Abbey men, but I take it that the intention of the Minister will be to mollify them. They must be treated generously.  One would not too closely scrutinise their estimate of net profit so long as it was not beyond all reason.  Having arrived at the estimate of net profit, it would remain to determine the number of years' purchase of that profit which would be equitable.  As I said at the start, these fishery rights come on the market so very seldom that it is impossible to find any recent figure by which one could compare, say, 20 years' purchase of the annual profits with the figure actually obtained on transfer by sale.  However, I have got one instance.  In one case, a group of six weirs on the Shannon was purchased in 1910 for £5,365.  I have found that a rough estimate of the annual profit on these six weirs for eight years has been about £197 or £198.  Twenty years' purchase of that profit would amount to about £4,000.  That would not be over-generous to the proprietors, who would be receiving £1,365 less than they actually paid in cash for these weirs in 1910.  Comparisons cannot be got easily because these rights come on the market only once in a blue moon.  The Minister may, on consideration, think that 20 years' purchase is too high in the case of the ordinary proprietor.  It would not be too high, or even high enough, in the case of the Abbey fishermen.  All I am seeking by this amendment is that the principle should be adopted, so that the Bill will not be enacted without the Oireachtas giving some direction to the arbitrator as to the basis on which he should arrive at his assessment. I think that the members of the Oireachtas should not allow the Bill to leave the House without fixing some definite basis on which the arbitrator can proceed to work in making his assessment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>This section is similar in principle to the corresponding section in the Shannon Act of 1925.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="72" /> In the course of the construction of the Shannon works, certain fisheries had to be acquired and the Act of 1925 made provision for compensating the owners of these fisheries on lines similar to those proposed in this section.  That consideration has, I think, a direct bearing on the Deputy's remarks, because it means that the arbitrator acting under the Acquisition of Land Act has had quite recent experience in assessing compensation for the acquisition of fisheries and, in fact, the acquisition of fisheries upon the Shannon.  It is necessary that the determination of compensation in such cases should be made by the arbitrator. The effect of the Deputy's amendment is to remove any necessity for having an arbitrator as such.  The Deputy, in fact, establishes the basis of compensation by his amendment and the only matters left for determination would be such as would concern an accountant rather than an arbitrator.  Also, I think on examination, he will perhaps come to the conclusion that the basis of the compensation he proposes is not quite a fair one.  There are a number of factors which would be taken into account by the arbitrator in determining the compensation payable in such cases.  The value of the property calculated on the willing seller and willing purchaser basis is one factor.  The absence of a common standard of value in relation to fishing rights will, of course, make it essential that the arbitrator should have regard to the particular factors the Deputy referred to, namely, the actual profits realised over a number of years.  There are other factors the arbitrator would also take into account.  One of these factors would be compensation for disturbance.</P>
    <P>The position is complicated by the fact that the acquisition value of certain of the Shannon fisheries has already been fixed by arbitration in connection with claims for compensation under the 1925 Act.  These awards would presumably have to be reopened if this amendment were passed, with possible consequential claims for compensation as well.  Also the Deputy's amendment takes no account of the provisions of sub-section <Col N="73" /> (2) of Section 14.  It is proposed under sub-section (2) that anything which was done, or occurred, in relation to property to be acquired on or after the 1st day of October, 1929, will not be taken into account.  It was on that date the operation of the Shannon works commenced, and whatever damage was done to the fisheries would have commenced after that date, and would, presumably, have affected the profits realised from these fisheries in the interval, although in certain cases the operations from the Shannon works might have increased the profits of certain fisheries.  But whether the profits were increased or decreased, I think it is a fairer basis to leave them out of account altogether and to have regard in the assessing of the amount of compensation, in any case, only to the position on the 1st October, 1929, and during the years preceding that date.  On the whole, I think it is preferable to leave the section as it stands, and to allow the arbitrator, under the Acquisition of Land Act, to determine the amount of compensation to be payable in particular cases.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the rather peculiar position of the Abbey net fishermen.  But I think we will be able to take that peculiar position into account in an amendment necessary to Section 22, the last section in the Bill. It proposes to make it unlawful for any person to fish with nets on the Shannon in future.  It is necessary to include in that section a sub-section providing for compensation to persons who are deprived from exercising that right of net-fishing and who previously exercised it lawfully.  I think it will, of course, be necessary, in the circumstances of the case, to set out the actual basis of compensation to be paid, and consequently I think the position of the Abbey net fishermen will be safeguarded in this sense, that they will be awarded fair compensation not merely for the acquisition of their property, but also for the fact that their right to fish with nets is being terminated.  There will be no safeguard in the sense that they will be allowed to continue to fish after the operations of the Shannon Fisheries Act, as they fished in the past.  The merits of the particular amendment to the section <Col N="74" /> which will be produced on Report Stage cannot, of course, be discussed by the Deputy until he has seen it. But, in so far as it is proposed to provide compensation for the termination of these rights, and to state the basis of the compensation, he will see that the position of the Abbey net fishermen, in which he is interested, is safeguarded in so far as they will get compensation for their rights as well as for the acquisition of what was owned by them.  In every case where ownership is in the hands of individuals and compensation is being made, I am satisfied with the method proposed in the Bill by leaving the matter in the hands of the arbitrator under the Acquisition of Land Act. There is at present only one arbitrator acting under this Act, and he is the person who has had experience of determining the compensation to be paid under the Fisheries Act of 1925.</P>

      <P>But for the last phrase the Minister used here I would have asked him if there was in the Bill, as introduced, any provision at all for the Abbey fishermen.  In the Bill as it stood compensation is payable under Section 4 if, and only if, injury is caused by the operation of the Shannon Scheme.  Clearly the net fishermen who are prejudiced here could not claim anything under this Bill as it stands.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposal in the Bill is that the Electricity Board shall acquire the various fishing rights along the Shannon.  In so far as the Abbey fishermen are owners they would get the acquisition price, but it is proposed, in addition, to compensate them on the termination of their rights as net fishermen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Electricity Supply Board does not necessarily injure anybody and acquisition by them would bring about the right of compensation only under Section 4 if injuries were caused by the operation of the Shannon hydro-electric scheme. But if not connected with the flow of water to the turbines for electricity purposes, then I am putting it to the Minister that it is quite clear it was not possible to compensate the Abbey <Col N="75" /> fishermen under the Bill as it stood. We proposed an amendment to bring them in.  They are only here at the moment in connection with the question of damage being done.  They are not here for the purpose of compensation being paid unless there is some connection between the acquisition by the Electricity Supply Board and immediate injury done to the fishermen. Let me put it in another way. Suppose the Electricity Board began under clause 22 of the Bill and that clause 22 was not in effect made operative by the regulation in regard to damage, then clearly the fishermen are not entitled to any compensation whatever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>But they may be entitled to compensation for damage done to their fisheries.  If Section 22 were not there the Board could not get into the position we desire it, namely, that it will control fishing on the Shannon and will have acquired from the Abbey fishermen their rights and property over the stretch they control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 22 is the one we are talking about here and it has nothing to do with the Electricity Supply Board.  It is the regulation of the Legislature.  This has nothing to do with the damage done by the Board because of the operation of the hydro-electric scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Compensation, as far as I read Section 4, is payable only if damage is done because of the operation of the hydro-electric scheme.  The Minister says he is going to tie up &mdash;I think he sees the gap as the measure stands&mdash; compensation with Section 22.  Does the Minister intend to rely in the main on the provisions of Section 14, once he does tie up the damage to the Abbey fishermen with Section 22?  If so, there is another consideration which arises.  It is quite correct to say that the arbitrator appointed under the Acquisition of Land (Assessment of Compensation) Act, 1919, has a considerable amount of recent experience and therefore should be more alive to the points in relation to compensation <Col N="76" /> to be considered in this connection than he might have been ten or fifteen years ago, but what is he tied to or how far is it open to him to take certain matters into consideration? Section 14 says that the compensation shall be fixed &ldquo;in like manner as if such compensation were the price of land compulsorily acquired.&rdquo;  That is really the gist of the terms of reference to the arbitrator.</P>
    <P>In other words, he is to consider the acquisition of the rights of the fishermen, not on the basis of a willing sale in the open market, but on the basis of a compulsory sale.  What arises for consideration on that point?  Say that land was acquired formerly for the purposes of building the canal and that a man had facilities for watering his stock and that he suddenly found that the greater portion of his land was left without these facilities, and that to get watering facilities he had to drive his cattle a long way or else had to sink some sort of well.  That was, naturally, taken into consideration. Again, the accommodation and the facilities which people formerly enjoyed for bringing milk to creameries, if they were separated by a long stretch of water from the creamery, were taken into consideration.  But was there ever taken into the consideration of the arbitrator such a thing as that which the Abbey fishermen feel they have lost?  They say they have an ancient right.  They say that they are one of the oldest guilds. They say they have made a financial sacrifice by their present position.  I do not believe the arbitrator appointed under Section 14 could ever pay the slightest attention to that.</P>
    <P>I think what he could take into consideration would be the amount of fish they caught, what was the price they secured, what were the net outgoings, what the income derived from the particular occupation of theirs was, but he certainly will be precluded, as far as I can read the section, by this whole procedure from taking into account any sentimental considerations. Of course, all these are sentimental considerations to the Limerick people.  There is the ancient position of these people.  There is a <Col N="77" /> guild system there, in the sense that there has been a trade and occupation handed down from father to son for many generations, and that particular item will not be assessed as worth a farthing unless the Minister brings into this new provision some advertence to that special point which will direct the arbitrator's attention specifically to it and unless the House gives the arbitrator leave to take that into consideration and to assess some value on it.</P>
    <P>Although the method suggested in Deputy Lynch's amendment is purely a hit-or-miss method, at any rate it raises the price.  Twenty years' purchase is something that would not be ordinarily achieved, but it is quite possible that we may find that that is not the true basis of compensation. It may not be and it should be, probably, held over until the other amendment is tabled.  I do not know whether the Minister considers the sentimental side, whether he considers that the old-time occupation of these people, transmitted down through many generations, is a thing that is worth compensating.  If he does think it is worth while compensating, I would certainly ask him whether it is possible to give compensation in relation to that matter at the moment.</P>

      <P>The debate on the amendment of Deputy Lynch, and on the projected amendment of the Minister, indicates how difficult it would be to arrive at anything like a fair basis of compensation for the Abbey fishermen, who have been so frequently mentioned in this matter. Deputy McGilligan decries immediately the question of sentimental values.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>At least, he indicated the difficulty arising out of it.  I would suggest that a lot of the difficulty would be obviated and a good deal of satisfaction would be given generally if, instead of an amendment as a preamble to Section 22 to make compensation payable to the Abbey fishermen, the Minister would delete Section 22 completely or indicate what is the reason for its being there.  It has been <Col N="78" /> pointed out by Deputy McGilligan, and it was indicated also in the Second Reading, that these fishermen are not interfering in any way with the Shannon Scheme portion of the river. They operate six miles below the head-race and above the tail-race where it enters the river again.  They are not interfering with the Shannon Scheme in any way.  Their removal from waters which they have fished for 300 years cannot be attributed to any interference with the Shannon Scheme. They are asking for no compensation whatever, and it is very difficult to see how compensation can be reasonably arrived at.  The point is that the fisheries are to be developed not on national lines, but in one particular river which happens to be incidental to a particular scheme and therefore fishing must be developed to the exclusion of fishermen.  It is rather an anomalous position that the fishery must be developed to the exclusion of the men who are dependent on the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are 50 families among the Abbey fishermen affected by this proposal. The fishermen at Castleconnell are also affected.  These 50 families consist in all of about 250 persons.  They ask for no compensation from anybody; they simply ask to be allowed to ply their calling as they have done for centuries past.  They have had constant hardships inflicted upon them since the initiation of the Shannon Scheme.  If at any time the Electricity Supply Board could be induced to do their own job directly and make good the damage they have done to the fishermen, the fishermen should certainly be entitled to reap any advantages that might come their way as a result.  I did hope that since the Second Reading of the Bill it had been made abundantly clear by all who are interested in the matter that there is a general desire for the preservation of the rights of the Abbey fishermen. As has been mentioned, even their friends in America have come to their assistance.  We always welcome assistance from them in any matter, and they have given expression to a righteous indignation at the attempt to deprive the Abbey fishermen of their <Col N="79" /> ancient livelihood.  I have yet to hear what case has been put forward to the Minister by his experts to justify the removal of these men.  I do not see any reason why he could not allow them to continue in waters where their activities do not in any way interfere with the Shannon Scheme.  If he allowed them to continue to earn their livelihood, as they have done for centuries, he would have no difficulty in settling a basis of compensation, because no matter what the arbitrator will do it will be a very serious step to deprive 250 persons of a means of livelihood which they have always enjoyed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Keyes misunderstands the position.  In any event, I am not sure that the point he raised is quite relevant to this particular section or to Deputy Lynch's amendment.  But, in order to ensure that the discussion upon this or subsequent sections will be relevant to the scheme as a whole, I think is is desirable to explain it.  This Bill has not been introduced in any way because persons fishing the waters of the Shannon have interfered with the hydro-electric scheme.  It is quite possible for the Government to take the course that the Shannon electricity scheme will proceed, and if in any way damage is done to the fisheries either by the construction or operation of that scheme, then compensation will be paid, and let the fisheries of the Shannon go any way that chance may decide&mdash; probably to disappear altogether.  This Bill has been made necessary because unless some change is made in respect of the ownership of the fishing rights on the Shannon, the Shannon fisheries are going to decrease in value.  It is, I think, within the knowledge of Deputies that in the past year or two various demands have been put forward for the execution of works on the Shannon, and for the adoption of other measures to preserve the fisheries.  The fisheries are in danger not merely of a diminution in value but of extinction unless certain steps are taken to preserve them, and the nature of the steps which we are advised are necessary are such that <Col N="80" /> they cannot be undertaken unless the ownership of all the fisheries of the Shannon is in the one hands.  In order to get the salmon to proceed up the river to the spawning beds, and in order to protect the spawning beds, it is necessary that certain works should be constructed.  These works cannot be constructed or, if constructed, would be of no value unless the fishing on a particular stretch of the river which the Abbey fishermen control, as well as on adjacent stretches of the river, is stopped altogether.  If the Abbey fishermen are to be allowed to continue to fish in that portion of the river, or if anybody is to be allowed to fish in that portion of the river, then we might as well make up our minds at once that it would be a waste of money to spend anything on the preservation of the fisheries, and that the Shannon fisheries, which are a valuable national asset, are going to disappear within a certain period of time, be it long or short.</P>
      <P>It is because the Shannon fisheries can be made a very valuable national asset if, and only if, there is uniform ownership of the fisheries over the whole river and that certain essential works are undertaken, that this Bill is introduced.  It has not been introduced because it has been found necessary for the successful operation of the Shannon scheme.  It has got nothing to do with the Shannon hydro-elecric scheme except this: that certain owners of fishery rights became entitled to compensation in consequence of damage done to those fisheries during the period when the Shannon scheme was being constructed and would also be entitled to compensation for any damage done to those fisheries through the operation of the Shannon scheme.  It appears preferable, from every point of view, that the Electricity Supply Board should be given the legal authority to buy out those fisheries rather than pay compensation for damage, particularly as in some cases the fisheries have now become of little value to their owners and that the owners will be quite willing to sell.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We could have proceeded to that extent and left it at that, but it was <Col N="81" /> felt undesirable that the possibility of taking full advantage of the Shannon fisheries should not be overlooked and that we should make a serious attempt to try to develop them for the benefit of the nation as a whole.  Having deliberated for a long time on the matter and secured all the expert advice that could be got, we came to the conclusion that it was not possible to preserve and to develop them unless the private ownership of those rights was terminated, unless the whole of the fisheries came into the hands of one authority and unless that authority carried out certain works which the experts stated were necessary.  Having come to that conclusion this Bill was introduced.</P>
    <P>The Bill establishes, first, that the authority which is to own and operate the fisheries and to construct the works is to be the Electricity Supply Board. It was decided to put the Electricity Supply Board into that position so that we would not have any rival authorities in the Shannon, and so that the one organisation could relate the interests of the electricity scheme to the interests of the fishery development. I think that was the only possible decision. This Bill is introduced to authorise the Electricity Supply Board to do all the things that I have mentioned: that is, to acquire the fisheries, to operate the fisheries and to construct the works necessary for the development of the fisheries.  Deputy McGilligan has suggested that Deputy Lynch might hold his amendment over until the amendment to Section 22 is before the Dáil on the Report Stage. I think that is a good idea.  I do not want to rush Deputy Lynch into any position.  This is not a controversial matter.  The Bill which is before the Dáil is, in a sense, as much the product of the Party opposite as it is of this Party.  I found it in an advanced stage of preparation when I came into office. I had it re-examined in detail by a Committee representative of the various interests who again advised me that, with certain alterations, the Bill which I had already found ready when I came into office still embodied the best methods of dealing with this particular problem.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="82" /> The position of the Abbey fishermen presents, of course, a particular difficulty in so far as the sympathy of Deputies is naturally with them.  It is not an easy matter to decide that they are to be interfered with in order that the whole of the Shannon fisheries may be properly developed.  If they are to be interfered with, I think they should be adequately compensated.  The purpose of any amendment which I would introduce would ensure that they did get adequate compensation, not compensation merely on the basis of the value of the property which they own, but compensation for the disturbance of their rights in the fishery which Deputy McGilligan has stated has been exercised by that particular guild for a very long period of time.  The amendment which I will bring forward on the Report Stage to Section 22 will provide a basis for the assessment of compensation for the destruction of that right as apart altogether from the assessment of the value of their property which is to be acquired by the Electricity Supply Board.  I think the matter might, perhaps, be left over until we have that before us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite prepared to leave the amendment over for Report Stage.  There is just one point that the Minister mentioned to which I would like to refer.  I think he said that the proprietors would benefit by the fact that matters like compensation for disturbance would be taken into consideration by the assessor.  I think if he looks that up between this and the Report Stage, he will find that the arbitrator is precluded from doing that under the Acquisition of Lands Act.  I have not the Act with me, but I am almost certain that sub-section (1) of Section 2 does preclude the arbitrator from taking into consideration the question of disturbance.</P>

I say that over and beyond both these things there is Section 22, which in fact&mdash; though not by any connection with the Shannon hydro-electric scheme&mdash;does interfere with a certain right to fisheries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <P>Amendment No. 3, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add at the end of sub-section (3) the words: &ldquo;Provided that where a fishing right has been operated by a person other than the owner whether under lease for a number of years or under tenancy from year to year during the five years prior to the passing of this Act, such other persons shall be entitled to such portion of the purchase price payable for the fishing right as the arbitrator shall deem equitable.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is in a different position, but if the Minister likes, I would be prepared to leave it over.  It deals with a different matter from amendment No. 3.  The object of the amendment is this: those who know the operation of those fishing weirs in the Shannon know that in a great many cases the proprietors never see those <Col N="84" /> weirs.  In the past they leased them, mostly for a number of years, to persons who worked the weirs and maintained them.  Any money that was spent on the upkeep was spent by those lessees.  They paid men for working them, and paid rent to the proprietor. Any leases that fell in during the last five or six years, or even a longer period, were not renewed by the proprietors, because some of them were clever enough to anticipate that some legislation of the type which we are considering at present would have to be enacted with regard to Shannon fisheries, and they wanted to exclude those lessees from any chance of getting compensation for their interests in the fishing right.  Any leases, then, which fell in during the last six or seven years were not renewed, but in many cases the lessees were allowed to work the fishery as before, but on a year to year tenancy.  I think that they would have an equitable right to some compensation.  The amendment does not purport to tie the arbitrators in any way.  It sets out that it is to be entirely within the discretion of the arbitrator as to what proportion of the compensation or purchase price should be paid to such tenant.  The amendment merely sets out to establish the principle that those persons have a right; that they should be entitled to put in a claim for a portion of the compensation, or purchase price as the case may be, and that such a claim should be considered.  It does not purport to go any further than that. It does not say that there should be any particular ratio&mdash;one-tenth or one-twentieth or anything else.  It leaves that entirely in the hands of the arbitrator. I think that principle should be accepted by the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The interpretation which I placed upon the Deputy's amendment when I saw it first was somewhat different to that which I now gather from his remarks.  I do not quite follow how his amendment affects the position of tenants whose leases expired during the last five years, and who have since continued on a year to year basis.  The position generally is that the Deputy's amendment, I am informed, is not <Col N="85" /> necessary.  In fact, a lessee or a tenant of the property has an interest therein. In the case of purchase he is entitled&mdash; as one of the vendors&mdash;under the Bill as it stands to a proportion of the purchase price paid, and in the case of compensation for damage, he is entitled to a proportion of the compensation. The only effect of the Deputy's amendment is to preclude from the exercise of that right the person whose lease or tenancy was less than the five years which he specifies.  In fact, any person who is a lessee or a tenant of a weir is entitled to a proportion of either the purchase price or the compensation for damage.  He is one of the vendors&mdash;one of the persons having an interest in the property&mdash;and is consequently entitled to his share of the purchase price on the one hand, or compensation for damage on the other.  It is not necessary to provide specifically for that.  It appears to me that the Deputy has some other point in mind, and that the point really is that a person who had a lease of one of those weirs for a number of years, and who might have expected a lease for another period of years if the Shannon scheme had never been constructed and this matter never arose, but who, instead of getting that lease for a number of years, got only a year to year tenancy, should be compensated on the same basis as he would be compensated if in fact he had got a lease for a number of years.  That would be a very difficult matter, and I should like to look into it before expressing an opinion.</P>

This is something on the same lines&mdash;&ldquo;lessees, and other persons interested shall sell to the Board.&rdquo;  Deputy Lynch's amendment goes on to another point.

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not clear about the meaning of sub-section (2), which says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture may by order vary as he shall think proper, in respect of the said tidal waters of the River Shannon, the weekly close season fixed in respect of those waters by the said Section 20 of the Salmon Fishery (Ireland) Act, 1863, as amended by this section, but shall not by any such order reduce the said weekly close season to less than 48 hours.</P>
      <P>I cannot see any justification for the Minister taking power to change the weekly close season by order.  The weekly close season was fixed by statute, but it is now to be changed, as far as the type of waters in the Shannon is concerned.  In addition, to alter the statute goes a great deal further, by giving the Minister power at any time in the future to change the close season without coming to this House, or even going to the trouble of making a bye-law.  In the past, a Minister could not alter the weekly close season, even by a bye-law.  Now he is to be allowed, apparently, to alter it by order.  That sub-section should be dropped, or, if it is found necessary to alter the close season, it should be done by statute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The sub-section has been inserted there really to avoid the contingency.  It might be possible to revert to the <i>status quo</i> in respect to the weekly close season, not that it should be extended, but reduced again to the 48 hours.  The section is really necessary for the purpose of avoiding <Col N="89" /> the necessity for amending legislation when that particular date arrives.  It is necessary at present, because of the damage done to the fisheries, to extend the close season, in so far as it affects the tidal waters.  It is believed that after a certain period, when the new conditions contemplated by the Bill come into operation, the value of the fisheries will be restored, and that it will not be necessary to preserve a longer close season than the section contemplates; that it will be possible to revert.  The section is there to have that done by order rather than by legislation.  Possibly, it would meet the Deputy's wishes if we inserted a provision requiring that any order made should be approved by the Oireachtas before coming into force, if the object is to prevent the Minister for Agriculture further extending the close season.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.  I think the sub-section should be slightly amended.  The Minister says that the purpose is to bring the close season back to the <i>status quo ante,</i> but the fact is that he may alter it as much as he likes.  Let us take an extreme case, that of some recalcitrant weir owner who is difficult to deal with.  The Minister may say: &ldquo;I will take it out of you.&rdquo;  By altering the close season four or five days he might bring him to his knees.  As the sub-section stands it empowers the Minister to do that. If the intention is to allow the Minister, when conditions improve, to revert to the shorter close season, the sub-section should be changed so that the Minister would not have power to alter it by lengthening it.  With such an amendment I could agree providing it was laid before the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I will look into that. This matter is more for the Department of Fisheries than for the Department of Industry and Commerce.  As I understand it, they do not expect it will be necessary to increase further the close season, although of course there is necessity for checking depletion of the spawning stock now going on.  They think that after a period that depletion will be checked, and that it will be possible to revert to the 48 hours.  Possibly they may have <Col N="90" /> in mind that if the increased close season provided was not operative, they might have to extend it.  In any event, there should be a provision requiring the assent of the Dáil before it is done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Dr. Ward)</NameTxt>
      <P>The aim of this <Col N="98" /> legislation is to improve the purity and quality of the milk supply and to safeguard it from infection and contamination. It is now generally recognised that milk derived from healthy cows is the most valuable food available for aiding the physical development and welfare of mankind.  Of all food materials, it contains the greatest assortment of nutritive substances and constitutes a foundation upon which an adequate diet can most safely and most easily be constructed. It is especially important as a food for infants and young children who are supplied through its protein with the necessary material for the healthy growth of their bodies.  It furnishes not only the best but the cheapest material for the building up of new body tissue, whether bone, teeth, brain or muscle.  A quart of milk supplies as much protein as 7 ounces of sirloin steak or 4 large eggs, and as much calcium for bones and teeth as 20 lbs. of beef or 32 eggs.  It is easily assimilated and, therefore, constitutes a natural form of nourishment.  It is also very valuable to adults because of the supply of ash constituents and vitamins which it contains.  The benefits to be derived from the consumption of a daily ration of milk have been demonstrated by repeated experiments and have been testified to by many research workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having regard to the importance of the dairying industry in this country and the large quantity of milk produced, it is somewhat surprising to find that despite the excellence of milk as a food, its consumption in this country in the form of milk is substantially below the quantity consumed in other lands.  Comparative statistics on the subject which are available only from seven countries indicate that the average yearly consumption of milk per person in Switzerland is twice more, in Norway 63 per cent. more, and in the United States of America 43 per cent. more than in this country.  Moreover, if the matter is examined from the standpoint of the proportion of the total milk output which is consumed by persons in the form of milk, it is observed that the proportion of the <Col N="99" /> total milk production which is so consumed in the Saorstát is only 15.1 per cent. as compared with 72.1 per cent. in Scotland, 71.6 per cent. in England and Wales, 38.3 per cent. in Germany and 32.2 per cent. in France.  This is, of course, mainly accounted for by the larger industrial populations in these other countries, but the figure for the Saorstát emphasises the extent to which the consumption of milk can be increased here.</P>
    <P>It is clear from my foregoing observations that there is both a strong argument in favour of the increased consumption of milk as food in this country and that the volume of milk production yields an abundant surplus to meet any probable increase in the demand.  Why, therefore, has not a campaign for the increased consumption of milk as a food been embarked on long since?  The reason is that milk forms a most suitable medium for the propagation of bacteria and if it is contaminated by Pathogenic organisms, they multiply rapidly therein.  Such contamination may be introduced into the milk by uncleanly methods of milking or by careless handling.  What was an excellent food when drawn from the cow may, through improper methods of production, become quickly a source of infection, and the use of such contaminated milk as a beverage may give rise to a widespread outbreak of serious illness especially in infants and young children.  Moreover, the milk may in some cases contain tubercle bacilli derived from a tubercular cow and the pooling of the infected product with the milk from other cows may extend the danger of infection over a wider area.  While the findings of the inter-Departmental Committee, constituted in 1926, to advise as to the cleanliness and the wholesomeness of the milk supply in this country, indicate that there is nothing to suggest a high incidence of tuberculosis amongst milch cows in this country, the estimate of the committee that at least 3,000 animals out of the aggregate number of dairy cattle in the Saorstát give tuberculous milk indicates that a substantial danger of <Col N="100" /> transmission of bovine tuberculosis through the medium of milk exists. The results of investigations by medical research workers show that tuberculous milk is responsible for a large proportion of bone and joint disease, diseased glands and other physical deformities in young children. This danger menaces especially, therefore, the health of infants and young children in whose dietary milk plays so large a part and it is essential that precautions should be taken to prevent the sale of infected milk for human consumption.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that it would be unwise to advocate a general increase in the consumption of milk as a beverage until precautions are taken to ensure that as far as possible such milk is derived only from healthy animals and that in the course of its production and distribution it will be safeguarded against risk of contamination or infection.  In considering the provisions of the proposed legislation it must be borne in mind that power is already given to the Minister under Section 34 of the Contagious Diseases (Animals) Act, 1878, to make Orders for registration of cowkeepers, dairymen and purveyors of milk, for inspection of cattle and dairies, for regulation of construction of dairies and cowsheds, for securing the cleanliness of milk stores, milk shops and milk vessels, for prescribing precautions to be taken for protecting milk against infection or contamination, and for authorising local authorities to make regulations for any of the above mentioned purposes.  The present Bill is designed to strengthen and to supplement these powers in certain respects and to give effect, as far as practicable, to the recommendations of the inter-Departmental Committee of 1926.</P>
    <P>Part I of the Bill contains preliminary and general provisions and definitions.  It imposes on sanitary authorities the duty of enforcing the provisions of the Bill and empowers them to appoint officers for that purpose. Provision is made for fixing appointed days for the coming into operation of different parts of the Bill.  It is also prescribed that milk <Col N="101" /> for purposes of the Bill is milk intended for human consumption in the form of milk and in no other form.</P>
    <P>Part II of the Bill provides for the sale of milk under special designations. At present milk is being offered for sale under different names implying certain superior qualities in the milk, but there is no redress for a purchaser if the milk sold to him is not up to the standard for which he has paid.  The Minister is empowered under the Bill to make regulations prescribing special designations which may be used in connection with milk sold or offered for sale, and to provide for the granting of licences to sell milk under any such special designation on payment of prescribed fees.  It is intended to follow the recommendation of the inter-Departmental Committee on the milk supply and to classify the superior qualities of milk under three special designations, including pasteurised milk.</P>
    <P>It is contemplated that either the Minister or the Local Authority may grant licences for the sale of milk under special designations.  This may involve a certain number of bacteriological examinations at the instance of the State if the Minister sees fit to undertake the State inspection of milk of the highest grade.  The powers under the Bill in this respect are general and may be subsequently distributed between the Minister and the Local Authority as will be seen fit. Generally, the primary responsibility in the matter will rest with the Local Authority.  When these provisions come into force, the sale of milk under special designations by unlicensed persons will be prohibited. Power is also granted to the Minister to make regulations prescribing general designations which may be used without a special designation licence which may be permissible in connection with milk offered for sale. General designations will be in the nature of fresh milk or new milk, or such other title as will not imply any special quality or special degree of cleanliness in such milk.  For instance, the terms &ldquo;pure milk&rdquo; or &ldquo;best milk&rdquo; would not be permitted to be used as a general designation.  It will <Col N="102" /> not be lawful for any person to use in connection with milk offered for sale, any words or signs which are neither special nor general designations and which indicate that the milk is of a particular quality or prepared in a particular manner or suitable for a particular purpose.  Sanitary authorities may be required by the Minister to ascertain whether holders of special designation licences in their districts are conforming to the conditions on which these licences have been granted.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill deals with the prevention of disease likely to be caused by milk infected in the course of production or distribution by outbreaks or carriers of the following diseases:&mdash; tuberculosis, typhoid fever, paratyphoid fever, diphtheria, membranous croup, scarlatina, or any other disease which may be declared by the Minister to be a disease to which this part of the Act applies.  Where an outbreak of any of the above-mentioned diseases is suspected to be due to the consumption of infected milk, the medical officer of the district concerned shall ascertain the location of the dairy from which such milk is derived, and may inspect the premises and examine any person engaged therein.  If satisfied that it is the source of infection he may prohibit the disposal of any milk from such dairy.  Appeal to the District Court against the making of such prohibition order is provided for and unless such order has been made in consequence of the dairyman's fault or neglect, the dairyman will be entitled to recover from the sanitary authority full compensation for any loss or damage he may have sustained in consequence of the Order.  Any dispute as to such damage or loss or the amount of compensation therefor shall be settled by arbitration under the Public Health Acts.</P>
    <P>A dairyman who sells milk infected with a disease to which the Bill applies, shall, if previous knowledge is proved, be guilty of an offence and be liable to a penalty for the first offence not exceeding £50, and in the case of a second offence to a fine not exceeding £100, or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months. <Col N="103" /> or to both fine and imprisonment.  In the event of an outbreak of a disease to which the Bill applies occuring in connection with any dairy, the dairyman is required to give notice in writing to the local medical officer of health and not to sell any milk produced or kept in such dairy without the permission of the medical officer until the expiration of 24 hours after the giving of such notice.</P>
    <P>Part IV of the Bill relates to cows affected by tuberculosis of the udder or uterus, and certain other forms of disease likely to affect injuriously the milk produced from such cows.  The sale of milk from such diseased cows is prohibited and it is provided that it will be an offence for any person to sell such milk if he knows that the cow from which it was derived was suffering from any of the above-mentioned diseases.</P>
    <P>Part V of the Bill deals with the bacteriological examination of milk samples, the appointment of bacteriological examiners for the purpose, the fees to be fixed in connection with the examination and testing of samples of milk, and the bacteriological certificates to be issued by the examiners on testing samples of milk submitted to them.</P>
    <P>Part VI of the Bill relates to the appointment of milk sampling officers who are persons whose professional or special training will enable them to appreciate the necessity for the observance of special precautions in taking such samples so as to avoid the introduction of any external contamination in the course of taking the samples.  The procedure for dealing with samples of milk taken is also set out.  Power is given to take samples of milk in course of transit from one sanitary district to a dairy or purveyor in another sanitary district.</P>
    <P>Part VII of the Bill contains miscellaneous provisions.  It is possible at present to sell, with impunity, milk which is dirty, contaminated or infected, and the Bill contains a provision making the sale of such milk an offence punishable in the case of a first offence by a fine not exceeding £5, and in the case of any subsequent offence <Col N="104" /> by a fine not exceeding £50 or imprisonment. This portion of the Bill also requires vehicles, cans or other receptacles from which milk is being delivered in any highway or public place to be conspicuously inscribed with the words &ldquo;Bainne ar Diol.&rdquo;  The procedure in regard to the service and production of bacteriological certificates as evidence at legal proceedings is laid down.  Power is given to the Minister, after consultation with the Minister for Agriculture, to make regulations for the labelling or marking of tins of separated or skimmed milk exposed for sale.  Provision is made for the establishment by sanitary authorities of district depots for the sale of milk specially prepared for the use of infants.</P>
    <P>A provision is included requiring dairymen to supply to medical officers of health on demand a list of all sources from which the dairyman's milk supply has been received during a specified period.  Procedure for service of notices under the Bill on dairymen and penalties for obstruction of officers carrying out duties under the Bill are also provided for.  Finally Section 9 of the Sale of Foods and Drugs Act, 1899, which requires the name and address of every person selling milk on a highway or place of public resort to be inscribed on the vehicle, can or other receptacle used therefor is repealed, and also Section 11 of the same Act which deals with the labelling of condensed, separated or skimmed milk.  Section 16 of the Tuberculosis Prevention (Ireland) Act, 1908, empowering the taking of milk samples by medical officers of health for examination or analysis is also repealed.</P>
    <P>I am glad to be able to say that the experience gained in connection with the schemes for the provision of free milk for necessitous children at the cost of the State has demonstrated that there are many milk producers in this country ready to adopt progressive methods by submitting their cattle to the tuberculin test and improving the conditions of milk production if they are given encouragement by receiving preference for their product over milk produced in the ordinary way.  Such preference was given for milk from <Col N="105" /> tuberculin-tested herds in connection with contracts under the free milk supply schemes, and in Dublin, Limerick and Waterford County boroughs and in 18 urban districts tuberculin-tested milk was supplied under these schemes during the half-year ended 31st March, 1934, while portion of the milk provided during the same period in eight county health districts was also derived from tuberculin-tested cows.  The testing of the dairy herd in each case was certified by a veterinary surgeon.  The growth of this movement is shown by the fact that under the free milk schemes for the current year tuberculin-tested milk is being supplied by 144 contractors in three county boroughs, 25 urban districts and 12 county health districts.</P>
    <P>The production of clean milk does not involve any very elaborate equipment or necessarily entail any considerable expense on milk production.  It demands closer attention to the grooming of the cattle, greater care and cleanliness on the part of the milkers and distributors, together with the provision of facilities for cleaning and sterilising milk vessels and utensils.</P>
    <P>It is to be hoped that the result of this legislation will be to improve the cleanliness and wholesomeness of the milk supply so that the more general use of milk as a nutritive beverage can be recommended without reserve and with the full advocacy of the medical profession.  It would then be possible to undertake safely an intensive campaign to educate public opinion as regards the wonderful properties of pure milk, and it might be possible in due course to replace to a great extent the use of tea which is so detrimental to many in this country, by this nutritive native product.  Such a change would benefit the physical and mental development of the race and would also redound to the advantage of our dairying industry.</P>
    <P>I move that the Bill be read a Second Time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Parliamentary Secretary should have taken the House a little more into his confidence as regards the necessity for this Bill in the first place, and that he <Col N="106" /> should really tell us what he expects the Bill to do.  The Bill is put forward as something to help us to get greater purity of milk and a better quality of milk.  A very considerable amount of agitation is raised from time to time that milk is a very dangerous thing. On this aspect of the matter the Inter-Departmental Committee drew attention to the more important features of the supply of milk so far as infection and impurity go.  But the present Bill does not seem to me to do anything more than to cross the t's and dot the i's as regards a certain amount of the present machinery for looking after milk from the point of view of food and drugs.  Those who have had a certain amount of discussion with the Department in the last few years will recognise the whole of Part II of the Bill, the whole of Part III and the whole of Parts IV, V and VI of the Bill, in addition to the greater part of Parts I and VII.  These Parts of the Bill have been at least three, if not four, years in draft.  Those who had a knowledge of the discussion that took place on this matter will probably miss from the Bill as it stands now one or two Parts dealing with matters affecting the control of the purity and quality of the milk, matters that perhaps in their minds are much more important than anything in the Bill as it stands.</P>
      <P>The report of the Inter-Departmental Committee to which the Parliamentary Secretary referred states in page 25:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We consider that the surest and most feasible method of securing a pure, safe and sufficient milk supply at a reasonable price for the general community is by strict supervision of the cow, the dairy and the distribution.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary himself pointed out that one of the most important things in getting a pure milk supply is the method of handling the milk. The Parliamentary Secretary has completely turned his back on the cow. No one can go near the cow unless some medical officer in some part of the country has reason to believe that there is a diseased or infected cow knocking around from which milk has been taken and supplied.  That is the <Col N="107" /> position as I judge it to be.  I think the matter that most struck the Inter-Departmental Committee is that the real place in which to tackle the milk question is being deliberately ignored. As I say, no one can look at a cow with any authority to bring about improvement under the Bill except the cow is known to be diseased or that there is good reason for believing that the cow is diseased.</P>
    <P>I may be misconstruing the position, but it seems that that is so.  If the Inter-Departmental Committee were wrong in putting their finger on the cow as the most important subject in this matter, I would like to hear what the Parliamentary Secretary has to say about it.  Again, turning to the cow, the Inter-Departmental Committee on page 9 of their report, in referring to the eradication of bovine tuberculosis as far as possible and as early as possible in the country, state that the Bovine Tuberculosis Order of 1926, if actively enforced, is a very useful first step towards the eradication of the disease.  And in paragraph 33 they state:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It should be made a condition that where the Government provide free tuberculin testing to producers under the `Bang' system, reactors must not be disposed of for further use for dairy purposes.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>They say that the most effective method would be to slaughter reactors and partly to compensate the owners.  If this were done it would remove one of the causes which tend to raise the cost of tubercle-free milk.  The Parliamentary Secretary has indicated that it is proposed to have three grades of milk under the Orders to be issued.  I hope it will be possible on the Committee Stage to indicate what these three grades are, why these three grades are being selected, what the cost will involve to the producers, and what it will involve in price to the purchasers of milk.  I do hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will be able to assure the House when he talks of licensing producers for certain grades of milk that he is not going to charge a substantial fee <Col N="108" /> for these licences.  Because if the milk is the important thing that he tells us it is, then the people who qualify for the licences ought rather to get some small subsidy if you like from the State, for having gone to the trouble that they undoubtedly will have to go to if they are to produce better grades of milk.  I do not stand for a subsidy for milk production, because if we are to have a subsidy for milk production, as for everything else, it is difficult to know who is to pay for it in the end.</P>
    <P>So much encouragement is necessary to get the proper care taken in the case of milk I hope, when the Minister talks about a fee, that he has in mind a twopenny stamp rather than a fee of £1 or £2.  If we are going to have any kind of wide production of a better class of milk, or the eradication of the worst types, I think the Minister ought to take the House into his confidence as to what is going to be done with regard to tuberculous cattle.  We did have a case here to-day, when attention was drawn to the fact that under a seizure for land annuities, two or three cows were taken, and two of them were sold at 5/- each, while the other cow was sold at 12/-.  I think the State would get much more out of it if, instead of pinching cows at that price, they went to the person who was offending under the land annuities business and slaughtered his tubercular cattle.  At least, the State would make as much out of it, and they might be helping to reform citizens whom they might otherwise regard as bad citizens.  It would be more profitable if attention were devoted to doing away with some of the tubercular cattle that are said to be in the country.  If it is going to cost something to do away with them, then the present time would be perhaps the cheapest time to tackle the job.</P>
    <P>As regards the whole milk situation, except the Parliamentary Secretary is in a position to tell us what he is going to do with regard to the inspection of cows&mdash;that, in an unexpected way, has been dropped from this Bill&mdash;and what he is going to do with regard to tubercular cattle, we <Col N="109" /> will not be in a position to make much progress.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>We are all in favour of securing pure milk, but one of the great dangers of a Bill of this kind is to cause a sense of false security.  If we are going to put milk producers under a series a fairly stringent regulations, I want to ensure that we will get value for the regulations and for the annoyance that they must inevitably cause.  It does not matter how much annoyance they cause if they are effective in eradicating disease and impurities from milk, and it is with a view to examining that aspect of the question that I am interested in this Bill.</P>
      <P>Will the Parliamentary Secretary contradict me if I say that the only milk you may definitely declare is absolutely free from deleterious bacteria is pasteurised milk?  You may be pretty certain other varieties of milk are, but the only milk about which you may be definite is the milk that is pasteurised.  Therefore, when we start talking about tuberculin tested milk, pure milk, and so forth, we are creating in the public mind the impression that these tuberculin tested milks, Grade A milks, and so forth, are in fact something which they are not.  Despite the most exhaustive tuberculin tests that may be carried out, it is quite possible that milk contaminated by tuberculosis could come from a tuberculin tested herd.  For instance, the tuberculin test, in my experience with cattle, is wholly unreliable, and it is very easily circumvented.  No beast will react to the tuberculin test twice in 48 hours and, if I want to avoid the rise in temperature which constitutes the positive reaction to the tuberculin test, all I need do is to go through the tuberculin test procedure 48 hours before the veterinary surgeon does and I have an absolute guarantee that no reaction will present itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Parliamentary Secretary will confirm me in that.  You might, therefore, have a situation in which the medical officer of health, or the veterinary surgeon, or whoever is provided <Col N="110" /> for in the Act, would test a herd with the tuberculin test and certify it all as perfectly sound and qualified to supply tuberculin tested milk when, in fact, half the cattle would be tubercular. What is the danger?  The danger is that many a mother of children, who habitually pasteurises the milk she gives them, would be deluded by the tuberculin test certificate into abandoning the precaution of pasteurising the milk herself; she would be misled into giving that milk to her children and possibly starting tuberculosis in her family.  I think that is a matter that ought to be examined very carefully, and it is a matter that ought to be examined with particular care when the time comes for the Minister to prescribe grades of milk and to authorise milk vendors in the manner set out here.  I think he will be bound, when he is prescribing the grades, to require some kind of warning note to be sounded, cautioning potential buyers that even though the milk comes from a tuberculin tested herd, and even though it is Grade A milk, required for the feeding of young children or susceptible persons, the ordinary precautions such as have been taken in the past should be taken.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill deals with the prevention of disease likely to be caused by infected milk, and we have a group of diseases set out here&mdash; tuberculosis, typhoid fever, paratyphoid fever, diphtheria, membranous croup and scarlatina, and every other disease which may from time to time be declared by an order for the time being in force.  I take it this has reference to diseases of human beings who work in the dairy, so that here we are not dealing with bovine tuberculosis but with human tuberculosis.  Am I to assume that is correct?  Am I to take it as correct that the diseases in Part III, beginning with Section 23, are the diseases of human beings working in the dairy?</P>

      <P>I see no objection to that, on the whole.  I do strongly object to Section 24 (1) (a) which gives power to the medical officer of a sanitary district not only to examine the dairy but, if he so thinks fit, to examine any person engaged in the service thereof or resident in the dairy or who may be resident in any premises where any person employed in the dairy may reside.  That is an infringement of personal liberty which goes far beyond what the situation would justify.  It would be quite legitimate to empower the medical officer to offer to undertake the examination of any such person or require such person to produce to him a certificate signed by a qualified medical practitioner giving him a clean bill of health before he would resume work in the dairy or in the premises referred to in sub-section 1 (a).  But I do strongly object to statutory power being given to a medical officer of health to examine a free citizen of this State against his or her will.  There is, I think, no precedent in any statute of the Oireachtas for giving a physician the right to examine any individual, whether the physician commands the confidence of that individual or not.  I submit that that is a section urgently requiring amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now we come to the process of sampling milk and the procedure to be adopted in examining the samples.  I do not know if the attention of the Parliamentary <Col N="112" /> Secretary has been directed to an article which recently appeared in the <i>Lancet</i> from the medical officer of health in Hammersmith.  The article appeared in the <i>Lancet</i> of the 10th November, 1934, page 1073. The writer points out that the sampling of milk which has been going on under the relevant legislation in England has been extremely unsatisfactory.  He points out that it frequently happens that a sample of milk, having been divided into two or more parts and submitted to analytical or bacteriological chemists, will produce most astonishingly different results.  I quote from the article in the <i>Lancet:</i></P>
    <P>&ldquo;Recently, I have had further tests made with startling results.  A quart bottle of pasteurised milk was taken and, after being thoroughly shaken, divided into six parts.  Sterile bottles were used and every precaution taken during the division.  Two of these bottles were submitted to each of three laboratories.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He appends a table giving particulars of the reports received.  These were six samples taken from the same bottle of milk, which had been adequately shaken.  The first laboratory reported the sample as having been received at a temperature of 13 degrees centigrade and as containing 9,270 bacteria per cubic centimetre.  The second laboratory reported as receiving the sample at the same temperature, but found that it contained 14,300 bacteria per c.cm.  The third laboratory received the sample at a temperature of 11 degrees centigrade, and found that it contained 147,333 bacteria.  The fourth laboratory, receiving the sample at the same temperature, found that it contained 3,400,000 bacteria per c.cm. These were four reports on the same sample of milk.  The medical officer of Hammersmith goes on to say that, in his opinion, these results arise from lack of uniformity in the procedure adopted by bacteriological chemists in conducting their tests.  He suggests that, in a Schedule to any future Bill, there should be set out some prescribed procedure through which the milk should be passed with a view to arriving at uniform results.  It will be readily seen <Col N="113" /> that, under this Bill, a milk purveyor might be prosecuted for having impure milk, a Government analyst might report that it contained 3,400,000 bacteria and a bacteriological chemist employed by the person concerned might report that it had a bacteria content of 9,270.  It is necessary that some procedure should be prescribed by the Department, so that when the certificate referred to in Section 39 is produced, it will be possible under paragraph (c) of that section to cross-examine the bacteriological chemist with a view to ascertaining whether or not he carried out the correct procedure as laid down in the schedule to the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 42 refers to the necessity for labelling cans in which skimmed milk is offered for sale or sold.  Is the Parliamentary Secretary satisfied that this section will not affect skimmed milk returned to creamery suppliers who, normally, take this milk in the can in which they brought the new milk to the creamery?  Obviously, it would be extremely inconvenient if a farmer were liable to prosecution for having skimmed milk in his creamery can on the ground that the creamery manager had sold it to him in that container.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy mentioned that this Bill did not seem to authorise the Minister to tackle the cow.  Of course, the Minister has pretty wide powers under the Tuberculosis Prevention Act, by which tuberculosis cattle can be arbitrarily slaughtered, subject to a certain amount of compensation.  I am not sure that it would be materially useful for the Minister to direct too much attention to the cow beyond the disease of tuberculosis, because, so far as I am aware, the only other disease which is liable to be conveyed from the cow to the human being is the human manifestation of contagious abortion. That very rarely manifests itself, though I believe cases have recently been reported in Great Britain.  If the Minister had to dispose of every cow in this country with contagious abortion it would be very difficult to maintain the cattle population at all.  I think probably the Parliamentary Secretary can assure the House that he has adequate <Col N="114" /> power in every case to deal with cattle that are tuberculous, and that they can be slaughtered without any difficulty. Subject to the observations I have made, I see no objection to this Bill. But I would impress upon the Minister most strongly what I think all see in connection with Section 24, and more so in connection with the danger that can flow from guaranteeing a tuberculin tested herd.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, introducing this measure, said it was designed to secure purity and quality in the milk supply.  In the latter portion of his statement he said that some penalties were to be imposed for the sale of dirty milk, contaminated milk and affected milk.  The Medical Officer of Health for Cork City has placed on record his dissatisfaction with this measure.  The main ground of his objection is that there is no definition in the Bill of dirty milk.  In the <i>British Medical Journal</i> for September 29th there is a reference to the Milk Bill and Dr. Saunders's objection to the Bill.  It says that Dr. Saunders set out in his general commentary (1) &ldquo;the difficulty of obtaining convictions for the sale of dirty milk in the absence of a specific definition of dirty milk.&rdquo; The article goes on to say &ldquo;the Department has dealt with Dr. Saunders's objection as follows (1) &ldquo;As regards the necessity of defining dirty milk, this term is included in the Dairy Produce Act of 1924, which prohibits the supplying of dirty milk or cream to a creamery, and it is understood that no difficulty has arisen in securing convictions under that law.&rdquo;  The section of the Dairy Produce Act referred to is Section 3, sub-section (1), paragraph (c).</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The milk or cream and all other ingredients and materials used in the process of manufacturing dairy produce on the premises shall be clean.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is some difficulty in connecting up the definition of dirty milk with this. I think the Minister will require to put in a definition of dirty milk.  Dr. Saunders deals, in the course of his statement, with this measure and is apparently very disappointed in connection with its provisions.  The Bill seeks to empower the Minister to licence <Col N="115" /> persons who will sell special quality milk or as one might say, for the richer people.  But so far as provision is made for the general sale of milk there is no security whatever in the measure. Reference to Dr. Saunders's statement is made to the effect that he is disappointed that there is to be no licence for the milk vendor.  In the report we find that Section 52 dealt with milk vendors in districts and the premises to be used by them for trade operations. Section 110 recommends a penalty for selling dirty milk, and the cancellation of the milk vendor's licence, after three convictions.  Dr. Saunders goes on, in the course of a statement which it is unnecessary to read in full to the House, to say that &ldquo;some of the provisions of the Bill are of little or no advantage to us; in fact&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;the great bulk of the child population will remain exposed to the risk of epidemics of diarrhoea which is almost entirely due to dirty milk produced in unhygienic surroundings.&rdquo; The Bill deals with licences for better class or quality producers. There is no provision whatever for licences to people who sell fresh milk or pure milk or whatever it is called.</P>
    <P>In the course of examination of this question by the inter-departmental committee, and subsequently, they made certain recommendations. Recommendation No. 26 reads &ldquo;milk vendors in county boroughs and urban districts should be licensed persons and, in respect of premises, there should be the right of appeal in cases of refusal to grant a licence.&rdquo;  They also recommended that persons employed in dairy farms or other positions where milk is kept and intended for sale should be personally liable for any neglect in the matter of cleanliness.  There is no provision in the Bill for a penalty in any such case. There is a penalty for the employer. But the employer has on occasions to go to fairs, markets, and other places of that sort.  He is not always on the premises.  In any case, it is not a selection of these penalties that we are called upon to make in this case. This is a scheme to ensure perfectly clean wholesome milk, free from contamination <Col N="116" /> and infection and certainly produced in hygienic surroundings.  If liability is not to be evaded, one or two things is likely to happen.  If the employer is fined he will fire his man; if the man is fined it will have a wholesome effect upon the other employees. If the desire is to ensure that the whole conduct of the business is to be hygienic and cleanly, and that all the purposes of the measures shall not be departed from, it should be capable of deciding on the person who is really responsible.  There is just a danger in connection with the consideration of a measure of this sort that too much attention could be directed towards the diseases of animals in the country. The percentage is negligible.  It is presented in the report published in 1928.  They say in paragraph 26:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The percentage of infection (25 per cent.) estimated from the results obtained at the Veterinary Research Laboratory points to a total of at least 3,000 animals giving tuberculous milk among the aggregate of 1,200,000 cows in the Saorstát. Slaughter of affected cows has taken place at an average of 800 per annum.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It would be much better, notwithstanding the cost, to dispose of any animal giving tuberculous milk immediately.  It would be well also in that connection if full compensation were paid.  The amount involved is inconsiderable, the advantages to be derived are illimitable.</P>
    <P>On a previous page, paragraph 19, the report states:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In a general consideration of the disease it should be understood that&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  A large number of cows reacting to the tuberculin test are affected only to a slight degree, some so slightly as to make it difficult to determine the existence of the disease on a <i>post mortem</i> examination.</P>
    <P>(b)  It is only a relatively small percentage of reacting cows that give tuberculous milk, but every reacting cow must be regarded as a potential danger.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="117" /> (c)  Cows may be extensively affected with the disease but show no evidence of it during life.</P>
    <P>(d)  Cows in some instances in good condition, apparently normal to the owner, may give tuberculous milk.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have no desire in connection with a discussion of this matter to raise that particular question.  It is inevitable that in the course of the examination of this question and a discussion of it here on Second Reading, owing to the highly competitive condition of world markets to-day, special attention might be directed in other countries to the fact that we have had to bring in a Bill of this sort.  It is interesting in that connection to turn to page 47 of the Report to see what the Medical Officer of Birmingham has to say on this question.  It is stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Very few children in Birmingham suffer from tuberculosis, and Sir John Robertson attributes this largely to the use of sterilised milk. He thinks that probably some of the vitamins are destroyed, but if the diet is supplemented by orange juice, there should be no harm in this.  The death-rate from non-pulmonary tuberculosis in Birmingham is very low....  In his experience 35 per cent. of dairy cattle react to the tuberculin test.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Having regard to the very small percentage of reaction we have amongst our cows, it is fairly obvious that the health of the animals is certainly on a higher level than it is in England.  This report goes further.  It emphasises a point which is likely to be lost sight of in the maelstrom of political and economic conflict here. The Parliamentary Secretary knows more about vitamins than I do, and the nutritive properties which are to be expected from animals exposed to the sun as distinct from animals kept in dairy cow-sheds.  Most of our competitors, particularly in Northern Europe, keep their animals in during the greater part of the year.  In this country they are out during most of the year.  It may be interesting in a few years' time to hear some man engaged in medical <Col N="118" /> research pointing out the obvious advantages there are in consuming the produce of animals which have the advantage of exposure to the sun as against the produce of animals that are not so favourably treated.</P>
    <P>In the course of the recommendations there are some matters which I suppose do not affect the Parliamentary Secretary. The very first deals with legislation recommended for the slaughter of cows affected with tuberculosis which, they say, should be concentrated under the Bovine Tuberculosis Order by the repeal of Section 18 of the Tuberculosis Prevention (Ireland) Act, 1908.  If the Parliamentary Secretary is not concerned with that matter, it is at least his duty to impress on the Minister for Agriculture or the Minister for Finance the desirability of affording such money as will enable that main difficulty to be dealt with.  No. 3 of the recommendations says: &ldquo;All cows should be subjected to veterinary inspection at least twice a year.&rdquo;  In the course of this year a great number of appointments will be made.  No better appointments could be made than those of officers who would carry out that particular recommendation.  It is far better than taking samples of milk.  In fact, as this report says, or as can be read into it, it is better to secure the desired result by means other than penalties, licences and other penal measures.  The Parliamentary Secretary laid some stress in the course of his speech on the desirability of getting herds which are free from any of those affections.  That particular phase is also dealt with in the course of the report.  The cost that is cited, taking one of the best herds in England, Lord Raleigh's, is considerable.  It amounts to £3 per cow.  In the beginning it cannot be effected at a smaller price than £8 or £9 per cow.  These are not times when one can expect farmers or other people engaged in this particular service throughout the country to embark on high expenditure of that kind.  Some assistance could be reasonably afforded by the State.  The tuberculin test is a very expensive item of itself.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Parliamentary <Col N="119" /> Secretary has any experience of it but I am told that if one is entering an animal for the Show and wants to get a tuberculin test, it costs two guineas.  It will be all the more expensive in the country having regard to the fact that a veterinary surgeon may not live in the neighbourhood. Although the fee of two guineas may look considerable, the work may occasion a journey of 20 to 40 miles.  That points to the necessity of having some helpful institution at the disposal of those who are engaged in the distribution of such an important article of diet for the people.  I would much prefer to see appointments of veterinary officers to do work such as that to help to eradicate the disease.</P>
    <P>Better opportunities than are proposed in the measure should be afforded for the inspection of dairies that are outside the area in which the milk is consumed.  Take the case say of Dublin or Cork.  It may be that in the case of one or other of those boroughs, very considerable journeys may be made.  This Bill expects the local authority in the area in which the dairy is situated to co-operate in the work.  Now, that is none of their business.  It does not concern them at all and the Minister should know by this that there is no great co-operative spirit amongst local authorities in connection with matters of this kind.  One of the first things an official will say is &ldquo;This is Dublin again.  They are never satisfied there.&rdquo;  You are expecting them to do work which is essentially work of the various other areas.  It does not appear on the face of it to be a better system than that which was put to the committee and in which, they say, a plausible case was made for extraterritorial inspection in connection with the desire on the part of medical officers of health to ensure that they would get perfectly clean milk.</P>
    <P>In considering this measure the Minister would have been very well advised to have had consultations with a committee of medical officers of <Col N="120" /> health from centres such as Dublin, Cork, Waterford and other centres.  They have to deal with the trouble which is occasioned by the delivery of dirty, contaminated or infected milk.  Once disease, such as typhoid, shows itself then the work of the medical officers of health starts.  I think it would be better to prevent the doing of that sort of work rather than have the job of curing it.  In all the circumstances I think it would be a good thing, even at this stage, if the Minister were to consult with the medical officers of health throughout the country to see whether it is necessary to supplement and strengthen this measure in order to effect the purpose of supplying wholesome milk to the people.</P>
    <P>The Bill, as it stands, has a peculiar character about it.  In the first place, it is going to ensure for those who are engaged in the production of Grade A and tuberculin-free milk a fairly safe business, but so far as the vast majority of the people of the country are concerned&mdash;those who cannot afford to buy that milk&mdash;there is no such security.  So far as the ordinary dairy proprietor in the country is concerned the Bill is going to put him in this position, that he will have to be watching for the inspector.  He ought not be put in that position but rather in the position that he would welcome the inspector.  The Bill does nothing to ensure that milk cans shall be covered when being taken through the streets.  The medical officer of Cork has drawn attention to the faulty method proposed for the taking of samples.  In connection with the taking of samples the Minister knows perhaps much better than any member of the House, with the exception of those who belong to the medical profession, that while one may take a sample at Limerick or Cork of milk that has been consigned to Dublin, it will, when subjected to bacteriological examination, show certain results, but if the sample be taken at Kingsbridge it will show, I suggest, very different results and for reasons which the Minister knows. <Col N="121" /> The Bill should be amended in respect of the liability of any person, no matter who it may be, engaged in the handling of milk or dealing in milk. I think he should be made liable himself personally for any act of uncleanliness. If the Bill cannot be amended in that direction, then I suggest to the Minister that another measure be introduced to enable compensation to be paid for the slaughter of cows that give tuberculous milk.  There is a section in the Bill calculated to arouse the cupidity of any dairyman if he wants to get out of a contract.  All he has got to do is to buy a cow suffering from tuberculosis and his contract goes by the board.  I grant that the Minister did not intend that, but as the Bill is drawn it has that effect.  The last point I want to make is that there should be a licensing of persons in urban districts engaged in the sale of milk other than Grade A and tuberculin free milk.  If the Minister, before the Report Stage of the Bill is taken, consults the persons I have referred to I think it should be possible to get a Bill through which would have the active support and co-operation of all classes in the community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrRobertJRowlette" hpid="Dr. Rowlette Dr. Rowlette">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Rowlette</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the Minister for Local Government and the Parliamentary Secretary are to be congratulated on having produced a Milk Bill at all.  We have heard a good deal of criticism of the defects in the Bill and with most of those criticisms I agree.  We have waited so long for this Bill&mdash;it has been so long overdue&mdash;that one had fears that it would never see the light.  Therefore, I express thanks to the Minister and to the Parliamentary Secretary that we have seen a Bill. In my opinion the Bill, as far as it goes, is a fairly good Bill.  But there are many defects in it.  Legislation dealing with a matter of health such as this is, if it is to be effective, must depend on the success of three different things: one, the terms of the statute itself&mdash;in this case the Bill that we are dealing with; secondly, the regulations that the Minister will have to draw up in obedience to the Bill; and, thirdly, and perhaps most important of all, the <Col N="122" /> manner in which the Bill is administered.</P>
      <P>At the moment we are mainly concerned with the terms of the Bill itself. The Parliamentary Secretary said that the Bill went as far as was practicable at the moment in carrying out the recommendations of the Inter-Departmental Committee.  I am inclined to think that a little more courage on the part of the Government would have really made the problem smaller and given a better chance of rapid success. If the problem had been tackled in a more thoroughgoing way, as was suggested by the Inter-Departmental Committee&mdash;I think that the present time is peculiarly appropriate for such a campaign&mdash;and that instead of having very protracted legislation and administration going on for many years&mdash;step by step legislation&mdash;this matter of healthy milk would have been settled in the course of a couple of years.  In the report of the Inter-Departmental Committee there were some 32 recommendations made.  In the opinion of that Committee 18 of these recommendations required legislation in order to be carried out, and the other 14 dealt with administration.  Of these 18, one, that in regard to the manufacture of tuberculin, became law two years ago under the Therapeutic Substances Act. Of the other 17, only seven, as far as I could identify them, are carried out in this Bill.  That, I suppose, is as much as the Parliamentary Secretary thinks practicable, but I would suggest to him that many of the other recommendations, most of which have been drawn attention to in this debate, are practical.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most important of these, to my mind, has been omitted altogether from the Bill; that is the attempt to eradicate tuberculosis completely from dairy cattle.  The Committee mentioned several plans by which such a complete eradication could be effected, and it should be borne in mind that such complete eradication has been effected in other countries.  In certain States of the United States of America, diseases which are extremely common among us here&mdash;you will see them in any hospital ward that you go into&mdash;are quite <Col N="123" /> unknown.  I have seen American surgeons look at these cases with immense interest because they had not seen any in their own country for several decades owing to the effectiveness of the campaign for the eradication of tuberculous cattle.</P>
    <P>The Inter-Departmental Committee in discussing the question pointed out that at the time&mdash;this was six or seven years ago&mdash;such a campaign for complete eradication of tuberculosis might be expensive.  The time is certainly more suitable now for the carrying out of such a campaign.  The expense would be very much less at the present day than it would have been in 1928, when the Committee reported.  I think it will be within the memory of the House that some months ago a colleague of the Parliamentary Secretary, the Minister for Agriculture, in speaking of the necessity for reducing the number of cattle in the country, suggested that the diseased cattle should first be got rid of.  I hoped that his view that the number of cattle might be reduced by the destruction of diseased cattle might be borne in mind in this Bill, and that we might have had some plan included in the Bill for the complete eradication of tuberculous cows at any rate.  It has been said&mdash;and quite rightly&mdash;by Deputy Cosgrave that the incidence of tuberculosis in Irish cattle is not high as compared with that of other countries, but it is high enough to constitute a great danger to the health of the country.  Of the cows slaughtered in the Dublin abattoir in 1926, as quoted in the Report of the Inter-Departmental Committee, 23.69 per cent. were suffering from tuberculosis&mdash;almost one-fourth of the cows which came for slaughter in the routine way.  Those were not cows slaughtered on account of ill health, but cows which came to be slaughtered in the ordinary way for human food.  The incidence in bullocks and heifers was much lower, so that that does not represent the incidence of tuberculosis in cattle as a whole.  However important&mdash;and I agree that they are very important&mdash;the control of the dairy, the control of the cow, and the <Col N="124" /> control of the methods of production and sale of milk may be, one cannot be secured by any method against the spread of tuberculosis except by the destruction of diseased cattle.  We will not have a complete guarantee as to the safety of the milk supply of the country until this problem of the eradication of tuberculosis in cattle is tackled squarely and fairly, with determination to bring it to a satisfactory conclusion.</P>
    <P>The second great defect of the Bill, in my opinion, is the absence of licensing of milk vendors, whether on the farm or as distributors.  The administration of this Bill will be almost impossible in the absence of some such licensing system.  The penalty of losing the licence in the case of a milk producer or distributor who is distributing milk which is dangerous to the public health will be much more effective than any ordinary penalty of a fine that could be put upon him.  I have no hesitation in pressing on the Parliamentary Secretary that there should be included in the Bill a scheme for the licensing of sellers of milk.  He will find the administration much easier; he will find control much more effective and he will find that his task will be accomplished sooner and with much more success.  With that would have to go what Deputy Cosgrave has just spoken of&mdash;the ex-territorial control of the milk supply by the authorities of a board of health area.  It is intolerable that the inhabitants of such an area as Dublin, or any other city of considerable size, should be subjected to a supply of dangerous milk coming from certain parts of the country, and that the health authorities of the city should have no power to go into those parts of the country and satisfy themselves as to the conditions under which the milk is produced.  Such power to go outside its own boundaries in the control of the milk which is going to find its way into the boundaries of the city is necessary if the milk supply is to be rendered anything approaching safe.</P>
    <P>These are, it seems to me, the three points of most importance which are absent from the Bill.  There are <Col N="125" /> various others, of course, in the Report of the Departmental Committee of which notice has not been taken.</P>
    <P>In regard to administration, the administration of this Bill will present problems of peculiar difficulty.  In establishing any new system which has to do with health there is always considerable difficulty, owing to the fact that the people of the country have not been accustomed to public health control until comparatively recent years.  Special difficulty will arise in certain areas.  While the carrying out of the provisions of the Bill is rightly made compulsory on the sanitary authorities throughout the country, the executive officer in the areas where there is such an officer will be the medical officer of health for that area, but in a very considerable area of the Irish Free State there is no medical officer of health other than the dispensary doctor.  A few months ago we were told here by the Minister that medical officers of health had been appointed in 18 of the 27 county areas.  I think that since that time medical officers of health, either temporary or permanent, had been appointed in perhaps two more areas.  At any rate, we have still six or seven county areas which have no control by a medical officer of health. It is provided by the Bill that in such areas the executive officer is to be the district medical officer of health, otherwise the dispensary doctor.  In those areas, without any disrespect to the dispensary doctor, one may say that the administration of the Bill will be quite impossible.  The dispensary doctor has no experience of such work, and it is work which requires experience and training.  It would require far more time than it would be possible for him to devote to it while continuing to give his attention to his duties to the poor of the neighbourhood. Moreover, the dispensary doctor is very largely dependent on private practice for his livelihood, and it would be impossible for him to exercise an active and zealous control over the milk supply, of his district so long as he is dependent on those very milk producers for the main part of his livelihood.  He is not paid a salary for <Col N="126" /> doing such work.  His salary as medical officer of health varies from £10 to £15 a year.  Perhaps in some instances it goes as high as £20.  It has been a policy, both of local authorities and of the central authority, since this office was instituted, to keep the district medical officer of health on a salary deliberately contemptuous in order to emphasise the opinion of the local authority&mdash;and until recent years the opinion of the central authority&mdash; that the less public health work he performed the better.  It is quite impossible to expect an officer working under such conditions, without independence and without remuneration, to do the work planned in the clauses of this Bill.  Of course, that is a matter that can be got over, but I stress it now, mainly because of its importance, and to impress on the Department the necessity of insisting on the appointment of medical officers of health in these areas in which they have not yet been appointed.  Unless the Minister insist upon such appointments this Bill will fail in six or seven of the county areas and will be a dead letter in these areas.</P>
    <P>In the Report of the Departmental Committee, there is another point to which, I think, little, if any, attention has been given so far.  The Departmental Committee drew attention to the point, that it might be difficult for small producers to meet the necessary expenditure required, in order to conform with such restrictions as might be imposed on the production of milk, and suggested that there should be power to give financial help to them, so that they might fit themselves to carry on their business in a way that would be satisfactory to the community, and conform to the provisions of the reformed legislation. I hope the Government will not lose sight of that, because I am quite sure if help was given in that way, it would go far to persuade public opinion of the propriety of the legislation now before the House.  If that legislation is to be effective it must have public opinion on its side, and that public opinion must affect members of local authorities and producers of milk, as well as purveyors.  There are various <Col N="127" /> other points which can be dealt with, perhaps better, on the later stages of the Bill.  I think the provisions regarding samples are impracticable and are bound to be a failure.  The absence of any definition of &ldquo;dirty milk&rdquo; has been referred to.  It will be extremely hard to get a conviction for selling &ldquo;dirty milk&rdquo; unless there is some definition of &ldquo;dirty milk.&rdquo;  I say further that while one should have regard to the bacteriological examination of milk, the results of that examination will have to be interpreted with great care, regard being had to the period that elapsed from the time the milk was taken to the examination, and the temperature to which it has been exposed during that time.  On that account these results have to be interpreted with considerable care and knowledge.  I would rely more on control of production and the marketing of the milk, upon the direct personal supervision of the cows or byres and cowsheds, of the dairy itself, of the people transporting the milk until it is sold to the public.  I welcome the Bill, and I hope the Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister will give sympathetic ear to the amendments which may be proposed in an endeavour, in which we are all united, that the Bill shall be an effective means of improving the milk supply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to offer one or two comments on this measure, mainly from the angle of its administrative side.  Like everyone else, I welcome the aim behind this measure. That is the aim, as I think it can be truly stated, of trying to provide that milk sold hereafter is, as far as is humanly possible, free from disease and free from infection.  I do not think there is any solidity in the sentiment expressed by the Parliamentary Secretary, when he expressed the hope that people would, in the future, become milk addicts or that milk hereafter will take the place now occupied either by tea or other beverages.  It would be a bad day if that happened, as one might see if he considered the position of milk when in the future it might have to bear the heavy weight of taxation <Col N="128" /> now imposed on tea and on the sugar used with it.  If revenue failed because of the decline in consumption of tea and of such sugar as is taken in it, and if milk had to raise that revenue, it might be more of a set-back to milk than anything we do for milk in this measure.  I am wondering if in attempting to get this very good idea carried out, there has not been a lack of proper consideration of the administrative side.  The Departmental Committee referred to one or two matters, such as the selling of milk in uncovered cans&mdash;a practice observed in Galway more than any place else&mdash;and the practice of leaving cans outside doors while the roundsman was delivering milk, but outside one or two matters of that kind there was nothing special in the report complaining of failure to detect adulteration, to detect milk from which the fats or solids had been abstracted.  Yet there is a section in this measure which changes the law considerably.  This Bill is indeed very drastic as far as administration goes. One section says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Nothing in this Act shall prejudice or affect any other enactment for the time being in force relating to milk and dairies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are, of course, three sections of two Acts repealed.  Some of these deal with cans and receptacles; they are not important, but they are substituted by other more extreme provisions. There is a repeal of the Food and Drugs Act, 1899, Sections 9 and 11.  These deal with the method of marking &ldquo;skimmed&rdquo; milk and oblige people selling milk to have on cans, from which the milk is sold, the seller's names marked in a conspicuous way. We now are to get our nationality advanced by clause 41, which ordains that in future it will be an offence to sell from &ldquo;a vehicle, can or other receptacle,&rdquo; unless the can, vehicle or receptacle has not merely the name or address in a conspicuous place, but also the phrase &ldquo;bainne ar diol.&rdquo;  The word &ldquo;receptacle&rdquo; has been brought in, advisedly, I presume.  Previously, it was a matter of some doubt, when a man was delivering milk from the ordinary milk tin as we know it and <Col N="129" /> poured a certain amount into a smaller tin with which he served a person holding a jug at a door, whether the smaller tin need have his name and address on it.  According to this Bill the small receptacle will have to be labelled with his name and address and have the Irish phrase as well.  As far as the Bill goes, if there is milk in a dairy or in the custody or possession of a dairyman, it is in the absence of proof to the contrary presumed to be kept for sale, and then by other sections where you keep milk for the purpose of sale the milk is supposed to be there for sale for human consumption, and further, as far as certain sections are concerned, for sale as whole milk.  These are big presumptions arising from the mere fact of keeping or having in custody or in the possession of a dairyman a particular substance.</P>
    <P>There is another Bill which we are going to discuss to-day which adds on to the present regulations in regard to the sale of milk the provision that samples of milk may be taken no longer as they used to be, merely in course of delivery, but in course of transit or delivery, so that the point that Deputy Cosgrave was adverting to is not merely met, but, I think, has gone far beyond what was necessary in the way of the reasonable meeting of a difficulty.  Suppose there is a practice by which people send up milk from, say, the Limerick area to Dublin. Some people at the moment have the practice that an examination of that milk is made on arrival in Dublin to see if anything has happened to it on the way, and it is not actually put into course of delivery until it has been taken from a particular platform in Dublin.  As this measure, combined with the other measure, go at the moment, the moment that milk is put on the train at some wayside station in Limerick, it is in course of transit or delivery and a sample can be used to have a man found guilty of an offence under the Food and Drugs Act.</P>
    <P>Take the sample sections.  Deputy Rowlette says that he thinks they will <Col N="130" /> be ineffective and will fail to achieve their purpose.  I can see a frightful embarrassment being caused to anybody who sells milk in the future. Under Part VI of this measure, each of the following persons shall be a milk sampling officer for the purposes of the Act&mdash;the second is a medical officer of health, and that is quite all right; the third is any sanitary officer of a sanitary authority whom such sanitary authority appoints to be a milk sampling officer, and that is not too wide; but the first class is any inspector, and when you go round to the definition section you find that an inspector is any person authorised by the Minister in writing, either generally or for a specific purpose, to exercise all or any of the powers and perform all or any of the duties conferred or imposed on an inspector under this Act.  Remember that nothing in this is to prejudice powers already had, and already under other Acts, any medical officer of health, any inspector of nuisances, any inspector of weights and measures, any inspector of a market or any police constable, under the direction and at the cost of the local authority appointing such officer, constable or inspector, may procure certain things and by a later Act, every officer of what was in the old time the Local Government Board, and which now, I presume, means every officer of the Department of Local Government and Public Health, has a roving commission under the Act of 1899 to take samples and to procure in that way evidence with which to get a person convicted of a criminal matter under the law.</P>
    <P>We are going to have all these inspectors&mdash;the people who are mentioned here are not to be in substitution for any of the previous people&mdash; but there is this further point added, that when it comes to giving evidence in court, samples will be taken as before, and the samples divided according to Section 38 more or less along the old lines and parts made of them, one part being given to the seller and another part sent off for examination. A part is to be produced in court <Col N="131" /> but a later sub-section of Section 38 says that &ldquo;in any proceedings under this Act, a certificate purporting to be under the hand of a sampling officer who took a sample of milk&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;who may be an inspector or any officer of the Department authorised generally or specifically...&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;that the provisions of sub-section (2) of this section were complied with by him&rdquo;&mdash;that is, that the sample was properly taken&mdash;&ldquo;that certificate is <i>prima facie</i> evidence of the matter so certified, and it shall not be necessary to prove the signature of such officer or that he was in fact such officer.&rdquo;  This certificate&mdash;although again it may not be meant, and I take it that there was deliberation about all this; it is in substitution for clauses running right through the Food and Drugs Act, either with regard to analysis or the certificate&mdash;shall be <i>prima facie</i> evidence unless the defendant serves notice that he or she requires the sampling officer or the inspector to be produced at the trial.</P>
    <P>It may be said that there is no necessity to have these people produced. They will only be called on when the person accused&mdash;and remember that we are dealing with a criminal matter in all this&mdash;thinks there is a reason, because if they are called on and if the man brought forward for this particular offence is accused, he will pay for them, for the extra expense he has put the State to in bringing these men along.  There is always that prohibition on a man from bringing an officer along unless there is good reason, so that I do not understand it particularly as the departmental report, on the reading I have been able to do of it, did not seem to me to indicate that they had found very many gaps in the procedure, but without any recommendation and without any case being made for it by the Parliamentary Secretary to-day, we have the whole tendency of the Act, so far as the seller of milk is concerned in the future, a harassing by a very big number of officials, many more than he used to have on his track, and he is not to be allowed for the future to call for the production of the man who signed <Col N="132" /> the certificate as to the doing-up of the sample.</P>
    <P>I think it is a notorious enough fact that in quite a good number of the cases that are brought forward, at least 30 per cent., I would say, the whole decision turns upon whether the sample was properly taken; whether it was divided in the proper way; and whether the sample of milk sent for examination and subject to analysis was in fact the milk that the person was selling at the time, and without any reason being offered in this House we are apparently going to have this new procedure adopted whereby a man can be harassed by very many more officials than ever before, while being deprived of the rights of rebutting a charge that he had previously.  That is entirely on the administration side. Any of the other points that were raised were dealt with by previous speakers.  I do ask those who are in charge of this measure not simply to rest content with the fact that they have a laudable aim in all this matter, but to see that the powers they are seeking are necessary in the circumstances and that the House, before it is asked to pass these very enlarged powers to any group of people, will have cause shown and will be told where the previous Acts have failed and why it is now considered, for any reason either of convenience or expense or the better facilitating of the apprehension of unlawful people, that these powers should be given.  Some case should be made that the old Acts were defective in these respects and that these particular precautions that are now being taken are necessary. The general purport of the Bill is to be commended.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I might perhaps say at the outset that I fully realise that this legislation is rather difficult and that it is not a very popular measure. There are many of the matters that have been raised in the course of this discussion that have given me considerable cause for thought during the past few weeks.  I anticipated most of the criticism we have heard here to-day but I did anticipate that we would get some helpful suggestions <Col N="133" /> from the Deputies who took part in the discussion here.  The flaws and drawbacks of the Bill have been adverted to, as I expected they would be, but the remedies have not been suggested.  I still hope that, on the later stages of the Bill, if any of the Deputies who are interesting themselves in this particular legislation have any better solution of the problem we are trying to solve than we have produced, they will give us the benefit of that solution.  Anything that is calculated to improve the Bill will be very welcome to this side of the House.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mulcahy reminded us of the fact that the draft was four years old and that there were a few things missing from it.  Why was it four years old?  It was four years old for the obvious reason that, the Bill being considered to be bad politics&mdash;a Bill that would be calculated, perhaps, to lessen the political support that a political party might have&mdash;Deputy Mulcahy left it there for four years.  I do not know whether it would be fair to assume that if Deputy Mulcahy were still there, the Bill would still be in draft.  I do not want to make any particular point about that, but I think that when Deputy Mulcahy mentioned that certain things were missing from the Bill that he had in draft for four years, in cold storage, he might have conceded that there were certain very useful additions made to the draft he handed down to us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a good deal of discussion on a question that really does not properly arise on this Bill at all. Deputy Mulcahy, in the course of his remarks, talked about the powers we had under the Bill, but he said that nobody had any power to look at the cow, and practically every speaker took the same line and dwelt upon the necessity, as they saw it, of incorporating in this Bill methods for the eradication of tuberculosis in cattle.  I am quite in agreement with steps being taken&mdash;perhaps more urgent steps than have been taken&mdash;towards the eradication of tuberculosis in cattle as an absolute essential if we are to succeed in our ultimate aim; but that is a matter that cannot properly be dealt <Col N="134" /> with in a Milk Bill.  That is a matter for the Minister for Agriculture, and it ought to be borne in mind, too, that only a small proportion of tubercular cattle may give tubercular milk.</P>
    <P>I need not dwell upon that.  I think that any Deputy that has been interested in the question at all will understand that a cow suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis, or from tuberculosis other than tuberculosis of the udder, may not necessarily give tubercular milk at all.  Viewed from that point of view, the eradication of tuberculosis in cattle cannot be looked upon as a matter that, adequately or properly, could be dealt with in this legislation; but I may say that we, in the Department of Local Government and Public Health, are very much interested in that subject, that we are in touch with the Minister for Agriculture on the matter, and that I believe that the Minister for Agriculture is giving it his close attention.  I believe that he will introduce his own proposals and submit them to the House with the object, as far as he can, at any rate, of eradicating tuberculosis.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy was rather disturbed at the possibility of exorbitant fees being charged for the licences for the special designations.  I do not think that there need be any anxiety on that score.  The fees for these licences will be fixed after consultation with the trade, and, anyhow, it has got to be borne in mind that people who secure licences for the sale and distribution of designated milk will be compensated by the fact that the public will have confidence in their product and that they will get a better market and a better price as a result of having secured a designation licence.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon, apparently, is under the impression that pasteurised milk was the only form of milk that was really safe.  I do not know how deeply he has gone into the subject, but those of us who have been considering the question of pasteurisation are fully convinced that there are methods of pasteurisation that are absolutely useless from the point of view of protecting the public by purifying milk, and that if pasteurisation is to be recognised at all, and if <Col N="135" /> pasteurised milk is to be designated milk, the process of pasteurisation must be definitely set out by regulation; in other words, that any form of pasteurisation will not be sufficient to secure a designation licence.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon also referred to the possibility of tuberculin-tested milk not being absolutely pure.  Well, there is no doubt that there is that possibility; but he apparently did not appreciate the fact that milk from a tuberculin-tested herd will not, under this legislation, be designated as under the special designation unless it has reached a high standard of purity apart altogether from the fact that it has come from a tuberculin-tested herd.  As well as reaching a high standard of purity, it will also have to reach the prescribed standard in the matter of percentage of fat and percentage of other solids. In the course of Deputy Dillon's criticism, he took particular objection to paragraph (a) of sub-section 1 of Section 24, and considered it an outrage on the liberty of the subject to give the powers to the medical officer of health that the Bill purposes to give in that paragraph.  Perhaps I had better read the sub-section for those members of the House who have not the Bill before them.  It reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1) If the medical officer of a sanitary district has reason to suspect that any disease to which this part of this Act applies, is caused, or is likely to be caused, by the consumption of any milk which is being exposed or kept for sale within such sanitary district, he shall ascertain the location of the dairy in which the animal or animals from which such milk was obtained is or are kept...</P>
    <P>The diseases have already been outlined in an earlier section and are very serious diseases for any unfortunate human to contract&mdash;tuberculosis, typhoid fever, paratyphoid fever, diphtheria, membranous croup and scarlatina.</P>
    <P>If a medical officer of health has reason to suspect that a certain dairy is responsible for the spread of any one or more of these diseases, he is empowered under this section&mdash;and <Col N="136" /> Deputy Dillon is outraged at the thought of it&mdash;to examine the dairy and, if he so thinks fit, examine &ldquo;any person engaged in the service thereof, or resident in the dairy, or who may be resident in any premises where any person employed in such dairy may reside,&rdquo; and so on.  If we are, under the operation of this Bill, to place a medical officer of health who is responsible for the health of his district in a position to protect the community from the spread of these contagious and infectious diseases, we must give him the powers outlined in this Bill. There may be typhoid carriers in that dairy, or diphtheria contacts, and unless he has power to examine the persons who are engaged in, or who have contact with the dairy, his efforts to ultimately trace and stamp out this infection will be utterly futile.</P>
    <P>In the course of Deputy Dillon's discourse on pasteurisation he mentioned the widely different results that were got by different bacteriologists and in that way would, I suppose, create in the lay mind the idea that all this bacteriological examination was so much nonsense and really was not a useful guide as to purity.  I should like to have asked Deputy Dillon, if he were here, if the samples that were taken from the same bottle and examined by these four different bacteriologists were kept in ice; because, if they were not, even an intelligent layman knows that bacterial multiplication is very rapid and that, unless the sample is stored in ice, in a few hours the bacterial content might be very considerably altered.  However, I do not suppose I need go into that any further.</P>
    <P>We have had a good deal of criticism of the fact that we have not attempted to define dirty or contaminated milk in the Bill.  Deputy Rowlette was honest enough, however, to admit that it was a very difficult matter to give a definition of what would constitute dirty milk or what would constitute contaminated milk.  That is one of the matters on which I hoped to get some assistance from this debate, but I must say that, as far as dirty or contaminated milk is concerned, I am not any wiser than I was before this discussion <Col N="137" /> started.  Generally speaking, dirty milk, in the Courts at any rate, is held to be milk that contains visible dirt and contaminated milk is usually held to be that which contains certain bacterial contamination.  The question of a definition of either one or the other is an exceedingly difficult one.  We are still examining it and still hoping that we may be able to get a satisfactory definition.  If a satisfactory definition can be evolved before the Bill reaches its final stages, we will still attempt to define &ldquo;dirty&rdquo; or &ldquo;contaminated&rdquo;; but if we cannot get a satisfactory definition, I think we will have to leave it to the Courts to interpret what &ldquo;dirty&rdquo; or &ldquo;contaminated&rdquo; means.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>It can.  It is only a very rough and ready definition that is held in the courts up to the present: dirty, when it is visible dirt; contaminated, when it is invisible dirt.  Someone raised a point about the fees for the tuberculin tests and complained about the additional burden that this would be on the owner of a dairy herd.  It is usual to have all the animals tested at the same time and the fee per cow, of course, is correspondingly reduced then, depending on the number of cattle that may be tested at a particular time.  I think, however, the fact that 144 milk producers have at their own expense carried out the procedure of tuberculin testing in order to be able to compete for the contracts for the free milk supply is in itself evidence enough that the fees are not deterring people from getting their herds tuberculin tested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A good deal of stress has been laid on what has been considered a defect in the Bill inasmuch as it does not provide for the licensing of all milk vendors.  I presume that Deputies realise that the Bill does provide, at any rate, for the licensing of vendors of designated milk.  We have at least <Col N="138" /> made that advance&mdash;that under the Bill nobody can sell milk purporting to have special qualities or special degrees of purity unless the milk has actually reached that standard of purity.  We have power, of course, for the registration of all people who sell milk&mdash;for the registration of dairies&mdash; and we have the power of inspection. I am open to conviction on the question. It is quite likely that the licensing of all milk vendors would be a useful addition to the Bill.  If any of the Deputies on the opposite side of the House or on the Independent Benches introduce an amendment to that effect it certainly will be very sympathetically examined, and unless it can be shown that there is some reason why it should not be incorporated in the Bill, I think there is a reasonable chance that it would be added to it.</P>
    <P>On the question of machinery, Deputy Rowlette is dissatisfied, of course, with the machinery in the counties where we have not a county medical officer of health.  Even since Deputy Rowlette got these figures we have made some further advance in the matter of having county medical officers of health appointed.  When the appointments, pending at the present time, have been made there will only be five outstanding areas and we will hope that we will lessen that number in the near future by friendly negotiation.</P>
    <P>I think we are coming rapidly to the time when if we cannot have these county medical officers of health appointed by mutual agreement the Minister will exercise the powers vested in him and compel the local authorities to appoint county medical officers of health.  In the meantime the assistance of the veterinary inspectors will be available in each area and, I think, in the few areas that will be outstanding when this Bill becomes law, that during the transition period and until such time as we get uniformity as to the county medical officers of health, we will have such machinery, though it may not be the best machinery, that will secure the benefits aimed at by this legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time. This legislation is intended to supplement the provisions of the Milk Bill, 1934, and to amend, in certain respects, the existing Sale of Food and Drugs Acts in order to bring their requirements, so far as they concern milk, into general conformity with the proposed legislation for improving the purity and the wholesomeness of the milk supply.</P>
      <P>Section 1 of the Bill deals with the definitions and, <i>inter alia</i>, defines whole milk.</P>
      <P>Section 2 confers power on the Minister for Agriculture, after consultation with the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, to make regulations prescribing the percentages of milk fat and milk solids other than milk fat in whole milk, of milk solids in skimmed or separated milk, of milk fat in cream and of milk fat and milk solids in buttermilk.  The object of this section is to make better provision for dealing with the vendor of milk which is found to be deficient in its constituents.  Under Section 6 of the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1875, such vendor may be prosecuted for selling &ldquo;to the prejudice of the consumer, any article of food which is not of the nature, substance and quality demanded by the purchaser.&rdquo;  It was found necessary to amend that section by Section 4 of the Act of 1899 with a view to determining what deficiency in the normal constituents of milk should raise a presumption that the milk was not genuine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as whole milk is concerned, the efficacy of this amendment of the law has been considerably lessened by the use of the defence referred to colloquially as &ldquo;straight from the cow.&rdquo;  This defence relies on evidence that the milk as sold was of the same constitution as when it came from the <Col N="140" /> cow and is a rebutting of the presumption that the milk was not genuine, raised under Section 4 of the Act of 1899.  The courts have held that such evidence unless disproved prevents a conviction.  Even where such evidence is untrue, it is obviously very difficult to rebut it and an amendment of the law on the subject is essential if fraudulent milk vendors are to be adequately dealt with.  The Minister for Agriculture has expressed the opinion that the presumption of non-genuiness of whole milk which does not contain the prescribed percentages of milk fats and of milk solids not fat should be made a conclusive presumption, which cannot be rebutted in respect of milk intended for human consumption in the form of milk.  The provisions of this section therefore abolish the defence of &ldquo;straight from the cow&rdquo; in respect of whole milk.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the Act of 1899, in so far as it relates to milk and cream, is repealed by this section of the Bill and provision is made for the fixing of an appointed day for the operation of this section.</P>
    <P>Sections 3, 4, 5 and 6 deal with amendments in the procedure for taking samples of milk for the purposes of the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, and enable such samples to be taken without payment and in course of transit or delivery.</P>
    <P>Section 7 requires a purveyor of milk to disclose to the sampling officer on receipt of a notice for the purpose the name and address of the seller or consignor from whom he received the supply of milk from which the sample has been taken, together with particulars of the time and place of delivery of future consignments of milk from such seller or consignor.</P>
    <P>The provision in Section 8 is intended to operate in cases in which a defence that the milk has been purchased under a written warranty of its genuineness is intended to be relied on.  In such circumstances a purveyor who wishes to avail of such a defence is required to serve notice on the sampling authority within sixty hours after the taking of a sample, stating the name and address of the person who sold him the milk, <Col N="141" /> and particulars of the time and place of delivery of future consignments from such person and requesting the sampling authority to have samples of the milk taken in course of transit from such person.  If the sampling authority fails to comply with this request no proceedings can be taken in respect of the sample.  Where a warranty is pleaded this procedure will enable the prosecution to test whether the defendant sold the milk in the same condition in which it was received.</P>
    <P>Section 9 has the effect of voiding any provision in a contract which requires a purveyor of milk, on a sample of his milk being taken under the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, to send to the person from whom the milk has been procured, any part of such sample or to notify that person of the sample having been taken.</P>
    <P>Section 10 provides for approved expenses incurred by the Minister for Agriculture under the Bill being paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Section 11 prescribes the title of the Act and citation with the other similar Acts as the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, 1875 to 1934.</P>
    <P>It is hoped that the passing of this legislation will enable the quality of the milk supply intended for human consumption to be maintained at a proper standard consonant with the importance of the dairying industry of this country, and that it would provide a serious deterrent to attempts on the part of fraudulent purveyors of milk to secure dishonest profits at the expense of the health of the infants and young children in whose dietary milk is so large a part.</P>

      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time. The object of this Bill is to enable two <Col N="142" /> or more county health districts to be established in a county and to make provision for the consequences arising from the division of an existing rural sanitary area.  A similar power was granted by Section 9 (2) of the Local Government Act, 1925, but the power lapsed on the day appointed for the operation of that Act.  While this Bill is general in its application the urgent need for it arises out of the condition of things existing in County Cork.  I am surprised that we have not all the Cork Deputies here.  I thought that they would be of great assistance to us in the discussion of this Bill, but possibly they may not have known that the Bill would reach us so soon.  I suppose Deputy O'Neill will be able to answer for the rest.  The Cork Deputies usually agree when it is a matter of Cork.  The proposed revival and exercise of the power granted under Section 9 (2) of the Local Government Act of 1925 is now complicated by the existence of county health districts and of boards of health established in pursuance of the Local Government Act, 1925.  Provision must, therefore, be made in the present legislation for dealing with the assets, liabilities, choses in action, officers, etc., of any board of health administering a county health district which it is desired to divide.</P>
      <P>The immediate demand for this legislation arises from the request of the Cork County Council and the Cork County Board of Public Health for the division into three parts of the Cork county health district as at present constituted, and for the setting up of a board of health for each such part in lieu of the existing county board of public health.  This division has become necessary owing to the inability of one board of public health to deal with the numerous matters arising in the domain of public health in so large a county health district as Cork.</P>

    <P>Part I of the Bill deals with the Title and necessary definitions and the payment of expenses incurred by the Minister for Local Government and Public Health in the execution of its provisions.  Part II of the Bill authorises the Minister for Local <Col N="143" /> Government and Public Health, on the request of the council of a county, to make a dividing order constituting two or more rural sanitary districts in the county, defining their boundaries and fixing an appointed day for the operation of such order.  The Minister may also, on the request of the council, make an order before the appointed day altering the number of members of the council.  Subsequent to the making of a dividing order, if circumstances so require, he shall make a new division of the county into county electoral areas so as to ensure that every county electoral area shall be wholly within one or other of the new rural sanitary districts and he shall fix the number of members of the county council to be elected for each electoral area.</P>
    <P>Provision is made for the carrying into effect of a dividing order in relation to the abolition of the existing rural sanitary district and board of health, the constitution and naming of the new county health districts, the establishment of a sanitary authority for each such district and the application to the new districts of the provisions of the Local Government Acts.  It is also prescribed that as from the first annual meeting of the county council held after the next triennial election of the county council subsequent to the making of the dividing order, the board of health for each new district shall consist of the members of the county council elected for the county electoral areas comprised in that district.  Prior to the annual meeting of the county council referred to, the constitution of each board of health shall be fixed by the county council.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill contains consequential provisions in connection with the dissolution of the existing board of health of the county health district intended to be divided.  It first sets forth definitions of certain terms used in this portion of the Bill.  It prescribes the transfer to the county councils on the appointed day of all property, rights, powers and privileges of the existing board of health, and any such property, right, power or <Col N="144" /> privilege may then be conveyed by the council to the board of health of a new district.  The debts and liabilities of the existing board of health shall at the same time be transferred to the county council by whom they are to be paid or discharged.</P>
    <P>Separate provisions are laid down in regard to the chargeability of expenditure incurred under the Labourers (Ireland) Acts as before the 1st April, 1933, and subsequent to that date, and arrangements are made for continuing the chargeability of other liabilities of the existing board of health on the same areas on which they were charged immediately before the appointed day. Arrangements are made for the discharge of paying orders issued by the existing board of health and not paid before the appointed day.  It is enacted that any right, power, privilege or authority vested in the existing board of health under any contract, agreement or licence so far as it is exerciseable in or in relation to a new district or the relevant joint districts as defined in the Local Government Act, 1927, shall be vested in the board of health of such new district. Provision is made for the preservation of continuing contracts and of by-laws, rules, regulations, resolutions, orders and notices of the existing board of health which are applicable to a new district or relevant joint district.  The continuance of legal proceedings pending in connection with the existing board of health is arranged for as well as the admissibility as evidence of books and documents of the existing board of health.  Directions are given for an audit of the accounts of the existing board of health up to the appointed day.</P>
    <P>In connection with the transfer of officers of the existing board of health, a scheme is to be prepared by that board not later than two months before the appointed day and submitted to the Minister, every such officer being notified of the proposal relating to him contained in the scheme.  This scheme shall provide in respect of every officer either (a) for his continuance by the board of health of a new district in the same office which he holds, or in an analogous office, or (b) for his <Col N="145" /> appointment with his consent to another office, or (c) for his removal from office.</P>
    <P>Where an officer is to be continued in the same office, or appointed to a new office in the service of the board of health of a new district, and his whole-time is not occupied by the duties of his office, he may be continued in or appointed to another office or other offices in the service of one or more of the boards of health of the new districts.  It is open to any officer of the existing board of health to object to the proposals relating to him contained in the scheme.  The Minister shall, before the appointed day, confirm the scheme with such alterations as he may think fit.  Superannuation rights are reserved for officers removed from office under the scheme.</P>
    <P>Powers are taken authorising the Minister, by order, to make certain consequential adjustments which may be necessary in regard to the joint use of property by two or more boards of health of new districts, the performance by a board of health of a new district of functions in relation to another district, payments by the board of health of one new district to the board of health of another new district, the performance by the county council of any functions of the existing board of health, representation of the board of health of a new district on public bodies in which the existing board of health were represented and in regard to such other matters as he may consider necessary.</P>
    <P>It is not anticipated that, apart from the question of the establishment of three county health districts in Cork County, the Minister will be called on to exercise the powers contained in this Bill; but it is necessary that the contingency of such an application should be provided for.  The provisions are practically of a non-contentious character and as it is desirable that the powers in regard to the county should be exercised at an early date, it is hoped that this legislation will be passed without undue delay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill represents the Ministry's answer to the demand that has been sent up on more <Col N="146" /> than one occasion by the county council and the county board of health.  I welcome the measure because I think it will help to enable the local authorities in Cork to embark on a good deal of useful work that has been held up pending the introduction of this Bill.  A great many of us in touch with the local authorities there feel that the contribution of the county board of health to the matter of housing rural labourers falls very far short of what it ought to be and that the scheme for the erection of many more labourers' cottages has indirectly been held up pending legislation to divide the county into three parts for the purpose of the Labourers Acts.  Bound up with this Bill also is the question of housing schemes for a number of the smaller towns in County Cork that have not urban powers.  The position of a good many towns without urban powers and without power to initiate housing schemes except through the agency of one board of health is not a happy one.  One board of health representing the whole county has unfortunately taken the view that there should be some sort of a local charge area in connection with housing schemes.  Consequently, a good many housing schemes for North and West Cork have been held up.  I believe one of the fruits of this Bill will be the tackling of such schemes immediately.  I think that the Bill will help to do very valuable work in that connection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad also that the Parliamentary Secretary is considering the question of the membership of the board of health.  We are not in a very happy position at the present time in regard to the board of health in County Cork.  Following the recent elections large sections of the public representatives of Cork have been expelled from membership of the board of health.  That appears to be in pursuance of a set policy.  We have a purely partisan body and the most rigid tests are applied even in regard to applications for labourers' cottages. This Bill will help to ease that position and, ultimately, to end it.  If it does no good otherwise, it will have done very well.  However, I think that the <Col N="147" /> most valuable results that will accrue from the passing of the Bill will be the speeding up of housing schemes in the county&mdash;both in the small towns and in the rural areas.  As the Parliamentary Secretary has said, the Bill is non-contentious inasmuch as it has been sought by all sections of public representatives in the county.  The need for the Bill is even more apparent now than when the measure was originally demanded.  I welcome the Bill, which will be a very valuable piece of legislation. It will end overlapping, bring about some sort of unified control and result in substantial progress in respect of housing in the rural areas and public works generally in the county.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:&mdash;</P>
    <P>That in view of continued widespread unemployment the Dáil instructs the Executive Council to make available forthwith sufficient money to permit of the carrying out of large scale schemes of public works, so as to relieve the distress caused by unemployment&mdash;Deputies William Norton, William Davin, Timothy Murphy, Richard Corish.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of the debate on this motion, before the adjournment of the House last August, several suggestions&mdash;most of them helpful and calculated to solve, at least partially, this problem of unemployment&mdash;were made.  The suggestion that appeared to receive most support here and&mdash;I say authoritatively &mdash;that has received most support in the country was that an earnest and consistent endeavour should be made to arrive at an honourable settlement of the economic dispute with our neighbours across the Channel.  The continuance of a war of attrition of this character&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should make his speech and not read it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall hand my notes to the Minister if he wishes. This dispute is disastrous alike to the Irish Free State and to Great Britain. That, I think, is acknowledged even by a Minister of such small intelligence as the Minister for Finance.  Of course a suggestion of this character would be regarded by the super-patriots as one that emanated from an enemy of the Free State and a friend of Great Britain.  We would be told that, in <Col N="149" /> making a suggestion of this character, we were playing England's game.  It should be remembered when discussing the problem of unemployment in this country that to the depression in agriculture is mainly due the depression in the industrial market in the cities and towns of the Free State. Lest there should be any doubt in the mind of the Minister or his Government, I shall quote figures from the official returns relating to unemployment issued by the Department of Industry and Commerce from April 3, 1934, to November 5, 1934.  On April 3, 1934, there were on the live register&mdash; that is, the register to which the Minister for Industry and Commerce so frequently refers when he is endeavouring to explain away unemployment and also when he is endeavouring to show that employment is on the increase and unemployment is decreasing&mdash;92,817 men.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were 101,730 persons signing the register on that date but that figure included women and juveniles. On the 16th April, 1934, there were 88,367 men on the live register.  The total, including women and juveniles, was 96,987, which shows a decrease of roughly 3,000 or 4,000 persons.  On September 10, there were 94,439 men on the live register.  The total, including women and juveniles, was 104,260. On the 24th September, 1934, there was 100,087 men&mdash;mark the progressive increase in the number of unemployed &mdash;signing the live register, the total, including women and juveniles, being 110,186.  On October 1st, there were on the live register 102,932 men&mdash;I leave out for the moment the total increase in women and juveniles.  On October 22, there were 105,575 men, and on November 5, the latest date for which figures are available, we get the enormous total of persons signing the live register in the official figures supplied by the Department of Industry of 108,742 men.  On that date there was a total of persons including women and juveniles of 119,428 persons.  Yet we can be very glibly told by the Minister for Finance, and occasionally by the Minister for Industry and Commerce that though the volume of unemployment has increased the number of <Col N="150" /> persons unemployed is greatly lessened. His own figures, as given on 5th November, are 108,742 men signing the live register.</P>
    <P>In Cork&mdash;and these are also official figures&mdash;on the 26th March, 1934, there were 4,900 persons on the live register, of whom 1,858 were in receipt of unemployment insurance benefit, some of this number being also in receipt of home assistance, as the Minister will readily understand.  On the 13th October, 1934, the last day for which figures were available, there were 6,804 unemployed as against 4,900 on the 26th March.  Of that 6,804 persons, 3,309 were in receipt of unemployment assistance.  The figures I have given to the House make it manifest that so far from employment being found for increased numbers of persons, reducing to some appreciable extent, the number of persons unemployed, notwithstanding all the talk about new factories&mdash;and some of them have been referred to by Deputy Norton as &ldquo;baby factories&rdquo; or something of that kind&mdash;the figures I have quoted show that unemployment is on the increase.</P>
    <P>The motion on the Order paper was put down so far as my memory serves me as long ago as last February or March.  The terms of that motion were &ldquo;That in view of the continued widespread unemployment the Dail instructs the Executive Council to make available forthwith sufficient money to permit of the carrying out of large scale schemes of public works so as to relieve the distress caused by unemployment.&rdquo; Today, as I have just shown, conclusively I think, unemployment is continuing and increasing. This is shown by the figures I have quoted, the latest available showing a huge increase.</P>
    <P>The President in one of his pronouncements, some year or two ago, declared that the problem of unemployment was more easily solved in this country than in any other country. I am not quoting his exact words, but these are as near as I can go to them, and I do not think the President would question them.  If that is true, if unemployment is more capable of solution in this country than in any other country that President de Valera <Col N="151" /> knows of, I am wondering how it is that instead of showing a decrease in the figures of unemployment in recent months there has been a huge increase.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnDonnelly" hpid="Mr. Donnelly Mr. Donnelly">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>We will come to that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnDonnelly" hpid="Mr. Donnelly Mr. Donnelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnelly</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>We heard something about the ratio of those persons unemployed to the population.  The ratio to-day is greater than ever it was in this country.  The Deputy knows that, and he also knows that from Fianna Fáil platforms, all over the country before the last general election, Ministers, and many of their followers, told the people that they had stopped emigration.  As I pointed out before, they did not stop emigration.  It was Uncle Sam stopped that.  The Deputy may laugh, but he knows as well as I do that many a young Irishman would be glad enough to go to America to-day if they only had the opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnDonnelly" hpid="Mr. Donnelly Mr. Donnelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Not at all.  They are coming home from America.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the mentality of the Deputy.  He believes his party stopped emigration, but, as I told him, it was Uncle Sam stopped it.  Under Fianna Fáil administration unemployment is worse by many thousands than ever it was before in this country.  We were told that with an intensified campaign for tariffs we would have factories in every town and village that would absorb most of the unemployed people.  Certainly some attempt has been made to create factories and new industries and to foster some of the old ones.  But what do we find as a result of this enterprise?  We find in nearly all cases these factories give employment to juvenile persons under the age of 16.  When they reach the age of 16 and become insurable they get their marching orders and further child labour is exploited.  Let us come down to brass tacks in this matter and what do we find?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="152" /> We find Fianna Fáil spokesmen before the elections, during the elections, and even up to now, making the claim that they would reduce taxation by many millions and increase employment by many thousands. The figures I have just read out negative that statement of that promise which Fianna Fáil held out to the electors of this country when they were seeking their suffrages at the last general election.  I would ask the Minister and his Government to accept this motion and to make a serious endeavour to grapple with this question of unemployment.  It is not by the creation of these little twopence halfpenny factories that give employment to a few little girls, whilst their parents are walking unemployed around the streets of Dublin, Cork and of other towns, that the industrial arm of this country will be built up.  We had it on the authority of many of the Ministers that after a few years of Fianna Fáil government, not alone would we have reduced taxation, not alone would we have created further employment for the people, but that we would have reduced very considerably the personnel of the Civil Service and that we would have reduced very considerably the amount expended year after year in administrative expenses.  What do we find?  We find that every other day you are adding to your permanent officials.  You are creating new posts for civil servants every other day of the week.  I recollect in answer to a question put down here, I think it was last session, that the Minister admitted that appointments had been made in one branch of the Civil Service which meant an increase of £63,000 per annum on the national expenditure.  Not later than a few weeks ago, another army of inspectors were engaged to go round the country to tell the farmer when to sell his cattle and when to hold them back.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, Sir, with all respect.  I want to pay a most subtle <Col N="153" /> compliment to the Minister, who is certainly endeavouring to create employment in the Civil Service and thereby to solve to some extent at least the unemployment problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy ever read the records of the House? It was stated here a short time ago that there are fewer individuals in the employment of the State than there were when we took office and that the Civil Service is costing less.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose you fired a lot of people on the other side.  We were told that expenditure would be reduced.  It is my belief, it is the belief of any man who gives any serious consideration at all to the financial position of this country, that we are fast reaching the stage when 40 per cent. of the population will be supporting the other 60 per cent., and at least 20 per cent. of that 40 per cent. will be civil servants.  The length of time that that 40 per cent. will be able to support the other 60 per cent. will be measured by the length of time they are able to hold out.  I am aware that this question of unemployment is not very easy of solution.  I do not suggest for one moment that, with one wave of the pen, any Minister or any Government could settle this problem, but at least a decent attempt could be made to settle it.  It is a problem which is giving very grave concern to heads of governments in other countries.  Other countries are endeavouring by all means at their disposal to overhaul their whole economic system&mdash;a complete overhaul as far as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>If the complete overhaul which the Deputy has in his mind means making dearer for the consumer of the country everything he wants to consume, and that everything he has to sell has to be produced at a loss, that is not the kind of economic change I want to see brought about. The farmer has to pay more for what he buys in the cities and towns and he is getting less for the produce that he sells off his own farm.</P>

      <P>I want to hear this. I generally get the better of these exchanges.  I would much prefer that he were allowed to have his say.  This will appeal even to the Northern intelligentsia&mdash;the figures which the Minister for Finance so very kindly quotes in the Dáil and the figures of his fellow-Minister, the figures coming from the Department of Industry and Commerce.  Again I suggest to the House that no serious attempt is being made to solve this unemployment problem.  Deputy Norton made some strictures upon the Government's attempt to solve this problem.  So far he has not been effectively answered. Nobody who stood up on the other side has controverted the figures he gave to the House relating to the wages paid in some of the factories&mdash;for child labour in most of them.</P>

      <P>While the good old Cork accent is understood in Donegal, I am afraid that we could never understand the Donegal accent in Cork.  I can always deal with cross-fire, but I still feel this is a matter that should be approached in the most serious vein.  I have suggested that the Fianna Fáil Government never made a serious attempt to grapple with the problem. I have also said that I feel that to some extent at least there should be an overhauling of the economic system in this country.  I admit that certain attempts were made, but these attempts were, in my view, begun at the wrong end. I would much prefer to see established in this country an industry giving employment to 100 men than to see five little factories springing up giving employment to 500 underpaid girls and boys.  I do not want to detain the House at any great length, but this motion has been on the Order Paper for very many months.</P>
      <P>Personally, I would like to see the motion disposed of this week or next week so that we might get on with the other important motions that are on the Order Paper.  I sincerely hope that Government Deputies as well as the members of the Government, when asked to vote on this motion, will go into the lobby with the movers and supporters of it.</P>

The fundamental contention of the Opposition is that registrations for employment, that the total number of people who indicate in some regular and accepted manner their desire and willingness to <Col N="156" /> take work if it is offered to them, is an indication of unemployment and of the distressed condition of the country. If we accept that, then there is no answer to the question.  All you have got to do is to get the figures and the case is proved.  Our difficulty is that the whole of the evidence in our possession is entirely the contrary to any such contention.  The evidence in our possession suggests that the actual number of people on the unemployment register at any two periods is not a comparable measure in any sense of the pressure of unemployment, but merely of the degree in which the total of all the people who might be put upon such a register has reacted favourably to the various artificial stimuli which have been used to induce them to register.  There is a fundamental difference in outlook upon these figures.  One says, if the figures go up by ten thousand then it means that there are ten thousand units more of an indication of economic distressful conditions; and the other says if it goes up by ten thousand let us enquire why it has gone up by ten thousand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want Deputies to go back in imagination to the unemployment figures, as they were called, previous to the coming in of this Government.  You will find, if you take them year by year, that every year they rose slightly as a total, but every year they maintained precisely the same seasonal characteristic. There was always a peak somewhere between January and February. There was always a hollow in June and July; there was always again a peak coming on to Christmas, and each year that characteristic remained.  It was what we have come to call in this House the seasonal characteristic of the unemployment curve.  Now, at that time the maximum figure attained &mdash;the two peaks&mdash;was somewhere in the neighbourhood of thirty thousand, but these were thirty thousand people registering under a particular stimulus, a very limited stimulus.  They were people registering who had no real reason to believe that registration, as such, would bring them employment at all.  They registered largely as part of the machinery by which they paid into, had accumulated for them and drew <Col N="157" /> out of an unemployment insurance fund the contributions of labour, employers, and of the State.  As far as the body of what you might call unskilled labour, or casual labour at any rate, was concerned they registered in the knowledge that no man who did not come under a specified, a segregated, category could get employment through that particular channel.  As, in my opinion, having regard to all the circumstances and for a brief time possibly, a justifiably economic sanitary expedient, it was arranged that the large number of people artificially recruited into the National Army and as artificially demobilised should have a preference in employment, and a register was compiled of people who either belonged to insurable employment or a very small proportion in addition of casual labourers who had been members of the National Army and who had a privileged position in employment in virtue of that fact.  In addition to that, registration took place at places widely distant from one another.  In some cases, it was necessary for men to travel fifteen and twenty miles if they did, in fact, desire to register.</P>

      <P>All right; I will get the Deputy the figures.  As a result, when we came to use that unemployment register, as it was called, as the only State evidence which was in our possession for the purposes of the distribution of unemployment relief upon a logical and fair basis, we found that it had no reality or validity at all along those lines.  As regards the money which is provided by this House for the purposes of unemployment relief&mdash;I am only bringing this in because it is in relation to this that we had carefully to analyse it&mdash;the idea is that that money shall be used in those places and for those people where there is distress and for people who are in distress, but when we came to plot the whole record of the unemployment register on a map for the purpose of the distribution of the relief given by this Dáil to the people who really were in distress, we found that not one penny practically <Col N="158" /> of that money, if distributed upon that basis, would have gone to any single poor district in the whole of the Saorstát. I will give the House a map at a later date.  I will give the House a poverty map of the Saorstát calculated on an investigation of the conditions of every separate one of the 3,000 electoral areas in the Saorstát.  I will give them that in the form of a coloured map which will indicate to them the degree of poverty and distress normal to this country over that area.  In order to illustrate the particular point which I have now, I will indicate upon a similar map, side by side with it, the distribution of unemployment as indicated by the pre-existing unemployment figure.  What you are going to find is an absolute reversal of conditions.  If the pre-existing unemployment figures are to be taken as an indication of distress in this country, then they are going to prove that distress and poverty exist in every rich area in Ireland, and that comfort and prosperity exist in every district in Ireland which other indications will prove to be poor districts. In other words, the fundamental basis upon which the whole of the argument in relation to the use of the unemployment figure is based goes by the board.  The original figures as a datum on which to work and as a basis of calculation are useless, and I need hardly tell any logically-minded person in this House that all calculations on a basis which is false must necessarily be false in their conclusions.</P>

      <P>Now what happened?  In 1932 this Government, when it came in, announced that it would fundamentally alter the basis and the <Col N="159" /> purposes of unemployment registration. The original purpose of unemployment registration was to find for a willing commercial employer labour which was value for money to him; in other words, to provide the commercial employer with desirable commercial employees.  It was to do it only in segregated and defined classes, and under conditions in which there was no general inducement to register.  The Government decided that they would see that the registration in Ireland was convenient to everybody.  Instead of widely distant places of registration they arranged for registration at every post office, at every Gárda barracks&mdash;at every place which was available.  It became far easier to register than not to register.  That was number one.  The second step was that they invited people to register who were not in those segregated classes.  The third thing they did was to offer an unemployment grant of £2,000,000 for the purpose of employing people who were in distress.  They required as a necessary qualification for enjoyment of that fund that people should under those new facilities register themselves for employment.  Further, they announced that the distribution of the £2,000,000 Unemployment Fund would territorially be upon the basis of registration in those areas.  As soon as you compare the figures under the old basis and the figures under the new basis you are comparing glasses of milk and elephants&mdash;two things which do not vary merely in degree but things which vary in their fundamental nature.  Instead of the employment exchanges being for the purpose of finding men for commercial employers on the basis of their commercial value, they became predominantly places of registration where men would get from the State unemployment benefit on the basis of their necessity.  Is it seriously suggested that two things so fundamentally different and contradictory in their nature are capable of comparison?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What was the result?  There should have been no result if the contention <Col N="160" /> is that numbers registered are an indication of economic conditions. There could not be any wild change in economic conditions overnight.  If the contention which has been put forward here to-night, and which is fundamentally the contention all over the country in relation to those figures is correct there should have been no response to that stimulation. But what was the result?  The result was that registration, without any change of conditions, rose like a wall. We have the registration before the stimulation took place; we have the response of the registration to stimulation.  It should not have arisen at all if the general contention in relation to the meaning of unemployment registration is correct.  It rose from 34,000 at the end of May to 80,000 at the end of July; then it resumed the seasonal characteristics. Where did that registration take place in the register which it is suggested should be regarded as comparable with the pre-existing register?  Did it take place in the same classes that were registered?  Did it take place in the same areas?</P>
    <P>The pre-existing registration took place in all the rich districts east of the Shannon.  The new registration took place entirely in the poorer districts west of the Shannon.  The pre-existing registration took place in the boroughs and in places where industrial employment of one kind or another had an existence.  It took place in the more prosperous towns, in trades of a specific kind and of an insurable character.  The registration which now took place raised the register from 34,000 to 80,000 in nine weeks, and took place entirely in the area of the non-industrial, the non-wealthy and the non-insurable classes. The total having been multiplied by the amount of the stimulant the pool again resumed its natural seasonal characteristic.  It remained so until it reached a total of 105,000 before Christmas week, 1932.</P>
    <P>The same stimulated condition of extra registration, the use of the employment exchanges for the purpose of providing employment for people who were registered, and the distribution <Col N="161" /> of unemployment relief on a perfectly fair basis, on the ground of unemployment, and the old character of which I have spoken&mdash;I do not know whether the eye of the House is good enough to see the diagrams&mdash; remains.  I live with these diagrams and am perhaps more familiar with them.  The actual seasonal characteristic was then resumed, dropping at the beginning of the year, and rising again in the winter.  All that had happened was that the total had been increased in answer to the stimulant, and the old law of seasonal change was resumed.  That went on until the end of 1933.  There was introduced into this House on August 9th, 1933, the First Stage of the Unemployment Assistance Bill, which was completed in November, 1933.  At the end of 1933 it was announced that this new Act provided unemployment assistance for able-bodied men who were in necessity who would register.  On January 1, or approximate thereto, the unregistered pool of possible registrants at labour exchanges was informed that it would come into operation on or about April 1.  In other words: &ldquo;If you want unemployment assistance, register.&rdquo;  That was a new stimulant.  If the contention of the Opposition is correct, that the mere number of registrants is an indication of the economic and distressed condition of the country, there should have been no response, and the seasonal characteristic with which we are familiar, which had survived the stimulant of 1932 and which proceeded all through 1933, should have continued. A seasonal drop should have begun in January and should have continued until July.  But did it?  It did not.  I have taken out of these graphs the actual difference between what it would have been, if the contention of Deputies opposite was correct, and what it is, and I defy anybody to find a more complete mathematical proof of any general contention than the proof they will find in these papers, that the increase of registration, the artificial upsetting of the seasonal characteristic, was due to specific stimulation.  On January 1 it started rising, and the difference <Col N="162" /> between what it should have been, and what it is, rose every week until it reached a maximum at the date which was set down as the date when this particular Act would come into operation. There were 34,000 more people on the register on April 1 than would have been if the characteristic had been adopted.  That was the date at which registration was to come in, and then the seasonal characteristic resumed control again.  The big rush and stimulant had absorbed the wise people&mdash;the maidens who had their lamps trimmed.</P>
    <P>The first rush came in and exhausted itself on the very date on which it had been arranged the Act would come into operation.  There was then a lull period before the unobservant virgins decided to trim their lamps.  The end of February was the date of the first applications for certificates.  In the month of March, in response to this stimulant, 115,000 people came forward and made applications for registration certificates.  By the end of April the number had reached 175,000, and it is now somewhere about 225,000. People came forward to register and applied for certificates, knowing that not one of them can actually get advantage out of any of these certificates unless they are upon the register as people who are unemployed and people seeking unemployment assistance.  The highest previous figure we ever had was 105,000, and to this there has been added an undiscovered pool, making a total pool of 220,000 people, who are capable of seeking to be on the register and everyone of these has a statutory inducement to put his name upon the register, and yet we are asked to believe that nothing of any kind has happened but a change in economic conditions in order to induce people to get upon the register. How any man, knowing these figures, having any idea of the existence of a condition such as this, can make the contention that is now being made, and make it honestly, passes my comprehension.</P>
    <P>I get back now to the first statement which I made.  The evidence at <Col N="163" /> present in our possession would suggest that the actual number of people on the unemployment register at any two periods is not a comparable measure in any sense of the pressure of distress or unemployment, but merely of the degree in which the total of all the people who might be put upon such a register has reacted favourably to the various artificial stimuli which have been in use to induce them so to register.  But you can go a lot further and you can find from the register which of the registrants have been registering regularly before the date in question, and which are fresh comers.  If, for instance, you found that there was a large increase in strange faces in any particular gathering you would say that something was happening.  In the same way if you find a large number of people who have not registered before and who are of the nature and quality that did not previously register, you would say that there has to be some new kind of explanation for it.</P>
    <P>Take the quarter ended 1st October, 1933.  The number of fresh registrations was 32,000&mdash;I am giving round figures&mdash; and the number of old registrations was 68,000.  If you take the quarter ended 7th October, 1934, the number of new registrations was 77,000&mdash;against 32,000 &mdash;and the number of old registrations was 60,000&mdash;against 68,000.  In other words, while the number of old registrations was practically normal, the number of new registrations had risen from 32,000 to 77,000, or by 45,000, and the actual increase in the number of people on the register at that time corresponded exactly with that figure.  In other words, the actual increase was 45,000.  There is an old saying that he who proves too much proves nothing, and I was not satisfied that the increase of 45,000 in new registrations would give anything like that increase, and, therefore, if the theory upon which we are working is sound, there must be other new registrations, and going back to the first quarter of the year, I find that there are those new registrations <Col N="164" /> there to explain the whole of the difference.</P>
    <P>In addition to that, the people have varied in condition.  It is not the people who have previously registered. The vast majority of the new registration is coming from the poorer districts, from the uneconomic holders in the west and in the south.  It might be suggested that the mere fact that those people have now come upon the register is a proof of a disimproving economic condition in the western and the congested and the poorer districts of Ireland, and that is a contention which would have to be examined, but the answer, unfortunately, is complete. The people who are stimulated to register are the people who, in rural districts, have less than £39 and, in certain urban districts, less than £52 a year.  Anyone who knows the West of Ireland; anyone who knows Connemara, Mayo, Donegal, West Clare or the Dingle peninsula; anyone who has even the remotest tourist knowledge of them; anyone who has gone through them at 60 miles an hour, knows that there had not to be a change in the conditions of those districts, not in living memory, not in a long way back from living memory, in order that the average income of the adult population should fall below £39 a head.</P>
    <P>The registration is taking place in the unknown Ireland.  The register to-day is not a picture of the unemployment condition; it is not the total of men normally seeking paid employment who are unable to get paid employment. It is the exposure and the development of the picture of deep, grinding, almost abysmal, endemic poverty which has existed in the memory of the oldest of us, in the memory of the grandfathers of the oldest of us, in the western and south-western, and in some of the north-western, districts of Ireland, and it is good that by these figures we who live in the more prosperous portions of Ireland, we individuals, among the people of Ireland, who are more prosperous than the average, should be shocked publicly into a knowledge of the existence and the nature of the <Col N="165" /> poverty problem as distinct from the unemployment problem of this country.</P>
    <P>If these large figures which are now coming out&mdash;if the heavy figures of unemployment assistance which will eventually become so familiar to the people of this country&mdash;perform no other purpose than to remind the Twenty Six Counties as a whole of the obligation and sense of undischarged debt that they have to the Western people, to the poorer peoples of this country, the register will have performed a duty which is worth all the money that has been spent upon it. But that is what it means.  The veil has been torn aside.  The silly, mad idea which was represented by a 30,000 registration, wholly and completely in the richer districts of Ireland, has been blown to atoms with the registration of 119,000&mdash;the larger portion of which is made up of people who have never registered for unemployment before; who have never been employed persons in the sense in which that term is commonly used; who have been people struggling manfully to maintain their existence under conditions which required a faithfulness and a heroism and a strength of mind and courage and abilities which I think, have never been matched in the history of the human race.  These are our poorer people on the Western coast of Ireland.</P>
    <P>On a previous occasion, as the House knows, I have exposed all the information in our possession in relation to the way in which we have discharged the duty the House has given to us in the matter of unemployment relief.  In the same way, I hope to put in the possession of every honest student of these things in this House the facts and figures as we are getting them.  There it, at the present moment, a most persistent and energetic study taking place in relation to the new facts in connection with Irish economic life which are being exposed to us for the first time in the results of the unemployment assistance register.  I think that when those are fully analysed, we will be in a position to give, in relation to the economic life of practically every individual in this <Col N="166" /> country who can be said to be in a state of necessity, more accurate particulars in relation to that life than any other country possesses, and I hope that the House will diligently study those when they get them and use them as a basis for a policy by which help will be deliberately brought to those more unfortunate, and, I think, far more noble of our own people.</P>
    <P>That being the position, as far as I know it, in relation to the actual figures, all the evidence officially in the possession of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce point to the fact that there has been no increase of unemployment throughout the country. As you know, we have given on previous occasions the general statistical figures in relation to that matter, and, as part of that investigation last year, we did approach deliberately individuals in this country who had expressed strongly pessimistic views with the suggestion that they had behind them certain facts.  Now, it was not a case, as far as I am concerned, and as far as this investigation was concerned, of trying merely to find the facts.  It certainly was not a case of trying to find the favourable facts.  The whole of the indications of formal statistics were favourable.  What we went out to do was to search in the highways and byways for the unfavourable facts which had not come to our knowledge.  While, therefore, we have failed, frankly, to get those figures, in two or three cases, where we received the information which was at the back of a man's mind in making a particularly pessimistic speech&mdash;the information he received from this place and the other place&mdash;on examination they proved to have no basis whatever. For that reason, I am satisfied that whatever degree of distress and unemployment there is in the country, that it is not an increasing condition of distress and unemployment.  But that does not touch or quarrel with the fact which is exposed by this extraordinary total of 225,000 people who apply for registration certificates for unemployment assistance and 170,000 who get registration certificates.  It <Col N="167" /> means that there is that pool of poverty in the country, from whatever source it has come; and until we are in a position, by development of industry or whatever it is of a formal and permanent character, to absorb these, there has to be relief of an emergency character.</P>
    <P>Now, what we did in that particular matter was that, first, we used our own limited brains and our own limited but increasing knowledge of the possibilities of artificial employment. Through that we gathered together from all the departments and places concerned, all the schemes which their most ambitious hopes would suggest as possible to deal with unemployment relief over a period.  These schemes are all now being critically examined by a committee of whose energy, initiative, and enterprise I cannot speak too highly.  In addition to that, we are making an appeal to all the brains and all the initiative of all the people in this country to find for us, if they can, the things that we do not know.  The House will remember that I once appealed to the massed intelligence and enterprise of 152 fellow-members of this Dáil, and asked them to send me the expressions of their genius in the solution of this particular problem. Modesty, no doubt, has prevented the output being up to expectation.</P>

      <P>Contempt and Deputy Rice are bedfellows.  If, therefore, anyone in this House knows now of any proposals, outside the conventional forms of proposals, which have a definite labour content and which are capable of being used in the areas in which distress and unemployment are rife, we will be very glad to have them.  In addition to that, any scheme which is put forward by any person outside, no matter who he is and no <Col N="168" /> matter what it is, we will examine it and see if we can get some good out of it.  When that mass of material has been got together it will be dissected and examined and put, to some extent, in the categories both of value and otherwise.  When that mass is complete, then we will try and work out of it some scheme by which, in ordered progress over a considerable period, public works can be done.  The ordinary schemes with which you are all familiar&mdash;public health work, drainage, forestry, etc.,&mdash;practically the whole of these are now being fully examined by the committee, but there may be other kinds of work of which we do not know which can be used.  All I can say is that, to the extent to which these are made available to us, the extent to which they have value, the desire will be to use them for the purpose of dealing with what, I repeat to the House, is not in its largest sense an unemployment problem, but endemic poverty in this country, which is three and four and five times as onerous and as heavy a problem as the problem of unemployment.  Both the unemployment and the poverty problems we will, as far as the resources of the State allow, attempt to deal with as and when we have completed the investigations now in hands.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I was here and had the greatest possible pleasure in listening to him.  However, we were informed two and a half years ago by the President that he was appointing Deputy Hugo Flinn as the unofficial <Col N="169" /> Minister for Employment.  We have listened to the Parliamentary Secretary for over 50 minutes.  It reminded me of another occasion when I listened to him, when he was not a Deputy, lecturing upon the abolition of income tax.  He made the same play with figures to-night.  The Parliamentary Secretary tried to put himself right in the middle of his speech, but unfortunately he did not stay right.  He said that he who attempts to prove too much proves nothing.  If it is any consolation to him, I think that is what he has succeeded in proving to the House&mdash;nothing.  Rather he succeeded in proving that if there is any man in the Fianna Fáil Party competent to solve the unemployment problem, the Parliamentary Secretary is not.  The Parliamentary Secretary has made an absolute confession of failure.  He was appointed Minister for employment. We all know the Parliamentary Secretary's opinion of himself and of his abilities and capabilities, and I think we know, to a certain extent, the opinion which members of his own party hold of his abilities; but I am afraid that even his warmest admirer in the Fianna Fáil Party will admit that he has not covered himself with glory in this particular debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary tells us that there is less destitution, less distress in this country now than there was at any time.  He tells us that because the figures have gone up to, roughly, 120,000 they do not mean an increase in unemployment.  His case, in effect, is that if they had gone down it would have meant an increase in unemployment; but the fact that they have gone up proves the opposite.  I am prepared to confess that if the figures had gone up, say, to 200,000 early this year I would not have been surprised. It would be understandable, because we know that in this or in any other country if people think there is a chance of getting money for nothing they are going to try and get it.  If the figures had gone up with a jump, say, up to July, it would be understandable. But I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary, or the Minister for Industry and Commerce, or the President, or anybody else, to explain <Col N="170" /> the steady increase of between 2,000 and 3,000 per week between July and the present date.  A jump of, say, 60,000 between April and July would be understandable and could be met by saying: &ldquo;These are new people coming in who are registering in the hope of getting unemployment assistance.&rdquo; But it is not so easy to wipe away the figures of the steady increase over a number of months.  The Parliamentary Secretary was talking about a seasonal increase.  Does he ever remember the figures before eclipsing the peak figures for any other year in the months of July, August, September and October, which are normally the busiest months in this country and when normally there is greater employment than at any other period of the year?  It seems to me that there can be only one explanation.</P>
    <P>I am not going to say to what extent employment has been found in the new factories, because frankly I have no detailed information beyond what I heard in the ordinary course.  I am satisfied, however, that there has been a very great reduction in the number of men finding employment in the rural parts of the country, and there is not a member in this House&mdash;I do not care whether he sits on the Fianna Fáil Benches or this side of the House&mdash;but knows quite well that that is so.  It is perfectly clear to everyone here that the ordinary farmer is not able to employ as many men as he employed before or to employ even the same number of men for the full period.  That is quite evident to anyone.  Deputy Flinn seems to be amazed.  I forget his exact words, but I think the gist of what he said was that you had a new type of person registering.  Of course you have.  All over the country to-day you have farmers and farmers' sons signing on for work on the roads, on drainage schemes and on relief works because they are compelled to do it. They would not dream of signing on for these works four or five years ago.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnDonnelly" hpid="Mr. Donnelly Mr. Donnelly">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>They were never compelled to do it before because they had <Col N="171" /> employment on their own farms&mdash; because their own farms were able to pay.  Now they are forced to go into competition for what one might call, for want of a better word, legitimate work.  Very few Deputies are living in rural areas.  Deputy Flinn, of course, has the usual sneer that we expect from the Deputy.  I assure him it is very becoming indeed to him.  The Deputy, I think, had the same sort of expression on his face about 12 months ago when he was justifying the cutting of wages in half and when he told us that he could put two men where one man was employed already.  We know how that scheme succeeded.  It succeeded to such an extent that the figures for unemployment have steadily increased, notwithstanding the Deputy's juggling with them&mdash;and I admit the Deputy is an expert at juggling, and he can juggle more than figures.  The fact remains that the official figures published by the Department of Industry and Commerce show that the number seeking employment in this State is greater than at any period in its history.  That is a fact, and one that cannot be got away from.  There are now 120,000 unemployed, and probably it is more than 120,000 this week.  The Deputy tells us that we ought to be content, that that is no indication whatever.  He tries to make play with that 120,000 and the figure of 30,000 some years ago.</P>
      <P>I notice the Deputy did not make any reference whatever to the figure which his Party gave a couple of years ago. I refer to the figure they gave when in Opposition.  That was the figure for the number of persons available for work&mdash;the figure that was secured as a result of the census.  Does the Deputy remember that figure?  I do not think he was in the House at the time.  But Deputy Lemass, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, knows a good deal more about that figure than does Deputy Flinn.  When in Opposition Deputy Lemass was fond of playing with the 78,000 unemployed&mdash;then an enormous figure.</P>

      <P>The Minister is making my point.  When on this side of the House, Deputy MacEntee worked himself into hysterics about the awful position of the unemployed then and when Deputy McGilligan tried to explain what the Minister is now trying to explain&mdash;that it was not a genuine figure&mdash;we know what Deputy MacEntee then said.  We too remember what Deputy McGilligan said at the time.  But of course times are changed.  The then Deputy MacEntee is now the polished suave Minister for Finance, the man who controls the moneys of the nation.  He is the man who agrees that 24s. a week is the highest rate to be paid upon relief schemes.  Deputy Flinn puts the figure at that.  The Deputy I know does not like to be reminded of some of the statements made by him in the past about the live register; he tells us now that it does not matter about the live register.</P>

      <P>Deputy Anthony could not possibly throw so much cold water upon the Minister's Department as the Minister for Unemployment has done.  He has proved what the statistics of the Department of Industry and Commerce are worth.  If we are to believe one word that Deputy Flinn applied to them in his speech&mdash;and he used that one word 18 times in the course of the first few minutes&mdash; these figures are &ldquo;fundamentally&rdquo; wrong.  The Deputy is fond of using that word.  It is he who is fundamentally wrong.  But then if your figures are fundamentally wrong for goodness sake abolish your statistical Department altogether.</P>

      <P>They are coming back to add to the 120,000 unemployed in the country already.  Deputy Lemass in 1931 said that if Fianna Fáil were returned to power they would abolish unemployment altogether.  He said they would do it in six weeks.  He <Col N="174" /> himself I am sure did not believe that, but many of those who voted for him believed his Party were going to make a determined attempt to reduce unemployment.  Instead of being reduced unemployment has increased.  I want to pay a tribute to one Department of the State that has done something not only to give work to the workers but to house the workers.  That is the Department of Local Government and Public Health. If the other Departments of the State would tackle the schemes within their spheres as the Minister for Local Government and Public Health tackled housing schemes, I am satisfied that the unemployment figures would be far different from what they are to-day.  So far as the Government policy or want of policy is concerned I must say that it has led to a vast increase in unemployment and I am afraid that that increase will go on increasing.  I say this for the reason that you cannot sabotage the main industry of a country without bringing destitution not only to the farmers but to those dependent on the farmers.  This means destitution for the agricultural workers and almost all the workers employed in the provincial towns of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the previous speaker, I had almost lost the trend of the motion in the wealth of figures that have been put before us by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance.  The Parliamentary Secretary put before us so many kinds of figures that if he had only gone on and if we had only waited for 15 or 20 minutes more it looked as if the unemployment problem would have completely solved itself.  I would ask the House to get back to the motion before it and to scrap the figures which the Parliamentary Secretary has given us.  The figures have been naturally inflated because of the provisions made for the unemployed and for which we are thankful.  But we have to get away from all these figures and from the fact that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance seems to be under the impression that there is <Col N="175" /> no unemployment in this State except along the western seaboard.  The only experience I have of the western seaboard is passing through it at 60 miles an hour.  I hope there are no Civic Guards listening because I was possibly exceeding the speed limit. But I will ask the Parliamentary Secretary to go through the country at less speed than 60 miles an hour. If he does so he will find that unemployment is as rife in the industrial centres as it is in the places of which he speaks along the western seaboard. When we see in the City of Limerick a little scheme of work being carried through with the maximum capacity of absorbing 70 or 80 men, and when we find 2,000 applicants for work on that scheme and the list of names growing every day, then we can understand the conditions of unemployment in this State.  The same thing applies to every job that has been carried through in every part of the State.  This shows clearly that the men who are looking for work do not want to live on doles but to get work at which they can earn a decent wage.</P>
      <P>We have been told that there is no unemployment, comparatively speaking; that there is no great increase in unemployment; that the big numbers on the list are mainly drawn from the western seaboard.  On that point I immediately join issue with the Parliamentary Secretary. I may inform him that that is not the position in my area, which may be classed as an industrial area.  The City of Limerick possesses old-established industries and a considerable amount of building is taking place in the area; yet all that can be done in the way of local enterprise, backed up by the efforts of the Local Government Department, is not by any means capable of making even an appreciable improvement in the unemployment situation there.</P>
      <P>The motion that is under consideration reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That in view of continued widespread unemployment the Dáil <Col N="176" /> instructs the Executive Council to make available forthwith sufficient money to permit of the carrying out of large scale schemes of public works, so as to relieve the distress caused by unemployment.</P>
    <P>That motion has been on the Order Paper for the last eight or nine months. We ought to approach it in a reasonable frame of mind, leaving aside all party spirit.  This is a subject that does not call for party spirit in any form.  It is too serious a question to be making party play with.  We should ask ourselves, has the position materially improved since this motion was first submitted?  In this matter every Deputy should scrap the returns submitted by statistical departments and should instead use his own common sense.  I am sure there are few Deputies who have not observed the great distress in every county in the Free State.  Notwithstanding the efforts made by the Government to remedy the position &mdash; and I will admit that they are doing a good deal in that direction &mdash; the existing conditions are still very bad, and the point is, are the Government doing what is commensurate with the gravity of the problem? That is all that we are asking for in this motion.  I do not think the production of figures such as we have listened to for an hour or more this evening is going to lead us anywhere. The main point is, are the Government doing all they are capable of doing in order to remedy the serious position in relation to unemployment that exists to-day?</P>
    <P>When this motion was moved by Deputy Norton he elaborated in great detail certain schemes that would undoubtedly be useful in giving remunerative employment, and he put forward suggestions to grapple with this most serious problem.  Unemployment is not only a great problem in the Free State, but it is also a great problem with most other countries in the world.  The intelligence and abilities of leading statesmen the world over are concentrated upon the problem of unemployment. We believe that in this country a lot of leeway has to be made in the <Col N="177" /> building up of social services so as to bring them on a par with the social services of other countries.  Money could not be better spent than by bringing our unemployed into work and training them for the time when the industrial schemes promised by this Government will materialise.  We all look forward to a great period of agricultural and industrial development when the Government's schemes reach the period of fruition.  But in the meantime our boys and girls are leaving school and there are few avenues of employment open to them.  Unemployed educated boys might well be a menace to the State, and any effort on the part of the Government to accommodate these boys with employment would, I am sure, be well repaid. There is no question that many people are in a state of absolute destitution in every city, town and village in the Free State.</P>
    <P>The most hopeful part of the Parliamentary Secretary's speech was contained in the last few phrases when he mentioned that schemes were being carefully examined with the object of extending employment.  Might I suggest that those who are examining the schemes should have some regard for the urgent need that exists in relation to their operation?  I hope they will not be quite so long-winded or so slow as the Parliamentary Secretary was when making his points.  Perhaps we could have some assurance that this examination of the schemes will not be the be-all and end-all, and that in the very near future some of them at least will be put into operation for the benefit of the country as a whole.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I will be allowed to give the Deputy the figures for which he was asked?  I do not happen to have the figures for Limerick City separately, but I have figures for the four county boroughs.  In Dublin in March, 1932, there were 11,000 unemployed; and in October, 1934, there were 13,000; in other words, it had increased by 18 per cent.  The increase in County Donegal was 2,100 per cent., and in County Mayo it was 2,500 per <Col N="178" /> cent.  The figures for Limerick cannot be very different from those of Dublin. I will look them up and I will get them for the Deputy.  The average for the four county boroughs was an increase of about 24 per cent.  I am putting to the Deputy the extraordinary discrepancy in the rise of figures in the different areas.</P>

      <P>Deputies on the opposite benches have made great play with the increase in the number of registered unemployed.  We are quite satisfied that the numbers of unemployed have increased because of the inducements held out to people to register at the employment exchanges. No such inducements were held out by the last Government and, in consequence, people were forced to starve. Those who went to register at that time were compelled to go to the Labour Exchanges week after week and month after month and finally they were told that they were not entitled to receive any unemployment benefit. We realise that we have not arrived at a final solution of the unemployment problem.  We do not hide the fact that there is unemployment, but we tell the people that we are prepared to deal with that problem and we are prepared to put a solution into operation.  We have a plan and we have told the people about it.  Even though Deputies opposite may sneer at the idea of a plan, we tell them that we have that plan and it only requires a short time to put it into full operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies opposite have very short memories.  They seem to forget that when Fianna Fáil got into power they received as a legacy from the Cumann na nGaedheal Party 90,000 unemployed and we now have 20,000 people, who under ordinary circumstances would be forced to emigrate, added to the list that the Government must provide for. In that way we get a figure that would be many thousands beyond the figure of the unemployed at the present moment.  We have less distress than we had two years ago; that cannot be denied.  Even though we have unemployment <Col N="179" /> we have not the same misery or the same distress in the workers' families as we had two years ago. They had a better outlook now.  They know there are schemes being put into operation by the Government that will alleviate their difficulties.  They have a more optimistic outlook and they know they can put their confidence in this Government to carry through schemes that will tend to ameliorate existing conditions.</P>
    <P>We have plans for housing of which you are all aware.  The Minister for Local Government has stated that it is the duty of public bodies to go ahead with housing and that the money will be provided, no matter how many houses may be required, until all the people who require houses are provided with decent habitations in which they may rear their families in comfort. That is one thing this Government is doing and is prepared to do.  Land division is another item that will absorb a number of the unemployed. When these ranches are broken up and given to men who are prepared to till them and carry out the full policy of the Government to the best of their ability, then a number of men will be taken off the list of unemployed.  Up to the present time we have had these unemployed people going around the country districts and looking across the fences at the bullocks grazing and fattening on these fields, while the children of these unemployed people were in a state of semi-starvation at home.  Like Tantalus, they were up to their eyes in plenty while they were unable to taste of that plentifulness.</P>
    <P>We must not forget that there is an industrial revival here and, no matter what sneers may be indulged in in respect of that revival by Deputies on the opposite benches, I am satisfied that not alone will it employ child labour, as it is called, but that it will extend so that it will give employment to adults, as it is doing at present.  I am satisfied that the larger schemes of industrial development which are to come will employ adult labour to a much greater degree than it is <Col N="180" /> employed at present.  Could we have industries started when we had those in opposition crying out that there was no stability in the country and that this Government could not retain office?  How could we expect expansion of industrial activity while we had that kind of propaganda?  As a result of the recent county council elections, we shall have a great quickening of activity in the industrial field.  We shall have men coming in prepared to invest money in our industries, men who no longer believe the false propaganda which emanated from the Opposition Benches.  These men see now that the people are determined to stand by the industrial policy of the Government.  Their will was declared in no uncertain way at the county council elections.  Some of the Deputies on the opposite side seem to forget these things.  They remind one of Rip Van Winkle.  They have been asleep from the time they went out of office until the present time, or, if they have not been asleep, they have conveniently closed their eyes to the facts that are staring them in the face. Although I believe with the Labour Party that it is our duty as a Government to use our utmost endeavour to solve the unemployment problem, I am satisfied that the Ministry have given evidence, week after week, of their desire to do so.  Many ameliorative schemes have been put into operation and it is the intention of the Government to put further schemes into operation as occasion arises.  I believe that the solution of the unemployment problem will not be much longer delayed.  If those people who are followers of the Opposition Party, who shout so loudly about unemployment, and who have money invested in foreign stocks and shares, were prepared, as patriotic Irishmen, to take that money home, now that we have stable conditions in this country, and invest it in Irish industries, it would do much to solve the unemployment problem.  If the Party opposite believe in their own words they should tell their followers to take that money home and not be merely drawing dividends and giving employment to foreigners.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="181" /> I notice that when the company promoting the sugar industry published a prospectus recently, the issue of shares was over-subscribed.  Other issues placed on the Irish market are also being subscribed and over-subscribed very quickly.  That is an indication of what the people believe the policy of the Government will lead to. As patriotic Irishmen, these people are prepared to invest their money at home.  They know they will get a return for their money.  They know that the market for the commodity in the development of which they are investing will be protected and that they will not, as under the old régime, be faced with the possibility of losing their money.  They know that they will get their dividends.  They know that they are helping to build up this country, now that it has won the economic war, now that it has withstood all the shocks and the batteringrams England could employ against it. The people feel now that they have at least the security they were looking for, that the native industries will be protected, that there will be no more foreign competition, so far as this Government is concerned, and that they can invest their money safely. No better means could be found at present of securing employment for our people than by having industries established here so that all the goods that we are or were importing can be made here.  I believe that, in the near future, we shall have this unemployment problem solved.  I know that, up and down the country, the people have faith in the present Administration. The workmen believe that the present Administration will solve the unemployment problem and I am satisfied that they will.</P>

      <P>I heard Deputy Kelly make the statement that we had won the economic war.  I hope the Deputy will not be annoyed if I relate some of my experiences as a farmer who tries to give as much employment as possible.  I should like to tell him of my experience at Blessington fair yesterday, to show the effects of the economic war and how impossible it <Col N="182" /> is for farmers to carry on and give employment as they did in the past. I had four calves, of about a fortnight or three weeks old, at the fair.  Three years ago, such calves would be worth from £3 to £3 10s. each.  I send milk into Dublin.  It is not my policy to rear calves but I have an objection, on principle, to killing them.  I never killed a calf.</P>

      <P>I found it impossible to dispose of these calves yesterday. I asked a man if he would take them and he said he would like to have a look at them.  He had a look at the calves and then he offered me £1 for them.  The position is that these four calves which would have brought £12 a couple of years ago would only now fetch £1.  Deputy Kelly tells us of the way we won the economic war.  Was there ever such nonsense talked by any responsible person?  I would like to give the House another experience that I have had.  I had two cows to sell. I was asked what I wanted for them and I asked a &ldquo;fiver.&rdquo;  The buyer said he would give me £1 for one and that I should give him the other for luck.  Eventually he offered a half-crown so that I had to part with the other cow for a half-crown.  I am in a position to prove these things.  The economic war is not over.  I tell Deputy Kelly and those associated with him that the economic war is at the root of the plague of unemployment in this country.  No farmer is in a position to-day to be able to employ and pay labour as he was three or four years ago.  The result is that the labourers are driven from the rural areas into the towns and villages where they come into competition with the local people.  There is no use talking of relief schemes.  The policy of the Government is that they are going to put people back on the land.  My experience is that they are driving people off the land.  I could give an instance of a man in my own village brought up in the most industrious school who cannot make a living at the present <Col N="183" /> time.  That man's father often got up at 2 or 3 in the morning to cut turf. Recently I offered a labourer 3s. a day to dig potatoes.  He said &ldquo;No.  If I dig your potatoes I will lose my unemployment assistance benefit.&rdquo;  Is not that an unfortunate position to have the workers of the country in?  They want decent employment but instead of that they are treated as paupers.  I have experience of men who left their employment in order to secure unemployment assistance.  When reference was made to me about one of these men I put the real facts before the Minister and his officials and the man was refused assistance.  That is the attitude that should be adopted.  I have the greatest respect for any man who is willing to work.  There will be a procession in Blessington to-morrow to the Labour Exchange.  I ask the Minister to send me ten men to give me a hand to dig my potatoes.  In that I would, of course, be taking a risk because to spite me they might leave the potatoes in the ground.  Deputies opposite know that that is really the true position.</P>

      <P>I live in the Free State governed by you.  Deputy Kelly talked of the facilities afforded to men to-day to put their names on the unemployment register as compared with three years ago.  That is not the point at all. The Government promised when they were trying to get into office that they would find employment for over 86,000 persons.  They said they had a plan, and at the Kildare by-election they were asked to produce it but they did not do so.  It does not matter what Party is in power if the country is prosperous; that is what we want.  The President at the Ard-Fhéis said that there would be always a fringe of unemployment in this country, but he said on another occasion that this was the easiest country in the world in which to find employment for the people.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce told us that the people would be coming <Col N="184" /> back from America so great would be the demand for employment.  What is the position to-day?  The unemployment figures were never so high, and before the winter is over they will be higher still.  Many farmers will be compelled to allow their men to go for the winter.</P>
      <P>There is a great deal of talk about industries being set up.  Deputy Norton described some of these industries as &ldquo;sweat shops&rdquo; and &ldquo;baby farms.&rdquo;  It is the men employed on the land who are going to make this country prosperous, and it is up to the Government to find a solution of the agricultural difficulty.  Let there be no quibbling about this.  The problem is there.  No matter how the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance tries to prove that it is not the case he will not be able to do so.  Facts are facts, and the fact that there are 119,000 persons on the unemployment register proves the case I am putting.</P>

      <P>This motion before the House has been so pulled about that one does not really know where to take it up.  Deputy Anthony, like Guy Fawkes, started with that critical date, the 5th of November, and having stolen their thunder from the Labour Party, he found that his arithmetical gunpowder was too wet to go off. In reference to this unemployment problem, the first thing to do in order to find a solution for it is to find out exactly what it is.  That is what this Government set out to do.  They cannot cloak the fact that there is an unemployment problem and so they try to find out the extent of that problem. Ever since they came into power they have sought by every means to find a solution or several solutions for that problem.  They got no help from any of the Opposition Parties of this House <Col N="185" /> when facing the fact that there is such a problem.  A very prominent member of the Opposition, speaking at the Cork County Council&mdash;the premier council of Ireland&mdash;called it the Parliament of Munster.  Yet when any public work is mooted before the Cork County Council it is immediately put aside on the ground that money must be saved as there is an economic war on.  We are told that the farmers are seeking work on minor relief schemes.  Deputy Morrissey called the labourers the legitimate workers in such schemes.  I suppose the farmers are the illegitimate workers.  The trouble about farmers looking for work on the roads is the same trouble ever since I knew the roads.  It is possible to keep rich farmers off the roads and to prevent them from taking the bit out of the poor farmers' mouths.  I hope that in the administration of the relief grants the Parliamentary Secretary will take effective steps to prevent work on the roads being done by rich Blueshirt farmers who want to take the bit out of the mouths of the poorer men.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked the Minister for Justice to-day if it is the intention of the Government, that is to say of the Attorney-General, to institute proceedings against six members of the Gárda Síochána who fired on a small body, some 20 men, in Marsh's yard in the City of Cork, killing one of the men upon whom they fired and wounding six.  The answer I received from the Minister was that it is not the intention of the Government to prosecute these men.  In reply to a supplementary question the Minister went on to say that there was a verdict of a coroner's jury which acquitted these men.  The Minister has been very strangely misinformed <Col N="186" /> indeed.  There has been no verdict of a coroner's jury exculpating these men in the least degree. The law is perfectly clear.  When one individual takes the life of another individual and it is proved that he has taken that life, the onus or burden of proof is on the person who has taken the life to produce evidence of some circumstance which will reduce it from murder to any lesser offence, or to show that it is not an offence at all.  The burden is upon the person who has taken the life.  That is well established law. It has been laid down in the Court of Criminal Appeal in this country.</P>
      <P>Therefore, the verdict of the jury which did not exculpate these men, a verdict of a jury who simply satisfied themselves, acting indeed on a suggestion of the coroner, in bringing in a verdict that Michael Patrick Lynch died of gunshot wounds, was equivalent to a verdict of wilful murder against these men.  The law presumes it is murder.  There is no question as to who fired these shots. They admitted it themselves on oath. There is no question as to the individuals who fired the volley, or series of volleys.  They admitted it themselves on their oaths.  In consequence the verdict of the jury in Cork was not a verdict acquitting these men; it was a verdict equivalent to a verdict of murder against them. These men could not have been acquitted.  No jury could have found a verdict exculpating these men, and, in the short time at my disposal, when I place the facts before the House, it will be clear to every member of the House, who brings to a consideration of this case anything approaching an impartial mind, that the Attorney-General is condoning wilful murder in this case and that the Attorney-General is, by his refusal to prosecute, making himself, as it were, an accessory after the fact to a calculated and cold-blooded murder.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What are the facts?  On this 13th of August there were 330 uniformed Guards in the City of Cork.  That body of uniformed Guards was quite <Col N="187" /> sufficient and ample to deal, without the use of firearms, with any activities of the crowd.  There was a crowd, which they estimated at something between 2,000 and 3,000 men, present on that 13th of August.  On the previous 27th July, in the very same place, there had been, on the police evidence, an equally large crowd and there had been only 50 police on that occasion, and yet they were able to preserve the peace and to control the crowd without the use of firearms.  What happened on this occasion?  There were several cordons of Guards drawn up outside the gates of Marsh's yard where certain cattle were being sold.  A lorry load of men, roughly about 15 men in a lorry, darted at the gate and carried the gate of the yard off the under rail on which it rested.  The lorry then went into the yard, a distance of some seven yards&mdash;22 feet to be completely accurate&mdash;and struck against a cattle pen and came to a complete stop. The gate itself, as I have said, was taken off the bottom rail but was still held up by the top rail hanging over the back of the lorry.  There was an attempt made by some members of the crowd to get in after the lorry.  Five members of the crowd did get in after the lorry and amongst these five was the unfortunate boy, Lynch.</P>
    <P>What was the position inside the yard?  There were 15 men on the lorry inside the yard and there were five others, not even in the lorry, who followed them&mdash;20 men in all.  There were inside Marsh's yard at that time 46 members of the Gárda.  The proposition which the Minister for Justice endeavoured to establish at question time to-day was that 46 members of the Gárda could not deal with 20 civilians, bearing no lethal weapons, without opening revolver and rifle fire on them.  That is a monstrous proposition.</P>

      <P>That was before the firing began.  We know that the Minister for Finance took the very extraordinary course in this case of endeavouring to interfere with the course of justice by making a speech on this matter, a speech full of false statements, long before the jury had even been collected to consider its verdict.  I think the least the Minister for Finance talks about this matter the better.  Inside there were 46 members of the Guards and there were these unfortunate men who had come in there.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>Very unfortunate. Outside there was a very large number of Guards.  There were very nearly 300 Guards.  Within half a minute on the police evidence, within 20 seconds on the evidence of Superintendent MacNeill, the Gárda cordon had been reformed outside.  Within 30 seconds, according to Superintendent O'Driscoll&mdash;another superintendent outside&mdash;the crowd had been completely beaten off.  That was the position outside&mdash;no danger, no possibility of any persons within the crowd getting into the yard.  What was the position inside?  These unfortunate boys came in.  They were in the lorry.  Before they could get out of the lorry a murderous fire was opened upon them without the slightest cause or justification&mdash;not, I am glad to say, by order of any superintendent of the Civic Guard, not by order of any responsible individual in the Civic Guard, not even by order of a sergeant in the Civic Guard, but opened without any order from anybody, on the initiative of six practically untrained members of the Civic <Col N="189" /> Guard.  A fusillade of revolver and rifle fire was opened on them.  In all, 38 shots are fired at these unfortunate young men.  Fortunately, only six of them are wounded, one desperately badly.  Another, a boy of 18 or 19 years, young Lynch, is shot and dies that night of his injuries.  What justification can there be for that?  What danger was there?  The men themselves do not say there was any danger.  They were put in the witness-box and examined.  They had appearing for them a very experienced member of the Irish Bar.  He put them in the witness-box and they gave evidence directly and under cross-examination. And what is the excuse? That they fired as a precaution, as one of them said.  Another said that they fired as a precautionary measure in case &ldquo;the men that we were supposed to guard might get into danger.&rdquo;  But there was no danger.  They cannot harden their hearts and say that there was any danger.  They cannot even suggest it themselves; and yet the Minister got up at question time to-day, and I suppose will get up here again to-night, and say that there was some possible conceivable danger to somebody or other because nothing except extreme danger, very real danger, very active and present danger to some individual will justify the taking away of human life.  It is not suggested, and it cannot be suggested, that there was anything of that nature here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What a scene occurred in this yard with the members of the uniformed Guards flinging themselves down on their faces to escape from the fusillade! You have other members of the uniformed branch of the Guards cowering down under shelter to keep away from this murderous fusillade.  You have Superintendent Bergin of the Civic Guards, the superintendent in charge of the yard under the chief superintendent, saying that he himself was struck in the face by sand which obviously had come from a bullet that struck the wall in his neighbourhood. That was the sort of firing that took place and it would probably have been as fatal to the uniformed members of the Guards as it was to these unfortunate <Col N="190" /> young Cork farmers if it had not been for this: that being trained men they had the presence of mind to fling themselves on the ground while this murderous fusillade was going on.  Is that attitude of firing by the Guards a thing which the Minister will have the audacity in this House to defend, and if he has not, why are not the men prosecuted unless this Government deliberately takes up the attitude that they are going to use murder as a means of governing?  These men should be prosecuted.  If they can show a sympathetic jury that there is anything which would reduce the crime from murder to manslaughter let them show it, but upon their own admissions these men are guilty.  I believe that any judge, if he had no evidence before him at all of any kind except the sworn statements of these men themselves, would direct any jury that their action amounted to wilful murder.  But there is going to be no prosecution we are told, and this crime is to be cloaked up.</P>
    <P>What happened outside?  After this firing there was a fracas or a row between the Guards and the rest of the crowd outside.  You had about 800 men engaged against 300, roughly.  What happened?  The Guards dispersed them.  As one superintendent said under cross-examination, &ldquo;We were able to deal with the crowd; in fact, we did deal with the crowd.&rdquo;  And what was the result?  There were some Guards who received very minor injuries indeed, and I think one or two civilians were hit on the head with batons.  That is what happened outside in the street, where you had 800 men as against 300 Guards.  The police were able to deal with these 800 men without using lethal weapons, without using revolvers or rifles, but inside in the yard you are asked to believe that 46 Guards are not able to deal with 20 civilians.  If ever there was a case of unjustifiable firing upon a crowd it was this firing by these men, and firing by them not in hot blood or anything of that kind.  The chief superintendent himself described the firing.  He said the firing was by men who knew what they were doing.  Calmly and deliberately these men discharged 38 shots, a few of them, they say, in the air, but <Col N="191" /> the others against human targets.  One of them went so far as to say he did not take a rifle, but that he picked up a revolver as it could be fired quickly.  One of them that did not fire gave as his excuse for not firing that he picked up a rifle and then went for a revolver as being a weapon of greater precision with which he would be sure to get his man.  He then ran over to the crowd in order that he might select his target, and while selecting his target the firing stopped and, as he said, he stopped.  One of the men who had a rifle said he was stopped firing by Superintendent Bergin of the Guards.</P>
    <P>You had this position.  You had uniformed members of the Guards. You had armed members of the Guards &mdash; respectable, disciplined, trained members of the Special Branch of the Guards.  You had them inside the yard.  You had them under the control of officers.  Not one single man under the control of an officer and not one officer inside the yard considered it necessary to give an order to fire, but these six young men, who were sent down specially, proceeded off their own to open this firing.  They proceeded to murder one and to attempt to murder the residue of those who came into the yard.  I do not care a button who fired the shot which killed young Lynch.  That is of no importance.  The whole six of them were firing in concert, and every single one of them is as much guilty of this crime as the man who fired the actual shot which destroyed the life of young Lynch.  They were firing together.  They were firing in pursuance of a joint design, and every single one of them so firing is as guilty as the hand that actually fired the deadly shot.  I have put the case as concisely as I could in the time at my disposal.  There are many things which I have had naturally to pass over as I am anxious to give the Minister for Justice full time to reply.  I wonder why it is not the Attorney-General who is replying, because this non-bringing of a prosecution is his primary responsibility.  I very much wonder if the Minister for Justice when he is replying will, as a lawyer <Col N="192" /> and a man, declare to this House his belief that this cold-blooded shooting of this young man can be justified by any law, Divine or human.</P>

      <P>Outside the gates of this sale yard there is a picked body of men, and certain prominent people connected with this campaign against the payment of annuities have taken up positions inside.  I have heard some complaints to-day as to why certain people are not admitted to those sales. Certain prominent people took up their positions inside.  Two or three minutes before the lorry made its charge against the gate there was absolute silence outside, and those responsible people who were let in to attend the sale walked out.  The next thing the Guards inside hear is commotion on the street, and practically immediately this lorry dashes in through the gates.  Remember those people whom, I suppose Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney would even have the audacity to get up here and describe as law abiding citizens, had bludgeoned their way through three cordons of Guards on the streets.

      <P>The Deputy is very anxious to interrupt.  He will not deny that this lorry with those people in it charged through those cordons of Guards; that several Guards jumped on to the lorry and tried to divert the driver by catching hold of the steering wheel and trying to twist it.  What happened to them?  They were beaten off by those law-abiding people out for this business that is afterwards praised and made the subject of such a great oration at the grave of the unfortunate man who was killed.  Take the position of those men inside.  They are there to protect the people who are to bid at the sale; they are there to protect the stock; they are there to see that an ordinary sale is carried out.  What would soldiers in a fortress do if they saw an armoured car dashing through?  I suppose they would wait until machine-gun fire was opened? Do you think they would?  In what position were those men who had, I am sure, like everybody else, heard of and read such speeches as &ldquo;the guns will be used against the John Browns&rdquo; as was said in Limerick?  In what position were those men who were there to see that the people they were protecting would be protected, and that the stock which they were there to protect was not seized by the people on this exploit?  How did they know whether those men were armed or not? Should they have put their hands behind their backs, or put their hands up, and waited for those people to fire?</P>

If men are going to go out and try to prevent by force what this Government considers it is its duty to carry out, and for which it has legal authority, then those men must be prepared to recognise that force will be ment by force.</P>
