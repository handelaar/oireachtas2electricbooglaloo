      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Breen</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if the report of the Commission on the Purchase of Labourers' Cottages has now been fully considered; and if in accordance with the almost unanimous recommendations of the Commission a scheme has been prepared on which proposals for legislation for the implementing of said recommendations will be based; and if he will state when it is proposed to introduce such proposals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. O'Kelly)</NameTxt>
      <P>The report of the Commission of Inquiry mentioned is being examined.  The basis of sale recommended by the Commission necessitates an investigation of the numbers of cottages provided under loans issued for varying periods since 1883.  Owing to the destruction of records, the compilation of this information has proved difficult, but it is expected that with the co-operation of local authorities it will shortly be possible to complete the examination of the Commission's recommendations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin (for Mr. Everett)</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and <Col N="1082" /> Public Health if he is aware that the Wicklow County Council after a very exhaustive discussion and being in possession of all the facts relating thereto, gave by resolution to their poor rate collectors certain ratepayers in their county a period of one month, ending on the 14th January, 1934, within which to pay a moiety of their poor rates; and further, if he is aware that the refusal to sanction such concession or to receive a deputation of councillors and ratepayers will hinder the Wicklow County Council in their endeavour to have the poor rate collection for the financial year 1933-1934 satisfactorily closed in County Wicklow without inflicting hardships on the ratepayers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Wicklow County Council passed the resolution referred to.  The secretary of the council, as was his duty, warned the council that they had exceeded their powers.  I have written to the council strongly deprecating their action.  Even if so disposed I would have no power to give approval to the council's action.</P>
      <P>As regards the last part of the question, it is clear that the action of the council has retarded the collection of rates needed for the maintenance of public services and has been prejudicial to the interests of the ratepayers generally.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that by his action in the beginning of last year in withholding a large sum of money from the relief of rates on agricultural land from the Wicklow County Council, he increased, after the Wicklow County Council had considered their estimate, the total warrant from the sum of £73,000 to £92,000&mdash;that is, an additional £19,000 added to the warrant that year to be collected&mdash;and is no consideration to be given to a public body trying to carry on in the difficult circumstances brought about initially by the Minister's action?</P>

      <P>The penalties imposed in this case were imprisonment for two months and a fine of 10/-. I remitted the imprisonment on condition that the offender paid a fine of £5, in lieu of 10/-, and entered into recognisances to be of good behaviour for a period of five years.  These conditions were accepted and carried out.</P>

      <P>The claims of Donegal for the establishment of distilleries for the <Col N="1093" /> manufacture of industrial alcohol from potatoes have not been overlooked. The first experimental distilleries will probably be situated in the counties of Louth, Cavan and Monaghan, but as soon as the results of the working of these distilleries are available, and if the results justify extension, Donegal, it may be taken, will be one of the first areas in which the industry will be established.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he is aware that the concession obtained by growers of home-grown tobacco in having the crop free from duty for one year has been of immense value to them in fostering its growth; and, whether, in view of the fact that cessation of this relief would now be fatal to this industry struggling for its existence, he will consider extending the period in which the crop may be grown duty free to five years, or to such earlier period as it would have passed its experimental stage and become generally grown; and, furthermore, if he will make an early announcement of his intentions in the matter, as it will be of great importance to those about to sow this year's crop, and to the future of tobacco growing in the Saorstát.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied that the facilities afforded last year to tobacco growers which enabled them to grow tobacco free of duty and without the normal restrictions were sufficient to demonstrate the feasibility of growing tobacco of good quality in widely different areas in Saorstát Eireann. There is, therefore, no necessity this year for a continuance of these concessions. It is the intention of the Government to introduce legislation immediately providing for control of the growing and re-handling of tobacco, and for the absorption of all home grown tobacco at prices which will afford a reasonable return to growers.</P>

      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, I would like to know whether when he referred to an economic price for the grower, he referred to the figure of 1/3 mentioned by him in a public speech recently. If that be so, does the Minister think it reasonable to ask Irish labourers to produce tobacco at the same price that negro labour is producing it in America at the present time?  Bearing in mind that foreign tobacco is landed at the port of Dublin at 1/1 and 1/2 per lb, does he think that 1/3 is a fair price for tobacco produced by Irish labour? Secondly, will he say, in view of the fact that he proposes a preferential duty of 6/4 on Irish tobacco, as opposed to 9/4 on foreign tobacco, what is going to become of the 3/- preference rate, if the result is to be no better price for the grower than 1/3 per lb?</P>

If these facts are not so, will the Minister inform the House of the true state of affairs?

      <P>The Land Commission received no fewer than 149 applications for land on those estates.  Martin McGovern, who appears to be a landless man, aged 63, without dependents, was one of the 117 to whom an allotment was not made.  The area for disposal provided for the requirements of 32 allottees.

    <P>4.&mdash;(1)  The Minister shall cause to be kept a list to be called and known as &ldquo;the list of exempted stallions&rdquo;<Col N="1110" /> (in this Act referred to as &lsquo;the list&rdquo;).</P>
    <P>(2)  The list shall be in the prescribed form and there shall be entered therein and removed therefrom the matters respectively required by this Act to be entered therein and removed therefrom.</P>
    <P>(3)  Any person may inspect the list on payment of such fee, not exceeding one shilling for each inspection, as may be prescribed.</P>
    <P>5.&mdash;(1)  The owner of any stallion (in this Act referred to as an exemptible stallion), which is entered in a prescribed recognised stud book and which&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  is used for the service of no mares other than mares which are either</P>
    <P>(i)  entered in a prescribed recognised stud book, or</P>
    <P>(ii)  approved by the Minister,</P>
    <P>or</P>
    <P>(b)  is used exclusively for racing,</P>
    <P>or</P>
    <P>(c)  is in training for racing,</P>
    <P>may make application to the Minister requesting him to enter such stallion in the list as the property of such owner.</P>
    <P>(2)  Every application made under this section shall be made in the prescribed form and manner, shall contain the prescribed particulars, and shall be accompanied by such fee, not exceeding two shillings and sixpence, as may be prescribed.</P>
    <P>6.&mdash;(1)  On receipt of any application made under and in accordance with this Act for the entry of a stallion in the list, the Minister shall, if he is satisfied that such stallion is an exemptible stallion, enter such stallion and the prescribed particulars relating to such stallion in the list.</P>
    <P>(2)  Every stallion for the time being entered in the list shall, save as otherwise provided by this Act, be an exempted stallion within the <Col N="1111" /> meaning of and for the purposes of this Act.</P>
    <P>7.&mdash;The Minister shall remove from the list any stallion entered therein which has ceased to be an exempted stallion on the Minister becoming aware of such cesser.</P>
    <P>8.&mdash;(1)  Any stallion entered in the list shall cease to be an exempted stallion on the happening of any of the following events, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the expiration of six months from the death of the owner of such stallion where the personal representative of such owner has not during those six months transferred (whether by sale, assent to a bequest or otherwise) the ownership of such stallion, or</P>
    <P>(b)  the expiration of a period of thirty days from the date of any transfer of the right to the ownership of such stallion, unless the person to whom the right to the ownership of such stallion is transferred applies within such period, under this Act, for the entry of such stallion in the list as the property of such person, or</P>
    <P>(c)  such stallion ceasing to be an exemptible stallion.</P>

    <P>(3)  A certificate purporting to be under the hand of an officer of the Minister, authorised in that behalf by the Minister, that any stallion specified in such certificate is not entered in the list shall be conclusive evidence of the matter so certified, and it shall not be necessary to prove the signature of such officer, or that he was in fact such officer, or was in fact so authorised.</P>
    <P>(4)  Any person may&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  obtain a copy certified in the manner hereinbefore mentioned to be a true copy of any entry in the list on payment of such fee as may be prescribed;</P>
    <P>(b)  obtain such certificate as is hereinbefore mentioned that a stallion is not entered in the list on payment of such fee as may be prescribed.</P>

      <P>A question arises about the list.  This list will be one of five or six hundred horses.  The usefulness of this list will arise where the sale of a colt is taking place.  One can discover for the payment of a 1/- whether a colt is on the list, but it often happens that when a man goes to buy a particular animal he may not purchase that animal, he may purchase another animal.  In a case of that sort it is quite apparent that a list would be very useful to purchasers because the list is a certificate that the horse is not subject to any disability.  I would suggest that such a list be published. The list will be compiled annually, as a general rule I should say, at the beginning of the year. There may be some erasures or some eliminations from the list.  Some changes may take place during the year from one cause or another but that could not form the subject of any serious objection to the list being available, and, in consequence, I think it would be well that a copy of the list could be procured for a nominal fee. A single inspection only costs a 1/-, but if one had to examine 40 horses it may cost £2.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, the Deputy realises, as he has shown by what he said, that the list will be changed from time to time.  In fact, at all times, horses may be going off the list and on to the list and there is provision made for supplying a certified copy of any particular entry in the list or a certificate to show that the horse is not on the list, if necessary, for a prescribed fee.  That is provided for in the new Section 9, sub-section (4).  I think that would meet the Deputy's point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a certificate in respect of one animal, but one may <Col N="1114" /> go down, for instance, to one of the big training stables.  I know one stable where there are over a 100 horses in training.  A man may go down to buy one horse.  He may see two or three horses that he likes and takes the owner's word for it that these horses are exempted, that they are on the exemption list, but it follows that he must come here in order to see the list, to make sure that he is all right. I would say that all that trouble would be obviated if copies of the list were available.  The alterations that take place in so far as additions are concerned, are negligible in number.  They would refer only to whatever number of horses would be brought into this country for racing or for other purposes in respect of which exemptions would be made.  I would say that additions of that sort, if any at all, would be negligible.  On the other hand, the names of certain horses may be removed from the list for a particular purpose.  If they were sent out of the country, that would be one of the purposes, but normally the erasures would not be so many and it would be an enormous advantage if the list were available.</P>

      <P>I think I can meet the Deputy as well on this point.  It says here:&mdash;&ldquo;that any person may inspect the list on payment of such fee... as may be prescribed.&rdquo;  The fee an individual pays would be nominal and we can, I think, arrange to give any particular list of horses to a particular owner for a very small fee.  If a person had 100 horses we could give him a certified copy for a very small fee or a certificate that they were in the list.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say a word on the &ldquo;humane administration&rdquo; of the Old Age Pensions Act.  I have cases at present in Donegal of people who are waiting three, four, and in some cases five months in order to be examined for blind pensions.  Some of those people went to Derry and got certificates there.  In some of those cases it was held that that was not a sufficient certificate of blindness, although it was given by a qualified oculist.  It now appears that in order to qualify for a blind pension you must submit for examination to the Department's ophthalmologist.  I should like to say that, in my experience, the gentleman who is charged with those duties at present is doing all that any man could possibly do to expedite appeals on blind pensions, but the volume of work which he is called upon to do is quite beyond the capacity of any individual, and the Department, I submit, if they wish to be as humane as the Minister for Local Government or the Minister for Finance would wish us to believe they are, must take steps either to increase the staff of ophthalmologists in the Department of else decide that they will be prepared to accept the certificate of the local medical officer in regard to blindness. I can speak with special knowledge for the County Donegal, as I have no doubt Deputy Blaney could too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilBlanel" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to think that there are no more cases of blindness in County Donegal than there are in any other county, but such as they are, they are being unduly delayed in getting the pensions to which they are entitled.  I have no doubt it applies to Kerry and other counties as well.  It is a matter for immediate consideration. That refers to administration.  I want to refer to a typical case of what the <Col N="1117" /> Department considers to be blindness for the purpose of this Act.  I had a case before the Department of Local Government and Public Health to which I drew the Parliamentary Secretary's attention, and in respect to which I addressed a question to him. It was in regard to a man who was certified to be blind in one eye and to have, if my memory serves me right, 6/16ths of normal vision in the other eye, and the humane administration of the Blind Pensions Act held that that man was not blind for the purposes of the Act at all.  He was told to go out and do his work, and that he was well able to earn his living.  That man has applied again for the pension, and his application is being appealed against. I hope when that appeal comes before the Parliamentary Secretary he will imbibe a little of the humanity which is overflowing from his chief, the Minister, and from the Minister for Finance.  I do not know whether cases like that could be produced from other counties, but until the Minister for Finance is satisfied that cases of that kind do not occur he would be wiser not to speak of the humanity with which he administers the old age pension code.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>This Estimate is not correctly described by the Minister when he says that it has been more humanely administered.  The fact is that the Minister got a wrong Estimate; he must have got a wrong Estimate.  The sum which he got was approximately £230,000, and the sum required was approximately £300,000. There was some reason for that.  There was some miscalculation.  There was apparently an entire misinterpretation of what the Act entailed.  The Act provides not only for the very poor, but for those who are not poor at all; it embraces pensions for people in very comfortable circumstances&mdash;people who are in more comfortable circumstances than members of the Ministry, not-withstanding what we heard last week about the wealth of some member of the Ministry.  The fact is that the Ministry must have miscalculated completely, and got a miscalculation of the estimate of cost.  That is the fact, and <Col N="1118" /> the Dáil should not be misled by the statement that it is owing to a more humane administration.  While that is so with regard to this dispensation of wealth to those who are in comfortable circumstances, there has been a statutory withholding of it from those who have far more moral claim, but are legally debarred by reason of some negligible income, such as a payment from one of the trade unions or something of that sort.  It would be well if the Minister would say that the Ministry in charge of it made a complete mistake in this Estimate, and did apparently not properly calculate nor consider what was the cost of the Bill which was introduced here, and was supposed to look after the very poor, but in its essence looks after the comfortably-off.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask the Minister what time is supposed to elapse between the date on which the local committee testifies that a claim is valid&mdash;a claim for old age pension or a blind pension&mdash;and the date on which payment begins?  How long after the decision?  The reason I ask the question is that I know of a good many cases&mdash;and the Parliamentary Secretary must be aware of them&mdash; where old age pensions and, in some cases, blind pensions, were granted as far back as September, 1932, and the money came only a week or two before last Christmas; in other words, over twelve months had elapsed between the decision and the first payment.  There must be something wrong somewhere. If the Department say they have not got the money, we know where we are. I want to know what is the cause. The cases I referred to must be within the knowledge of the Parliamentary Secretary.  The cases occurred in Cork; I do not know anything about Tipperary, Kerry or anywhere else. The award was given in September, 1932, and they only received payment in December, 1933.  What was the cause of the delay?  When the claimants got their first instalment it amounted to only £3 in some cases, while about £22 or £23 was due.  I should like to know from the Minister what is the cause of that delay?</P>

Several cases were passed in 1932 and nothing has been done with them yet.  I know also certain cases where, within the last week, there was a notification from the Department that the claims were passed for the full pension, and the party died last August.  I think there is somebody responsible, and I hope the Minister will take steps to expedite the matter.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon, posing as the friend of humanity, and speaking from the benches opposite in association with Deputies of this House who, when they were Ministers, virtually refused to concede pensionable rights to any person unless he were stone blind, carries amusement beyond the borders of ridicule.  I said, and I repeat, that this excess is due to a more humane administration of the Pensions Acts than prevailed during the period of our predecessors' administration.  The original estimate of the number of persons eligible for pensions in the current year has not been exceeded, but the estimate of the average weekly amount payable by way of pensions to those persons has been exceeded.  That has been due to the more humane operation&mdash;I again repeat it&mdash;of the Appeals Tribunal in the Department of Local Government and Public Health.  Deserving cases, which possibly under our predecessors would have been turned down owing to a too rigid and unsustainable calculation of means, are now permitted to secure the benefit of the Act, in the spirit in which the Dáil intended when the Act was being passed.  Deputy Dillon has cited one case.  I wonder what chance the particular person concerned in that case would have had of procuring a pension under our predecessors&mdash;a person who, according to the certificate presented, the validity of which would possibly have to be examined and might be contested, had six-sixteenths of normal vision in one eye?  Not if Deputy Dillon had been a member of <Col N="1120" /> the Dáil and had that applicant sitting on his doorstep, and Deputy Dillon brought him up and set him down on the doorstep of his colleague on the front bench, Deputy Mulcahy, would he have the faintest chance of getting a pension.  Many others who have got pensions under this Act and under this Administration would have been in the same position.  Deputy Anthony has cited one case.  He has told us about a person who applied for a pension and was granted it in September, 1932&mdash; granted it by whom?</P>

      <P>And what is more, the Deputy will remember that when the claim was granted&mdash;some time he said in December, 1933&mdash;the arrears of pension which were payable to that person amounted to a sum of only £3. Therefore, the person, if he were to draw the full pension at the rate of 10/- a week, could only&mdash;on the ground of age or some other statutory requirement&mdash;have become entitled to that pension about six weeks before it was paid to him.  On the facts, as the Deputy himself has recited them in this House, the local pensions committee who made the recommendation in 1932 were not justified in doing so.  That is the sort of case we have trotted out here by Deputy Anthony.  The Deputy ought to make sure of his facts before he comes here.  If he wanted this matter investigated he ought to have it put down as a Parliamentary question, and not have relied&mdash;as I believe he is now relying&mdash;on his imagination.</P>

      <P>I would sooner hear someone on the Ministerial Benches who knows something about this matter replying to the criticisms raised here, particularly by Deputy Cosgrave.  I would like to hear someone who can tell us something about the real reasons why this additional money is required.  The humanity that the Minister for Finance speaks about now and then, and that is planned for so very carefully from the Government offices, finds itself oozing out in the strangest possible places.  It is people other than those for whom that humanity is really intended, and about whom the speeches are made and the preachings are carried on here in the Dáil who benefit; it is into other hands than those that that humanity gets itself in the end.  The Minister for Local Government, a day or two ago, insisted that he was not going to do anything to implement the humanity that was spoken about on the turf scheme, and the poor in the City of Dublin are being given turf which the Minister for Education tells was only half the value of coal, at a cost to the ratepayers that is greater than the cost of coal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to hear the Minister for Local Government or his Parliamentary Secretary telling us what is happening under the Old Age Pensions Act.  If they tell us what they know, they will tell the House that what they were told from these benches when they passed the Old Age Pensions Act was true; that is, that the biggest burden of the additional cost that the new Act is putting on this country is a burden for giving pensions to persons in very substantial and comfortable circumstances and who are in no public need of old age pensions at all.  The Parliamentary Secretary very jauntily told the House, when introducing the Bill, that it would cost a certain amount, but that he hoped it would cost more.  The Estimate was more than generous at the time.  Dangers in the Old Age Pensions Act were pointed out here. It would be much more satisfactory to the House, when this Estimate for the <Col N="1122" /> very substantial sum of £75,000 is being presented, if Deputies were given some information as to what happened under the Old Age Pensions Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>There ought to be some particulars showing how this figure is arrived at.  Has the number increased?  The number must be enormously increased to necessitate this substantial Estimate.  It may as well be remembered that people other than those in this House are going to pay for it.  Surely it ought to be possible to get the number of persons concerned; what is the exact amount involved, and how much is humanity responsible for out of the £75,000.  Is it responsible for 10,000 persons getting 1/- a week more, or what exactly are the circumstances?</P>

An official of the Department, who was probably paid £5 or £10 a week, spent three weeks in the area collecting evidence from farmers.  He asked them how long this applicant worked for them, what they paid him, did they give him a bit of tobacco, and so on.  All the information was compiled, and in the end the application was refused.  After a long fight the poor man succeeded in getting 2/- a week.  This man had absolutely no property, and he had lived by the sweat of his brow.  I remember that case perfectly, and we were told that the authorities had acted most generously towards this man.</P>

The Minister hugged himself and said he was the most humane creature who ever sat in these seats, and he intended to get more and more humane with the passage of time.  But the Minister forgets that President de Valera got up three months ago and said that he <Col N="1124" /> was very much dissatisfied with the way the Old Age Pensions Act was being administered.  He said that it seemed to him there was extravagance and that it was clear that tightening was required. I am sure the Minister remembers the President saying that.</P>

      <P>Perhaps he will give his version of it when I sit down.  So far as the itinerant labourer to whom Deputy Corry refers is concerned, Deputy Corry is apparently blandly ignorant of the fact that there is nothing in the Old Age Pensions Act of 1932 which would entitle that labourer to a penny more than he would have got under the original measure, and every penny that that man got under the circumstances which Deputy Corry describes, he was entitled to and would have got and could have got under the old administration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder is the Minister quite satisfied with the charges Deputy Corry has made in a certain set of circumstances, when he knows that the men who were determining the Old Age Pension appeals then are the same men who administer them now?  Does he <Col N="1125" /> believe that any man was deprived of his legal due by the men who were administering Old Age Pensions in 1931?  Does he not know perfectly well that that is the cheapest form of crossroad slander upon a body of men who cannot defend themselves?  Does he not know from his own experience that in all cases that come before the Department of Local Government and Public Health of people who should get the pension, such persons would get that pension?  With all the facts as stated by Deputy Corry, a man earning 6/- a week would be entitled to a full 10/- a week pension.  A man to-day earning 6/- a week, with all the magnanimity of the Minister, is only entitled to 10/- a week.  Is it not so that in 1931 he would be similarly entitled?</P>

One of these is that when Deputy Mulcahy was the proud dictator in the Local Government Department, even Deputy Dillon dare not go there to interview the officials, or to open up one of those cases with the officials.

      <P>The Deputy will have an opportunity of making his speech after me.  I have no doubt the case will now be suitably amended, but the fact remains, with all the attacks on humanity, that what we are concerned with is the administration of the law as it stands to-day, and I draw attention to the fact that if there are hardships experienced by persons who have certain legal rights under the law as it stands to-day, these hardships should be redressed.  If a man who retains 6/16th of his vision is denied a blind pension, that man is suffering a hardship which should be redressed. I remind the Minister that the definition of blindness is that a person shall have vision so defective as to prevent him following his ordinary avocation. Even the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, I am sure, will not pretend to the House that that provision is being literally interpreted.  A person must be a great deal more blind than indicated by that section to get a pension.  I would be very interested to hear from the Parliamentary Secretary his version of what the President had to say as to the administration of the Old Age Pensions Act.</P>

      <P>Two factors gave rise to the necessity for this Supplementary Estimate.  Firstly, there has been an additional expenditure of £603 for actuarial work performed by the British Government actuary under an agency arrangement for the Widows and Orphans' Pensions Committee.  At the time the Estimate was prepared, the British Government actuary's department was not aware what further services would be required in connection with widows and orphans' pensions, but following on a conference between members of the Committee of Enquiry into Widows and Orphans' Pensions, Mr. Kyd of that Department, and Mr. Hendrie of the Ministry of Health, London, further investigation by the actuary's Department was required, and a report obtained for the Committee involving the extra expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second factor involved in the Supplementary Estimate is that from the experience of the nine months to 31st December, 1933, it is now estimated by the Department that an additional sum of £6,700 will be required to meet the State grant on expenditure on benefits and administration by approved societies.  The additional money represents an increase of 3.4 per cent. on the original estimate of £199,000.  The main causes of the additional State expenditure are the increase in the number of insured persons and the increase in the benefits paid which, under the National Health Insurance Acts, automatically means an additional State grant.  Against the additional expenditure of £7,303 there are additional receipts by way of appropriations-in-aid under different headings amounting to £756.  Of this excess, £750 approximately is estimated to be due to repayment by Cumann an Árachais Náisiúnta ar <Col N="1130" /> Shláinte (the Unified Society) of portion of the cost of the salaries of two officers of the Department appointed by the Minister for Local Government and Public Health on the 24th July, 1933, to act as members of the Provisional Committee of the Society.  Furthermore, savings on salaries and travelling expenses, telegrams, telephones, etc., amounting to £4,555 are available.  The sum asked for is £1,992.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Aiken)</NameTxt>
      <P>For a number of years we have advocated that the defence forces of the country should be organised on the basis of a small highly-efficient Army backed by a Volunteer Force, and even the previous Government gave a certain amount of assent to that organisation.  We propose now forming a Volunteer Force that will be wide spread throughout the country and recruiting into it men of good character who are prepared to serve the country.  The Force will be formed within the reserve, and as such will be an integral part of the defence forces of the State.  It will be organised in each military district on a territorial basis in a manner to be prescribed by military regulations.  The units raised in each territorial area will have their own commissioned and non-commissioned officers, but for purposes of command, administration and discipline, they will be subject to the officers commanding the military districts in which the units are located. In the military districts there will be <Col N="1131" /> regimental areas, and in these areas there will be battalions.  To give you an idea of what the regimental areas will be like, I have a provisional list. In the regiment of Laoghis and Offaly will be included the counties of Laoghis, Offaly and Westmeath.  The regiment of Desmond will cover Cork and Kerry.  The regiment of Dublin will cover Dublin City and County. The Oriel regiment will cover Louth, Monaghan and Meath.  The Connaught regiment will cover Galway, Mayo and Roscommon.  The regiment of Thomond will cover Clare and Limerick.  The regiment of Breffui will cover Cavan, Longford, Sligo and Leitrim.  The Tirconaill regiment will cover Donegal. The regiment of Ossory will include Tipperary, Waterford and Kilkenny. The Leinster regiment will cover Kildare, Carlow, Wexford and Wicklow.</P>
      <P>As connecting links between the Regular Army and the various volunteer units, there will be appointed district executive officers representing the district commander and area executive officers representing the various territorial units of the Volunteer Force.  On the district executive officers will devolve the duty of supervising, on behalf of the district commander, the work of the area administrative officers in all matters pertaining to recruitment, to the training and allotment of recruits, and to the custody of public property and the disbursement of public funds.</P>
      <P>The area administrative officers, on the other hand, will act on behalf of the Volunteer units.  The area administrative officers will, of course, be Regular Army officers.  They will initiate and advise on recruitment and will arrange for the training and allotment of personnel to units.  They will be responsible for providing accommodation and equipment for the Volunteers; for promoting social, athletic and recreation activities for the units, and they will be directly responsible for the safe custody, distribution and accountancy of all public property and of any public funds entrusted to the units.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this work the area administrative <Col N="1132" /> officers will be helped in military matters by the regular personnel of the military districts in which the units are located, but in matters not directly of a military character they will be helped by local committees.  Volunteers in each area will be known as &ldquo;The Sluagh&rdquo; of the locality, and from the members of the Sluagh will be formed a Sluagh Committee appointed by the local administrative officer.  In each Sluagh area there will be built or hired halls for the purpose of training, administering and promoting the various activities of the Sluagh, and the Sluagh Committee will help the area administrative officer in seeing that these activities are properly co-ordinated and efficiently carried out.  The members of the committee will not receive any payment, but a secretary, to be nominated by the area administrative officer, will receive an honorarium of £5 a year from public funds.  Further, in respect of each Volunteer who is finally approved, who attends week-end camps and performs a certain number of nightly drills, or who reports for training, there will be paid into the funds of the Sluagh Committee certain grants-in-aid which will be administered by the area administrative officer and will be spent in accordance with prescribed regulations. Such funds will be augmented by local contributions, and will enable the committees to look after the welfare of the sluaighte in their localities.</P>
    <P>The Volunteer Force itself will be organised by three groups or lines.  The first line, generally speaking, will consist of volunteers between the ages of 18 and 25, who will fulfil certain physical conditions laid down by the regulations, and also of old volunteers who had service prior to the Truce in July, 1921.  The ages will be 18 to 25 for the first few years.  Afterwards it is intended to confine recruiting to men between the ages of 18 and 22, but normally for the first years they will consist of volunteers between 18 and 25, and also old volunteers who had service in the Army prior to the Truce in July, 1921.  This last class will, as a rule, serve five years in the first line and will then be transferred to the second line.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1133" /> The volunteers of the first line will receive their initial or annual training with the Regular Army, but in addition they will be required to carry out a certain number of drills each year in the local halls, as well as any week-end or over-night camps arranged. Further, if a volunteer, during his initial training shows any particular aptitude for non-commissioned rank or for any specialised branches of the ordinary service, he will be permitted to extend his training period up to three or four months so that he may be thoroughly trained in the service of the branch concerned and return to his local unit as an instructor or specialist.</P>
    <P>Again, any of these volunteers who have shown exceptional keenness and efficiency as non-commissioned officers and who possess the necessary education will be eligible for commissioned rank in the Volunteer Force, so that in time the Volunteer Force will provide its own instructors, non-commissioned and commissioned officers, and preference will be given to such men for commissions in the Regular Army.</P>
    <P>Finally, during their training periods, volunteers of the first line will receive the same pay and allowances as soldiers of the Regular Army of corresponding ranks.  Apart from that, they will be purely on a volunteer basis.  It is only when they come up for the annual training that they will be paid, and then on the same scale as men holding corresponding ranks or appointments in the Army.</P>
    <P>The second line of the Force will be composed of those volunteers who have been transferred from the first line, and also of men not over 45 years of age passed as fit who possess special qualifications for the corps or service for which they have been attested.  Old volunteers with pre-Truce service are also eligible for this second line.  Volunteers of this second line will not be trained with the Regular Army but will carry on all their training with the local units by means of nightly drills, parades, camps and mobilisations. Volunteers of this line will receive no pay, but when called out for training, camps, parades, inspections or mobilisations they will receive rations, fuel and quarters, or an alternative allowance on <Col N="1134" /> the same scale as allowed to corresponding ranks or appointments in the Regular Forces.</P>
    <P>The third line will comprise men between 45 and 55 years of age passed as fit, who, owing to family or other circumstances, are unable to comply with the requirements of the first or second line.  These men will receive their training with the local units and will serve on the same conditions as volunteers of the second line.</P>
    <P>The Volunteer Force thus organised in three lines will, in time, become self-contained, and every facility will be afforded its members to form not only complete infantry units but also their own medical or ordnance service as well as their own cavalry, engineering, signalling, or transport corps.</P>
    <P>The financial cost of the Force will, of course, depend on the response to the call for recruits.  Twenty area administrative officers have already been appointed, and have received commissions in the Regular Army.  They are at present undergoing a short intensive course of training and administration, and it is anticipated that they will begin work in their areas about the middle of February.  Assuming that each of these officers will, on an average, recruit 250 first and 250 second line volunteers, there is a total of 5,000 of the first line and 5,000 of the second line, and assuming that 300 of the first line will have received their initial training early in March, the cost to the end of the present financial year will be as follows:&mdash;</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1135" /> A large portion of that £63,107 for clothing and equipment will be on foot of the new Volunteer uniform which will be issued.  Some of it is merely a book-keeping item and will really be taken out of stores already at our disposal. This sum of £28,271 will be met out of savings in the Army Vote for the present financial year so that only a token Vote will be necessary.</P>
    <P>During the next financial year, if it is assumed that the strength of the force will have increased from 10,000 to 24,000 the approximate net cost will be £243,736, of which £50,000 will be borne on the Vote for the Office of Public Works in respect of the building of halls.</P>
    <P>The cost of the force has been spread over the different sub-heads of the Army Vote.  This in a sense is undesirable but it is nevertheless unavoidable owing to the structure of the Vote and owing to certain rulings given in previous years by the Committee of Public Accounts.</P>
    <P>In the Supplementary Estimate you will see the additions that have been made to the sub-heads.  It is the only way we could get them up owing to our system of accounting.  The allocation to the sub-heads of the total cost is to a large extent tentative but it cannot be otherwise at this stage.  As the scheme gets into its stride allocation will become more exact, but meanwhile it will be necessary to rely on the power of virement between sub-heads subject to the concurrence of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>Next year, as I have indicated, I will be asking for £50,000 for the building of halls.  It would be impossible to know now how many halls will be required. We have a number of old barracks in different parts of the country and we propose to take them over and fit them up for the volunteers.</P>
    <P>Whenever there is a number of men forthcoming as recruits and there is no suitable hall available for hireage it is proposed to build a hall as quickly as we can go ahead with the work.  I think I have said sufficient to give an indication of the structure of the volunteer force.  There will be three lines, the <Col N="1136" /> first consisting of young men from 18 to 25, normally 18 to 22, who will serve five years in the first line and come up for defence training in the area and these after five years will be transferred to the second line.  They will remain in the second line until they are 45 years, and in the third line from 45 to 50 years.  Non-commissioned officers and commissioned officers will be drawn from the volunteer force after the first annual drilling and training.  The likely men who would make good non-commissioned officers will be given a further period of training and from the non-commissioned officers who have got their training the commissioned officers will be taken.</P>
    <P>When the first line is up for annual training, it will be organised on the same basis as it would in war under its own officers.  When it goes back after that training to join up with the local sluagh, and then, for the purposes of the weekly training, for competitions of all sorts and descriptions, the members will be under the command of the camp commandant, who will be the senior officer of the first line who happens to reside in the district.  We hope that by keeping the competitive strength organised between the different sluaighte, a high standard of training will be maintained in the local halls, and that that will cut down the work to be done when the volunteers come up for training.  As far as I can see we are adopting the same system as they have in Switzerland, with the exception that we are cutting out conscription.  There you have a very small standing army, an army merely of instructors for administering, training and officering an army of 250,000.  That particular type of army did very good work for Switzerland in guarding its neutrality during the war.  It proved that such a type of organisation is sufficient to make even strong neighbours respect a country, and we hope to make ours respected and that, like Switzerland, we shall be able to guard our frontiers against any person who might like to interfere with us.  The scheme, after a number of years, will, I believe, give us a very much more efficient defence force than we have at present, and at a <Col N="1137" /> very much lower cost.  For the first few years, on the building of halls and the providing of uniforms and equipment, we shall have to spend a good deal more money than will be normal after that initial expenditure has taken place.  I think I have pretty well covered anything I wish to say, and I ask the Dáil to pass the Vote.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Both in the scheme put before us by the Minister, and in its manner of presentation, I think we have an astounding state of affairs. The House will recall a Supplementary Estimate in respect to beet being presented to the House, and a great appeal being made by the Minister for Finance that unless it was dealt with there and then, valuable constructive work would be postponed and employment that might otherwise be given, during a very difficult period of unemployment might not be available.  The House found itself through force of the Government's numbers, forced into taking that Supplementary Estimate for a certain amount of money for the erection of beet factories.  To-day the farmers throughout the country are saying, that now that we have got the factories started, the scheme is all nonsense and will not work, while the country is being faced by an expenditure of hundreds of thousands of pounds, which will involve a further expenditure of hundreds of thousands of pounds in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On top of that, we get a Supplementary Estimate for the new army put before the House.  We got the Estimate in our hands a few days ago, but even now the cost of the scheme is partly hidden in the Estimate by putting it under certain sub-heads, so as to take into account certain balances and savings under these particular sub-heads.  Then later on in the Estimate as a whole, further savings are shown, but, as the Minister has pointed out, the expenditure which is shown on the Estimate as only £24,000 is, in fact, going to be about £72,000, in respect of 10,000 men who are going to be recruited under this scheme by the end of this financial year.  Where the scheme is going to end up from the point of view of cost, the Minister tells <Col N="1138" /> us he has no information, good, bad, or indifferent.  So far as expense is concerned we do not know where we are going.</P>
    <P>As far as the question of providing an army is concerned, the information given us by the Minister conveys as little as he did on the finance side. We are apparently going to have a volunteer army scattered throughout the country, divided up into certain areas, with administrative officers in charge of each area.  As far as we can gather from the very brief and certainly not very clear statement of the Minister, the army is to be run by sluagh committees and local committees. That army is to be drilled at night.  It is to have halls&mdash;no one knows where.  We do not know whether it is to be armed and we do not know under whose care these arms are to be kept.  We do not know what type of training is to be pursued.  We do not know what kind of assistance the Minister is going to give the sluaighte and the local committees in the matter of technical officers to carry on their training.</P>
    <P>It is an astounding thing that when a new departure concerning the army, concerning its technical control and what defence strength it is possible to organise in the country is contemplated, a proposal radically changing the whole of our present system is brought in here on a Supplementary Estimate and dealt with in the way that the Minister for Defence has dealt with it.  If there is to be a radical change in the army in this way, every section in this House should ask, considering the importance of our defence forces, that the matter should be dealt with by a very definite piece of legislation that can be thoroughly examined on its various stages passing through the House.</P>
    <P>The House knows now that it is likely to be faced with a very serious situation arising out of the fact that it was not given sufficient time to examine the beet proposals when they were passing through the House.  The proposals now before the House are likely to land us into much more expense and much more difficult <Col N="1139" /> questions of organisation.  What kind of force does the Minister expect he is going to recruit, either between this and the end of March this year or between this and the end of March next year, in the area that stretches from North Roscommon to Carraroe or Clifden?  I am not sure whether the Minister has worked out 20 of those areas, but at any rate he has worked out quite a large number.  One of those areas stretches from the north of Roscommon to the west of Carraroe. What kind of force is going to be developed in that area between this and, say, the 1st of March, 1935, under the area administrative officer?  At what centres are halls to be built?  At what centres are sluaighte going to be organised?  How is the committee of the sluagh to be formed?  Is the local committee to be above the sluagh committee or under the sluagh committee? Offering this type of organisation to the House, as practically a substitute for the present Army, will the Minister give us some idea of what kind of organisation he would expect to have there, say, by the end of March, 1935? Thousands of questions raise themselves from the point of view of administration and training alone; but when we turn to the Minister's statement as to what has been the outlook of the present Minister on the kind of Army we ought to have in this country &mdash;that we ought to have an Army substantially different from the present one&mdash;and to some of his statements made on previous occasions as to changing the type of Army that is in the country, then I submit that he is putting the House up against a very much more serious thing than the mere matter of expense.</P>
    <P>This morning's <i>Irish Press</i> tells us that an important decision has been reached by the Minister in connection with the granting of commissions in the Regular Army.  &ldquo;It is intended to confine commissions in future to the members of the Volunteer Force shortly to be recruited, and to discard the cadet system.&rdquo;  It seems to me that the Minister is preparing to discard more than the cadet system of recruiting officers to the Army, and that the <Col N="1140" /> Minister is, in fact, preparing to discard the whole piece of army organisation that he has at the present moment. The Minister told the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis on the 7th November:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The new Force would be on a purely voluntary basis, and would be organised, with the exception of conscription, on practically the same basis as the Swiss Army.  They wanted to put this country into such a position that it would be able to maintain its neutrality against any foreign power whatsoever.  They believed that that could be done at an expenditure that the people could afford.  They proposed that, with the passage of years, the Army would be on a Volunteer basis, with the smallest possible Standing Army, acting as a training force.  They wanted the Army to be thoroughly representative of the people, and not a Fianna Fáil Army.  They were out to make this a really National Army.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In starting out to make this a really National Army, differing in structure from the present one, the Minister selects, as his 20 officers to organise the new army, 20 men who had been concerned with and organised a long and sustained attack on the present State. Those officers are to be administrative officers for the new areas, and they are to organise a really National Army to replace the present Army.  It is because of the Minister's actions, and the Minister's statements on this subject, that a much bigger and more detailed statement from him and a much more elaborate scheme for passing this measure through the Oireachtas are demanded.  This new Army, as I say, is to be recruited or, at any rate, is to be captained by men who sustained a very big attack on the State.  Will the Minister tell us, are those the men who are to recruit the various men who are going to join the different lines of the new Force?  Are they going to have power to refuse any person that they like?  Is there any limit to the number of persons that they may take into their areas or to their sluagh?  Because of the nature of the administrative officers that have <Col N="1141" /> been selected, a very complete and open statement is certainly required from the Minister as to what powers those men are going to have in the matter of recruiting; how the training is going to be carried on, and under whose direct instruction and supervision; at what particular centres in those areas the instruction is to be carried on, and the nightly meetings are to be held.</P>
    <P>I say that the Minister is replacing the present Army.  He explained to the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis that he did not want to have a Fianna Fáil Army, and that he had always objected to Cumann na nGaedheal having a Cumann na nGaedheal Army.  The Minister has the administration to-day of an Army that has served the State and served the people beforehand absolutely detachedly.  To suggest&mdash;as I think the Minister has done in some of his recent speeches&mdash;that the old volunteers questioned in any way the right of the Dáil to demand their allegiance and their services is entirely unwarranted.  The Minister knows very well that there is a certain number of very self-opinionated persons in every direction, mostly people who fail when they are called upon to give certain services. There might have been people who had their opinions and their discussions, and who argued as to whether the volunteers were right and should come in under the old Dáil, but to suggest that the volunteers as a whole, or any responsible group among them, or any responsible person anywhere throughout the country in dealing with the volunteers, repudiated the Dáil authority in any way once a native Parliament&mdash;even though a proscribed Parliament&mdash;was set up in this country, is to state what is not the case.  The National Army that was formed in 1922 served the State; it served the people; it served them in 1931; it served them in 1932; it served them in 1933 and 1934, apart altogether from the complexion of the politics of the Party that was then in power.</P>
    <P>I submit to the Minister that, as well as prejudicing the Army from the point of view of being a National Army by the type of persons he has appointed to <Col N="1142" /> do the recruiting, he and his Party are also prejudicing the Army in the future as a National Army.  By a National Army I mean an Army that will serve the Government set up here by any majority of the people, whether they want to describe themselves as Republican Governments, like the present Ministry, or as any other kind of Government other than a Republican one.  He is prejudicing the new Army as a National Army by those speeches and by the statements that are being made.  The Government parade themselves in every way as a Republican Ministry&mdash;in their speeches and in their Press.  Deputy O'Dowd, speaking in Boyle on Sunday last, appealed to some of those who call themselves I.R.A. now to come into the new Army.  He said that &ldquo;perhaps when the time came they would be asked to use those guns, but they would never be asked to use them except on behalf of the Republic and under the control of the State.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister, in view of the statements made by himself and his fellow Ministers and by Deputies of his Party along the lines of the statement quoted from Deputy O'Dowd, whether he is recruiting this army as an army that is going to serve no Executive Council and no Government set up by the people except a Government that calls itself a Republican Government. That, I submit, is being definitely held out to persons who are being asked to join this Minister's new force.  An additional force is attempted to be given by some speakers to that appeal, by other Ministers, such as the Minister for Education, making a charge that there are political organisations, or that there is a political organisation in this country, the United Ireland Party, with its League of Youth as an internal part of that Party, planning to seize power by unconstitutional means.  I submit that members of the Party opposite. including Ministers, are holding it up to people throughout the country that a change of Government here that would replace the Fianna Fáil Executive Council by an Executive Council drawn, say, from the United Ireland Party, would be a change brought <Col N="1143" /> about by unconstitutional means and, therefore, was not to be respected by men who were recruited to this new army, on undertakings given by Ministers and others that whenever they would be asked to fight they would be asked to fight only for the Republic.</P>
    <P>The way in which the Beet Estimate was introduced here is now driving Ministers to quibbling and mis-statement. It is driving them to put an additional tax on sugar to-day in order to cover up mistakes costly to the people. The way in which the Minister is introducing this Estimate is going to drive Ministers opposite and members of their Party into further quibbling statements about an army that may give rise later on to serious situations in this country and, for that reason, this House is entitled to ask the Minister to make it perfectly clear that the army he is forming in this particular way, or rather that he is attempting to form, is a national army.  He should make it perfectly clear that in captaining it by the persons he has put in charge of it, that in planning to do away with part of the technical top as well as some of the rank and file of the present standing Army, that in holding out to the recruits of the new force that they are not going to be asked to fight for anything but the Republic, and in holding up the chief Opposition Party as a Party that is going to seize power by unconstitutional means, he is not creating an army which is going to repudiate some day a new Government that will take the place of the present Fianna Fáil Executive.</P>
    <P>I submit that in a blundering and futile way on the one hand, and in an extravagant way on the other, the Minister is blundering into a situation in which he himself does not know what he is doing and he does not know what the results may be.  We from these benches protest as vehemently as we can against the action of the present Executive and the line it is taking in this matter.  It is simply setting out to try to stir up strife and bickering from one end of the country to the other and to put arms into the hands of the people who will be the <Col N="1144" /> centre of that strife and bickering. The Minister has not said a single word as to where the main centres of this organisation&mdash;we have to call it an organisation until we see whether it is likely to be anything like an army&mdash;are going to be, to what extent they are going to be, supplied with arms, and to what extent they are going to be supplied with officers who are skilled in controlling men as well as skilled in training men.  I submit the Minister has told us nothing, good, bad or indifferent about this, and he has put an astounding and far-reaching proposal before the House in a manner that is so inadequate as to suggest that it is done for the deliberate purpose of evading criticism from the House and evading the possibility of the House understanding what he is at.</P>

      <P>The Deputy has referred several times to an Estimate for sugar beet.  The existing sugar beet factories were established, not on the basis of an Estimate, but by an Act passed by the Oireachtas.  The Deputy had ample time to criticise that and make suggestions.  So far as the National Beet Scheme is concerned, it has been from the beginning a success, despite the attempts of the U.I.P. to spike it from a distance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>Whilst the Minister was speaking in terms of war, I was endeavouring to think in terms of peace.  I was wondering whether I was listening to a Minister in a native Irish Parliament or to a Minister in the French Chamber, the German Reichstag, or the Minister for War in the British Imperial Parliament.  I am wondering is this the last army that will be catered for in this country. How many more armies are we going to create?  I look upon this Estimate, and upon the circumstances surrounding it, as one of the most provocative things that could be done in our country at the present juncture and in the present state of affairs.  The first thing that <Col N="1145" /> will strike the common or garden citizen of this country is what is the necessity for this new Force.  This little country which, it is admitted, can never hope to sustain or maintain a large army and cannot under the very best of circumstances be expected to beat a big invading army, is now to be called upon to maintain and sustain a third or fourth army.  I wonder what the common people will say when they read the details set out by the Minister.</P>
      <P>This little country, the population of which is taxed almost out of existence, is to be called upon to bear further expenditure&mdash;and for what?  To get further armies into the country, to create new hostilities and to embitter further the relations that exist between many sections of our community. You propose to establish drill halls in country parishes while you have to-day members of the I.R.A. drilling somewhere else, and some other kind of army recruited from the men of 1921 drilling in a school building or somewhere else.  Would it not be better to cultivate the art of peace rather than the art of war if it is to be called an art?  It is time that Ministers gave a little more thinking to the needs and necessities of the nation and not to asking people to continue to make sacrifices on the altars of their hatreds. If there are people in this House with old spleens and bitternesses to get rid of, let them get rid of them against the people for whom they have these spleens, and not endeavour to bring the people of the country into their quarrel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I look upon this measure as a further endeavour to suggest that we are a people who, instead of settling our differences in the ordinary way should have still further recourse to armies to settle them.  We have seen, as a result of the teaching of many people in the country who should know better, that force is taking the place of argument. This measure can have only one effect if it passes as, of course, it will with a Government majority behind it, namely, that it will further estrange the relationship between this country and Great Britain, and will encourage the idea that we are out to build up a great army in this country.  Is that what the <Col N="1146" /> Minister hopes for?  I honestly do not believe it is, but that is what the effect will be.  We have had enough of armies already.  The people cannot afford them.  They are entirely too great a luxury.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>There were a couple of remarks made by Deputy Mulcahy that should be met at the outset.  I am not going to bother about his reference to beet.  That, as the Minister for Finance pointed out, was very fully discussed here in the House.  We do not share at all the Deputy's views that it is an expensive scheme, or that it is a scheme that if we were to reconsider now we should not have carried out in exactly the same spirit as we proposed to carry it out when it went through the House.  I was through the country at the opening of the factories in connection with this scheme.  The Ministry were aware of representations from every part of the country where farmers wanted to have beet factories established in their areas.  I suppose as long as farmers are farmers, and similarly, other sections of the community, they will always be looking for bigger prices than the particular price they get at the moment.  If the price of beet was two shillings more than it is they would demand another two shillings.  But the point is that the farmers are prepared to grow it, and that they can grow it at the price they receive in return for their labour, and that the community, as a whole, is being benefited by that scheme.  I have not the slightest doubt that if it was the subject of a plebiscite to-morrow we would have an overwhelming vote in favour of the scheme. Once the question has been decided, and that no question of its being taken away arises again, it might be difficult to put the question in a way that you would get a really true answer to it. Therefore, there is no point whatever, and it is not necessary to go further now into the question of beet.</P>

    <P>Perhaps I sympathise to a certain extent with the Deputy opposite when he said he wanted more details.  He has been accustomed to deal with organisations, and he would like to see before him all the details, and I sympathise with that to a great extent.  It <Col N="1147" /> is only natural, and the opportunity to see them will be presented at one time or another to the Deputy.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Defence has the preparation of the Permanent Forces Bill under consideration, and after a time the House will get the whole details of the organisation of the defence forces, and while, as I say, I have a certain amount of sympathy with the Deputy, I am not, at this particular time, going into details.  But some of the principles to which he referred are important, and it is right, at the outset, that there should be no misunderstanding about them.  What is it we propose in the establishment of this force?  Why are we doing it? When we were sitting on the benches opposite we made it quite clear that our view was that the best defence force for this country was one in which we would have a relatively small standing army and that the main defence force would rest upon a territorial basis.  I can assure Deputy Anthony that we have given this matter, for years at least, as much thought, and have more intimate knowledge of what is involved than he thinks.  Anything of the sort he suggested is very far from our minds.  We were told, as I said, that the defence of this country could best be secured by a force in which a standing army will be small but sufficient in an emergency to deal with any internal disturbance, and that in time of attack from outside, it would be the nucleus&mdash; officers and so on&mdash;around which we could gather the whole manhood of the nation.</P>
    <P>A question is whether we should have any defence force at all other than what you might call a mere reserve for the police.  That is a question that people will always ask, and will ask particularly in the case of small countries such as ours.  It is true that if we were attacked by a great power with all its forces we could not maintain an army with any hope of standing up in an ordinary way to an attack launched in that manner.  But there are two things to be considered.  There is the invading of a country and the holding of it.  Our main strategy as regards <Col N="1148" /> defence must always be, it seems to me, based upon this: that if we were invaded and should be unable to keep out the invader, then the invading force will have a very hot time while amongst us, and that the power that tries to establish its rule here in a permanent way will find it impossible to do so.  In our new position we want to have that security, and we want to have another security.  We want to see that no foreign country has any excuse whatever for suggesting that in time of war or strained relationship we would not be in a position to defend our territory.  It is vital that we should be in that position and this force will put us in such a position at any rate that no foreign power will have an excuse for suggesting that we are not able to defend our own shores.</P>
    <P>As to the character of the Army, we want the Army as a whole, not drawn from any particular section of the community, but representative of the community as a whole, and I want to make it perfectly clear that this new Force is being recruited, not in substitution or replacement of the present standing Army, but in addition to it. And, as regards the duties of that Army, every member coming into it will be pledged to accept the authority of the elected representatives of the people.  They will be the servants of the Executive Council.  It is no function, and never should have been at any time a function of the members of the Army to feel that they were to determine policy.  Whatever, at any rate, may have been the position in the past that is our position, and we do not want to do anything which would seem to suggest even that that could obtain in the future.  The Army is to be an Army responsible to the Executive elected by the Irish people. If there have been people trying to stir up bitterness in the past, that charge cannot be laid on the members of the Fianna Fáil Party.  The whole basis of our national policy was that we should try, as far as possible, to put aside the recollection of past dissensions.  It is not we who are going around the roads or the towns trying to stir up these recollections of the past.  It is not from our benches that speeches suggesting <Col N="1149" /> a continuation of that bitterness have been made.</P>
    <P>This addition to the present existing Army is being brought about in order to strengthen our national defences. Unfortunately, it costs money.  Insurance or assurance of all kinds costs money, and what the people have to ask themselves is, whether the assurance or insurance which is to be provided by this Force is called for or not. The Executive Council believe that it is called for.  It believes that when this Force is organised, no matter what Executive Council comes into office, having been elected by the Irish people, that Executive Council will have at its disposal an Army to protect the interests of the community as a whole and obedient to its orders.  It would certainly be rather a strange turn for us to take if we at this time proposed anything else.</P>
    <P>Suggestions of inconsistency have been made against us from many quarters.  We can point out that from the time of the &ldquo;Cease Fire&rdquo; order, when the forces who were defending the State, as we conceived it to exist, when we who were at that time the regular army were beaten in the defence of the State which was proclaimed by the people, and was not at that time abandoned by the people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I am dealing with the point raised by Deputy Mulcahy, who suggested that the officers of the new force were people who had taken up arms against the community.  I say that they had taken up arms in defence of the Republic which had been proclaimed at that time.  We may differ, we do differ in our construction of that. Historians may differ about it.  But the attitude of the Executive towards these officers is that they took an oath to maintain a certain State against all enemies, foreign and domestic; they continued faithful to that oath; and that it was in continuance of that faithfulness that they served as they did.  When it was clear that it was not physically possible to maintain that State, we made proposals to the <Col N="1150" /> Executive of the day, because we had in mind the whole future of the country and the possibility of ordered conditions here.  We made propositions to the Executive of that day which would have ensured those stable conditions, which would have ensured that the arms, in so far as it was possible for anybody to collect them, would have been collected and made available for the Executive and under the direct control of the Executive elected by the people.  But these were turned down. The oath was the pivotal point in connection with it.  When the Executive of the day did not accept our proposals we went to the people and have been elected and these proposals stand as the basis of our policy, which is, that when all sections of the people are entitled to come forward at an election and to vote for their representatives, and have their representatives elected, and it is possible in that way to have an assembly completely representative of all the people without any excluding tests, it is the duty of every section of the community to accept the authority of the Executive elected under those conditions.  The very same propositions which we put up to the Executive of that day and which were turned down are the basis of our policy to-day when we are the Executive.  We believe that they are based upon reason, that they are based on fair play to every section of the community, and we propose to stand by them no matter what section of the community may refuse to accept them.  We believe that there is no reason whatever for refusing to accept them.  Consequently, the army which it is proposed to recruit, the additional volunteer section of the army, will, every one of them be expected to make a declaration accepting the authority of the elected representatives of the people.</P>

      <P>It is the Deputy's side who are trying to get that done. I said they were not Irregulars; that that was propaganda deliberately put out by these people at the time.  I was not supporting an Irregular Army.  I supported the Army that was defending the State against the coup d'etat brought off at the time.  If there is a difference of opinion, and Deputies opposite want to hold their view of that, they can, but they are not going to get us to accept that view.  Therefore, we are putting to the defence of their country men who defended it in accordance with the oath which they had taken to defend it.  What we want to do is to see that there is back again in the National Forces both sections of the men who defended it from 1919 to 1921, however they differ in politics. They defended it side by side then, and they will be side by side, please God, in a short time again.  That is what we are aiming at.  Nobody can say a word against these men.  Let it go to history to be decided, and we will see.  I am quite prepared, for instance, if the members on the opposite side wish to have the whole Treaty negotiations published&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If we are to have from the opposite side their interpretation of recent history, then we are to give ours.  We are standing up before the Irish people in the selection of these men, because we hold they were honourable men and good Irishmen who gave proof of their devotion to the country from 1919 to 1921, and one of the things that gave me most satisfaction in a long period of time was to be at the ceremony when these men were being taken over, and see them once more with their previous comrades getting into a position in which they would be side by side in any future defence of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not, then, in any partisan spirit that this force is being recruited.  It is not, as Deputy Mulcahy has suggested two or three times in his remarks, that we want to replace the existing force by any other.  We do not.  The members of the present Army as it stands have fought against us, and we fought against them in the civil war. And Cumann na nGaedheal, by the way in which it left office, did more than anything it had done during its period of office to show its sincerity, so that the Army by its loyalty has given the lie to anybody who suggested that their motives were other than they themselves represented.  I only regret that Cumann na nGaedheal did not continue and that it did not insist that no outsider would come in and change <Col N="1153" /> them from their tracks and from continuing in preserving the same attitude for the rest of the time as they had continued in when they left office.</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>What I have to say is with regard to the only two matters of importance that I think need be replied to.  The first charge was replacing the existing Army by another. There is no truth whatsoever in the suggestion that we are replacing the existing Army by another.  It is by way of complement and not in any form of substitution for the other.  It is in continuance of the policy which we announced here as being the best State policy when we were in Opposition, a policy towards which the <Col N="1155" /> previous Executive appeared at one time to be leaning.  I am glad to follow this policy, because it is the best policy.</P>
      <P>The next point made was the suggestion that this part of the Army would not be responsible to the Executive or the subsequent Executive that might be elected by the people.  I have a similar answer to that.  Those who are to be recruited into the new Force are to be completely and absolutely responsible to the Executive Council elected by the Irish people.  These are the two serious matters about which I thought it necessary to intervene.</P>
      <P>The third charge was that the officers whom we had chosen as administrative officers in this case were chosen in order that there might be some particular definite bias about the selection. I want to deny that too.  They were chosen because they were officers who had proved their devotion to the country, officers who, in our opinion, were perfectly loyal and who were amongst the men who on a previous occasion defended the country and knew something about the type of activity that would be necessary to provide the most valuable type of defence.  They were chosen so that the two sections of the former Defence Force, who had unfortunately been on opposite sides in the civil war, should be reunited in defence of the nation and in defence of the people of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>This Vote is a Vote for money.  The speech that we have just listened to was a political speech, a hashed-up political speech, a very biased political speech that can be made with an air of sincerity, with certain particles of the truth and certain very large omissions from the truth.  We are proposing to spend a sum of approximately £60,000 before the end of the financial year.  We are doing it at a time when the unemployment figures are enormous, when we have lost through the policy of the Government the export of approximately 50 per cent. of our fat cattle, for which there is no longer sale, and at a time when we read in the Press of <Col N="1156" /> a new imposition of ½d. per lb. on the price of sugar.  We are told that although this expenditure is approximately £60,000 to the end of the financial year, a sum of close on £300,000 will be on the Estimates next year in respect of this particular service.  One of the first considerations that would present itself to the mind of any person who had introduced an Estimate of this sort, which would be spoken to by the Head of the Executive, is whether there was any necessity for strengthening the defence arm of the State, if there was need for the expenditure of the money, if the resources of the State were equal to the cost of that particular service, and if the needs of the State required that it should be spent.  We got no explanation in respect of this but we have got an apologia in respect of the policy that is behind this particular proposal and the policy that is behind it is, apparently, the only reason for the introduction of the Vote.</P>
      <P>This is a departure from the principle that is embodied in the Defence Forces Act.  One might reasonably have expected that a new Act would have been introduced or that an explanatory statement in respect to the policy which the Minister read out for us would have been circulated in the shape of a White Paper, that it would be introduced on its merits and not as an excuse for the failure of the gentlemen who are at present in office, and who were in arms eight or ten years ago, who failed in arms but who succeeded by reason of their promises in deluding the people in the short period of 12 or 18 months.  The Minister may smile, but he knows very well that he was the biggest promiser and how well he has succeeded.  Time will tell whether or not it is worth while succeeding at the cost of one's word, at the cost of the suffering which the policy of the Party opposite has entailed, the spoliation of the country's resources, commercial and industrial, and the ruination of its principal industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This proposal is brought forward at a time when one would imagine from what the Government says that everybody in the country is doing well. <Col N="1157" /> There are some farmers in the Fianna Fáil Party.  Has there ever been a meeting called by them to consider the events of the last few years, or to consider whether they will be able to balance their accounts?  Have any of them gone before the Ministry and explained to them that under present circumstances it is not possible to make farming a successful commercial operation?  Are they looking at the list of persons unemployed, seeing the mounting costs of home assistance day after day, seeing the Government's own inability to contribute towards the relief of rates on agricultural land during the last 12 months the amount they had contributed during the previous 12 months?  By the way, they did not inform the electorate that they were going to reduce that amount.  Is this the time that we have got £60,000 to spend in the next two months and £300,000 to spend in the next year on this new army?  I was in for portion of the speech made by the President in which he said that he had put certain proposals before the previous Executive.  There were no proposals put to the Executive.  There were certain proposals sent to me, at the time when he was on the run, and when I undertook to give a safe conduct to the persons who were going to see him that they would not be followed.  That proposal was that we should allow him to take the money that was in dispute in America to use it for the purpose of his political propaganda. That was a very nice proposal&mdash;that the people here should be asked to pay to the Americans one and a half millions so that it would be handed over to the Fianna Fáil Party to be used for the purpose of the Republic by the Royal and Imperial Republicans.  They were neither Royal nor Imperial at that time.</P>
    <P>Twenty officers have been commissioned in the army.  We are told they are excellent men, that they had records, and so on.  Are they all physically fit?  Do they all fulfil the standards which are expected from the officers of an army?  Would they satisfy both Parties?  Suppose there were some angel of peace in this country, who sought to do what the <Col N="1158" /> President had told us he is endeavournig to do or that his Executive is endeavouring to do, to bring about peace, would any person commission these 20 officers for this particular purpose?  They are selected by the Executive and they are political selections. There can be no doubt about that.  They will not have, I am sure, the hardihood to deny the fact that they are political selections and that they are being sent out to the country to make political selections for the Army.  Mind you, that is not good business.  That was not done during the time of the Cumann na nGaedheal Government.  It was not thus with the Army that fought for this State, and preserved this State, and as a result of whose efforts the Ministry sitting over there is in office to-day.  It was a competent Army and it proved its competence.</P>
    <P>I observe that a sum of £2,500 is down in this Estimate, no portion of which will be returned to the Comptroller and Auditor-General, and which will be disbursed in accordance with regulations to be made by the Minister.  We heard no particular reference to that sum of money.  It so happens that it is in accordance with the Vote that was passed here some 18 months ago, a Vote of £2,000,000 under which a prosecution arose in the courts which was reported in the <i>Irish</i><i>Independent</i> of the 14th November, 1933.  In the course of that case the judge in the criminal court said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That Act did not define what &lsquo;the present emergency&rsquo; was. Neither he nor the jury should be asked in a court of law, and especially of criminal law, to guess at the meaning of these words or as to what might have been decided by the appropriate Minister, group of Ministers, or Department, as to what should be done with this £2,000,000 or whether it was ear-marked for the payment of cattle bounties.  There might at least have been produced in court some person who could tell them authoritatively whether any decision has been made or any resolution passed as to the payment of bounties and the basis on which they should be paid.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1159" /> The Vote which is now before us states:</P>
    <P>The expenditure of these Grants-in-Aid will not be accounted for in detail to the Comptroller and Auditor-General and any unexpended balance of the sums issued will not be surrendered at the close of the financial year.</P>
    <P>In the &ldquo;details of the foregoing&rdquo; it is stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Provision required to enable Capitation Grants at the rate of five shillings in respect of each volunteer of the first line and second line who is finally approved, to be made to area funds to be established under regulations and administered by area administrative officers for purposes to be defined by the Minister for Defence.</P>
    <P>I do not approve of having money voted in that fashion in this House. There were no members of any Party more anxious and more jealous for the exercise by the Comptroller and Auditor-General of control and inspection during the period from 1927 down to 1932 than the members of the Ministry and their supporters.  Why that departure should be made now I do not know.  We have, however, a precedent for a criticism of a similar sum of £2,000,000 which was made by the Ministry in July, 1932, and to which very strong exception was taken by us. The main point in connection with this particular Vote is: Can the country afford the expenditure of this sum of money at this particular time? If we were satisfied that it could, the question that should ge before that is: &ldquo;Is it necessary?&rdquo;  Is it necessary for the defence of this State?  What is there that is menacing the security or the stability of the State?  It is to preserve, we are told, our neutrality. It is not, I am sure, to be a branch of what is called the neutral I.R.A.  The whole and sole purpose of this is to ensure our neutrality.  Who is menacing it?  What are the dangers affecting it?  Who is there that is likely to attack us?  If we were going to be attacked is this the best system to adopt in order to meet the attack?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1160" /> We had a new policy in connection with the Army partially disclosed to us this evening.  I should say that the second explanation of the expenditure of the money is nearer to the truth than the first&mdash;that it was a desire to try to rehabilitate in a military order some of those who were defeated eight, ten or 12 years ago.  As an act of grace nobody will object to the principle of that, more particularly if they were suitable to the purposes for which they were being recruited, if in the circumstances of the time one could justify it, and that those commissions would not interfere with the ordinary promotion of young officers having had eight, ten or 12 years' service.  When reference was made to the disputes that took place eight, ten or 12 years ago, and to the civil conflict that took place, there was very great care exercised in eliminating any references to the people's choice on those occasions.  After all, the people have some right in this country.  They have the right to vote. They have the right to express their opinion.  For a long period, 12 years ago, that was denied to them&mdash; absolutely denied to them.  We had stone-age criticisms of plebiscites.  We had objections&mdash;&mdash;</P>

There are other people who have their conceptions of truth, purity and righteousness, and they say that, by whatever method, no crowd of men and no organisation, political, military or otherwise, has the right to put a stop to a decision by the people on a political question which concerns the people.  The whole sum and substance of the objections there were to political meetings at the time&mdash;when the rails were torn up from the railroads, when the roads were blocked by trees, when shots were fired at public meetings&mdash;and the whole principle at the back of that opposition, was to prevent the people of this country from giving a decision which Deputies opposite knew quite well was going to be in favour of the Treaty that had been signed.</P>

      <P>Subsequently, yes. How many might have paid it had meetings taken place in June?  I was addressing myself to the subject of public meetings and the people's authority to decide matters.  The Army which this Government entered into control of was the Army which was under Cumann na nGaedheal.  It was the Army which accepted, and at all times accepted from the date of its formation, the authority and the right of the people to elect their representatives and from those representatives to elect a Government.  When Deputies opposite can say the same in respect of any persons who are going to be commissioned as officers in the Army then there is no objection to them, provided that all the other qualifications that commissioned officers should have are fulfilled.  It is an unfair allegation and an untrue allegation to say that the Army which the present Minister for Defence presides over&mdash;the Army Council&mdash;was a Cumann na nGaedheal Army.  Ministers know there were people with commissions in the Army who did not agree with us politically.  There was none of them dismissed or none of them removed from office for any political differences.  We stand, and all the time have stood, for every service of the State, civil or military, to recognise the authority that the people have in electing a Parliament in the first place and a Government in the second place.  I am not blind to the fact that there is a difference between authority and power and might.  This Government has gone mad on the assumption that because it has might it has power.  There is nothing of the sort.</P>

      <P>Those long in authority are always capable of restraining themselves; those who are dressed in a little, a brief, authority are unequal to doing so.  Unless there is a different statement made in connection with the proposals presented here, they are political proposals, and they are bad as such and they must have a disturbing effect upon the officers of the Army.  I regret that very much.  Those men have served the State well.  If they are not capable or equal to their particular tasks, take their resignations, get more suitable persons, but get them on the ground of suitability.  I object to this Vote, in the first place, because the necessity for it, the actual physical necessity, does not arise and has not been evidenced.  There is no danger affecting this country.  I object to it in the second place because it is going to spend £300,000 of our money next year, when the state of business in this country, and its main industry, cannot afford any such expenditure. If I wanted proof of it I have it in the extra halfpenny put on the pound of sugar.  Is that going to make up the £300,000?  It is published in the Press <Col N="1165" /> as a tax on foreign sugar.  Did anybody ever hear such nonsense, everyone knowing that five-sixths of the sugar consumed here is foreign sugar?</P>
      <P>It is going to get money and it is getting the money from the poor who can ill afford it and who, if it were put to them, would not agree to even one-third of that halfpenny being spent on an army such as this.  Assuming all is correct and that the commissoned officers are the best that can be got and that the scheme is put forward for our consideration only as a scheme, what is it going to get us? Do you think a month's training in the year is going to produce a soldier? I object to it on the third ground because of this expenditure of £2,500 in unusual circumstances.  There is no reason why the Comptroller and Auditor-General should not be able to look over all accounts and we should not be again put in the position that we were in before a judge of our own courts, when he said he had nothing to guide him as to how the money voted by this Parliament should be spent.  I object principally because of the speech to which I have listened from the President of the Executive Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened to the President's speech and, of course, as usual he deprecated any going back to the past, but then characteristically proceeded to go over a large amount of distorted history.  I do not propose to follow him.  He is very adequately answered by a letter that he wrote in the month of September, 1922, to a gentleman called Charlie Murphy in which he spoke about Rory O'Connor's repudiation of the Dáil.  His own words are there giving the lie to the story he tried to put up just now.  I listened to him and one phrase he used was that it never should have been the function of the Army that it should determine policy.  I object to that because there seems to be an implication in it that the Army&mdash;I am not referring now to the irregular carryings-on in 1922&mdash;did attempt to determine policy.  The President seemed to admit that when the present Government received the Army from as it was a fact, as I had always said <Col N="1166" /> and was ridiculed by the Opposition at the time for saying it, that the Army was a loyal body, not a political body; a body of disciplined men ready to obey all orders given to them under the aegis of a legitimate Government. That was what the Government received and the Army never attempted to determine the policy.</P>
      <P>The President did say that the new members of this new Force will have to make some sort of attestation.  I would like to know will they take the oath that is prescribed for members joining the Army at the present moment, or is there going to be some other form of words put up that will enable them to draw the benefits of joining the Army and not commit their consciences to loyalty to this State?  The President and his Government have gone to the end of the earth, so far as one can judge from the newspapers, to bring back men who, as the President himself says, were parties to that repudiation of the Dáil in 1922, which, quoting the President's own words, he said he was so foolish as to agree with.  That may be quite all right on the lines the President puts forward for it, but it means an injustice to the men in the Army.</P>
      <P>The rule with regard to the Army is that if a man wishes to have a commission he has to be within a certain limit of age, he has to pass an examination indicating his educational qualifications and he then has to go into the Army and serve for two years as a cadet, passing an examination at the end of the first year and the final examination at the end of the second year.  When those men go into the Army they should, and justice demands that they should, be able to look forward to a progressive promotion as time goes on, provided always that thay prove themselves fit and efficient officers in the work they have to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What this Government has done is this.  Although it has plenty of officers in the Army, men who have given long service, dangerous and devoted service, and although it has in the Curragh cadets who have had to pass educational tests and fulfil medical requirements and who had to give two years' apprenticeship there, this <Col N="1167" /> Government has gone to the ends of the earth to bring back other men.  I do not know what steps were taken to find whether these men were physically fit, whether they possess the necessary educational qualifications; but one thing is certain, and that is that the men in the Army, the officers of long standing, have time and again had to go through courses, all aiming at giving them a competent knowledge of their craft.  These men who are now brought back are jockeyed into the Army.  Their function, I presume, will be the training of men.  The Army has been preparing its officers for the training of men and yet we go right outside the ranks of the Army, involving as that does injustice to officers in the Army, and the plea for that is that the Army is to be representative of all sections of the community.</P>
    <P>During my time in the Army there were a number of examinations for cadets to join the Army as officers.  I never made any inquiry whatsoever as to what their political opinions or affiliations were.  But these men have been chosen presumably for no other reason than that their political affiliations are known.  So far as the cadets who joined the Army within the last six or seven years were concerned, to my own personal knowledge nobody inquired what their political opinions were.  They might have been ferociously Fianna Fáil for all we knew.  The only two men whose politics I knew in the Army were two men who told me that they were strong supporters of the Labour Party.  There was no question of that.  But now regardless of justice and any sense of fairness to the men who have devoted service in the Army, year after year, and were entitled to avail of their pensions later on, these others are now dragged in to be placed over men who have been all the time in the Army, and who are now to be deprived of the promotion that they had every right in justice and fairness to look forward to, provided they did their duty properly and were efficient.  Now we are told that men have been brought from the ends of the earth because they previously <Col N="1168" /> defended this country.  The Government opposite had to go to Australia and America to find out men who previously defended this country.  How many officers in the Army, of long standing, are there who have not previously defended this country? The whole implication of the President's speech was that he could not get men for these new positions who had previously defended this country and that is the reason why he had to hunt up all his friends.  The suggestion that he could not get men who previously defended this country here in the Army was an outrageous libel on the men who gave unstinted and unsparing service to this country. That is an indication of what is behind this whole proposal.</P>
    <P>I would like to know under what Article of the Defence Act this thing is being done.  I presume it means that every member of this new Defence Force will have to join the Regular Army for some period of time, no matter how short it may be.  I think the details should be explained by the Minister.</P>
    <P>As the Leader of the Opposition has pointed out, this is going to add an additional £300,000 per annum to the cost of the Army.  The present Estimate for the Army of £1,253,324 is the Estimate for this year.  That already is considerably in excess of the actual cost of the Army during the last year that I was in control of it.  I know that at that time Deputy de Valera, as he then was, went round the country suggesting that the Army was the cause of enormous expenditure.  On 4th January, 1932, Mr. de Valera said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The removal of the Oath would save the country a vast amount on the Army, which was maintained on a large scale simply because there were Irishmen and women who believed that so long as the country was not free they had to win its freedom.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>All this additional expense according to him was being incurred because the country was not free.  On 20th December, 1931, Mr. de Valera said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Free State Army was costing £1,500,000 per year&rdquo;&mdash;that was not a fact&mdash;&ldquo;and it was being kept up <Col N="1169" /> solely for keeping down the people who being denied representation in the National Assembly through the imposition of the Oath were thrown back on force.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now the Oath is removed.  The President had assured people that one of the great advantages of the abolition of the Oath and incidentally the breaking of the Treaty would be that it would save this country an enormous amount of expense, because they would then have a completely satisfied population behind them to enforce their authority.  Deputy Geoghegan, speaking at Athlone on 3rd January, said that:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We were maintaining an Army at a cost of £1,500,000.  If they were foolish enough to want to go to war with a foreign power the Army was not adequate, but as regards a civil war who wanted it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now we are going to increase the cost of the Army though the Oath has been removed, and the President said that that was the only reason for having an Army at all.  He promised the people of the country that if they abolished the Oath there would be a large saving in the cost of the Army, which at that time was, I think, about £1,100,000 odd.  The cost is now £1,250,000 and on top of that we are putting an additional cost of £300,000. I would like to know this: I may be misunderstanding the situation and perhaps the Minister might make it clear.  These Volunteers will not only be recruited but trained in various parts of the country, and I presume will be men who showed their suitability by supporting the Party opposite when it repudiated the Dáil. I presume there will be some sort of halls in which they will be trained.  I would like to know will these local forces be controlled by officers and sergeants or sergeant-majors or will there be local committees to make arrangements with regard to the training carried on in these halls, and to make other arrangements.  Will there be a committee or will the management only be in the hands of officers and N.C.O.'s who will control the men <Col N="1170" /> without any other arrangement whatsoever? If there is to be a committee will it be a military committee or a civilian committee?  Everything about this proposal smells badly of corruption. We are getting rather used to corruption with this Government, but I feel indignant when that corruption takes the form of denying ordinary justice and fair play to officers in the Army.  It may be well to give equal rights to everybody irrespective of whether their past is criminal or otherwise, because, of course, we all of us can be susceptible to grace and change.  But I do not see why, from the mere fact that a man repudiated the Dáil in 1932, he should be given rights and privileges denied to other people in the country and given these rights and privileges at the expense of men in the Army.  I do not see why these men should be put into the Army to deprive other men of the promotion to which they are entitled. These proposals are not of any good from the point of view of defending the country.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Defence has been long enough in the Army now to realise or at least he ought to have been, that these isolated places in the country are, not going to be the best means of getting the best training for men in the Army.  In my time I did something of that kind when I started the B Reserve, but I realised when these men were brought in that they would have to be brought into some central place where the best means would be available for giving the maximum amount of training in the minimum amount of time.</P>
    <P>There are many points that we want to know something about.  For instance, under what section are these men recruited?  For what reason are the Army regulations disregarded as to the commissioning of officers?  What arrangements will there be as to whether or not there will be committees looking after the position of these men?  Again, I protest against selecting men from the ends of the earth and putting them over men who have been long in the service of their country and previously defended this country and who have a more honourable <Col N="1171" /> and nobler record than men who are now brought back to take their places.</P>

      <P>The speech we have heard from Deputy Fitzgerald and the speech before it from Deputy Cosgrave were not the product of mere thoughtlessness. They were uttered with deliberate intent.  Deputy Cosgrave's references to the obscure incidents of 1922, which I am sure a number of Deputies sitting behind him did not understand&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Cosgrave was not the first speaker in the debate.  He was preceded by other members of the same Party who were following what was obviously a deliberate policy of the Party in relation to this estimate. They were determined to bring in here the apple of political discord and have it dissected during the discussion on this particular Vote. They did that of deliberate purpose. They knew that it might be regarded as bad national policy, that it might have undesirable consequences, but, nevertheless, they decided to do it because, irrespective of the national consequences, they thought they might get some political advantage for themselves; just the type of political advantage they thought they would get 12 months ago when they published an announcement to the Army to assure them that if Cumann na nGaedheal were re-elected to office Deputy Fitzgerald would not be made Minister for Defence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A very great thing has happened. The greatness of it is apparently <Col N="1172" /> incomprehensible to Deputies opposite. Because they are unable to comprehend it they come in here with the old political catch-cries, with these efforts to try and revive memories of things better forgotten, so that the greatness of the thing which has happened will not be seen.  It was one of the most significant things that ever happened in this country when those 20 officers received their commissions in the presence of those against whom they had been fighting in the civil war.  Ten years ago, eight years ago, prayers were being offered in every Irish church and household that that day might come soon.  The day has come.  The memory of the civil war is being wiped out. It is being wiped out despite the efforts of Deputies opposite to keep it alive. Those who were sundered by the mistake of 1922 and put into opposite camps have come together again in a single league of service under a common bond of loyalty.  Can we afford it?  Deputy Cosgrave wants to know. We can afford one thousand times the sum involved in this estimate just to secure the elimination of the memory of the civil war and the creation of some guarantee that no designing politicians, Irish or English, will ever be able to bring it about again.  Is it necessary?  It was the most necessary thing in the political life of the country for the past decade and Deputies opposite should try to take joy in that accomplishment instead of coming in here with petty words endeavouring to revive old hates and bitterness between these men who are now working together again.  I think it was Lenin who said that words are sometimes more explosive than bullets.  If the civil war were a mere matter of fighting, the memory of it would have caused no great disturbance to the life of the country.  Men can get together and fight and when the fight is over forget about it.  But, those who did not do the fighting, those who only spoke about it, who went around the country keeping alive the memory of the things which happened during the fight, so that the hate engendered by the fight should not die, were the men who were responsible for the <Col N="1173" /> damage that we attribute to the civil war.</P>
    <P>The damage done by the civil war itself was a mere matter of material things.  The damage done by the fools who spoke at every cross-roads in the country, glorying in the fact that they had succeeded in knocking the devil out of their brother Irishmen, is the damage that we are now trying to repair and that, thank God, we are repairing.  The men who did that damage have the will to repeat it in them still.  They did not work out all their venom in the speeches at public meetings.  Some of it is still left, and that is why we have these speeches here to-day.  They see this reunification taking place; they see old memories dying; they see the platform on which they climbed to power disappearing beneath them and they are trying vainly by the old methods to restore it again, but they will not succeed.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzgerald said that the Army never attempted to dictate policy.  He can speak for the time when he was Minister for Defence. We can speak for the time when we were the Government and during our time it never did.  It was, I think, a very great thing that the change of Government took place in all the circumstances existing in this country without any disturbance.  It is a tribute to every officer and soldier in the Army, because no matter what Deputy Fitzgerald may say about that Army not having been recruited on political lines, it was recruited in circumstances which confined its membership to those who had taken one side in the civil war.  It is, as the President said, a testimony to the sincerity and the honesty of purpose of the men who are in it, that when the people decided upon a change of Government and policy they accepted the people's decision.  We got from that Army the same loyalty as they had given to our predecessors.</P>
    <P>Now the time has come when an effort should be made to extend the idea of organising and training in the national defence outside the limited membership of that permanent Force. That is why the attempt has been made to establish this Volunteer <Col N="1174" /> Force.  There will be brought into that Force, not men who were on one side or the other in the civil war, but all the youth of the country who are prepared to organise themselves voluntarily so that their services will be available if needed.  In doing so, the basis of the Army will be extended and the last concrete evidence that there ever was of the civil war in this country will disappear.  Those men who were recruited into the Army for the purpose of organising this Volunteer Force were not recruited on political lines.  No matter what Deputies opposite may say or think, I want to assure through them the people of the country that that was not the consideration in the mind of the Executive Council when they were being selected.</P>
    <P>They were selected because, in our opinion, they were the best people for that post, the best qualified in every way.  Their acceptance of these commissions and the manner in which the commissions were conferred on them, their association with those who were in the regular Army and were there before them is a guarantee that this new Force is going to be a national Force and not a mere appendage of one political Party or another, a Force that will be there to defend this country is such defence is needed.  I do not know whether such defence will be needed.  There is one country in Europe that took the course of abolishing its army, trusting to the declaration of the great powers and the formula that were embodied in international agreements.  But this particular country did not keep to this decision for long.  They reconstituted their army again.  They felt that as they were up against great military powers they could not effectively prevent invasion, but that they could nevertheless so acquit themselves in the case of invasion that the damage they were capable of inflicting would deter the invaders from making the attempt.</P>
    <P>If any great military power plans to invade this country we cannot stop them.  But if we have got the youth of Ireland organised and trained militarily we can make it possible to inflict such damage upon the invading <Col N="1175" /> forces that no power, great or small, will lightly undertake the task.  The Army which exists is small in numbers but it is highly efficient and highly trained.  It might be better equipped. But nevertheless it is capable of giving effective service.  If its fighting power is to be maintained there has got to be associated with it a wider organisation such as the Volunteer Force now to be brought into existence.  The establishment of that Volunteer Force gives us a much more effective unit but it also has national advantages to which I have made reference.  I do not think it is necessary to say more than has been said in defence of this Estimate. I would ask Deputies opposite to try for a short while to forget that they are Party politicians and to remember that the needs of this country are greater than the needs of their Party. The work they can do for this country is much more important than the work they can do for their Party.  Though they may get some advantage, though they may get when the ballot boxes are opened a few Army votes by making the sort of speeches that Deputy Mulcahy and Deputy Fitzgerald have made, I say this, that in the long run they will have done much better work for their country and their Party by taking another line.</P>

      <P>There may be an adequate case to be made for the Estimate or the proposals which lie behind the Estimate that we are called upon to consider to-day.  But if there is such a case I venture to say that it has not yet been presented to this House.  The Minister for Defence rose to inform the House that he and his colleagues had decided to revolutionise, to reconstruct, our military system.  I remember when something of the same kind was done in England about 28 years ago that the Minister for War in that country thought it necessary to overwhelm the House of Commons with a record speech lasting four-and-a-half hours. The Minister for Defence here has very different ideas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, thank God, but perhaps he went rather to the <Col N="1176" /> opposite extreme when dealing with the proposals of the importance of these before us.  He spent only about ten minutes on his feet.  Brief as his speech was there were some statements in it which were hard to reconcile with the later utterances of some of his colleagues.  I might say that one of the statements in the Minister's speech which most struck me as being a reason for supporting these proposals was that they would lead to a less expensive system of defence than we had up to the present; in the future system, the Regular Army was to be still further reduced and the net result would be that we would be spending less money on our defences than we have been spending heretofore.  There has been plenty in the speech both of the President and the Minister for Industry and Commerce which must lead one to the conclusion that no thought of that sort is entertained by them.</P>
      <P>We have had an estimate given us that as a beginning these proposals next year will cost £300,000 and perhaps much more later.  According to the Minister for Industry and Commerce that is a very cheap price to pay for what has been accomplished. According to him it would be worth not £300,000 but £300,000,000 a year to accomplish what he says they are going to accomplish.  He says it would be worth £300,000,000 to this country to restore these 20 gentlemen to the bosom of their comrades.  I am bound to say that I consider that view a trifle exaggerated.  I consider it rather characteristic of the mentality of the people on the opposite benches who think that they themselves, and their past and their little individual histories, and the individual histories of a certain set of men with whom they were closely associated, are the most important things in this country and that the unfortunate ordinary citizen does not matter at all in comparison.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A few minutes later the Minister for Industry and Commerce told us that in point of fact these 20 persons had not been appointed on political grounds at all, that they had been appointed because they were the best men.  If it was worth £300,000 a year to get them for political reasons why were they not <Col N="1177" /> got for political reasons?  The Minister for Industry and Commerce flatly contradicted himself.  As a matter of fact they were appointed for political reasons and it is ludicrous to pretend otherwise.  What an extraordinary coincidence it would be that if you went out to get 20 good men in the country you were to find that every one of them was a supporter of Fianna Fáil and that 17 out of the 20 had been out fighting against the Treaty in the civil war.  What an extraordinary coincidence that all 20 were supporters of the Government?</P>

      <P>The Minister may enjoy that witticism but no one else will.  It was a little odd that 17 out of the 20 actually fought on that side in the civil war.  I do not think that anyone could accuse me of wishing to keep alive civil war memories or that I resented anybody's character being re-established or that I resented anybody's prosperity being re-established merely because he fought on the losing side in the civil war.  That is not my point of view at all, but I do say that it is not a good way to go about eliminating civil war memories or bitterness when you are creating a force such as this to go and select the entire body of officers to put in charge of it from one particular side in the civil war, and to select the people who have one particular point of view about politics and the Government of this country.  Can it be successfully argued that that is the way to eliminate bitterness? The President says that in every department of Government <Col N="1178" /> policy the thought of eliminating bitterness is always present.  And that the thing that has thwarted him in accomplishing that desirable end is, above all else, the recent change that has taken place in the character of the Opposition.  Is that an honest statement? The President suggests that the Opposition is now committed to support an attempt to establish a dictatorship in this country.  Does the President believe that?</P>

Let us suppose that the President truly believes that some of the speeches of General O'Duffy&mdash;I do not hesitate to use the hated name that the President could not bring himself to allow to pass his lips&mdash;let us assume that he genuinely believes that some of the speeches made by General O'Duffy before the Party merger, were open to the interpretation that he was out for a dictatorship.  Is he nevertheless justified in believing that to-day not only is that General O'Duffy's aim, in spite of all General O'Duffy's declarations to the contrary, but that also he has succeeded in converting to that view everybody on these benches, including persons who have over and over again expressed their emphatic objection to anything in the nature of a dictatorship or Hitlerism in this country?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears to me that a little attention might be paid to the fact that not only General O'Duffy himself has emphatically declared that <Col N="1179" /> he is not in favour of a dictatorship out also that the policy of the Party, which has been published, has a clause to the same effect.  In face of that, to suggest that bitterness has been caused because the Opposition is in favour of a dictatorship seems to me so absurd that it is hardly possible to argue about it.  That there has been increased bitterness since the Party merger I do not deny.  Why has there been increased bitbitterness? It is worth while mentioning in connection with the Army Estimate and the surrounding circumstances. There has been increased bitterness for two reasons.  The first is because the Government and the Fianna Fáil Party feel that a force has come into being which threatens their power and they do not like it.</P>

      <P>The second is, that they have not been ashamed to disinter the Public Safety Act, which they condemned in the terms in which they did condemn it, in order to destroy that political force of which they are afraid.  If the President wishes to eliminate bitterness from politics in this country&mdash;and goodness knows I wish it, too&mdash;the very first step he should take would be to go back on what he has done and withdraw his use of the Public Safety Act. I do not think that a case has anywhere near been made out for the Estimate to which we were asked to agree to-day.  It was only a few days ago that we were called upon to agree to proposals that will cause intense discontent amongst a number of public servants, in the name of economy, in order to secure a total sum of £35,000.  Yet here we are to-day being asked to agree to an annual expenditure of £300,000, which according to everybody except the Minister for Defence is more likely to increase than decrease and which the Minister for Industry and Commerce would be quite content to see raised to £300,000,000 per annum.  Is that a reasonable request or a sensible request?  I am quite satisfied it is not and for that reason I ask the House to refuse its assent to this Estimate.</P>

      <P>There are no Republicans in this Assembly and it is unfortunate that they cannot defend them selves here.  I do not look upon this pink and yellow Party of Radical-Socialists as a Republican Party.  It is rather unfair that this proposal should be brought through the Dáil in the absence of Republicans, seeing that it is obviously an attempt on the part of the Government to bribe a certain number of members of the I.R.A.  That is the object of this Vote.  They have succeeded in corrupting and bribing a certain number of late members of the I.R.A., who have agreed to take the King's shilling and become members of the militia.  I take off my hat to those members of the I.R.A. who have not been bought by this new proposal. The Government, during recent weeks, have gone out of their way to try and attack members of the I.R.A.  We have Deputy Dr. Ward, Deputy Dr. O'Dowd and other members of the Government Party doing their best to undermine in various directions their former colleagues in the Republican movement.  They spread slanders against the I.R.A.  The official organ of the Government Party&mdash;it is the official organ in spite of all the denials which we hear&mdash;ventured to suggest that the murders and other outrages which were being committed in this country were committed at the instigation of the I.R.A.  The official organ ago a very clear statement appeared, which was issued by the I.R.A., repudiating in very clear terms any participation in these murders and outrages. It is common knowledge that these murders and outrages were not committed by the official I.R.A.  They were committed by the scum troops of the Fianna Fáil Party.  That is known throughout the country and yet the Government and its supporters tried to put the blame on the I.R.A. They have succeeded in bribing and corrupting a certain number.  They have not succeeded bringing and corrupting those members of the I.R.A. who are patriotically inclined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy MacDermot referred just now to the fact that this Dáil had recently been asked to agree to heavy cuts in the salaries and wages of public <Col N="1181" /> employees throughout the country and now we are asked to put an additional burden of £300,000 a year on the taxpayers.  The Labour Party is making its contribution, I suppose, to this debate.  It is making a valuable contribution and a noteworthy one.  I suppose that it is satisfied that this money is being better spent in this way than it would be spent in keeping up a decent standard of wages in public employment.  The President made two contradictory statements as to what his defence policy is.  In the first place, he suggested that this was the carrying out of the general defence policy of the Fianna Fáil Party, that is a policy which is founded on a territorial system.  He then went on to suggest that no excuse could be given to any foreigner to say it was unable to defend our shores.  It is obviously absurd to suggest that a Territorial Force such as it is proposed to establish could defend the coasts of this country.  I have pointed out before that the Article of the Treaty which gave the external defence of our coast to Britain has lapsed.  Nothing was done by the last Government, nor has anything been done by the present Government to see that some other form of defence was provided.  I agree with the proposals put forward and the suggestions made at a recent meeting of the real Republican Party, when they urged the claim for a proper defence force for the defence of the coast of the country, urged the establishment of a coastal defence, the inauguration of an Irish navy, and certainly the establishment of a naval or coastal defence force.  It is ridiculous for the Government to come forward and suggest that a Territorial Force, with headquarters in different country towns, is to be a very effective use in defending the shores of this country.  I think it is ridiculous, and it is for that reason that it is clear to anybody who thinks at all about coastal defences that this is no attempt to find the solution.  It is only an attempt to find a solution for something which is very different, that is, the political problem which faces the Party in power in view of the fact that they know they are losing the support of <Col N="1182" /> the Republican element in this country, on which they relied before. This force will be composed possibly of ex-Republicans.  They will be there armed in local centres and it is quite possible that when the time comes&mdash; as it comes to all Governments&mdash;that the people turn against them, that Army will be there to see that they are retained in power against the wishes of the people.</P>

      <P>In this debate I notice that the Fianna Fáil Party have brought their big guns into action.  We have had an endeavour by the President and we have had another endeavour by the Minister for Industry and Commerce to justify the bringing in of this Estimate which is before the House.  I must frankly confess that I have never heard, even from the Government Benches, a lamer defence of policy than I have heard put forward by the President, and put forward by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  That defence of their policy did not ring true.  It had not a note of sincerity in it.  It had not a note of sincerity and it did not ring true because the case which the President and the Minister for Industry and Commerce were putting forward was not a case which they honestly believed in themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are told that this Force is being established for the purpose of defending this State against some hostile invading army.  What hostile invading army?  What State are you arming against?  What State threatens this country with invasion?  Is there one single person on the Fianna Fáil Benches, not alone in the Executive Council, who considers at the present moment that at any future time there will be an invasion of this State by any foreign military power?  I do not believe there is one.  I do not believe there is a single member of the Party who is foolish enough to hold that view.  What is the power that is going to invade this State, and above all things what is the present urgency of this measure?  You are increasing your Army.  Against what?  What is the present menace?  What is the danger that you see before you in the <Col N="1183" /> near future against which you are preparing? That should be the very first thing which the House was told, but we have not been told.  We have not been told, because the President knows, and the Minister for Defence knows, and the Minister for Industry and Commerce knows that there is no danger and no menace to the State by the invasion of a military force. They know it, and they know that there is no necessity at all for the establishment of this militia body. They know that the case which they are putting forward is not a case that the country can believe.  They must know that the country does see what is the real thing which is hanging behind this Estimate.</P>
    <P>We are told by the President that the officers who command this body are not to be drawn from any particular source but from the nation as a whole. That is what this new force is to be recruited from&mdash;not from any particular source but from the nation as a whole.  Have those officers, who have been selected, been selected from any particular source or have they been selected from the nation as a whole? I defy anybody, the Front Government Bench or any bench in the House, to deny what is a plain and obvious fact, that those men have been selected from one particular source.  They are not men who represent the country as a whole.  They have been deliberately chosen from one political source, with the deliberate object in the minds of the promoters of this new Force to make that Force an entirely political one, because they have chosen the officers not on the grounds of efficiency but because of their political beliefs. The Minister for Industry and Commerce said that the men were chosen because they were best qualified in every way.  We wonder if the Minister for Industry and Commerce expects any sane person to accept that statement. What are their qualifications really?  Let us know them.  They are men without any military training. You have got a splendidly efficient Force&mdash;a splendidly efficient Army.  It may be small, but it is magnificiently fitted and magnificiently trained, under <Col N="1184" /> the most splendid discipline.  Is it not from a source like that, from trained men and disciplined officers that you would draw the officers of this new Force if you wished to have an efficient Force?  But what did you do? You go around the country or outside the country and you take in men who have no training in discipline themselves, and have no military training of any real kind behind them, and you select those men to be the officers in command of your Force.  Is that making for efficiency?  Is it making for efficiency, when you could get splendidly trained and qualified men to carry out professional work, that you take unqualified and untrained men to do it?  You can paint yourselves as complete fools, thinking that untrained and unqualified men could do professional work better than trained and qualified men, but you cannot get the country to believe that you are quite the foolish body of men you try to paint yourselves.  Of course they are not picked for efficiency.  If you were looking for efficiency you would go to the regular trained Army, and would take every single one of the officers from that trained Army.  You would take trained men and not untrained men.  What is going to happen? You are going to take in many thousands, you say, of untrained and undisciplined men.  You are going to put them together in various camps, and over that body you are going to have in command men who are also untrained and undisciplined.</P>
    <P>What is this new Force going to be like?  Is it going to have the efficiency even of a militia, or is it going to be a completely undisciplined mob with no control?  Take any body of men, no matter how good they are.  You take them and put them together, a large body of young men.  It is very difficult and it takes a long time to make these men disciplined.  It requires very well trained and very efficient men to make them disciplined.  It is not like taking recruits into an army.  You have a regular disciplined Army; you take in a recruit and he is absorbed by the disciplined Force.  But here you are not absorbing into a disciplined Force <Col N="1185" /> undisciplined men; you are trying to create an entirely new Force out of entirely undisciplined men and you are putting undisciplined men to do it. How do you expect that is going to be a success?  If you want an efficient Force, if you do not want a Force that will be collected together and that will be more a menace to the ordinary lawabiding citizens than anything else, you could not set about it in a better way than this.</P>
    <P>What experience have these officers who are to be put in command?  They are pulled in a couple of months beforehand and they get a little brushing up in training themselves.  I think it was Byron who wrote about a certain lady teacher that</P>
    <P>She in teaching taught so well</P>
    <P>That she herself learned how to spell.</P>
    <P>That seems to be the principle upon which you select your officers for this Force&mdash;that by disciplining other men they will gradually learn how to discipline themselves.  You have regularly trained, disciplined men who are available to do this work, but you brush them aside and say that these other untrained, undisciplined men are better at disciplining others.  It is going to be a very big work, it is going to be a terribly tough business, a heavy, responsible and difficult business.</P>
    <P>The officers in command of this Force will have to make these untrained men disciplined.  If they do not succeed, what will you have?  You will have a collection of undisciplined men being taught to shoot.  Is it wise now to take so many thousands of young men whom your own commonsense will tell you will not be disciplined?  A month's training could not discipline them, even under the best of officers.  They are going to be under untrained officers. Is it a wise thing to collect this body of young men, put arms into their hands and teach them how to shoot? Is that the course of conduct that an Executive Council that really wished to see peace in this country would take?  You know perfectly well it is not.  You do not want peace and you are not looking for an addition to your <Col N="1186" /> Army of regularly trained men.  You are taking a desperate risk; you are running most frightful risks when you take these undisciplined young men, put arms in their hands and teach them to shoot.  That course is particularly risky in this country at the present moment.</P>
    <P>The President said that these men were men who had fought according to their ideas for this country at one period.  These men who have been selected may have fought according to their own ideas, but it is perfectly well known and cannot be denied that they fought against this State.  They fought against the authority of the Oireachtas and now these men are to control a body of men who are, you say, to be entirely obedient to everything that is done by the Oireachtas. Are you not running very grave risks in that?  Again, the President says that these persons who fought with him against the State ten or 12 years ago have now no excuse for standing out. But they are standing out.  Deputy Esmonde said that you have bought off a certain number of men of the I.R.A.  No doubt you have.  There may have been certain men in the I.R.A. who have taken your posts.  That may be so.  I daresay it is so.  But remember that the I.R.A., which is a force that you still allow to remain armed, a force which wishes to upset this State and Constitution by force of arms, have not accepted this new militia.  If you read their paper or the placards they put up or the writings on the street walls you will see they have not accepted this new militia at all.  You are effecting nothing; you are not getting the whole I.R.A.  Even if that were a desirable thing to do, to take in the whole I.R.A. and teach them how to shoot&mdash;which I think would be a shocking thing to do&mdash;that would not be effecting what you profess to be your political aim.  Even in your political aim you have failed and you are taking now the most terrible risks.</P>
    <P>I do not see how the Executive Council can justify to itself this course which obviously, to gain political capital, they are taking. <Col N="1187" /> In order to gain this political capital they are deliberately endangering the structure of the State and almost the existence of civilisation in this State.  I use the word civilisation in the old sense, because I deny the Soviet Republic's term civilisation. You have not put forward and you cannot put forward any reason for the establishment of this Force.  It is being established at a time when obviously every single halfpenny that can be saved should be saved.  You are deliberately wasting, misapplying, putting to a very bad use in my judgment, an enormous sum of money. You may succeed in carrying your proposal through this House&mdash;you have got your majority&mdash;but if this House passes this estimate this House is doing as bad a service to Ireland as it has ever done in passing any measure that ever came before it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to be very brief in my reference to the proposal before us.  This, I think, must be said, that I suppose one of the most remarkable past-masters of propaganda who has ever appeared in this country is President de Valera.  He intervened at an early stage in this debate and he said that one of his principal purposes in intervening was to secure that the debate would not proceed on political lines and would not serve to revive bitter memories of the past.  A bland and saintly smile settled on the faces of all his supporters in the back benches of Fianna Fáil and the President then went on to make as controversial a speech as it was possible for him to make.  I do not propose to follow him in his discussion as to the merits of the civil war.  The only reference that was made to the civil war here to-day was brought into the discussion by President de Valera.  I can only hope that pious speeches will not be made on the hustings deploring that provocative references to the civil war were made from these benches, because it ought to be borne in mind by any honest man sitting on the benches opposite that every reference <Col N="1188" /> made to the civil war here to-day was adduced by the President of the State.  It is greatly to the credit of some of the men who have been engaged in that unhappy struggle that they allowed a good deal of what the President thought fit to say to drop, and passed on to the subject matter of the Estimate before us. The President faced up to the subject matter of the Estimate too, but even then he could not avoid adopting those strange tactics which have become characteristic of him during the last couple of months.  He managed to drag in the cheap fraudulent allegation that the object of the United Ireland organisation was the overthrow of the Government of this country by force of arms and the establishment of a dictatorship.  I sought to compel him to make that charge openly and directly in order that it might be openly and equally directly repudiated but that he would not do.  He referred to some unknown person whom he declined to name.  I knew whom he meant; everybody knew whom he meant.  The President wanted to maintain the position that there would be a kind of feeling of doubt if he told more.  Why had he not the courage to get up and say I charge General O'Duffy with trying to overthrow the Government by force of arms and to establish a dictatorship. He did not do that because he knows it would be false.  But he puts up his unfortunate &ldquo;goms&rdquo; all over the country to make and to whisper that charge.  When he gets up here he will not make the charge specifically himself because he knows the answer he would get, but he makes it in a backhanded way.  To my mind, that is inconsistent with honourable conduct in public life.  If you want to make a charge against a man make it and let him answer it or plead guilty, but do not try to stab a man in the dark.  Now let anyone get up and say he believes that General O'Duffy wants to set up a dictatorship and to overthrow the Government by force of arms and we will tell him he is wrong.</P>

      <P>The Deputy need not believe me if he does not like.  He need not believe me, but at the same time he gives me the opportunity of repudiating it; but the President gets up and makes the charge.  It must be apparent to any man in this House, and in the country, that the President has sources of information that the ordinary citizen has not and that the ordinary Deputy has not, but he is careful, knowing that he has this source of information, not to make a specific charge.  He hints something. If he knows that General O'Duffy or any other man in this country is pledged to overthrow the Government by force of arms then President de Valera is a traitor if he does not apprehend that man and try that man and convict that man.  A man who is afraid to do his duty by the State, who is affraid to defend it, but who is not afraid to come in with hints and innuendoes and suggestions is a man, I confess, entirely different from what I imagined President de Valera to be.  Now let us dispose of this dictatorship once and for all.  That charge is false and that charge is made for one reason: Because Fianna Fáil knows it is losing ground in the country and knows that the League of Youth is one of the most powerful instruments of constitutional political action against Fianna Fáil.  The Government has searched the records of the League of Youth; it has searched the houses of the League of Youth; it has read it rules and its correspondence, but it has never been able to prove one single breach of the law against the League of Youth.  Every raid and search made on the League of Youth makes it more manifest what we told the Government from the beginning, that the League of Youth stands for the maintenance of law and order and for the right of the Irish people to choose who are to be the governors of this country.  It is because the Government cannot blacken their character or find anything that will injure their reputation in the eyes of the Irish people that they start their cheap fraudulent charges which they dare not make directly, but which they make in a backhand way in the <Col N="1190" /> hope that they will not find people to contradict them.  Their charges are contradicted, and if any man thinks he can prove them then the proper place to prove them is in a court of law.  The Government has made certain efforts to blacken their name in a court of law already, but they have not pulled it off yet.  They are making a couple of more efforts, but they have not pulled it off yet.</P>
      <P>We were told at the conclusion of a very eloquent oration from the Minister for Industry and Commerce that this Army is not going to be an appendage of one Party or another.  I do not know if Mr. Lambert has yet received his commission, whether he is a commissioned officer of the Army as yet or not.  If he is, he is entitled to the title of Captain Lambert.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If he was he would be entitled to the title of captain.  I only hope that this commissioned officer of the National Army and who is now a captain designate would manage to so deport himself in public as a man who is virtually a member of the National Army.  At a meeting of friends who came to welcome him home from the Antipodes the <i>Irish Press</i> reports the captain designate, in regard to the return of the Fianna Fáil Party, as expressing the hope that from this forward they would give the Government every support.  That was published in the <i>Irish Press</i> last Saturday.  I have no complaint whatever that Mr. Lambert should have his views on Irish politics.  He is quite entitled to have them and he is none the worse man for holding this position. But what I do complain of is this: That if this Army, which it is proposed to create, is to be genuinely what the Minister for Defence and the President pretends it is going to be, then, obviously, any captain designate of the Army should not say these things.</P>

It is manifestly improper for him or any designate officer to take up a controversial position in the politics of the country.  It is something greatly to the credit of our National Army that it can be truly said of them that they are absolutely above politics and are resolved to serve the elected Government of the Irish people, no matter what that Government may be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it would be better to leave General O'Duffy out of the discussion.  If the Deputy wants to make a speech on General O'Duffy he is quite free to do so.  I entirely agree with the position taken up by Deputy Anthony and that is: can we afford it or who wants it?  The only trouble in this country is that we have had too many armies in the past.  I have heard it preached from Fianna Fáil platforms again and again that their object was to do away with armies&mdash;that we did not want any army.  Now, we are not only to have the existing National Army but an additional 15,000 men. We all know, and there is no use closing our eyes to the fact, that the object for which this Army was designed was to provide a kind of haven of refuge into which all the I.R.A. would march like lambs.  The I.R.A. have made it perfectly clear that they have not the slightest intention of marching in like lambs.  Those who get a good job out of it are prepared to consider the position, but those who are going to be marched in as common privates say, &ldquo;Not on your life.&rdquo;  We are <Col N="1192" /> going to have our Army and spend £300,000 a year, and we are going to weep over the triumph of the Minister for Industry and Commerce who sees the men who were parted in the past coming together again.  At the back of our minds and the Minister's minds and the President's mind the whole object was to get the I.R.A. to come into this organisation and to come under the control of the Government, and the I.R.A. have not the slightest intention of doing one thing or the other.  In that determination not to do one thing or the other, they are ably vindicated by several members of the Fianna Fáil Party at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the use of maintaining the fraud that these officers were not chosen for political reasons?  Everybody knows that they were.  If the plan was going to succeed there would be some excuse for doing that, but everyone knows that it is not.  The I.R.A. come out week after week and denounce the Minister for Defence as the greatest blackguard and cut-throat that ever appeared in the country. They say that he is trying to sabotage the Republic; that he is trampling on his high principles.  Deputy Hales and Deputy Flynn are going around the country trying to save his face; explaining that poor Frank Aiken is not as bad as he is painted; that <i>An Phoblacht</i> is very hard on him, and that really he is not a bad fellow. The whole thing is falling down like a house of cards.  Nevertheless, we are to spend £300,000 a year&mdash;10 times as much as we took off the local officials' salaries last week.  Is there head or tail to such a performance?  To cap the climax, when we look at the thing closely we discover that in every parish, in every barony, there is to be set up a rifle range and the young people of the country are to be brought in for a month every year and taught to be gunmen and then let loose on the country.  Is that commonsense?  Why should we want to teach every young fellow in this country how to use a gun?  To a lot of them it may do no harm, but in a great many cases you are sowing in that unfortunate youth the seed of demoralisation.  The next <Col N="1193" /> performance is that you will have him turning into a gangster.  Some unscrupulous person will make a gun available to him.  He will know how to use it and having been taught how to use it he may have the ordinary youthful ambition to have a gun of his own.</P>
    <P>Everybody knows how undesirable it is to have arms in the hands of the majority of the young people all over the place.  It is very hard to keep an eye on them, to keep them under reasonable discipline; anything may happen to them.  What is it all for? To consolidate the defence of the country? In the name of Providence, against what are we going to consolidate the defence of the country?  As the President aptly said, if any big Power makes up its mind to invade us with its full forces we cannot stop it, and the fact that we have 15,000 lads up and down the country who have undergone a month's training once a year is not going to stop it.  So that no matter from what angle you look at the proposal there is absolutely no justification for it.  It is going to cost £300,000 a year as a minimum&mdash;it will probably cost more&mdash;and it is going to put arms into the hands of every decent young fellow in the country and teach him to become a gunman.  Surely it is the acme of futility.  Surely it can do nothing to achieve the purpose that the Minister for Industry and Commerce spoke of.  He spoke of reconcilation.  Surely this can do nothing to that end.  If it was worth while, if it would contribute anything to that end, I believe there would be hearty co-operation from every part of the House in order to arrive at that purpose, but it will not.  On the contrary, it is going to stir up and down through the country the kind of recrimination and bitterness that, to the regret of all of us in this House, sometimes bursts out on those benches. Every Deputy knows that there are parts of the country in which that civil war bitterness has largely passed away. Every Deputy deplores that from time to time, despite our best intentions, we do lose our tempers here and some of that bitterness does flare up&mdash;not as <Col N="1194" /> often, I am happy to think, as it used to do.</P>

      <P>Where is the use of discussing the whys and the wherefores? These are the facts.  The danger is that this move in the country will result in splitting the people into the old miserable lines of division.  You create on one side a semi-armed camp and on the other side a bitterly resentful unarmed body.  What is it all for? What is the money being spent for? What do we hope to get out of it? Why cannot we face it rationally, patiently and sensibly, and abandon the whole scheme and concentrate attention on the Army we have got? It is a good Army; it is admittedly an efficient Army, it is an Army loyal to the State; it is an Army with a fine <i>esprit de corps,</i> with a fine spirit; an Army that would do any young man who wants a military career good to join.  Why must we start another?  If these 20 men are really in good faith, really want to bury the hatchet and show readiness to serve the State, they will be made welcome at the Curragh.  I am certain that the officers of the Army will welcome these men as regular officers, take them into the body of the Army and show by their attitude that they feel nothing of the past differences that divided them.  That purpose can be easily served without resort to this Army. Unless this House desires to commit itself to a deplorably mistaken policy, it will turn its back on this Estimate and resolve that any military developments that may be required will have their foundation on our existing Army, and that it will not vote £300,000 per annum to finance an Army the reason for which is unknown and unknowable to the whole country.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon promised to be brief.  Like all promises made by his Party, no sooner are they made than they are broken.  I want to assure Deputy Dillon and the other members of his Party that men like my comrades and myself resent the fact of our being called gunmen.  A gunman, sir, is a murderer.  We are more <Col N="1195" /> used to being shot at than to shoot. It has been unfortunate for us that we have had to use guns and kill people. We never used guns against anybody who was not using them against us. For that reason we resent being called gunmen and we resent these men being called gunmen.  Deputy Dillon and others like him who never handled a gun in defence of this country should keep their mouths shut when men and soldiers talk.</P>
      <P>Deputy MacDermot told us a while ago that he did not understand the mentality of the Fianna Fáil Party.  Of course he does not, nor does he understand the mentality of the United Ireland Party either.  He does not understand the mentality of this Irish nation.  His education and traditions are altogether different from ours.  I want to assure Deputy Dillon that there is no bitterness in our minds, no bitterness at all.  We want to get rid of all the bitterness in this country. We do not want by one word to add to that bitterness, but if Deputy Dillon asks do we believe that his Party aim at a dictatorship I will say for one I did believe it absolutely and could not believe anything else from the statements made by General O'Duffy.  I do not believe it now because I know damned well he will not get away with it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon tells us the reason why this new Army is being started is because the country has gone from us. That is not true.  We are stronger than ever before.  We do know that your people and your leaders would have started a dictatorship if you could get away with it, but you could not.  I will take Deputy Dillon back a few years. Deputy Dillon, I am sure, dislikes bitterness and cruelty just as much as I do.  I will give him credit for that. Some years ago in Waterford a number for men were very cruelly beaten.  I know that, to the honour of the late Kevin O'Higgins, the matter was investigated and the officer who carried out the investigation reported that these beatings were carried out by official orders.  Kevin O'Higgins, like the man he was, immediately suspended the man who gave the order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1196" /> General O'Duffy threatened to resign. Kevin O'Higgins again, like the man he was, told him to do it.  General O'Duffy went back to his headquarters and gathered around him all the senior officers of the Gárda and got them to sign a statement offering their resignations to Kevin O'Higgins unless the suspensions of the men found guilty were removed.  Kevin O'Higgins accepted those resignations on Friday evening and on Sunday morning he was dead.  I hang that up for the people to look at.  The men who wanted to coerce Kevin O'Higgins in 1927 were dictators and they wanted to get away with it.  I welcome the organisation of this new Army as the best means of promoting good-fellowship amongst good Irishmen.</P>

I can assure Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney that they are men of a lot better discipline than the kicking cow. These men had very definite responsibility in 1920-21 and they never failed in these responsibilities.  They will not fail now.  Again I want to resent the statement of Deputy Dillon in calling me and my comrades gunmen.</P>

      <P>Everybody in this House and outside it who notes the present trend of the statesmen of the world in their efforts to bring about a peace atmosphere and in trying to curtail armaments are aware that the chancelleries of the world are meeting and trying to do everything possible in the hope of bringing about the limitation of armaments.  In these circumstances it is rather remarkable that we in this small State should embark upon getting together a new force of 15,000 men.  If this £300,000 were to be allotted with a view to getting the youth of Ireland into some form of organisation where guns would be discarded and where physical training and the developing of the athletic <Col N="1197" /> powers of our young people were to be the main programme it would be something at which we would be pleased.  If the young people could be brought together in that way even for a month at a time and if we set about training to develop their museles and their athletic abilities with a view to the development of their physical fitness and the establishment of fine moral courage so sadly lacking at the present moment, I would say the money would be well spent and would bring a great return.</P>
      <P>But unfortunately it is on an organisation which is to be called an Army that we are now to spend this large amount of money despite reductions in salaries, despite wage cutting and despite all the sacrifices of the people in the present hard times.  We are now starting out to have shooting galleries and to train the youth of the country in the use of the rifle and revolver.  This is not the time for this sort of institution when we are doing our best to denounce armaments.  To my mind there is too much soldiering and too much of an appeal to the militaristic spirit.  There is too much of that sort of thing that says once you are a soldier you are better than the civilian member of society. There is too much about this marching forward and this talk about conquering the world.  We have too much of this thing telling the youth that as long as the Army is marching and as long as they can drill and march that they are great Irishmen. It is time that we took the other course and denounced all this soldiering idea in the minds of our young countrymen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When this Government took over the machinery of this State from its predecessors, one of the things which all of us admired, whether on this or that side of the House, was the splendid loyalty and the splendid neutrality of the young Army that had been set up by the previous Government.  Despite the scares that we read of in the <i>Irish Press,</i> about some <i>coup d'etat,</i> some sort of seizure on which the Minister for Local Government and Public Health got very busy and active, despite all these cruel rumours that <Col N="1198" /> went round, the transfer took place quietly and smoothly.  Our Regular Army gave a lead to us all as to how our duty to the State should be performed. Now we find rumours speeding round that this Regular Army is to be slowly but by degrees absorbed; that it is to be unfortunately absorbed by those who had been its political opponents or its opponents in the field in the past, and that by degrees the Army will become a purely political Army and nothing else.  I am glad to learn, as I was not in the House myself, that a statement has been made that this Army is to be independent of any political Party.  Unfortunately it would seem that a bad start had been made.  I am glad to hear it is not true.  At the same time it seems to be that the old Regular Army will by degrees, man by man, section by section, company by company, ultimately be absorbed and that their places will be taken by this new Army. I hope that that will not take place. It will be mighty hard to stop it. Everybody knows what it is when claims are raised by certain followers: &ldquo;We want this and we want that; we must have this and we must have that.&rdquo;  It will require all the energy and determination of the Executive Council to stand against it.  I sincerely hope that even yet, in spite of all the pronouncements made, that there is no foundation for the rumours that have gone round that certain men in the Regular Army, almost over 1,000, will lose their chance of promotion by reason of these new 15,000 Volunteers.</P>

      <P>One of Deputy Minch's pronouncements here was that we had too many trained men in the country already and that it was scandalous to start another Army at a cost of £300,000 per annum, that we did not want any more armed and disciplined men in the country.  I want to tell Captain Minch and those who think like him that it was time we had trained and disciplined men in this country.  I want to tell him that when he and his ilk came to this country and said: &ldquo;You will have to go out and fight where we are; you will have to go out and die in France&rdquo;&mdash;the trained and disciplined men said: &ldquo;We will not,&rdquo; and it was the trained and disciplined men who prevented them from taking us out and told him that he could go out and fight if he wanted to but that he would not get us.  Now if we have trained and disciplined men, as a result of this measure, it will be the proudest moment of my life even though they will be a thorn in his side as they were before.</P>

      <P>I am answering the Deputy through you, sir.  I repeat again that the only purpose I had in standing up was to answer Deputy Minch.  I repeat again that the proudest moment in our lives will be when this country has a trained and disciplined body of men, open to every man, no matter what his political views may be&mdash;a body of men who will be able to oppose any persons who may attempt to filch our rights from us.  I should like also to answer Deputy Dillon.  In one of his statements he tried to convey to the House that this political discussion resulted from pronouncements made by President de Valera.  That is not a true statement to make.  What really occurred was that the first speaker on the opposite benches who stood up to criticise the Vote introduced by the Minister for Defence, made a pronouncement to the effect that the 20 men who are now commissioned were men who fought for months against the Constitution of this State.  That needed explanation and the President stood up to make that explanation. Naturally he had to go back on history to make clear the position of these men and to show that they were not Irregulars, as they were described by the opposite Party, but that they were the Regular Army who had been true to the oath of allegiance which they had taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose that, like Deputy Minch, I am one of that ordinary type of Irishman who is not supposed to interfere in discussions such as this, for the simple reason, to use the words of some of the Fianna Fáil Deputies, that I never took a gun in my hand and never did anything for Ireland.  In my early days I was always taught that it took as good, if not a better, man to live for Ireland as to die for Ireland.  Acting on that advice, I intend to continue that policy of living for Ireland and not dying for it.  Conscious of the position as it exists at the moment and also conscious of the feelings of the people of this State, I am convinced that there is absolutely no necessity for the establishment of a Volunteer <Col N="1201" /> Force in this State.  We have a Regular Army, of which we are all proud.  We have one of the finest and most efficient forces in the Gárda Síochána to be found in any part of the world.  We have what is more than that.  We have our people in the main inclined to obey the law and to carry out faithfully any orders given by the duly-appointed Government of the day.  I want to emphasise that fact, in view of certain statements that have come from the Government Benches, which would give one the impression that all over the country there is a sort of serious opposition to the Government as regards the administration of the law.  I want to assure members of the Executive and members of the Fianna Fáil Party in general that in so far as I am personally concerned, and that very considerable section of the people in the County Louth, whom I represent at the moment, they are most charitably disposed towards the Government and threw in their weight in many instances to help the industrial policy of the present Government.  I do not, therefore, think there is much necessity for the suspicion that seems to run through some of the speeches delivered by the members opposite.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My opposition to the establishment of this Force is that, not for this year but in the future years, it will mean the spending of a very considerable sum of money which in my opinion could be put to much better use than in the establishment of this Force.  As the Minister for Defence has already stated, the cost during the present financial year will be somewhere in the region of £62,000 to £64,000, making allowance for some stocks he has in hand in the form of clothing which will very considerably reduce the sum for this financial year.  In the years to come it is proposed to spend a sum amounting to almost £300,000.  I was figuring out in my mind, while the Minister was making that statement, and I found that that sum would provide work for about 6,000 men at £2 a week year in and year out.  Those 6,000 men could be employed in very useful work, such as afforestation, the cleaning of drains, the repair of roads <Col N="1202" /> and so forth&mdash;something akin to the very useful works that are already in progress under the administration of the Commissioners of Public Works. I would appeal to the Minister and to the members of the Fianna Fáil Party to consider seriously whether the money which they propose to spend in the setting up of this Volunteer Force could not be more usefully employed in the manner which I have indicated.</P>
    <P>Again, I object to the setting up of this Volunteer Force because I believe it will create a very big difference of opinion throughout the country and we want, if at all possible, to decrease rather than increase those differences. References have been made to some of the speeches delivered by Deputies on this side of the House&mdash;that they are made for political purposes; that they are also made to sabotage the Government, so to speak, and to pour ridicule on every proposition that the Government brings forward.  Of course Fianna Fáil Deputies know that I, as a member of that Party&mdash;I have not been very long a member; I was an Independent member for seven years&mdash; when statements are made about the Party of which I am a member, consider that those statements are made against me as well, and I want to tell members of Fianna Fáil that as far as I am personally concerned we are not out to impede the Government in any way.  We are out to claim the right to criticise any legislative proposals which the Government introduces here in this House, and which we, after giving due consideration to the subject matter contained in them, think will not be to the best interests of the people of this State.  There is no use in issuing threats against members of the Opposition, or saying that we are playing England's game, and are not people of national minds.  That will not advance your cause very much, because as I have stated the reverse is the truth.  We are doing all we possibly can to assist the Government, but in the setting up of this Volunteer Force I would point out to the Minister for Defence in all seriousness, and to the members of the Fianna Fáil Party, that they are not going to accomplish what they desire as far as the future <Col N="1203" /> of this country is concerned by the setting up of this Force.  We have enough armies in this country.  We have a standing Army and I think that should be sufficient.</P>
    <P>I am sure the members of the Government realise that at the present time there does exist in this country an organisation which is very much opposed to the Government, and which will not have anything to do with this new Volunteer Force in any shape or form.  I think the Government, and the Minister for Defence especially, in conjunction with the President, who always likes to tell the House about the very large amount of moral courage of which he is possessed, will be displaying a little more moral courage if they will face this force openly and above board, and not attempt by subterfuge, or by such means as the introduction of this Bill and the setting up of this force, to get those people away from the ranks of that organisation.  I think they would be displaying a little more courage by administering the law impartially, and relying on the forces which they have at their disposal, in the persons of the Army and the Gárda Síochána, to restore law and order in this country.  I am opposed to the Bill for those reasons, especially as I am of the opinion that the money could be more usefully spent in the manner in which I have indicated than in the setting up of this force, which, in the opinion of many people better fitted to judge than I am, will lead to even more trouble and confusion in the future than has existed in this country in the past.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>A Chinn Comhairle, Deputy Cosgrave said that the establishment of those Volunteers was a complete departure from the principles of the Defence Forces Act.  Now the fact of the matter is that there was a Volunteer Force started about four years ago under the Defence Forces Act.  It had to be done by enlisting recruits in the Regular Army for one day, and then transferring them to the Reserve.  Until the Bill which is at present in draft is introduced and passed here&mdash;the new Defence Forces <Col N="1204" /> Act&mdash;we will have to follow a similar procedure, that is men volunteering for service will have to be recruited into the Regular Army for one day, and then transferred to the Volunteers. There is a regulation here in Deputy Fitzgerald's own time which brought into being a Volunteer Force in a somewhat similar way.  Deputy Dillon said that this Volunteer Force had already fallen down like a house of cards. Deputy Dillon is a very mournful sort of person. The worst is always going to happen to-morrow and if not to-morrow the day after or if not the day after, next year.  I have not the slightest hesitation in saying that I believe the Volunteer Force is going to recruit into its ranks every young man of proper national character who is prepared to fight for his country.  I can understand why Deputy Dillon does not realise that.</P>

I think that all the major points that were raised have already been answered by the President and the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the other speakers who spoke from the Fianna Fáil Benches.  We are not out to teach the young people of this country to be gunmen, as Deputy Dillon said.  We are out to teach the youth of this country to be disciplined Irishmen, disciplined soldiers, on whom the country <Col N="1205" /> can rely and on whom the representatives elected by the people of this country can rely to put into effect their policy, no matter whether it suits England or any other country or not.  We have, after a long period, reached a situation when the people can vote for any policy they like in this House and it must be accepted as legally binding on all Parties, but something that is legally binding is not binding militarily, and we want the laws and the declarations which the people's representatives make respected by everybody and we are going to ask the young people of the country to come forward and insist that they be respected by everybody.</P>

      <P>The only thing I will say is that that is no new policy.  It is the policy that was outlined in the &ldquo;Cease Fire&rdquo; proposals which the President alluded to here to-night and which were made in 1923 and unfortunately turned down.  However, we are in a position to put into effect the Governmental side of these &ldquo;Cease Fire&rdquo; proposals and we believe that the young men of the country will make operative the other sections of them, and that the decent young men of the country will come forward and support the Government and maintain here a disciplined army that will ensure that the will of the people in this country is made effective against foreign majorities as well as native minorities.</P>
      <P>I do not know where the figure £300,000 came in.  I did not mention it.  I pointed out quite clearly that this year the cost was going to be a net cost of £28,771 and that next year we estimated that the cost would be £243,736, of which £50,000 would be borne on the Vote for Public Works in respect of the building of halls.  We estimated that the net cost this year will be £28,000 roughly and that next year it will be £243,000.</P>

      <P>In the course of the last debate a statement was made that certain proceedings were taken against members of the Guards with reference to an occurrence in the County Waterford; that there was a meeting of officers of the Guards, and that about a week afterwards Kevin O'Higgins was murdered.  There is a clear innuendo in that statement.  I wish emphatically to state that the Waterford affair had been finished many months and that disciplinary measures had been taken many months before Kevin O'Higgins was murdered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. O'Kelly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the Second Reading of this Bill.  The purpose of the Bill is to extend the period within which a new building must be begun or completed in order to obtain a partial suspension of an increase in valuation under the Local Government Act, 1927.  Remissions of rates on new buildings are designed to promote employment by encouraging <Col N="1212" /> building enterprise.  The Local Government Act, 1927, enabled a reduction of two-thirds to be made in any increased valuation for a period of five years from the date of the increase or for the period from such date up to that in which a general revision of valuation became effective in an area, whichever was the shorter. The period fixed within which the new work should have been completed to enable such benefit to be secured ended on 1st October, 1930.  By an amending Act of 1930, this date was advanced to 1st October, 1933, and, in view of the representations which have been received, it is now proposed to extend the date to 1st October, 1938. These remissions do not apply to houses erected under the Housing Acts or the Housing (Gaeltacht) Act, 1929, which are otherwise provided for, nor do they apply to cottages erected under the Labourers Acts.  The Bill contains no new principle; it merely continues the existing practice for five years longer.</P>

In the Act of 1927 the phrase &ldquo;new buildings&rdquo; has a very restricted meaning referring to buildings completed some years before the passing of that Act and, as there may be some misunderstanding or misconception in connection with the matter, I would ask the Minister, if he is not able to say what is the effect at the moment, to look into the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Dr. Ward)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill is intended to give effect to a recommendation made by the Commission on the Relief of the Sick and Destitute Poor including the Insane Poor.  It will be remembered that in paragraphs 266, 267 and 268 of their Report of August, 1927, the Commission wrote:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;266.  It would seem from the evidence given before us that in the City of Dublin there are a number of poor class maternity homes from which children are placed out to nurse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;We are of opinion that all private maternity homes should be licensed annually by the local authority and that no licence be granted unless the home is properly and suitably <Col N="1214" /> equipped for the purpose, and that it was in charge of a respectable person trained in maternity care and nursing.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;267.  From the Registrar-General's Report for 1924, it appears that one in every three illegitimate children born alive in 1924 died within one year of its birth, and that the mortality amongst these children is about five times as great as in other cases.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;268.  It is high for many reasons, but there is one to which we wish specially to refer.  The illegitimate child being proof of the mother's shame is, in most cases, sought to be hidden at all costs.  What frequently happens is that the mother, or the mother's family, at the time the mother leaves the hospital or home, make arrangements with someone to take the child, either paying a lump sum down or undertaking to pay something from time to time.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;These arrangements are often made or connived at by those who carry on the poorer class of mater nity homes, and the results to the child can be read in the mortality rates.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If a lump sum is paid or if the periodical payment lapse, the child becomes an encumbrance on the foster mother, who has no interest in keeping it alive.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>At present there is no means of obtaining information as to the where abouts of the homes referred to by the Commission.  Neither is there any power of inspecting them except that provided for the purposes of the Midwives (Ireland) Act, 1918, by Section 17 thereof.  This section relates chiefly to the supervision of midwives.  It is quite insufficient to insure the suitable and efficient management of the maternity home.</P>
    <P>The aim of the present Bill is to bring all such homes under proper control and to provide machinery to insure that the patients who enter them will get skilled treatment, and that the interests of the infants will be protected.</P>
    <P>It will be noted that &ldquo;maternity <Col N="1215" /> home&rdquo; is defined as any premises which are, either wholly or partly, used or intended to be used for the reception of pregnant women or of women immediately after childbirth. Any hospital or premises maintained or controlled by a Department of the State or by any local authority or by a body constituted by Special Act or by Charter will be excluded from the provisions of the Act.</P>
    <P>The local authority for the purposes of the Act will be that entrusted with the supervision of the Midwives (Ireland) Act, 1918, that is the board of health in joint county districts, and the county borough councils in county boroughs.</P>
    <P>The local authority will be required to keep a register of the maternity homes in their administrative area. The register will show in relation to each home the name and address of the person carrying it on and also such particulars of the premises as may be prescribed by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The local authority will have power to refuse to register a home if</P>
    <P>(a)  the applicant is not a fit and proper person to carry on a maternity home, or</P>
    <P>(b)  the premises in which it is proposed to carry on the home are unsuitable for the purpose, or</P>
    <P>(c)  in the case of a home which was not in existence before the passing of the Act, the superintendent nurse is not a qualified nurse or a certified midwife.</P>
    <P>The local authority will also have power to cancel registration if satisfied</P>
    <P>(a)  that the person registered is no longer a fit and proper person to carry on a maternity home, or</P>
    <P>(b)  the person registered has been convicted of an offence under the Act.</P>
    <P>They may also cancel registration in regard to any particular premises if satisfied</P>
    <P>(a) that the premises are no longer suitable for use as a maternity home, or</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1216" /> (b)  that an individual who is neither a qualified nurse nor a certified midwife has been appointed after the passing of the Act to be superintendent nurse.</P>
    <P>Provision is to be made for an appeal to the Minister against the refusal of the local authority to register a maternity home and also against the cancellation of registration by a local authority.  The Minister will have power either to uphold the decision of the local authority or reverse it as he thinks proper.</P>
    <P>When the local authority has registered a home they must issue a certificate of registration to the person carrying on the home, and such person must keep the certificate of registration exhibited in a conspicuous place in the home.  It is felt that this is the most convenient way of giving assurance to the patients seeking admission.</P>
    <P>The Minister is to be given power to exempt from registration any hospital or institution which is a maternity home but is not carried on for private profit.</P>
    <P>A very high penalty may be imposed for carrying on a maternity home which is not registered, namely a fine not exceeding £50, and in case of a continuing offence a fine not exceeding £10 for every day during which the offence is continued.</P>
    <P>Detailed provision is to be made for the records to be kept in registered homes.  The records will cover receptions into the home, and discharges therefrom, confinements, miscarriages, births and deaths occurring in the home.  The records will give the local authority full information as to the work carried on in the home.  An important record for protection of the infants will be that showing the name of the person by whom an infant is removed from the home and the address to which it is removed.  This record should enable the local authority to keep a check on the disposal of children referred to by the Poor Law Commission.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for the inspection of any maternity home within the functional area of a local authority, and also of the records kept in a registered <Col N="1217" /> maternity home by an authorised officer of the local authority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SydneyBMinch" hpid="Mr. Minch Mr. Minch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Minch</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to know from the Parliamentary Secretary if there is a great increase in illegitimacy, and if it is by reason of that that this regulation is made the more urgent. If that is so, it is about time there was some general publicity and that no attempt should be made to hide the facts.  I do not know, but it seems from what I hear that this is becoming a tremendous social problem.  I welcome the suggestions of the Parliamentary Secretary that every effort should be made to protect these infants.  At the same time there must be some reason for this Bill, outside the ordinary cases that, unfortunately, occur.  Is there a very great increase in illegitimacy?  If so, is the Parliamentary Secretary prepared to face the country and to make the facts public so that the public conscience will be awakened, and that this question will be looked upon, as it was many years ago, as a crime, instead of being hidden and passed over?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Minch must not have been listening very carefully to the first part of my statement.  The necessity for this Bill is not due to any known increase in illegitimacy.  The Bill has become necessary because of the high death rate amongst illegitimate children.  Attention was drawn to the abnormally high death rate amongst these children by the Poor Law Commission, in paragraph 267 of their Report.  This is the quotation:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;From the Registrar-General's report for 1924 it appears that one in every three illegitimate children born alive in 1924 died within one year of its birth, and that the mortality amongst these children is about five times as great as in other cases.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is because of the high death rate amongst illegitimate children that we want to establish some more effective control over the numerous maternity homes now operating.  As Deputies are probably aware, these institutions take it upon themselves to dispose of and to board out these children.  From the <Col N="1218" /> abnormally high death rate amongst this class of children one must come to the conclusion that they are not looked after with the same care and attention as that given to ordinary children.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexHaslett" hpid="Mr. Haslett Mr. Haslett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haslett</NameTxt>
      <P>From the statement of the Parliamentary Secretary it would appear that there is not only need for registration of maternity homes but also for after-care.  Do I understand that the local authorities will follow these children to their homes?  If so, I think that would be just as necessary as looking after the maternity homes.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is designed to increase the amount provided by the Electricity Supply (Amendment) Act, 1931, by £1,160,000.  The main purposes for which this additional capital is required by the Board are associated with its ordinary working.  At this stage I should say that another Bill will have to be introduced in the present session of the Dáil to provide capital for the Electricity Supply Board to undertake certain operations outside its ordinary workings and particularly to provide for additional storage on the Shannon.  I mention that fact now because, otherwise, some misunderstanding as to the future policy of the Board may arise from a mere statement of the purposes for which the money provided in this Bill is required.  The intention <Col N="1219" /> originally was to introduce one Bill providing both for the ordinary capital required by the Electricity Supply Board, and the money required for storage and other purposes, but, as the drafting of the Bill dealing with storage is likely to be a task of considerable difficulty, and may take some time, it was decided to proceed with the present measure.</P>
      <P>Under Section 12 (2) of the Electricity Act, 1927, a sum of £156,000 was advanced to the Electricity Supply Board.  Authority for the expenditure of the whole of that sum was asked for and received.  Under Section 12 (3) of the same Act a sum of £2,500,000 was provided, of which £1,904,000, to the nearest thousand, was expended.  The Act of 1931 provided and additional £2,000,000, of which £1,809,000 was the sum for the expenditure of which authority had been sought to the end of January, 1934.  The Electricity Supply Act of 1932 authorised an additional expenditure of £365,000, of which £315,000 had been authorised to be expended up to January of this year.  The total amount provided by all these Acts was £5,021,000, from which is to be deducted the sum of £756,118 in consequence of the restrictions under Section 39 (6) of the 1927 Act, leaving the net figure of £4,264,882, out of which authority had been given for an expenditure to the end of January, 1934, of £4,182,893.  The balance therefore available to the E. S. Board to the end of January of this year was £81,989.  The E. S. Board estimate their capital requirements for the three years 1933-34, 1934-35 and 1935-36 at £1,436,600.  The balance from the amounts made available under previous Acts available at the 1st April, 1933, was £276,100.  The net amount required, therefore, to finance capital works in the three years is £1,160,500.  The sum of £1,160,000 is being provided in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main objects for which the additional capital is required all arise out of the ordinary working and growth of the undertaking. Deputies may recollect that in the <Col N="1220" /> year 1931, when the Electricity Supply Act was introduced by Deputy McGilligan, there was a somewhat acrimonious debate in the course of which Deputy McGilligan said he contemplated a time coming when Acts to provide additional capital for the E. S. Board would be regarded as merely routine measures in somewhat the same light as Acts to provide capital for the telephone system are at present regarded.  This measure might properly be described as a measure of that kind.  The sum which it provides is designed to finance the ordinary development of the electricity supply scheme for the three years from 1st April, 1933 to 31st March, 1936.</P>
    <P>I will give Deputies the main items under which the expenditure will arise, but, first of all, I should stress that there is nothing abnormal in the expenditure.  The first item is a sum of £50,000 required this year, to which is to be added £28,000 required next year for the deepening of the River Shannon at Killaloe.  The board have been advised that it is necessary to carry out this work.  The carrying out of the work was contemplated when the scheme was initiated, but it did not become necessary until the partial development stage had been passed.  As Deputies are aware, the fourth turbine has been installed at Ardnacrusha.  The initial stage is now definitely passed and it is necessary that this work should be carried out.  As a result of the expenditure the available output of the station will be somewhat improved through the possibility of a greater utilisation of storage in Lough Derg and through the increased head of water obtainable. The expenditure under this head will not involve any consequential revenue expenditure.  There is a sum of £1,500 required this year for various minor improvements at Ardnacrusha. The greater part of that money will be expended on improving the reliability of the cooling system.</P>
    <P>A large item of expenditure involving £64,400 in the present year and £5,000 next year arises under the head of various improvements in the Pigeon House.  In the first place, it <Col N="1221" /> is necessary to provide for the installation of additional pumping stations and the provision of a circulating water supply.  The present circulating water supply from the Pigeon House harbour will be inadequate for the increasing capacity of the station and insufficient to ensure the reliability of the supply. It is also necessary to engage upon extensive dredging operations at the Pigeon House harbour and for an extension of the wharf to make provision for coal boats larger than can be handled there at the present time. The present facilities permit only of boats carrying 500 tons to be used and, as the limitation thus imposed restricts the amount of coal that can be imported per week, the extension of the wharf and the dredging of the harbour become necessary.  All this is necessary in consequence of the increased capacity of the station.  For a similar reason it is necessary to make provision for additional coal storage and coal handling equipment.</P>
    <P>There are various items of expenditure necessary upon the transmission system arising entirely out of increases in the load.  Extensions to transformer stations will require expenditure. Also there are substantial items of expenditure contemplated in each of the three years upon the distribution system.  The expenditure under these heads involves the realisation of substantial additional revenue to the Board.  That work arises out of the ordinary development of the system. It is undertaken when it is shown that the capital will be remunerative having regard to the estimated extent to which the extended system will be utilised.  There are smaller items, £3,100 in 1933-34, £4,500 in the following year and £4,700 in 1935-36, capital expenditure arising out of the change over of consumers' apparatus and heaters to the alternating current system.  An estimated capital expenditure of £80,000 per year is required in connection with the connecting of new areas. It is proposed to provide a capital sum of £3,500 in each year for work in connection with the projection of future developments.  An inquiry into the installation of the Liffey <Col N="1222" /> for power purposes is being undertaken and will be covered out of that provision.  The Board has made representation that provision of suitable accommodation for the head office staff has become a matter of urgency and it is proposed to undertake the building of new offices for which a capital sum of £60,000 is provided for 1934-35 and a similar sum for the following year. There is provision for £30,000 a year to cover contingencies which must arise in an undertaking of this size and a further contingency item arising out of the extension of the transmission and distribution system for £20,000 1933/34, £50,000 1934/35, and £39,000 1935/36.  It is necessary to have a margin to facilitate a type of growth of which it is not possible to have accurate measurement now.

      <P>When dealing with this motion this night week I made a few prefatory remarks on Deputy Hugo Flinn's brief and concise speech as he described it himself. It lasted for only four hours, and I was reminded forcibly of the old poem which says:&mdash;&ldquo;Like sad Prometheus fastened to the rock, we looked with pity at the hands of the clock.&rdquo;  His speech was a choice farrago of bluff and bluster, of bunkum and of balderdash, didactic, dry, declamatory, dull. His economic piffle was calculated on the one hand to draw iron tears down Pluto's cheeks, and on the other hand it was calculated to bring a smile from and oyster, and set a spider jazzing to <Col N="1223" /> the music that we are told is broadcast from Dublin 2RN.  I wonder how many here have heard the story of the ass and the sacred relies.  There was once a poor old moke and he was sent carrying on his back a great load of venerable relics.  Everywhere the poor donkey went, crowds of people gathered round to pay reverence to the holy and venerated relies.  The poor ass got it into his head that they were all doing homage to himself, and he soon developed what may be called a general attack of swelled head or exaggerated ego or megalomania.  It is the same way with several people when they get into office.  They get it into their heads, and remain under the delusion, that the respect paid to their office, and the patronage their office enjoys, is all given to themselves. And the invariable result is that they do something which in the ordinary course of affairs they would not do.  Now Deputy Flinn told us in the course of his remarks of the untold wealth and priceless treasures that lay at our feet if we would only follow and adopt and co-operate with the policy of the present Government. As a contrast I would like to tell the story of Whang the Miller.  The miller dreamed of countless millions and that they were hidden down somewhere under his mill.  He began digging operations at once, and, after a while, he came on a big stone.  Then he ran home rejoicing to his wife who, duly, as a wife ought to, kissed him.  He told her that all the great wealth belonged to him.  Unfortunately, when he came next morning there was no treasure to be found; his mill had been undermined and had fallen down.  That is exactly what is going to happen when looking for the countless treasures promised by the present Government. The country will be found to have gone to wreck and ruin.  I do not want to touch very minutely upon the subject matter involved in this motion. It has been dealt with very ably by speakers more competent than I am. But following Deputy Flinn's example I just want to parse and to analyse a few of his remarks.  It would, of course, be too long to go through them <Col N="1224" /> line by line, but there are a few things I may be pardoned for dealing with.  He said: &ldquo;The amazing modesty which distinguishes the Opposition is about the only good quality they seem to possess.&rdquo;  Of course that strikes the imagination very much of Mr. Hugo Flinn, because modesty is a word that is entirely absent from his bright vocabulary.  He was very anxious to find that there should be no modesty left in the House because, of course, he himself is the last man in the world that anyone would accuse of modesty.  Then he goes on to say: &ldquo;They had waited until a late hour to-night to get rid of to-night's instalment of the serial story of depression.&rdquo;  I presume he meant the cereal policy which was introduced by his Government, and which, of course, as everyone knows, proved to be a barren failure.  Then he said: &ldquo;When I listened to &lsquo;these bright young things.&rsquo;&rdquo;  That expression would remind one of Mayfair and of the night clubs.  &ldquo;Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.&rdquo; Evidently there must be running some very pleasant memories in Deputy Flinn's mind when he made use of that expression.  Then in some mysterious way he got hold of the Irish expression &ldquo;go brónach.&rdquo;  He must have got that from the Minister for Finance (Mr. MacEntee) or the Minister for Local Government (Mr. S.T. O'Kelly).  Then he refers to the wails and woes of the farmers as a sob story.  He goes on to speak of a Greek chorus, one of which he never read or could not construe.  Then he goes on to say: &ldquo;Their leaders remind me of Macbeth's Three Witches: &lsquo;When shall we meet again in the thunder and the lightning and the rain?&rsquo;&rdquo;  He refers to the leaders on this side and says: &ldquo;They remind me of a book written by a less distinguished man of my own name, Victor Hugo, called &lsquo;<i>Les Miserables.</i>&rsquo;&rdquo;  I will answer him in the words of Shakespeare: &ldquo;When the hurly-burly is done, When the battle is lost and won.&rdquo;  He then went on to say that the Opposition were really mourning because they had not got a corpse to mourn.  All <Col N="1225" /> I can tell the House is that unfortunately within the last two months in West Cork we have had two corpses to mourn over, those of Hugh O'Reilly and Cornelius Daly.</P>

      <P>On a point of order.  I assume it is within the limits of order for a Deputy to examine some of the case that Deputy Flinn made on this motion.  The motion before the House had reference to the action of the Government in taking £448,000 from the local authorities in the beginning of last year, resulting in circumstances in which a huge amount of rates were uncollected on 21st December last, something over half a million more than the previous year.  From the point of view of time, Deputy Flinn was the one member of the Government who made any attempt to defend the Government's case in connection with this matter, and whole half-hours of his speech were full of irrelevancies. I assume that it is in order to refer to the absolutely irrelevant case that the Government have made in rebutting this particular motion, so that in so far as matter is contained in the Parliamentary Secretary's speech which draws into this discussion huge lumps of irrelevancy to hide the want of case on the part of the Government, Deputies may point out that fact in their speeches.</P>

I allowed him that. <Col N="1227" /> Irrelevancies have been introduced on both sides.  It does not take a Deputy a quarter of an hour to indicate to the House that he considers Deputy Flinn's speech contained a lot of irrelevancies. I allowed him to analyse the personality of Deputy Flinn up to a point. Surely it is time that we came to the matter of Deputy Flinn's speech and nothing else.</P>

They are a sort of incarnate bad luck wished upon this House.&rdquo;  Was that irrelevant?  We had over four hours of that.

Dry Those Tears&rsquo;; get that lump out of your throat; swallow it.&rdquo;  Am I right in quoting that?  May I suggest that a better title would have been &ldquo;Oh try light beer.&rdquo;&ldquo;Weep no more, my Lady&rdquo; he said. I say: &ldquo;Sleep no more, my boys,&rdquo; for Macbeth hath murdered sleep.  You may be hauled out of your beds and murdered.  Deputy Flinn went on to say: &ldquo;I am trying to act as a tonic.&rdquo; Am I right in saying that he was acting really as a wet blanket? If I am out of order I will accept the ruling of the Chair.  He also said: &ldquo;I got held up in a fog the other night <Col N="1228" /> and I had to stay at a hotel on the way.  I could not sleep, so I read Opposition Deputies' speeches.&rdquo;  I think he was in that fog when he made the speech.  Deputy Flinn went on to say: &ldquo;Deputy O'Leary said we had been returned on false pretences.&rdquo; Have they not been returned on false pretences and promises which they knew they could not carry into effect? Did they not promise the people openly and publicly that they would have better times, lower rates and reduced taxation, and what is the result?  I ask any honest man in the House, no matter on what side he sits, are not times worse, are not rates higher, are not taxes increased?  Still Deputy Flinn has the audacity to say that Deputy O'Leary had made a mistake in stating that they had been returned on false pretences.  That is a fact that must be known to everybody.  In view of the ruling of the Chair I am going to cut down what I have to say.</P>

      <P>Will the incorrigible member for East Cork try to keep silent even for a few minutes?  &ldquo;I do not mind fooling somebody else,&rdquo; says Deputy Flinn, &ldquo;but I do not fool myself.&rdquo;  The inevitable result is that he is not only fooling everybody else but also himself. He referred to a matter which is just as irrelevant as anything I have said&mdash;a report in the <i>Cork Examiner</i> of a meeting held in Cork by General O'Duffy.  He gave a long citation about it.  He then went on to say&mdash; which had nothing whatever, if I might be permitted to say so, to do with the motion before the House&mdash;that one of the most faithful followers of the U.I.P. was heard to say: &ldquo;That is a great man we have got as leader, if only he was dumb.&rdquo;  The same may be applied to Deputy Hugo Flinn himself. As I say, I accept the ruling of the Chair but I hope I may be permitted to quote at all events from what he says.  He said &ldquo;This Christmas has been a happy and prosperous Christmas in Ireland relative to what it was before, and everyone knows it.&rdquo; To this extent it may have been a very <Col N="1229" /> happy Christmas, that there might have been abundance of food.  Calves were sold for 1/6.  It is an unfortunate fact in the history of the world that feasts and famines go together&mdash;&ldquo;Eat drink and be merry for to-morrow we die.&rdquo;  The Deputy referred to chapel gate meetings.  Here is a Deputy with an inferiority complex. He talks about our slavish spirit.  Why does he call them chapel gates?  Why does he not call them church gates? &ldquo;Chapel gates&rdquo; is really a relic of the old penal laws.  It always annoys and irritates me when I hear anybody&mdash; even the President did it this evening &mdash;referring to our churches as chapels. Deputy Flinn goes on to say that Deputy Haslett is one of those loyalists. Whether that was in any way germane or pertinent to the question before the House I am not in a position to judge. There is one thing I can say about Deputy Haslett and that is that I am sure he never sent a petition round the country begging to get off conscription because he was the only man who could supply fish to the British market.</P>

      <P>The motion now before the Dáil is:</P>
      <P>That the Dáil condemns the action of the Government in reducing the total of the grants payable for the relief of rates on agricultural land.</P>
      <P>I find it necessary to draw the attention of the House to the real subject-matter of this debate in view of the speech to which we have just listened.  I do not propose to deal with all the aspects of that speech. I would be ashamed to follow Deputy Burke into the realms which he has traversed to-night.  I will, however, merely remind the Dáil that when the debate on this motion was adjourned on Wednesday last Deputy J.M. Burke, like a chimera, was bombinating <i>in vacuo</i> about Judas and Jabez Balfour.  At first, I must confess that I failed to appreciate the connection between those worthies &mdash;whom Deputy Burke apparently so much admires, possibly because a fellow feeling makes us wondrous kind&mdash;and the resolution now before the House.  I am sure that many Deputies were in a like difficulty. Let us recollect, however, that as the terms of this motion clearly manifest, we are discussing rates on agricultural land and at once the relevance becomes startlingly apparent.  For what is agricultural land?  What differentiates it from any other description of land,&mdash;slob lands or building lands, for instance?  Not the use to which it is put, nor the misuse, nor the disuse, because I have gathered from the speeches of the Opposition that if the land were not used at all, if it grew nothing but nettles and weeds, or if it were made a refuse dump, the Opposition would still clamour out that it should be relieved of rates at the expense of the hard-working members of the community. So that, for the purpose of this motion, it is not use which distinguishes agricultural land from all other descriptions of land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Yet it is clear that there must be somewhere some characteristic which to the minds of the Opposition does demarcate agricultural land from <Col N="1231" /> other land or else the use of the adjective in the motion is mere verbosity and nobody would accuse the Opposition Deputies, least of all Deputy Belton, of that failing. Possibly the differentiation may lie therefore not in the land itself but in the man who owns it.  If so, then we can easily understand why we describe agricultural land as land which belongs to an agriculturist, or slob land as land which belongs to a slob or building land as land which belongs to a builder.  It may be a speculative builder like Deputy Belton for instance or Jabez Balfour&mdash;&mdash;</P>

On Wednesday, sitting almost cheek by jowl with Deputy Belton, divided only from him by the gangway, sneering when he sneered, snarling when he snarled, growling when he growled, was Deputy Morrissey and at once there arose the picture in Deputy Burke's mind and that picture was complete&mdash;Judas Iscariot and Jabez Balfour.  The poet in J.M. Burke's mind saw the picture.  It is only a poet would have perceived how like these worthies were or who would have the inspiration to use that knowledge in a rough and tumble debate.</P>

      <P>I would like to call the attention of the House to a passage in Deputy J.M. Burke's speech, <Col N="1233" /> volume 50, No. 4, column 1075.  Here is what he said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In the course of his speech Deputy Flinn referred to the Twelve Apostles.  May I remind him that amongst them there was a man named Judas and that the aforesaid Judas was attached to the Finance Department of the Twelve Apostles. It was he who was in charge of the purse strings, and another one of the Apostles was a taxgatherer.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Then later on he said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Let it be remembered that there had been a very long and big contingent of financiers from the days of Judas, to go back again to him, down to Jabez Balfour and to many others.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I must not follow.  He saw the relevance.</P>

      <P>I shall leave Deputy J.M. Burke.  I will say no more about that except that from what I have quoted it clearly emerges that Deputy J.M. Burke could not take this motion seriously. He jested with it.  He tied a few classical tags to it as any street urchin might tie a tin to a cat's tail; and then he completely forgot it, just as his colleagues on the Opposition Benches who spoke during the debate have forgotten it.  I can say that on this motion the Opposition have talked a lot.  I am sure a Shakespearian scholar like Deputy Burke will appreciate that it was all &ldquo;much sound and <Col N="1234" /> fury signifying nothing.&rdquo;  We had, for instance, from Deputy Belton a long statement of his superlative qualifications, as a man, as a patriot, as a farmer, as a politician, as an economist, as an agriculturist, as an employer, and as a public contortionist, and in each of these capacities Deputy Belton's admiration for his own achievement is so unbounded&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Opposition has wasted a considerable amount of time in discussing this silly futile motion&mdash; I presume it will be relevant for me to express my opinion of the motion as a silly futile one, just the silly sort <Col N="1235" /> of motion one would expect Deputy Belton to put his name to&mdash;but when important matters were before the House last session, matters upon which discussion would have been useful and serviceable, they have been silent and dumb and allowed them to pass by default, sitting there in their incompetence. I do not often praise Deputy Mulcahy but I might say this: that he is the one member of the Opposition who makes a serious effort to discharge his duties as a public representative. He has been made do the whole work of the Opposition.  He has to deal with question after question standing in the name of his colleagues on the merry-go-round that now passes as the Front Bench of the official Opposition, because those who should have been here to look after these questions for themselves and to do their duty as public representatives, were absent. We had in the course of the debate a very long and a very explosive speech from Deputy Dillon.  Deputy Dillon is not here to-night.  He was not here the last night.  Deputy Dillon, Deputy MacDermot, Deputy Brennan and the other Deputies who spoke on this motion, once they had delivered themselves of their orations, speedily made themselves scarce because they would not come here and face the music or they would not have their misrepresentations dealt with&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am going back to the speech of the proposer.  I was saying that it might be said of the Opposition in general that they talk too much and think too little.  As an example of what I mean take Deputy Belton's speech on this motion.  In the whole two hours&mdash;or was it three?&mdash; during which he spoke, he reminded me of a story I once heard about my native city.  An American was once asked by a friend if he knew Belfast. He said &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he knew Belfast.  He had spent a week-end there one Sunday afternoon.  Deputy Belton's speech reminded me of the Yankee's week-end, only his speech was weak in more senses than one.</P>

      <P>In the whole two or three hours of that disjointed oration, he did not advance one solid or convincing argument in support of his motion.  He told us that the President was now nearly caged.  I wonder when Deputy Belton will be locked up? Deputy Belton went on to say that he &ldquo;was elected by the independent, courageous electors of the North City,&rdquo; that &ldquo;the people when they gave their votes, gave all that they possessed to designate their citizenship in their native land,&rdquo; whatever that might mean.</P>

      <P>No, about Deputy Belton.  I am paraphrasing Deputy Belton's remarks about himself.  He declared in one memorable, noteworthy outburst that he himself had only been a student of mathematics and not a professor of mathematics.  All I have to say in that connection is that I am afraid he has yet to cross the Asses' Bridge.  He said that he and those associated with him &ldquo;were going to <Col N="1237" /> defend our rights, our homes, the homes of our children and the homes of our ancestors in this country against any scheming politicians.&rdquo;  He did not once seriously address himself to this motion.  Deputy Belton talked about what he called &ldquo;a Coercion Act,&rdquo; referring, I presume, to the Act the enforcement of which against other people he was prepared to support in 1931.</P>

      <P>The gander is getting the sauce intended for the goose and he does not seem to like it. Only once did Deputy Belton touch upon the substance of this proposal, and that was when he said that anybody who follows the trend of the prices knows that agriculture in this country, and probably all over the world, was more depressed in the beginning of 1932 by many points more than it was in the beginning of the year 1931.  For the first time, like the candle in Cerberus, a glimmer of truth was permitted to shine in the blackness of this miserable controversy but only for a moment.  Truth is the one source from which the Opposition forbears to draw inspiration.  In this debate we have had empty vanity, bitter hatred, petty personal rancours. We have had them in plenty from the Opposition&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but truth never, not even from the best informed amongst the Deputies who sit opposite. Not if they were to remain dumb and tongue-tied throughout eternity, would they dare to speak the truth about present conditions in this country.  They have conspired to suggest that the present condition of agriculture in this country is due entirely to the dispute regarding the land annuities.  Not one of them made a reference to the effect of world conditions <Col N="1238" /> on our agricultural position here.  They were not prepared to give away their case completely.  They left their willow leader, whom I see they have permanently relegated to the back bench, to blunder into an expression of the truth, because it is only when he blunders that Deputy Belton does speak the truth, the truth which is clear to him and to all the members of the Party opposite if only they would allow themselves to think.  The Opposition in this matter are in the position of men who cannot see the wood for the trees.  They tell us that our present position is due entirely to our disagreement with Great Britain, but if they look at other countries or give some consideration to the conditions that prevail generally throughout the world they will be driven to the conclusion that if trade between this country and Great Britain were flowing unhindered and unhampered there would be no real improvement in the position of Irish agriculture.  They say that the British duties have driven down our prices here, but the price of agricultural produce has fallen &mdash;and fallen considerably&mdash;in other markets as well as here.  The prices secured by other producers, by our principal competitors like the Danes, the Australians and the New Zealanders, in the British market, have fallen also.  Does Deputy Belton deny that?  Will Deputy Belton get up here and contend that the price for Danish produce or Australian or New Zealand produce in the British market to-day is as high as it was in 1931?</P>

      <P>Those competitors of ours, those Egyptians, after whose fleshpots Deputy Belton hankers, like everyone else are suffering from the depression that has followed from the restrictions in industrial income throughout the world.  The main basis of world trade and world prices is the exchange of agricultural produce for industrial products.  If the parallel is not maintained between those two forms of production one or other of them must become a glut on the market, the level of prices of one or other must fall, to be followed inevitably by a fall in the general price level of the others.  The one thing which emerges from a statistical survey made by the League of Nations, which has just been published, is that the depression in agriculture is not local but is world-wide, and that in endeavouring to deal with the situation which has been created by that condition the Government here are tackling a problem which in many other countries <Col N="1240" /> has been found to be almost insoluble. Will Deputy Belton deny that?</P>

Unfortunately those anticipations are not being fulfilled.  Throughout the country a determined effort has been made, and is being made, to disorganise and to bankrupt local finances.  It is true that the incitements to this end have been more covert than open, more cunning than candid.  Those who are behind this campaign, those who have sponsored this motion in the House, have not had the courage to bear public responsibility for them.  They did not say to the farmers &ldquo;Do not pay your rates&rdquo; but merely &ldquo;You cannot possibly pay your rates.&rdquo;  They did not tell the collectors not to collect but they merely commend those among the county councils which refused to strike the rates, and, by so refusing, refused to empower their collectors to collect.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;they took care to be on the safe side of the law.  I see that Deputy Dillon has entered the House.  He comes carefully upon the hour.  Take him as an example. When he was speaking during the last session on this motion he protested with great indignation against the attempts of the Minister for Agriculture to level back-handed charges against him or his associates that they were inciting the farmers not to pay their rates.  He asked, in the course of that speech, did the Minister for Agriculture or any member of the Executive Council allege that any member of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party took part in any campaign to prevent the paying of rates.  I do not see Deputy Curran in the House at the moment, but if he were I would ask him if he, in Ballyneal school-house, within six or seven miles from Carrick-on-Suir, addressed a secret meeting of farmers at which he advised them not to pay their rates.  At any rate, we will leave the smaller fry and turn to Deputy Dillon, the whale among the minnows.  He asked if we could prove that any member of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party took part in any campaign to prevent people from paying rates.  That is typical of the whole attitude of Deputy Dillon in regard to this matter.  It might be difficult to prove that he actually prevented people from paying rates in the sense of forcibly restraining them from doing so, but he certainly did his best to encourage them in that action.  Councils, as I have already pointed out, were told by members of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party&mdash;&mdash;</P>

When we suborn councils to refuse to fulfil their statutory obligations to provide money for the local services by means of the rates, do we not prevent payment of the rates just as effectively?  In that way, the prevention was subtly arranged but Deputy Dillon is even more subtle than that.  He goes further and he tells the farmers that they should pay this, that and the other thing before they pay their rates or their annuities. What right has Deputy Dillon to fix the priority in which any man, farmer or otherwise, shall discharge his obligation to pay his just debts? What special unction, grace or sacerdotal authority&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>When was Deputy Dillon given power to bind or to loose in the matter of a man's commitments to his creditors?  I know that Deputy Dillon does pontificate in this House but I should like to know when the holy oils were marked upon him and when he was given this power, as I said, to bind or to loose in the matter of a man's obligations to his creditors. Deputy Dillon and Deputy MacDermot, it is true, as we have just seen, are very anxious to disavow all connection with the no rates campaign. In his speech on Deputy Belton's motion, as I have already stated, Deputy Dillon most indignantly repudiated the suggestion that he would have or could have anything to do with such a campaign.  Does Deputy Dillon remember a meeting of the Standing Committee of the Cork National Farmers' and Ratepayers' League held in the Imperial Hotel, Cork, on the 23rd July, 1933?  He ought to remember.  He was present at it and there is a three-column report of his speech printed in the <i>Cork Examiner</i> of July 24th.</P>

Does he remember that a certain Mr. O'Reilly, of Watergrasshill, seconded <Col N="1244" /> Mr. Smith and said that the non-payment of rates was the only way to bring the Government to their knees because when local administration failed, national administration would also fail?</P>

      <P>On a point of order. Nearly an hour ago the Leas-Cheann Comhairle stopped a speech by one of my colleagues, Deputy Burke, because he said the Deputy was confining himself to quoting what other Deputies had said, and was not speaking to the motion.  The Minister has now been speaking for three-quarters of an hour. The motion before the House is one which says &ldquo;That the Dáil condemns the action of the Government in reducing the total of the grants payable for the relief of rates on agricultural land.&rdquo;  The Minister has not once in his speech referred to the subject of rates on agricultural land.  He has addressed himself to the question as to whether we were engaged in a no-rates campaign or not, which I hold is altogether irrelevant in a debate on this motion.  The Minister has not once in his speech, extending over three quarters of an hour, referred to the motion on the Order Paper.</P>

      <P>Because that paper printed every idle word that Deputy Dillon uttered at that meeting on the 23rd July.  It contains nothing to indicate that he opened his mouth by way of condemnation of the resolution or protest against the action it was proposed to take.  On the contrary, we are told that having discussed what action might be taken to protect those against whom the rate collectors may have taken action, it was decided on the secretary's suggestion&mdash;the secretary of this organisation sitting on the <Col N="1248" /> same platform as Deputy Dillon and I am sure making the suggestion with Deputy Dillon's acquiescence, if not. open assent&mdash;to refer the matter for consideration to the branches of this precious organisation in Cork, Waterford, Tipperary, Meath and Kildare. Deputy Dillon did not utter a single word against this proposal inciting farmers not to pay rates and urging them to conspire together to prevent the rate collectors and the public authorities generally from enforcing their collection.  There never was a clearer case in which silence gave consent.  Deputy Dillon's dupes who were at this meeting must surely be surprised when they read that he has the effrontery to get up here and complain that members of the Government were making backhand charges when he and those associated with him were conspiring to break the law.</P>
      <P>I know that Deputy Dillon and Deputy MacDermot, in regard to this matter, will disclaim, as they have already disclaimed, any association with the no-rates campaign.  They will declare that they never said to the farmers &ldquo;Don't pay; we merely told them that they could not pay.&rdquo;  The dividing line between saying that you should not pay and that you cannot pay&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>With pleasure.  As I was saying, the dividing line between saying that you should not pay and that you cannot pay is so thin as to be less than a metaphysical abstraction. Those who in July last witnessed Deputy's Dillon's astounding silence&mdash; the members of the County Cork Farmers' and Ratepayers' Association &mdash;in regard to the proposal not to pay, and those who have since heard Deputy MacDermot impressing on the farmers that they cannot pay have made note of the distinction between them.  They saw both the nod of Deputy Dillon and the wink of Deputy MacDermot, and they did not pay their rates: at least they did not pay until they became convinced that the Government would compel them to pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1249" /> In support of this campaign to dislocate local administration and, through it, in the words of Deputy Dillon's associate, Mr. O'Reilly, the local finances: through that dislocation to bring the Government to their knees, we have throughout the country subversive organisations calling themselves Farmers' Defence Forces and Youth Movements <i>mar dh'dheadh</i> led by the bald-headed boys of the old brigade. Talking about the Farmers' Defence Forces, what did Deputy Belton do with the rifles he bought for the Farmers' Defence Force which he established in County Dublin during the farm labourers' strike of 1922?</P>

We have been condemned, because in 1933-34, when so much more land and intensive construction work was being done for the farmers than we were able to get under way in 1932-33, we discontinued the emergency grant of £250,000 made in 1932-33, and slightly reduced the additional supplementary agricultural grant, leaving the total grant allocated in relief of rates on agricultural land for this year £1,750,000.

    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>I addressed a question to-day to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health with regard to the action of his Department in interfering with public bodies, and I asked him did he consider that action to be in the interests of the county councils or to be of assistance to them in collecting the rates and in discharging their obligations.  He did not answer the first part of the question, but, like many other Irishmen, he replies to a different point and says that, as regards the last part of the question, it is clear that the action of the council has retarded the collection of rates needed for the maintenance of public services and has been prejudicial to the collection of rates generally.  I want to refute that.  The facts are that on the 4th December six ratepayers came before a meeting of the county council.  Those six men had been summoned for 12 months' rates.  They asked for a fortnight's extension so that the person who owed them money, of which we, as local councillors, were aware, would pay them what was owed, and they would then pay the county council in full. The county council decided that that was a reasonable request.  These people had promised to fulfil their obligations and were no parties to a no-rates campaign.  Within two days of the county council's resolution a letter was sent down by the Department, signed by the Minister's secretary, ordering proceedings to be taken against those six individuals and, during the Christmas period, they were brought into court and decrees were given against them.  In some cases an extension was given and in others no extension, but £8 costs were put against them.  The county council seemed surprised that the privilege they had already exercised, of extending a period of grace to various ratepayers in the area in order to enable them to pay the rates, should be withdrawn and that at that particular period of the year, of all other times, such an order should be issued contrary to the wishes of a public body. From my own experience, that privilege of extending a period of grace to <Col N="1255" /> various ratepayers has been exercised for the last 15 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The county council held a special meeting on the 16th January and were more than surprised when they read in the local Press that their resolution had been considered by the Minister's Department as <i>ultra vires.</i>  It was no compliment for the county council merely to extend a fortnight's grace when we knew the local situation and when we knew that these honest and hardworking men were willing and were going to pay the rates and were prepared to help the Government in every way to win the economic war. On the 16th January, however, a meeting was held and I maintained that I did not believe it was the policy of the Fianna Fáil Government that these people should be brought into court and decrees given against them.  I maintained that that was not the Christian policy I had heard enunciated so often in this House.  I believed that was not the policy of the Fianna Fáil Government.  It may be the policy of the Department, but, if so, I am certain that policy is contrary to the wishes of the people of Ireland at the present time.  I maintained on the 16th January that officials here in departments in Dublin, away from the seat of war and not realising the effects of the economic war, since they are not living amongst the people as we are in the rural areas, did not realise that there is an economic war on.  At that meeting we decided that a deputation from the county council should be sent to the Minister to put our views before him and to ask him not to interfere with the discretionary powers which the county council had always exercised and which we have exercised for the past 15 years.  That resolution was passed, but what happened? The Minister's Department did not wait to receive the resolution. They did not wait to receive the minutes of the meeting from the county council, but a Press report appeared on the 20th January and the Department acted on that Press report and replied that they were not going to receive the deputation and threatened the county council with the <Col N="1256" /> Public Safety Act.  Is this the policy of the Government?  The council are to be threatened with the Public Safety Act for maintaining that we had the right to extend the period of grace in certain cases.  I want the House to remember that one of these cases was that of a poor person in receipt of home relief who was decreed for £1 7s. 6d.  Another case was that of a poor woman whose husband died last October and we had to give her son a week's work during Christmas to enable her to pay the rates to prevent sheriff's and solicitor's costs being put against her.  Are we to be threatened with the Public Safety Act simply because we used our discretion in such cases?  In one case a poor woman, whose daughter is dying of consumption, is brought into court for 12/6.  Surely this is not the Christian policy we have heard so much about.</P>
    <P>I want it to be understood that, while making this criticism, I am whole-heartedly in support of the Government in their economic policy and prepared to help them in every way to prevent any foreign nation dictating to the people of Ireland, but I am not going to allow a Department to interfere with the discretionary powers of public bodies which they have always exercised.  We are threatened with suspension, but I can assure the Minister that there will be a meeting of the county council on Monday and, if that policy is going to be continued, he can take over the charge of the county council, as far as I am aware, from Monday next. If it is going to be the policy of the Government that the county council are not going to be allowed to use the discretion they have always had and that the rate collectors are in the position that they must, according to the orders of the Minister's Department, take proceedings, which will mean that the sheriff adds his costs on to the bill, it may mean that the District Justice will give a longer term than the members of the county council would have given.  I maintain that the rate collectors are the officials of the county council, and I also maintain that the Minister has no power to interfere with those rate collectors until they <Col N="1257" /> are reported by the county council for neglect of duty.  Therefore, I suggest that his action in rushing, within two days, to order proceedings to be taken against these people behind our backs is altogether <i>ultra vires</i> so far as the Minister's powers are concerned.  I maintain that until they report to him he has no authority to act in any way whatever.  He has to take responsibility for his own officials.</P>
    <P>The Minister maintained that our action is retarding the rate collection. What is the position of the rates?  We had £18,000 more to collect this year than last year, and I am proud to say, and I congratulate the ratepayers of the county on it, that even with that additional £18,000 on the rates, we are only about 2 per cent. less in the collection of our rates than we were this time last year.  If that £18,000 had not been added on we would have been over 5 per cent. more than last year, because we were using our local knowledge in the collection of the rates as regards the members who, we knew, could pay and we were making them pay.  Notwithstanding that, the very moment the rate collectors got authority from the Minister they refused to take half the moiety.  They issued civil bills and all the rest of it and brought these people into the court and put more expense on them.  If the Minister is aware of all this, then he is a party to a policy which, I believe, will bring all parties together at the present time in Wicklow in trying to oppose the taking away of the rights and privileges which the county council always had.  I suggest that there is no question of a non-payment of rates campaign in this.  In proof of this I can say that out of 975 cottages under our control the arrears amount to only £485.</P>
    <P>Can any other county point to that record?  Can any other county point to an overdraft amounting only to £20,000?  No other body can point to that, and no other county council is receiving the threatening letters from the Department that the County Council of Wicklow is receiving.  What I recent is that the Minister or his Department should act on Press reports.  That was never heard of <Col N="1258" /> before.  I never heard of any Government acting on a report in the local Press.  The Department replied to that and refused to meet a deputation. Instead, a threat is made of what may happen the members of the county council under the Public Safety Act.  I am aware that it is not possible for the Minister to see every letter which issues from his Department, but I conceive it to be my duty to let the Fianna Fáil Party and the Government know of the letters that come from the Department, apparently without their knowledge.  I am sure that if the Minister were aware of the true condition of affairs he would not be a party to making scapegoats of the few men who were brought to the courts for the benefit of others.</P>
    <P>There were in our area a number of small farmers who grew black oats and who could not get a price for them. There were also labourers out of employment, and these were the men who were sued for rates.  People in receipt of home help are having the rates collected by the Civic Guards, out of that home help, each week or fortnight. Surely that is not a policy that the Minister or the Fianna Fáil Government approves of.  The Minister should change that, because it is the experience of everybody that it was the co-operation of the public bodies that helped to win the war during the Black and Tan regime.  I want that co-operation to continue, but I am going to try to protect the rights and privileges of the public bodies while I am here.  I have had experience of every public body in the County Wicklow. We had some pin-pricks from the Minister's predecessors, and we had trouble with the Department in the old days.  The only way the Government can win is with the co-operation of the civilian population.  If authority is taken out of the hands of local men, who understand the conditions, and placed in the hands of men in the Department in receipt of good salaries, there cannot be co-operation.  Of course, we are attacked for mentioning officials.</P>

      <P>I should be very slow to believe that the Minister is aware of the facts I have mentioned.  If he is, I should be sorry to think that the Government approves of the continuance of such tactics.  The rate collectors have been placed in a very awkward position.  They are threatened by the Minister on the one side and by the public body on the other.  The result is that a number of rate collectors are summoning the weakest and poorest persons and adding extra cost to the amounts they owe.  On the expiration of the six-days' notice, they are demanding payment of the full year's rates.  They have refused to take a half-year's rates from these poor people.  The sheriff has to take the half-year's rates, and the district justice gives the people six or seven months in which to pay.  The Minister, through his Department, refuses to give two weeks to these people to enable them to pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that we shall have some reply from the Minister for the meeting on Monday.  He may say that the law is there and that he cannot interfere with it.  We are not asking him to interfere with the law, but we are asking him not to interfer with the privileges and discretions of public bodies.  Few public bodies have carried on their administration with an overdraft of £20,000.  The Wicklow County Council is endeavouring to have every penny collected from the people who, it is known, can well afford to pay.  But they should not be put in the position of having the weakest and poorest persons made scapegoats.  If I were waging a war, it would not be against 200 or 300 people that I would launch an attack.  I would start with one or two.  I would not drive the whole population as a united body&mdash;Fianna Fáil, Labour and farmers&mdash;into opposition to the Department for interfering with the rights of public bodies. Members of the county council and local people are the best judges of local conditions.  The majority of the people in my county are out to support the Government in their fight for freedom. But I want to remind the Minister that the people of the cities do not realise what the position of the people in rural <Col N="1260" /> areas is.  Labourers are out of employment and there is distress amongst farmers, but they are not growling. They are not a party to the attack made here to-night, but I suggest that the people in the cities have not felt the effect of the war.  Deputies who represent rural areas know the position of affairs.  We should be given some discretion.  People should not be required to pay the full year's rates on demand.  I know that they are legally due on demand, but they are not really due until the 31st March next.  We will complete our warrant if we are allowed to mark the rates of these poor people in receipt of home help and in poor circumstances as &ldquo;irrecoverable.&rdquo;  The collection of rates out of home help was never heard of before.  That is not a policy which is going to help Ireland or to help the Government.  It will help only the people who are out to destroy the country and destroy the public bodies.</P>

      <P>That is so; in individual cases it depends on the rate collectors. But I have yet to be told that the members of county councils, meeting as a finance committee and discussing cases of arrears with their rate collectors, and knowing the circumstances, do not consult with the collectors, who give time.  They go through the list of arrears at the end of a month or a quarter, and the collectors give time. Once the rate collector gets his warrant he is independent; he has the law behind him and, despite the county council and the Minister, he can put the whole force of the law into operation. The Deputy knows that.</P>

      <P>It is done every day by the rate collectors.  I do not suggest there is any no rates campaign in County Wicklow.  So far as I know there is not.  There is in other counties, as the Deputy knows, and the effect of that resolution published in the Press&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The first resolution was not, because the committee met in private.  We had a committee meeting and it was not published.  It was the second resolution as regards your action.</P>

      <P>I read a resolution published in the Press and I was responsible for that being answered. I do not want the officials blamed; I am the person responsible.  That was answered immediately and it was answered because of the very bad <Col N="1262" /> effect a resolution of that kind would have; it would be used very detrimentally in other cases.  I am not saying it was intended to be used in that fashion in Wicklow, but it was taken up in other places and used in other places, and it could be used with effect if we allowed it in Wicklow.  In other places we could be told that we had passed over in silence a resolution ordering the rate collectors to give time; that we allowed that to be put into operation in Wicklow and we would not allow it to be operated in other places if similar methods were adopted, and they were intended to be adopted, as we know.  I have no power.</P>
      <P>I would not receive the Wicklow County Council deputation, because I would simply have to tell them that I have no power as a Minister to give that authority to anybody.  The rate collectors are masters once they receive their warrants.  They can and do use their discretion.  The law is there, and I am bound as Minister to see that it is observed.  If I do not do that I would not be fit to hold a position as Minister.  I am bound to see the law is observed.  It is only when unwise resolutions of that kind are passed and published by an important local authority that we are put in the position of having to call on the rate collectors to observe the law and exercise their functions.  That was what we did in the case of Wicklow. I had to tell the rate collectors what their duty was, and I had to tell the County Council that it was exceeding its legal right and its duty.  That was the position, and when a resolution of that kind is adopted by a local authority I, as Minister, am bound to move.  I am the person responsible, not the officials, and I take full responsibility. I do so in the exercise of my power as Minister.  I am standing by the law, which I am bound to see observed.  There are ways of doing these things, and the Wicklow way was not the way.</P>
