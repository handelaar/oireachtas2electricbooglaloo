      <P>Section 2, sub-section (2).  A new sub-section inserted before the sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2)  Every order made under this section shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made, and, if a resolution annulling such order is passed by either such House at any time during the continuance of such order, such order shall be annulled accordingly, but without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done under such order.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the amendment is merely to provide that every order made under the Bill shall be laid before each House and may be annulled by either House.</P>

      <P>I would like to know from the Minister why this amendment is being accepted by the Government in view of the fact that this House has been occupied recently in discussing a Bill the purpose of which is to abolish the Seanad.  If I were to proceed to discuss that question I would probably be ruled out of order, but from the point of view of the ordinary plain man and back bencher it seems to me rather strange that the Government should accept an amendment from the Seanad at a time when it is seeking to abolish that House altogether.  The fact that the Government propose to <Col N="2516" /> accept this amendment from the Seanad provides a sufficient reason for me or for anybody else in the country as to the necessity for leaving the Seanad as it is.</P>

      <P>When the discussion on this Estimate was adjourned I was drawing the attention of the House to the fact that there has been a very large increase in the number of Guards, an increase of 400 within the last few years.  I pointed out that this increase had taken place while an Executive is in office which pledged itself to reduce very considerably the number of men who are in the Guards and announced publicly that its policy was to fill up no vacancies which might occur, and in that manner reduce the number of the Guards.  They have gone back completely upon that policy.  I am glad in one way to see that they have acknowledged the tremendous amount of nonsense that they talked when they were in opposition.  They acknowledge now by their actions that all the criticism which they used to pour upon the Guards was absolute and entire nonsense.  They have not justified, or sought to justify, the increase that they have made in the number of men in the Guards and the very substantial increase of £70,000 which there is in the Estimate.  At no time has the Minister for Justice given the House any reason for the increase in the number of Guards, or the increased cost.  At the time the present Executive took over control of affairs, the country had passed from a very undesirable and a very disturbed state into a state of complete calm and rest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was not the semblance of disorder in the State at the time the present Executive took over office. The country had been brought back into a state of complete peace, and our contention is that the number of Guards who were then in the force should be sufficient, if they were properly directed and allowed to do their work in a proper and efficient manner.  At the time the Constitution (Amendment No. 17) Bill was passed an increase took place in the number of Guards and that increase, in the <Col N="2518" /> opinion of the then Executive Council&mdash;and it is our opinion still&mdash;was sufficient to have a force numerically strong enough to maintain peace and order.  We have heard no explanation from the Minister why the Guards had been brought to a figure very considerably over the figure that they had then reached.  We still are of the opinion that the then numerical strength of the Guards is sufficient for the present needs of the country.  The Minister has shown us nothing to the contrary.  No matter how strong the Guards, or how many Guards you have got, it is no use unless the force is properly controlled, properly directed and allowed to exercise its energies in a proper fashion.</P>
    <P>When I was addressing the House on this Estimate a few days ago, I dwelt at some length upon the failure of the Guards to prevent the construction of a land mine.  I said that there must have been some particular reason, some particular order, given to the Guards not to raid the premises in which they knew that a land mine was being constructed.  In a question which I put yesterday to the Minister for justice, on behalf of Deputy McGilligan, I found strong confirmation of the view I had formed, clear confirmation of the view that the Guards must have had instructions not to interfere in any way with the activities of the I.R.A.  A court-martial, or what purported to be and what called itself a court-martial, which of course was quite illegal, was being held by certain members of the I.R.A. upon certain other members of the I.R.A.  It was quite public.  It was known to everybody that this illegal court-martial was going to take place. I asked the Minister yesterday if any steps were taken to prevent it, if any steps had been taken to deal with the persons who constituted that illegal court.  The Minister's answer was simply that he had no evidence.  Why has he not evidence?  I asked him if the Guards had been making any searches or any efforts to acquire evidence and the Minister could give me no answer.  I conclude from that, and I am sure every sensible person concludes, that the Guards have instructions that the headquarters of <Col N="2519" /> the I.R.A. are not to be interfered with and they may publicly proclaim that they are acting illegally.  They may even send notices to the papers proclaiming that they are acting against the law.  They may send notices to the Press and it may be published in the Press that those people, calling themselves the only legitimate army in the State, can hold courts-martial and deal with any persons they like in any fashion they like.</P>
    <P>Obviously it never occurred to anybody that they should be stopped or interfered with.  Those are illegalities which were allowed to be carried on. Let us visualise some individual going to a member of that so-called court-martial and saying to him, &ldquo;Are you not running a certain amount of risk in publishing this matter about the court-martial before it is held?  Do you not think the Guards may enforce the law?&rdquo;  If someone went to a member of that court-martial and addressed him in that fashion, I am pretty certain the member of the court-martial would turn round and say, &ldquo;Who would allow the Guards&mdash;do you think Ruttledge&rdquo;&mdash;I am quite sure he would not call him the Minister for Justice, because these gentlemen would not admit the existence of a legitimate Executive Council in this country, and possibly he might call him Mr. Ruttledge&mdash;&ldquo;do you think Mr. Ruttledge would have the courage, do you think he would dare, to allow the Guards to come along and interfere with us?&rdquo;  He would be merely giving utterance to a very clear statement of fact, that the Guards would not be allowed to interfere in any way with the activities of the I.R.A.  That is very bad.  The law should be impartially administered and anybody who breaks it should be made amenable. There should be no privileged classes in this country.  There is a privileged class, the gentlemen who call themselves members of the Irish Republican Army.  They can break the law with impunity and they are allowed by the Executive&mdash;and the Executive admits that they allow them&mdash;to break the law with impunity.  There is no use <Col N="2520" /> increasing the number of Guards and then keeping those Guards from doing their duty.  The number was already completely adequate.  No matter how many Guards you have in this country they will be no use to the State unless they are permitted to enforce the law against every section of the community who break the law.  I am sure that the Guards are only being held back from doing so by definite instructions from somebody.</P>
    <P>I see no sign in this Estimate of any attempt at economy.  I will not go through the Estimate at length; I will not go into how the £70,000 increase is made up.  I will, however, point out one very curious little item. While there is rather a decrease in the country districts in the allowance for locomotion expenses, there is a considerable increase in locomotion expenses at Headquarters.  I have discovered that though the number of cars is seemingly the same&mdash;there is an item for the replacement of some cars&mdash;yet the number of drivers and mechanics has increased by 30.  What is the explanation of that?  There is no greater number of cars.  Cars may be, no doubt, a little bit older and there are some replacements, new cars coming in.  There was something in the nature of £1,000 for replacements. What is the need of these 30 new drivers or 30 new mechanics?  Why are these particular individuals getting this allowance&mdash;the number increased from 56 to 86?  It seems to me, taking that item alone, that there is no attempt, in any way, at even ordinary economy in the Guards at the present moment, and certainly that is an item which I should like very much to hear explained.  I do not know whether you are sending out two men now to drive each car where you sent one before; whether one particular driver is to go for ornament, while another is driving the car, or what the explanation of that figure is, or why it is that the same number of cars, which could be run last year by 56 men, requires 86 men to run and look after them this year.  I wonder if these are some of the new gentlmen who have been brought in and who are found capable of nothing else and are being put into <Col N="2521" /> the mechanics' department in order that they may ornament it with their presence and fill their pockets with the pay they are not earning.  The whole force, most undoubtedly, is deteriorating and must deteriorate with the way it is being administered at the present moment.  As I said before, I do not believe you can destroy the <i>esprit de corps</i> completely, but you are doing your very best to lower and diminish it.  The Guards are being directed to act, on certain occasions, in a completely illegal manner.</P>
    <P>Let me take the example of a meeting in Westport.  There, the Guards&mdash; and I am sure they must have been acting under definite instructions, I am certain they must have received instructions from somewhere&mdash;proceeded to arrest the leader of a great political Party in this State, who was doing nothing irregular and nothing wrong.  They proceeded to pull him off the platform and to arrest him&mdash; illegally arrest him, as the courts have held&mdash;while he was addressing a meeting of many thousands of his supporters. Why was that done?  What was the reason for that?  More foolish action could not have taken place.  If the crowd, if the enormous number that had been collected there, of young men supporters of General O'Duffy, had not shown the most extraordinary restraint, there would have been, in the town of Westport, on that particular occasion, a most terrific and terrible riot, and since they were 10 or 15 to 1, and possibly more, in numbers, compared with the Guards, the Guards would have been powerless to check that riot.  There was deliberate provocation given, a deliberate attempt, I say, by instructions coming from somewhere, to stir up a riot&mdash;thank goodness the attempt failed&mdash;a deliberate attempt by the Executive, or by some higher officer of the Guards, and I think it much more likely to come from the Executive, to stir up a riot and create disorder.  I am glad to say that the people showed tremendous restraint and they were not stirred up by that illegal action, that provocative action, taken in their presence.  The people showed restraint.  The people <Col N="2522" /> showed a desire and a determination to obey the law and not to break the law, in spite of the provocation they received.  If there was not a riot on that particular occasion, and a riot of tremendous dimensions, that was due entirely to the fact that the people showed restraint and self-discipline in the teeth of the greatest provocation. If, however, you are using the Guards, compelling the Guards publicly and openly to do what they and everybody else must have known was a breach of the law, you are doing a very grave injury not merely to the community as a whole, but to the body of the Guards themselves.</P>
    <P>As I said before, you inherited, when you came into office, the very best police force that then existed, or certainly&mdash;I will not use superlatives&mdash;I will say, as fine a police force as was then in existence.  You have been doing your very best&mdash;the Executive Council has been doing its very best&mdash;to demoralise that police force and to use it in an illegal manner, compelling&mdash; obviously by your direction&mdash;the men, whose duty it is to see the law observed, openly and in public to commit breaches of the law.  Strong as may be the sense of discipline, it should not be tested too highly, and I do sincerely hope that this method, which is now being adopted, this method of using the Guards and directing the Guards to take proceedings against men who are obeying the law completely, and at the same time telling the Guards that they are not to take proceedings against people who are openly flouting the law&mdash;that course of conduct, I sincerely hope, will speedily be brought to a cessation.</P>
    <P>I wish that the Minister for Justice and I wish that the whole Executive Council would realise that they have got a very great responsibility in this matter.  I wish that the Minister for Justice and I wish that the whole Executive Council would realise that the whole foundation of every civilised State rests upon the clear and impartial administration of the law. The law must be fairly and impartially administered, and it must be recognised by the whole community that it is being administered fairly and impartially. <Col N="2523" /> If you find, upon the one side, that persons can break the law openly and that they are immune from prosecution, and, upon the other side, that people, who keep within the law, are being harassed, you are shaking the confidence of the people entirely in the administration of the law.  In shaking the confidence of the people, you are shaking the very foundations upon which a civilised State must rest, and I do sincerely hope that when the Minister for Justice comes to reply in this case he will give a pledge to this House that the course which he has been pursuing is a course which he intends to pursue no longer; that he intends for the future to see that the Guards are not checked or hampered in any way by any instructions in carrying out the provisions of the law against all evil-doers; that all this thing will come to an end, such as that certain persons may have arms, provided they do not show them in public &mdash;that they may use them but they are not to show them in public&mdash;this kind of thing that their premises are not to be raided, no matter what illegal acts they may be doing upon those premises. Let us have an end of all that &mdash;a complete end&mdash;and let us have from the Minister a definite pledge&mdash;a pledge that he intends to honour&mdash;that no person in this State will be allowed to break the law for the future.</P>

      <P>Within the last couple of weeks or so I happened to refer, when speaking here, to the fact that the Government had given illegal orders to the police ordering them to deprive citizens of their rights.  After I had spoken, the Minister for Education got up and, either directly or indirectly, suggested that what I had said was untrue.  It is a fact that for a long period, to my knowledge, the police were ordered to prevent people dressed in blue shirts from addressing public meetings.  I, myself, have seen that order.  That was an order either from a superior officer of the police, or from the Government to the police force, not to enforce the law but to break it, and that has been going on quite consistently.  The Government <Col N="2524" /> inherited, as Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney has said, a very fine body of police.  Then, a year or so ago, Fianna Fáil were having a sort of a party in this building and there was a fire here, a thing which might happen anywhere. Immediately, through the President's private propagandist organ, the suggestion was put out that that was an incendiary fire.  It was even hinted that the origin of it was the Blue Shirt Organisation.  Nothing very definite was said but, under cover of these stories, the Government proceeded to recruit a new force, popularly known as the &ldquo;Broy Harriers.&rdquo;  I know nothing about that new force except what I read in the newspapers.  It is a remarkable thing, however, that in so far as information has come out about members of that force, largely in the law courts, in every case that I have seen it transpired that any member of that force who was being examined on oath had to admit that he himself was a law-breaker and had been a law-breaker at the time he was taken into the force.  There was one occasion when the Minister, I think, said with regard to a member of that force that he had a recommendation from the parish priest and immediately the parish priest wrote to say that he had given no recommendation whatever to the man.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I admit that one cannot generalise from the particular, but in so far as it has come out in court, every bit of evidence was that the Government recruited men who were law-breakers into that force and recruited them under cover of the suggestion that there had been an incendiary attempt to set fire to this place.  At some time or other there was a hint that there was going to be an inquiry as to the origin of the fire, but we have heard no more of it. The public knows perfectly well that, whatever was the origin of that fire, it was accidental, possibly due to carelessness. But the Government was looking for an occasion to get a certain type of people into the police and they did it in that dishonest way.  That sort of thing is not very original&mdash;has been done all through history&mdash;either using an accident or else promoting something <Col N="2525" /> oneself and using that as an occasion for doing something that one wants to do.</P>
    <P>I should like to know whether it was the Government or the Commissioner of Police who gave the illegal orders to the police to deny citizens' rights to people and to use illegal methods to deny those rights.  That is a thing that we have every right to ask.  For the Minister for Education to say that these statements are untrue is no answer whatever.  He is either misinformed or he is not telling the truth. As I have said, I have seen the instructions given to the police.  The Government has an extra charge for police now and they can put up a very good case that the condition of order in this country is very disastrous and very ominous at present.  One can understand that it would very easily be necessary to increase the police force. But what is the fact?  Everywhere one goes one finds that the police are not using the appropriate force to put down law-breaking.  In any country the maintenance of social order is not a thing that just happens; it is a thing which can only be maintained by definite effort.  There is always a possibility of social order breaking down in any country.  The apparent ease with which it is maintained in most countries is due to a long tradition of social order, wherein the people by reflex action just assume it.  We have not that historical formation in this country and the Government, as any Government over this period would be, is bound to be more watchful to see that every attempt at overthrowing social order is immediately crushed.</P>
    <P>But what happens now?  Anybody who reads newspapers knows that it is a daily occurrence to open a newspaper and read about outrages which have been committed.  Very frequently when our Party is holding a meeting there is a riot.  For instance, on St. Patrick's Day there was a meeting in Bagenalstown in County Carlow. Everybody read about the occurrence. The blackguards of the neighbouring localities came into the town and created a riot.  I have a letter here which tells me that one of the ringleaders came in and kicked one of <Col N="2526" /> our supporters who was dressed in a blue shirt and twice broke through the cordon of the Guards.  He was struck by a detective-sergeant who was on duty.  That detective-sergeant, I am informed, has now been reduced.  I admit that you cannot draw up rules for a police force with what you might call a certain amount of mathematical precision.  There is no doubt that a great deal of discretion is required. There would be occasions when you might say that a policeman used too much force.  But, to my mind, in the present condition of the country it must be recognised that when there is a riot on a policeman has to judge exactly what degree of force should be used.  On such an occasion as that, and in such a condition as we are in at present, the police should tend to use rather more than less force.  The Government should recognise that they would be doing more harm by coming down rigidly on a man because he may have been too zealous than they would by condemning a man for not using sufficient force.  Time and again I have been told by police that they dare not use the appropriate force and do what they really are employed to do in putting down disorder, because it is more than their job is worth.</P>
    <P>The Minister will talk piously and ask for definite information about an individual.  It is notorious in the police force at present that if any prominent supporter of Fianna Fáil or the I.R.A. breaks the law, attempts to assault people, or create a riot, it is more than the policemen's job is worth for them to take the appropriate methods that should be used on that occasion.  That is a condition which can only lead the whole country to disaster.  The police know that they were ordered by the Government to break the law; at least, if you like, there is a general impression amongst the police that, when an enemy of Fine Gael is breaking the law by assaulting people or creating a riot, a policeman has a better chance of keeping his job and getting promotion if he stands by and allows that to be done, rather than if he makes the law effective against that man.</P>
    <P>We have the case referred to by <Col N="2527" /> General Mulcahy of Murray, in Cork. Independent of the fact that the affidavit stated that one of these police &mdash;no doubt, one of those who got in as a result of the bogus scare about a fire here&mdash;entered to shoot this unfortunate man, Murray, it was known in Cork that Murray was in grave danger of his life.  I myself had people writing to me from Cork saying that Murray was in imminent danger of his life and that his not being shot was not due to the action of the police put on by the Government, but to the courage of his own family and the female members of that family.</P>
    <P>There was no need for extra police so far as one can judge; there was no need certainly to take on extra police at greater cost to the public when the police are being restrained from taking appropriate action to put down disorder in this country.  The fact that one or other man might get a knock on the head, or that there might be an odd riot, is itself a very serious matter.  It means that the people no longer have confidence in the power of the law to protect them.  It was necessary in this country that there should have grown up amongst the people a consciousness that the law would always protect them, and that the law breakers would be put down. Because of our history of achieving, political results by extra legal means, this is a thing very difficult to get, but, during the last two years, the Government have wantonly let it be known in this country and demonstrated to the people of the country that the law breaker is a man to whom their hearts go out and whom they are determined to protect.</P>
    <P>We have seen on another occasion a man whose mind had not even assented to a breach of the law being imprisoned for merely vindictive reasons when the Attorney-General and every member of the Government knows that on no plea of justice whatever could that be justified.  On the other hand, we read in the papers orders from a body calling itself &ldquo;Oglaigh na hEireann,&rdquo; which is itself an illegal name, and we read, as Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney has stated, <Col N="2528" /> the announcement that certain men were going to be court-martialled.  The court-martial was duly held and, presumably, sentence duly passed.  I did hear that one of them, although he makes powerful speeches, went on the run after the court-martial had been held.  Then there was this other matter about which we have heard nothing since&mdash;the meeting in Parnell Square. Deputy Cosgrave got up here and stated that the police knew that that meeting was going to take place; that the police came and watched the building while the meeting was on; that his information was that the purpose of the meeting was the demonstration of a land mine; and that the next day a land mine was exploded in Dundalk, murdering one woman, blowing up a house and damaging adjacent houses and injuring other people.  The Minister waved that aside on two grounds, firstly, that he was satisfied that the meeting at Parnell Square had nothing whatever to do with the crime in Dundalk, and, secondly, that enquiries were being pursued into it.</P>
    <P>It was interesting to see, some time after that, that a man was arrested in Dundalk neighbourhood and interrogated by the police.  The Minister had said here that he was quite satisfied that there was no relation between the Parnell Square business and the Dundalk business, but it was interesting to see the announcement in the court that, in the examination of this man by the police, he was asked had he been present at the meeting in Parnell Square, was he a member of the engineering section of an illegal body calling itself &ldquo;Oglaigh na hEireann,&rdquo; and had he been in Dundalk on the day the crime was committed.  Apparently, the police examining that man had not the same conviction which the Minister announced he had here, that there was no connection between the one happening and the other.  When the Minister gets up here and states that he is convinced or satisfied of a thing, he implies, not that he sits in his office and decides from his own wisdom, but that he gets reports from the police which satisfy him in making the statement he makes.  It seems fairly clear <Col N="2529" /> that, though the Minister may be satisfied, the members of the police were not all satisfied in the same way.</P>
    <P>The police force, under the Ministry of Justice, must know that there are organisations in this country aiming at the overthrow of the State, organisations whose method is murder and organisations which have no moral code whatever, but which think that, by merely mouthing certain phrases, any crime is justified and any crime becomes a virtue and, in those circumstances, the Government controlling the police allowed the meeting in Parnell Square to be held for the making or demonstration of a land mine and withheld the police from getting after the people who were doing it.  What had happened was so well known that on the Sunday there were military all around the place. Military were going around County Dublin&mdash;I myself saw them&mdash;and they were going around because it was known that the land mine business was on.  The only thing which the Government did not know, so far as I can make out, was exactly where it was going to be exploded, but they knew the men who were behind the thing.  They know the men responsible for running the I.R.A. at the moment and they know that those men, running that organisation, are running it solely for the purpose of overthrowing this State and destroying social order in this State.  We are paying an enormous sum for the maintenance of the police force.  The only excuse for paying that money is that it is recognised that social order must be maintained and that, in this or any other country, it can only be maintained by the State having the appropriate force to put down any attempt to overthrow it.</P>
    <P>While we are paying this money for the maintenance of this force, the Government itself is conniving at the continuance and propagation of this illegal organisation which exists solely for the purpose of overthrowing social order.  Under these circumstances, it is really scandalous that the Minister should come here and ask us to vote money to put down the thing which he himself is definitely promoting. <Col N="2530" /> We had the case of the murder of O'Reilly in Cork and the murder of Daly, and, when one asks any questions about these things, one is told, and possibly quite rightly, that it is inadvisable and not in the public interest that they should be referred to too much, as the police are making inquiries and the matter is being got after.  I think it is more than a year ago since there was a strike on the Great Northern railway.  During that strike, a train was derailed, causing the murders of two men.  Such an action as that is not the isolated action of a criminal; it is quite clearly an organised work.  If one inquired about it immediately after, one would be told that it was against the public interest for the Minister to say too much as the matter was being got after.  Two men were murdered during that strike and that was an organised murder.  The Government have made no statement whatever about it since and have told us nothing as to what steps they are taking to get after those responsible for those murders.  I do not want to make any assertions as to responsibility but it is known that the Government has power, under the 17th Amendment of the Constitution, to arrest people and to put questions to them and, under that amendment of the Constitution, the people are bound to answer questions and if they fail to answer, they are liable to imprisonment.  The Government knows every member of the Communist Party here; it knows every office member and certainly every member of what is called the General Headquarters of the I.R.A.  The Government undoubtedly &mdash;there is no good in trying to get away from it&mdash;knows perfectly well that the members of General Headquarters of the I.R.A. and those other bodies are themselves in possession of information which would enable the Government to bring to justice the criminals who are guilty of those crimes.  Under the 17th Amendment to the Constitution the Government has power to arrest every member of the General Headquarters of the I.R.A., and anybody else they like, and call upon them to <Col N="2531" /> answer certain questions.  If they fail to answer those questions the Government has power to punish them.  They can put them in prison.  That is what is happening.  The Government arrests members of the Blue Shirt organisation and puts them in prison. The Attorney-General some time ago got up and said that only three men had been imprisoned for membership of the Blue Shirt organisation.</P>
    <P>The Blue Shirt organisation is not, and never was, an unlawful association. There have been occasions when the Government, by this crime against justice which it committed, has been in a position to punish men according to law, but in defiance of justice, and to put them in prison for membership of it.  At the same time, there is the I.R.A. association, which is an unlawful association; which is an association that exists for the promotion of crime&mdash;the great crime of the complete overthrow of the State, and the destruction of social order here.  No man has been arrested and imprisoned for membership of that association, yet the Attorney-General appeared to expect a certain amount of appreciation for the restraint the Government has shown in imprisoning only three men for membership of an association which is not an unlawful association, but a desirable and worthy association.  The Government, by a crime against justice, has been able to imprison those men.  The Government, if it used its power, could undoubtedly have brought to justice the men who were responsible, either constructively or directly, for the murder of the men in the railway wrecking.  There is no doubt that the Government is aware with a moral certainty that knowledge as to those guilty of the murder of O'Reilly is possessed by certain people.  The Government has power to arrest those people and demand that they will answer questions under penalty of imprisonment if they refuse.  The Government has those powers.  Does it use them?  Not at all.  On the contrary, the police were ordered to break the law in order to prevent our organisation from making use of its <Col N="2532" /> legitimate rights.  At the same time, the police know, or at least they are convinced, that if they use their police power to put down crime in the way of riot, in the way of assault, in the way of injury to property, window breaking, destruction of motor cars and so on; if they use what is recognised in every country, and is necessarily recognised in every country as perfectly legitimate force against law breakers, the result will be that they will be injured in their career as members of the Civic Guards.</P>
    <P>There have been times when the police have known that, because they took action in protecting the public from the blackguards who support the Government, they were doomed to penalisation in their profession.  That is a fact known all over the place.  If the Minister got up and asked me to stand for one particular case I admit that I could not, because sometimes one does not want to bring harm on a man.  Take the case where Detective-Sergeant Leslie Fergus protected the public when blackguards came along to break windows and attack people at a legitimate meeting.  Because he protected them, and in doing so had to strike a prominent leader of those blackguards, a man named Sullivan&mdash; I will leave out the word &ldquo;because&rdquo; and say &ldquo;following that&rdquo;&mdash;he is demoted.  It is a remarkable thing. The Government may say it is only policemen who are guilty of some offence, technically or otherwise, that actually do definitely take action when those riots are taking place, but it is an extraordinary thing that any policemen I have heard of&mdash;and there are many&mdash;who have taken their jobs seriously, and who, when those crimes were committed, did really try to put them down, have been either transferred or demoted.  It is an extraordinary thing that the police who try to do their duty are either transferred or demoted, while those who do not do their duty get promotion.  The Government may not be completely guilty in all those cases.</P>
    <P>The President gets up and says that the position in the country is very serious.  He talks about plots against paying rates and all the rest of it.  In <Col N="2533" /> the Seanad, when the Blue Shirt Bill was under discussion, he got very excited.  Periodically he can get excited, and say that the Government requires those extraordinary powers because the state of the country with regard to social order is very critical. He is right in saying that the position is very critical, but he is dishonest in saying that the critical condition arises through the Blue Shirts.  Time and again we have had Ministers get up and say in effect that the Blue Shirts must be put down, because the existence of the Blue Shirts makes other people break the law.  What is the Government's duty?  The Government's duty is to see that the citizen enjoys the rights he possesses by law, and that anybody who attempts to take those rights from him will be punished by law.  What is the argument that has been consistently put up by the Government?  It is this, &ldquo;Yes, you have the right to meet; you have the right to wear shirts of any colour you like; but those people who support us, and who automatically resort to criminal methods tend more towards criminal methods if you exercise your rights as citizens.  Our method of meeting that situation is to prevent your possessing the ordinary rights of citizens, and to give those criminals a particularly favoured position in this State.&rdquo;  I know that unfortunately&mdash; owing to our bad traditions, and owing to the fact that the record of the Government over there is such that people feel it almost natural for them to side with evil doers&mdash;the full seriousness of this situation is not realised. What is in store for this country if the Government remains in power any length of time; if the Government continues to do as it is doing at the moment, protecting the criminal, trying to put down law-abiders; punishing the police who do their duty, and promoting the police who do not; indicating to the police that their business is to show favour to those in a certain political force who are themselves criminals&mdash;the attitude being &ldquo;go on favouring them and anything you do against the law-abiding people who happen to support Fine Gael will be recognised as merit in you?&rdquo;  At the <Col N="2534" /> present moment you have the Government&mdash;the President a few Sundays ago went around a little more frankly on the sort of work which he usually leaves to other Ministers and back benchers&mdash;trying to incite class feeling in this country.  You have the I.R.A. and the Communist Party.  You have Fianna Fáil Deputies and the President going around saying: &ldquo;Support us; they are ranchers.&rdquo;  A ranch is a farm bigger than the farm you hold yourself.  That is the definition of a ranch here.  If you own no land any farm is a ranch.  If you own 30 acres the man with 40 is a rancher; if you own 40 nothing smaller than 50 is a ranch.</P>
    <P>The President and the Ministers appeal to the cupidity of the people. The President thinks that the venality and servility of the Labour Party is explained by the fact that his policy is one which should appeal to the workers and to the small farmers. What does he mean?  He means that his policy is one that will appeal to those who wish to become possessed of other people's property.  Even if the President and the Ministers do not do that, that is the general attitude of mind in the world.  It is an attitude of mind that can only be corrected over a long period of years by certain means of rectification.  Here you have the President and his Ministers going around and advocating that form of class war.  You have organisations possessing arms whose declared policy is that property shall be taken from those who own it and distributed amongst those to whom it does not belong.  You have the police brought into such a state that they feel that they must support the law-breaker against the law-abiding man.  You have the police knowing that if they do their duty they are likely to be punished for it.  When the Government, by its action and its inaction, has created a condition in which social order is tottering, it comes along and says, &ldquo;You see the bad condition of the country; we require dictatorial powers to deal with our opponents; we require to increase the police force and to recruit men who are law-breakers into that force.&rdquo;  They have got votes of <Col N="2535" /> extra money to bring new men into the police and, as I have said, every indication we have had in the courts goes to show that, so far as the particular individuals were concerned, they had been law-breakers until they joined the force.</P>
    <P>The Minister has the courage, shall I say, to come here and to ask for a larger Estimate for the police when the police are obviously, as shown by declarations of the Ministers, not as effective now as they previously were in maintaining peaceable conditions and when the police are actually being restrained from doing the work they are paid to do&mdash;namely, maintaining social order.  We are asked to pay police who have been ordered by the Government, or their chiefs, to break the law.  The arrest of General O'Duffy by the police was a completely illegal act.  Why was it done?  It was necessarily done in fulfilment of an order.  The order was given: &ldquo;No man in a blue shirt is to be allowed to address a meeting.&rdquo;  Legally, a man in a blue shirt has a perfect right to address a meeting.  The policeman knew that, legally, the General had an absolute right to do that.  At the same time, from his superiors he had an order that General O'Duffy should not be allowed to do so.  The only way to prevent him was by using force.  There you have a conflict in the police between the law and the orders they receive.</P>
    <P>It is almost inevitable that, in a great many cases, the police will take the orders from their superior and be guided by them rather than by the law. If that order was not given by the Government, then the Government should immediately call for the resignation of the Commissioner of Police, who would be the man responsible for giving orders to the police to break the law and deprive citizens of their rights.  If the Minister himself, or the Government, gave instructions to the Commissioner to give these orders to the police, the Commissioner should have refused to obey the Government. I know that that is a thing that always tends to horrify the Government. They think that, merely because of <Col N="2536" /> their being a Government, every order they give must be obeyed and every wish they have must be immediately fulfilled.  It was the duty of the police to refuse to accept that order from the Government.  The police were really bound in law to do that.  But you cannot blame the police.  They have a conflict between the law and the orders they receive from their superiors, whether these orders emanate from the Commissioner of Police or whether they come directly from the Government.</P>
    <P>The police exist, as I said, to maintain the law and ordered social conditions here.  There is not any law in the police themselves.  They have a conflict between the orders they are receiving from their legitimate superiors and the actual orders they know of, which exist in the form of law.  Under these circumstances the police force at the moment is effectively serving no really good purpose.  Of course, time and again, I have seen them participate in an endeavour to put down disorder at meetings.  But at practically every meeting where that occurred, the people who were trying to make disorder would have been severely dealt with if the police had not been there.  The members of the Government have stood up and told us how splendid they were because they gave protection to our meetings.  They never gave protection to our meetings until we, ourselves, had protected them. They never gave protection to our meetings until, by giving protection they saved the law-breakers from what they would have got.  They minimised the punishment the law-breakers would have got.  Time and again meetings to which police protection had been given continued to be interrupted by cries, stones, and one thing and another when, if the police had not been there, the stone-throwers, the cat-callers and the disorderly mob would have been driven far from the scene.</P>
    <P>The Government tell us how splendid they are and how they gave us protection.  They never gave protection to our meetings until it was necessary for them to do that in order to prevent their blackguard supporters from getting the punishment due to them.  We are asked to pay <Col N="2537" /> this enormous sum for police who are restrained from doing their duty by the Government or by their superiors. If the Government did not give orders to the police to break the law, the Commissioner should be dismissed immediately.  Even if the Government gave these orders, the Commissioner should still be dismissed from his position for having taken illegal orders from the Government.  The Commissioner's duty, in that case, was to obey the law and not the illegal orders of the Government.</P>
    <P>One could make many criticisms of every Department of State, but it may well be that if a future historian looks back on the disasters that may yet happen in this country, the really guilty person he will see will be the Minister for Justice.  There is an opportunity now to put down crime in this country.  There is an opportunity to create a sense of security within the law and of insecurity without the law.  The people to whom the Government are pandering are the biggest cowards in the country.  The moment we brought in the 17th Amendment to the Constitution there was not a murmur from them.  Before that, they could go around shooting police superintendents&mdash;so long as it was absolutely safe.  They could shoot a poor boy named Ryan, but they only did it on a written guarantee that no harm would happen to themselves.  The moment we brought in the 17th Amendment to the Constitution they were like lambs&mdash;most law-abiding people.  They went back to their funk holes immediately.  It was only when the Fianna Fáil Party came into office that the little bullies came out to throw their weight about the villages. While we had the 17th Amendment to the Constitution in operation, the decent, law-abiding people felt that they could breathe again.  The would-be murderers were leading a very quite life and taking no risks whatever. The whole condition of disorder, which exists at present, has been directly produced by the Government, either by positive action or by inaction, either by acting wrongly or by refusing to act rightly.  They are leading the country into such a condition <Col N="2538" /> that practically every class is beginning to think in extra-legal terms.</P>
    <P>Time and again, I have spoken to members of families who have suffered from the blackguardism of certain people.  They know that they cannot get proper protection from the Government and they feel that there is nothing for it but to protect themselves. Under these circumstances, it must be recognised that they are quite right in protecting themselves.  I remember a casual case last year&mdash; for instance, the case of Tralee&mdash;and in which the blackguards and would-be murderers attacking had their grenades and their bombs, which they tried to explode.  They burned General O'Duffy's car and attacked him with a hammer.  Having done all that while the police were there, these men, who refused to recognise the Free State, who refuse to recognise the legality of our laws, who refuse to recognise any of our institutions, called upon the police to go in amongst the people they attacked because they thought somebody in the building was armed.  They wanted, when they went with their grenades and bombs, to see that they would be absolutely safe, and they looked to the Fianna Fail Government to protect them from people that they were trying to blow to pieces.  What happened?  The police, in order to please their masters, the Government, instead of using whatever power they possessed to the very limit against the would-be murderers, searched the potential victims to see that they were not in a position to defend themselves against people who wanted to murder them.  That is a condition that can only lead to anarchy in this country. You can talk about the Blue Shirts and say things about them, but the Government is responsible for anarchy in this State.  Instead of using the police to put down anarchy, they have, in the instances I have given, used the police for the protection of criminals.  There has been a number of crimes, and other things committed, and when questions are asked as to what steps were taken one is told that no information could be given in the public interest.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2539" /> One could go over an enormous list. I mentioned the murder of two men in the breaking up of a railway. Clearly, that was organised action. Under the 17th Amendment to the Constitution the Government has power to examine people and to make them give information.  Has the Government done that?  What steps have they taken to bring to justice those guilty directly or indirectly of these murders?  I would like to know if the Government has asked the police if they have any information, or if they have asked people who may have information, as to who was responsible for the murder of O'Reilly. I do not think the Government need go as far as the police to find persons who know who was responsible.  The Government has power to arrest people suspected of having that information and of having them questioned, and these people are bound to answer the questions under the penalty of going to prison.  Has the Government used that power?  Not at all.  It has not done that with regard to Daly or O'Reilly or the men murdered on the railway.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking the Attorney-General if every policeman has been asked for the names of any persons that they think may have information, or who may be morally certain that they know who were responsible.  If the police say that the Government has power to arrest these people, and to call upon them to answer questions, if they fail to do so they can be put in prison.  The same applies in the O'Reilly case and in the case of the men murdered on the railway. The Government does not use the power it has but it used the 17th Amendment to put three men in jail for being in the Blue Shirts.  The Government used its power absolutely to outrage justice and to attack a man whose mind, it was clear, had not even assented to breaking the law.  By a <Col N="2540" /> trick the Government got him into a position of being technically liable to imprisonment and used that opportunity to put him into prison.  I invite the Attorney-General or the Minister for Justice to say if it was compatible with justice that Commandant Cronin should be sentenced to three months' imprisonment.  For what crime? Merely for this.  That he, being a law-abiding citizen, belonged to a perfectly lawful association.  But the Government suddenly met in the Council Chamber and made an order, and called upon the Military Tribunal to recognise as full and conclusive evidence the order they had made, that he belonged to an unlawful association. Before he had time to get out of that position the Government arrested him and had him sentenced to three months' imprisonment, because they had made an order before he had been able to make certain changes that were required in virtue of that order.  They caught him in that way and gave him three months' imprisonment.  I invite the Minister and the Attorney-General to say if in their consciences they consider that in such a case a man should be sentenced to three months' imprisonment, as if he were a criminal. Neither can do so.  With regard to crimes against decent citizens they have power to get information which would enable them to bring to justice the people who are responsible, and those responsible for diabolical murders, but they will not use it.  They come to this House now and, on behalf of the people, ask it to vote money to carry on what they call police policy for another year.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>As I am rather annoyed at the thought that the morale of the Gárda Síochána has been considerably shaken all over the country as a result of things that it is difficult to explain, I should be very glad if the Minister could give some assurance on the points I am going to raise.  In every district where United Ireland Party meetings have been held, and where the Guards found it necessary to take some action to prevent disorderly conduct, a report or a deputation is immediately sent from <Col N="2541" /> the district to the Minister for Justice. Before the deputation proceeds on its journey it causes an announcement of a semi-public character to be made as to the treatment that is going to be meted out to certain members of the Guards.  The deputations of the Fianna Fáil clubs make reports, and they publish resolutions that have been passed.  After some time they announce&mdash;I do not know whether it is done publicly or not&mdash;that the Minister has undertaken to punish certain Guards.  As they say in the country, the Fianna Fáil club members go around making &ldquo;a blowing horn&rdquo; of the manner in which the Minister is going to deal with these Guards. Whether it is a coincidence or not, it invariably happens that within a week, ten days, or a month the Guards referred to by these clubs are transferred. It may be that the transfer was due, and would come in the normal way, if no report was sent in, but the impression left upon the community and on the Guards is that as a result of that action they are being punished by being transferred.</P>
      <P>Certain members of the Fianna Fáil Executive and clubs in Longford came to Dublin on a deputation, and a report published in the <i>Irish Press</i> stated that the Minister had promised to take stern action because of the conduct of some Guards.  The <i>Irish Press</i> withdrew that statement a day or two afterwards and said there had been no such deputation to the Minister and no such enquiries.  The strange part of it, however, is that the individual member of the Gárda whose name was mentioned by the deputation was immediately transferred. What I would like to know from the Minister is whether the transfer was made because of this deputation to the Minister, or whether the transfer was made in the normal course of events?  Was the transfer as the result of the views expressed to the Minister by that deputation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, there are areas where the Fianna Fáil clubs look on all members of the Gárda as enemies of nationalism and as enemies of all patriotic endeavour.  They charge that they are traitors and so on.  I know that <Col N="2542" /> the Minister does not at all share that view, but these plutocrats in patriotism have that view.  If a Gárda summon one of those heroes even for not having a light on his bicycle they will say, &ldquo;We will soon shift this fellow.&rdquo; As a result of these things, I am satisfied that members of the Gárda are left with an uneasy feeling.  I have not any evidence that the Minister is at all a party to any such thing.  But it is a peculiar thing that the transfer of the Gárda to whom I referred happened shortly after the incident complained of.  That uneasy feeling is being created.</P>
    <P>At the present time the Gárda are engaged in a scrutiny of the register of voters for the purpose of verifying ages, deaths, and so on.  Where a Gárda has asked a question in the homes of supporters of the Government as to the age of certain members of the family, where the Gárda has gone to the parish register for the purpose of ascertaining these ages of the people who made application to be put on the register, or where the Gárda has gone to the country register to ascertain these particulars, that is taken in the case of members of Fianna Fáil clubs as a hostile act notwithstanding the fact that the Gárda has made similar inquiries in the case of the other members of the community. I know that the Fianna Fáil Clubs take such performance of his duty by a Gárda as evidence of that Gárda's hostility towards them and a resolution is passed or attempted to be passed.  There are unfavourable comments made and again the threat is used, &ldquo;We will tell the Minister about that.&rdquo;  That is a very dangerous state of affairs.</P>
    <P>I would like to know what is the present position with regard to the I.R.A. in Longford?  It is alleged, and I have fairly definite information of it, that quite recently a musketry course has been carried out in the northern part of the country.  Rifle fire has been heard over a certain area.  I would like to know if the Minister has received any reports in the matter and whether it is proposed to take any action.  The brigade commander is well known there and boasts of the efficient and competent body of youth <Col N="2543" /> he has under his command.  It is also alleged that a consignment of rifles was delivered there recently.  I was recently told on good authority that a unit of the I.R.A. was met marching along the road and that they had a number of rifles.  Have the Gárda any information on that and will the Minister say if it is true? It is disconcerting to find a thing like that occurring.</P>
    <P>There are other matters of minor importance which I would wish to raise on this Vote, but I prefer to leave them over for the present.  Some of the points I would like to raise are in the form of questions to the Minister. I would be glad now to have a statement from the Minister that these transfers are not the result of political action by the Fianna Fáil clubs; that they are transfers in the ordinary course of events; transfers arising out of the ordinary administration of the police code.</P>

There are Press placards published this morning: &ldquo;Charges against the Police.&rdquo;  I presume that is a result of statements made to the House by me yesterday. I am not making charges against the police.  I do not know the police guards who have been appointed to observe my movements.  I would not be able to identify any more than three of them who were transferred from the military.  Therefore, it would be impossible for me to make a charge against them.

      <P>I would not intervene in this debate were it not for the definite charge made against the organisation to which I belong.  I go so far as to agree with General MacEoin that superintendents or higher officers in the Gárda should not be removed until the charge made against them is properly investigated. He referred to a certain case in Longford town and the Press report in connection <Col N="2544" /> with it.  What I asked the Minister to do in that case was to have a public sworn enquiry held and if the charge that was made against that superintendent was not proved he should not be removed, but if the charge was proved the least we could expect from the Minister was that that officer should be dismissed.  What is the charge?  A copy of it is in my bag at my hotel at the moment.  It is that the superintendent came out of a hotel at 9.30 that night when a meeting was being held by General O'Duffy.  He said in the presence of three witnesses &ldquo;Clear this crowd of people,&rdquo; and he walks down to four people who were talking, raised his stick and gave one of them a blow of the stick and a punch.  Two of the four men proceeded along the Main Street.  This is the substance of the statement made in presence of witnesses, a copy of which statement is in my bag at the present moment.</P>

      <P>I was not in Longford, and I cannot accept any responsibility for what happened at 1.30 o'clock.  But I am asking, as a public representative, that there should be fair play all around.  I asked for a sworn inquiry. What I am charging is that two men were going down the Main Street and they were overtaken after 15 or 20 yards and one of them got a stroke of a stick from the superintendent. Another man got an unmerciful stroke and was rendered unconscious.  That is his signed statement in the presence of witnesses.  I asked for a sworn inquiry and the only thing we got was the superintendent's removal.  I hold that that is not justice.  Citizens are entitled to fair play and if any ordinary citizen committed such an assault action would be taken against him.  I am sorry to intervene in the debate, but we should have justice all around.</P>

      <P>The point I put to the Deputy is this: At a quarter to one a number of people were mobilised in this street.  The chief superintendent was passing and gave an order that they be removed.  After that the chairman of the Fianna Fáil club came down the street and challenged the superintendent, who had nothing whatever to do with the order given. The order had been given by the chief superintendent, the superintendent had nothing whatever to do with it, but as he was standing in the street the chairman of the Fianna Fáil club came up and told him he was going to report him and that he would see that he would be shifted.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:&mdash;</P>
    <P>That in view of continued widespread unemployment the Dáil instructs the Executive Council to make available forthwith sufficient money to permit of the carrying out of large scale schemes of public works, so as to relieve the distress caused by unemployment&mdash;(Deputies Norton and Davin.)</P>

      <P>It is not my intention to take up the time of the Dáil to any extent, on this motion.  I have already spoken upon it and for a somewhat longer time than I originally intended.  In fact I would not have intervened at all, <Col N="2546" /> at the present stage, if it had not been for the contention made by Deputy Mulcahy that the solution of the problem of unemployment was something which could be easily achieved by the termination, on whatever terms might be secured, of the financial dispute with Great Britain.  In fact, it was clear from Deputy Mulcahy's speech, made on behalf of his Party, that the only idea in the minds of that Party for dealing with the problem of unemployment is to secure an adjustment in the financial relations with Great Britain, and then trust to luck. I intervened to point to the obvious fact that unemployment existed here, and constituted a very grave problem here, before the financial dispute with Great Britain began, and I invited Deputy Mulcahy or some other member of his Party to explain to us, in detail, in what manner the termination of the dispute would secure the removal of the problem of unemployment and what persons now unemployed would secure work in consequence of the termination of the dispute.  In case Deputies would have forgotten the conditions which existed in the Saorstát before the present Government came into office and before the financial dispute with Britain opened, it is desirable to advise them to read some of the speeches which they themselves made concerning the conditions which existed at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the occasion of the earlier debate upon this question I noted that the Lord Mayor of Dublin, Deputy Alfred Byrne, was about to intervene.  I advised him it was unnecessary to do so because, presumably, he would have nothing more to say on this occasion than on previous occasions when unemployment was discussed here and that I would save him the trouble by quoting from some of his earlier speeches.  I am doing that, not for the purpose of facilitating Deputy Byrne, but for the purpose of impressing upon Deputies opposite who support Deputy Mulcahy in his original contention that unemployment is due to the financial dispute with Britain, what their own Party considered to be the position many years before that <Col N="2547" /> dispute between the Saorstát and Great Britain arose.  On the 10th March, 1926, there was a debate here on unemployment in which Deputy Mulcahy as Minister for Local Government suggested that the unemployed workers in Dublin should not get relief in cash, but only in kind because if they got relief in cash they would spend it in publichouses instead of on their wives and children.</P>

      <P>I have sent for the volume.  Meantime I must be allowed to proceed.  Deputy Byrne, who was under the impression that the suggestion was made, was very indignant and spoke strongly about it.  Speaking about unemployment he said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I was really astonished at the brusque, shall I say, the almost savage way in which the Minister endeavoured to brush aside the case made by Deputy Johnson.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Byrne went on to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;When Deputy Johnson brought this matter forward on a former occasion I stated that the Government were only dealing with the fringe of the question, so far as Dublin unemployed were concerned. We have to-day many decent workmen who earned good wages in the past walking the streets of Dublin unemployed.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That was a statement made by Deputy Byrne about the unemployed in Dublin in 1926.  In 1927, Vol. 21, Col. 1867, he said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I avail of this opportunity to draw the attention of the Government to the extraordinary poverty that exists in Dublin.  The majority of these people are in more than a poverty-stricken state.  It is impossible to find words to describe their condition.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In the year 1928 in another debate reported in Vol. 24, Col. 2206-7, Deputy Byrne said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;No words of mine could possibly describe the appalling conditions in the tenements of Dublin to-day.  I would ask Deputies to take a stroll through Gloucester Street, Gardiner Street, Grenville Street, Henrietta Street and such streets which are within five minutes' walk of Nelson's Pillar.  They will find people in the tenements there hungry.  I do not wish to exaggerate the conditions that obtain in the tenements of Dublin to-day, but I take this opportunity of asking the Minister if he will take the words of the inspectors, of the St. Vincent de Paul Society, or the Roomkeepers' Society.  Both those societies are heavily in debt as the result of the administration of relief.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In 1929 Deputy Byrne said:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The matter to which I wish to draw the attention of the House is causing grave anxiety to people outside who are aware of the appalling conditions that exist in quarters where unemployment most prevails. <Col N="2549" /> People are asking how are the unemployed who are not entitled to unemployment benefit and who have no means of livelihood existing.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was on April 12th, 1929, when Deputy Byrne had been translated to the Seanad and had also joined the Cumann na nGaedheal Party.  I am not quoting these speeches in order to justify inactivity in relation to unemployment to-day.  I am quoting them to dispose of the ridiculous contention made by Deputy Mulcahy that unemployment is something of recent growth which has its cause in the financial dispute with Great Britain, and which would cease to exist with the termination of that dispute.</P>
    <P>I want to make an apology to Deputy Mulcahy.  The Minister for Local Government on the 10th March, 1926, was Mr. Séamus Burke, his colleague, of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister quote him?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>He said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We know that very often money given in this way can be spent in publichouses, etc., and by giving food we ensure that, at all events, nobody is going to die of hunger and nobody who is reduced to that condition need have any scruples or need feel in any way embarrassed in coming forward for this relief.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole debate was on the proposal that relief should be given in kind and not in cash.  I want to try to impress upon Deputies opposite how ridiculous is the contention that the termination of the financial dispute with Great Britain could have any permanent or substantial effect upon the unemployment position here.  It is futile for them to argue that there is any action open to this, or any other Government that may occupy these benches, which would secure for Saorstát agricultural produce an unrestricted entry into the British market.  Deputies opposite are continually making speeches, here and throughout the country, in which they are obviously endeavouring to persuade the people, particularly the farmers, into the belief that there is something which could be done by us or by them which would secure a free <Col N="2550" /> entry for agricultural produce into Great Britain.  I am quite certain that they are not as ignorant as they pretend to be.  I am quite certain that when they make these speeches they know they are misleading or attempting to mislead the farmers.  I do not think they are succeeding in misleading them.</P>
    <P>I quoted here on a previous occasion correspondence which had passed between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of Great Britain in which the Government of New Zealand had put up the definite query to the British Government, that if they were to give a completely free entry into New Zealand for all English products or to effect an all-round substantial reduction in the tariffs on British goods, would New Zealand products on that account be exempted from quota restrictions in Great Britain.  The British Government replied that they would not.  They turned down the proposition.  Since then we have had further confirmation of the attitude of the British Government.  In the London <i>Times</i> there appeared on the 25th of this month, that is, this week, a report from their correspondent in Sydney of a speech made by Mr. Bruce, the Australian High Commissioner in Great Britain, who was attending a conference in Australia, concerning the agricultural position there.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Australia,&rdquo;  Mr. Bruce is reported to have said, &ldquo;could gain nothing better by attempting to ignore world action and trying to export without limit, for she would find herself deprived of markets. Great Britain was the only available market for lamb and butter and Australia must make the best arrangement possible in view of the fact that Great Britain was determined to restore her own agriculture.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On the following day, the 26th, that is yesterday, the <i>Irish Independent</i> reported a speech made by Mr. Huggins, Premier of Southern Rhodesia, in which he referred to the fact that Southern Rhodesia would have to make its own agreements with other countries if Great Britain was <Col N="2551" /> not prepared to give reasonable quotas to her Colonies.  It is, however, not necessary to go to New Zealand, Australia or Southern Rhodesia in order to get confirmation of the attitude of the British Government. In the London <i>Times</i> on the 10th of this month there was reported a discussion which took place in the House of Commons on a motion relating to agriculture.  In the discussion the main criticism of the British Government was directed to the fact that they had failed to take effective action to increase the price of cattle and Mr. Ormsby Gore, the First Commissioner for Works, replying on behalf of the British Minister for Agriculture, who was ill at the time, referred to the fact that all statistical evidence showed that the consumption of beef was steadily going down, and then he said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Without tariffs, regulations and quotas he did not think there was any branch of British agriculture which could survive.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I referred here on the last occasion to a statement issued by Mr. Stanley Baldwin to the British National Farmers' Union and to other speeches made by other members of the British Cabinet, all of which were directed to emphasising the fact that it was the policy of the British Government, having regard to their internal situation, to restrict drastically imports of all agricultural goods into Great Britain and that that policy was going to be maintained.  It is, therefore, I suggest not merely foolish, from a purely Party point of view, but stupid from a national point of view, for Deputies opposite to be wasting their time trying to convince the people that there is anything which we can do which would secure unrestricted entry for our agricultural produce into Britain.  The only circumstance which would make such a thing possible would be a complete reversal of the present policy of the British Government, and there is no indication that such a reversal is going to take place.  On the contrary, there is every indication that the policy <Col N="2552" /> adopted by the British Minister for Agriculture, and now in operation, has got very substantial support in Great Britain and is going to be maintained. In these circumstances we have got to face the fact that, no matter what the future of our relations with Great Britain, we are going to be faced with quota restrictions on agricultural produce going into the British market. Because of that fact, we have, obviously, got to review the position here and take whatever measures are necessary in order to prevent these restrictions involving unnecessary and preventable hardships for our people.</P>
    <P>In so far as the agricultural position has a bearing upon industrial employment, we have got again to face the fact that the available indices all show that there has been no substantial falling off in the agricultural purchasing power.  The actual consumption of all classes of goods, whether manufactured foodstuffs, wearing apparel or the like, has increased.  That position may be, in a large measure, due to the expenditure which has been undertaken upon relief works.  It is, of course, obviously due, in a considerable measure, to the 50 per cent. remission of land annuities and the provision which has been made for the relief of rates on agricultural land and also to the fact that there has been an increase in the forms of agricultural production, which give most employment, brought about by the measures adopted by the Government from time to time.  I do not know if Deputies opposite saw in the Press during the last week a report of a British commission which was considering matters relating to unemployment in Great Britain and in which they stressed the fact that employment in agriculture in Great Britain, despite all the efforts of the British Government to increase production, had substantially diminished and that, in fact, there had been a much greater decrease in the employment of agricultural workers in Great Britain than in the case of the workers in any other industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The solution of the unemployment problem is not going to be easy.  Nobody has suggested that it is going to be easy.  Our predecessors during their ten years in office failed completely to make any impression upon the problem.  They left it much worse than it was when they came into office.  Its solution is going to depend, first, on the development of industry and, secondly, on the organisation by the State of public works where necessary and useful.  On the matter as to the extent to which our plans for the development of industry have progressed another opportunity for stating the position will shortly be available.  I do not propose to go into that now.  I know that Deputies opposite chortle with joy whenever they are able to record any temporary setback or failure in the Government's industrial plans, and they are continuously endeavouring to represent the position as very much worse than it is in the matter of employment for particular classes of workers.  Only last week, Deputy Alfred Byrne went to Wexford and told the people of Wexford that there were more carpenters and more painters unemployed in Dublin than ever there were before.  The statement is not true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am going to tell the Deputy what the position is.  I took the pains to take out quarterly figures in relation to both these classes of workers for a considerable time back. In October, 1932, the number of carpenters and joiners registered as unemployed was 869.  In October, 1933, the number was 368.  In October, 1932, the number of painters registered as unemployed was 603.  The number in October, 1933, was 465.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In January, 1933, the number of carpenters and joiners registered as unemployed was 1,061.  In January of the present year the number was 580.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of painters registered as unemployed in January, 1933, was 1,084 and in January of the present year the number was 740.  Of course, there are too many, but the statement made by the Deputy in Wexford was not true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am dealing with the Deputy.  I am dealing with the fact that the Deputy, without taking any steps to find out whether the statement was true or not, went down to Wexford to broadcast it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will now be very sympathetic about the numbers that still remain unemployed, but I suggest he would be helping those who are unemployed to get employment by telling the truth about the position and not by misrepresenting it. January is the period of the year when there is least activity in the building trade.  The Deputy knows that. Weather conditions prevailing at that time of the year are not conducive to widespread building activities.  The Deputy knows quite well that there is much more activity going on in relation <Col N="2555" /> to housing, activity of a kind that will absorb these people into employment, than there ever was before in the history of this country.  The Minister for Local Government in relation to one class of houses&mdash;labourers' cottages&mdash;gave figures here yesterday which showed that the number of cottages constructed or under construction or approved for construction since the Fianna Fáil Housing Act was passed 18 months ago, was 20 per cent. of the total number built in the past 50 years, during ten years of which the Deputy's Party was in office when there was very little activity of that kind.</P>

      <P>The sincerity of Deputy Byrne's criticism of the previous Government is revealed by the fact that when it suited his political interests to join them he did so.  It is easy enough to make speeches about the unemployed.  We get plenty of speeches about the unemployed, plenty of lip sympathy, but when our predecessors were in office the number of the unemployed was mounting daily, while the prospect of work was diminishing.  The situation has changed now.  Works have been made available. There has been more spent on the provision of work for the unemployed, on State-aided schemes, in the two years since Fianna Fáil came into office than there was in the ten years that our predecessors were in office. There have been more houses built in the last 18 months than our predecessors built in ten years.  There has been a continuous expansion in industrial production.  That is what the Government is doing to aid the unemployed.</P>
      <P>It is because the Government is doing that that these hypocrites who prate about unemployment, who give lip sympathy to the unemployed but who are prepared to sacrifice them when it is in their political interests to sacrifice them, are opposing the Government.  I am always made feel very indignant when I see the miseries of those who have not got adequate means to provide the necessaries of life paraded here for political propaganda purposes by people who have succeeded in doing very well for themselves out of such tactics in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The development of industry, as I have said, is a matter which we can discuss in more detail in the near future.  I merely wanted to indicate <Col N="2558" /> that, in relation to industry, there will be many difficulties.  There has been the suggestion that having regard to the increased mechanisation in industry now proceeding, a reduction in hours of work would maintain the employment position. In theory it is possible to contend that it would not and it has, in fact, been argued that a reduction in the hours of work of those engaged in any industry, if it does not involve, as it should not involve, a reduction in their earnings, will increase the cost of their products to such an extent that consumption will fall off, leaving the employment position unchanged. That contention was made in all places where this matter has been considered and particularly at the International Labour Office Conventions, where various proposals for the reduction of hours of work were made.  I think there must be a fallacy in that argument, although it is not easy to see it. There is sufficient in it to justify us moving with considerable caution in that direction and certainly no legislation should be adopted that did not involve a minute examination of the position of every industry before any orders affecting a reduction in the hours of work would be brought into force.</P>
    <P>On the matter of public works, what the Government has done, is doing, and is contemplating in that connection will be stated by the Minister for Finance, who is more directly in touch with the activities.  I stated the Government's plan for dealing with unemployment was threefold.  I said it involved the creation of three lines of defence against destitution arising from unemployment.  The first line of defence is the development of industry. Deputy Norton thinks that all the industrial development possible in this country would not be capable of providing employment for all those without work.  That may be so, but it has yet to be proved.  It is something which we will have to examine in detail when more information is at our disposal. Personally, I am inclined to believe that the actual number of persons out of work can be provided with work <Col N="2559" /> in industry or indirectly in other occupations as a result of industrial expansion to the extent that is possible here.  In any case, the development of industry necessarily is a fairly slow process.  However, it constitutes the first line.  The second line is the inauguration and the continuous operation of a scheme for financing useful public works where they can be undertaken in various parts of the country.</P>
    <P>Behind these two lines of defence is the third line, the Unemployment Assistance Act.  I know there are many people who criticise that Act and who say it is unwise to provide cash subsistence for workers without requiring work in return.  There are obvious answers to that contention. First, it is not possible to devise any system of providing work of a kind which will secure that work will be available in every part of the country at the time it is required and to the extent that will be sufficient to absorb the unemployed in a particular district. Human ingenuity could not bring into operation a system of that kind.  I know the Party opposite are trying to meet that difficulty by proposing to conscript the workers into battalions and march them around the country looking for work to do, permitting them to write home once a week to their relatives and perhaps to send them some of their earnings.  I am quite certain such a system as that will never be in operation in this country under any circumstances.</P>
    <P>The main justification for an assistance scheme that does not require work in return for the actual cash benefits given is that the inaguration of a system of public work of such a universal kind that an assistance scheme of the type in operation will not be necessary is not possible. Secondly, there is the very considerable fact that it costs a lot more to put the worker at work than to provide him with assistance without the obligation of work.  I agree fully that it is much better that workers should be provided with work rather than with assistance.  Both from the point of view of national gain and the effect <Col N="2560" /> on the individual, it is much better that relief should be given in the form of work rather than in the form of cash benefit not involving the working condition.  But whereas a man can be provided with the necessary means of sustaining himself and his family for a reasonable sum per week, it would cost almost double that amount to give the man the same subsistence under a work scheme, because the inauguration of a work scheme involves not merely the provision of tools and implements, but also supervision and, over and above the supervisors, the necessary technicians, engineers and the like who have to plan the work, the cost of which must be charged against the scheme.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the justification for the inauguration of an unemployment assistance scheme is that it is devised to secure that where the worker cannot be provided for immediately in industry or by a State scheme of public work of some kind, he will nevertheless be protected against destitution to the extent that the Unemployment Assistance Act does protect him automatically. The principle is that the worker is given a statutory right to that protection.  It is the first time in the history of this State that the worker has had that statutory right.  In that regard we have advanced much further than European countries or most other countries in the world.  It may be that the amount of assistance under that Act is limited.  It is limited only because our means are limited; but the principle which it embodies is a sound one and one which was subscribed to by all Parties in this House some time ago, even though the leaders of the opposite Party have since departed from it.</P>
    <P>The motion before the House emphasises the necessity for public works.  I think the Government can claim that its public works programme up to date has been very extensive and has produced beneficial results, not merely in the creation of the actual works but in maintaining commercial activity through the country, and it is the intention of the Government to continue those works in the same manner until the development of <Col N="2561" /> industry has rendered them less necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>We have been given to understand from various quarters, including the Minister for Finance, that the Minister for Industry and Commerce is the &ldquo;bright particular star&rdquo; of the Fianna Fáil Government. That may be so, but he suffers, if I may say so, from one serious intellectual defect, a defect perhaps characteristic of his enviable gift of youth, and that is a certain arrogance in his attitude towards anyone who has the misfortune to disagree with him.  Members of this Party are quite as capable of seeing political facts and drawing inferences from them as is the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I am sure that, as he grows older, he will come to realise that and will, by degrees, discard the arrogance of which I speak and which, while it may give him satisfaction for the moment, does detract considerably from his charm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every single one of the quotations which the Minister for Industry and Commerce read to us on the subject of Great Britain's trade relations with the various Dominions has been the subject of attention by my colleagues and myself. We have not by any means shirked the issue to which such quotations give rise.  Whereas, however, it seems to the Minister for Industry and Commerce that the British policy of tariff regulations and quotas is something that is necessarily fatal to our main agricultural export trade to Great Britain, it seems to us, on the contrary, that that orientation of British policy is something which can be of definite advantage to this country if we take the necessary steps to make it of advantage to this country.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce appears to neglect the fact that there are very considerable differences between our position and the position, say, of Australia or New Zealand, Southern Rhodesia or other distant parts of the British Dominions.  There is, in the first place, the element of distance, the geographical element, which is quite an important one. Aside from that, however, it has been a characteristic of Great Britain's trade <Col N="2562" /> relations with her various Dominions that she has always been receiving from them a far larger volume of goods than they have been willing to take from her.  Now, that does not apply to this country.  The strength of our position is that we are a magnificent market and always have been a magnificent market for the British manufacturer; that the British necessarily are anxious to retain that market, and that whatever we may do&mdash;and I am all in favour of doing a great deal&mdash;to start native industries in this country, we must still import a large quantity of goods from elsewhere.  For geographical reasons and for reasons of our own commercial interest the natural place to import them from is Great Britain.</P>
    <P>That being so, we have an enormous bargaining power.  Therefore, it seems to us that, Great Britain having abandoned a policy of free trade, which made it impossible for her to give any special advantages to the Irish producer in her market, it would, in the normal course, have been open to us to secure for ourselves in that market a far better position than we had ever held before.  We believe that, in spite of the opportunity that was thrown away at the Ottawa Conference, it is still open to us to do that when another Government comes into office or when the present Government sees the light.  We are frequently being accused by Ministers of having no other interest than to drive the Government on the rocks.  Our real interest is to save the country from being driven on the rocks, and we are only anxious to drive the Government on the rocks in so far as that might contribute towards saving the country from being driven on the rocks.  If the Government would adopt a commonsense policy and take advantage of the opportunities that have been created by the economic situation in Great Britain we would be very far from offering any factious opposition in connection with that.</P>
    <P>As regards the question of unemployment, I do not doubt the sincerity of the Government's desires to make as much impression as they can on the unemployment problem in this <Col N="2563" /> country.  Surely, however, it is very remarkable that, in spite of all the money they have spent and all the efforts they have made, they have succeeded in making so very little impression on it.  The truth of the matter is that expenditure of public money, and especially the expenditure of public money on public works, goes a terribly short way towards making any real impression on unemployment.  What does make an impression on unemployment is the natural and normal development of industry in a country where confidence and courage prevail.  It is just that that has made so big an impression on unemployment in Great Britain.  Expenditure on relief of unemployment was greater a few years ago in Great Britain than it is to-day, and yet the unemployment problem kept getting worse and worse, and it is only because, under a Government which balanced its Budget, confidence revived and people put their heart and their money into making the wheels of industry go round, that a very considerable reduction has been made in the number of unemployed in Great Britain.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce speaks to-day of what can be accomplished by way of new industries towards reducing unemployment.  He speaks of that in a very different tone from the tone in which Ministers were accustomed to speak of it at election times.  We are all able to remember when we used to be assured that the conquest of unemployment was a relatively easy matter and that it was only because of the extraordinary denseness of the old Cumann na nGaedheal Government and their lethargy in the matter of starting new industries that it had not been conquered long ago. I was not present to hear Deputy Norton, but I understood, from the Minister's remark, that Deputy Norton expressed the view that new industries never could conquer entirely the problem of unemployment here.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce was not prepared to go so far as that, but at any rate he did feel obliged to speak in a very hesitant tone as to the <Col N="2564" /> extent to which new industries could take care of the unemployment question. Now, I am sure that new industries can do something.  I think that, up to the present, they have done very little, because whatever employment the Government have been able to create by fostering new industries, they have balanced it by the amount of unemployment they have created in destroying an old industry and in destroying our main industry.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce speaks of agricultural expenditure being high.  If so, the reason is simple enough.  It is a reason to which the Minister himself alluded&mdash;the amount of Government money that in one shape or form or another has been distributed to the poorer members of the agricultural community which, no doubt, has tended to keep up the general volume of agricultural buying.  But, unless the Minister is deliberately shutting his eyes to the facts, he must know that there are countless farmers throughout the country who, during the last two years, have had their life's savings swept away.  We have all been in touch with such men; men who have worked hard all their lives and, perhaps, succeeded in scraping together a few hundred or a thousand pounds and they now, as the result of the last two years, find that they are back again at scratch and that their children will have to start in as poor circumstances, or in poorer circumstances, than those in which they themselves started.</P>
    <P>The fundamental factor of the unemployment situation is the same as that which is the fundamental factor in almost all our difficulties in the present time and that is the decline of agriculture; the impossibility of a farmer making profits out of farming; the fact that only by Government assistance in its various forms is any farmer to-day able to keep his head above water.  If the Labour Party are zealous, as I am sure they are zealous, to reduce the misery that exists in this country to-day as the result of unemployment, they cannot possibly do better than to co-operate with us in striving to bring the Government to a sense of realities <Col N="2565" /> and to effect a settlement of the financial dispute between ourselves and the British Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy MacDermot has tried to show that the quota system, instead of being a disadvantage to us in disposing of our agricultural produce, will be a distinct advantage. That is a rather peculiar way of reasoning.  I wonder how he arrived at that conclusion.  He told us about our bargaining power.  New Zealand, which undoubtedly has a bargaining power, put up an offer to Great Britain to allow her imports into New Zealand free, or nearly free, if she were given an increased quota for her exports to Great Britain, but that offer was refused.  Doubtless, the great love that Great Britain has for the Party opposite, greater than the love she has for her colonists in New Zealand, would induce Great Britain to strike a far better bargain with the Party opposite than with the people of New Zealand.  They would be prepared to do for Deputy MacDermot and his colleagues what they would not do for New Zealand.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am answering it.  I should like to know what service Deputy MacDermot considers his Party has rendered to Great Britain greater than the service which Great Britain's colonists in New Zealand have rendered to her that the British Government would be prepared to give concessions to Deputy MacDermot's <Col N="2566" /> Party greater than they would give even to their colonists in New Zealand. What is the price?  Let us have it. We have had the same old simulation from Deputy Alfred Byrne here to-day that we usually associate with his speeches.  He declared solemnly that he was not a member of any political Party and at the same time he solemnly expressed the hope that Deputy Cosgrave would come back as President.  Some time ago I happened to look up some past history which shows what those people are prepared to do when political force compels them to give another twist.  I have here the Dáil Debates for 20th April, 1926, volume 15, column 824, and I find the following discussion:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Mr. A. Byrne: I will detain the House only a few minutes.  I desire to add a few words to what has been stated by Deputy Norton regarding ex-soldiers.  Recently I drew the attention of the Minister for Industry and Commerce to a number of cases where young men joined the National Army a couple of years ago and, when joining, they were in insurable occupations.  In many cases they had 20, 40 and in one case up to 84 stamps to their credit.  In the course of the big demobilisation which has recently taken place&mdash;men being demobilised on an average of 30 to 40 a day&mdash;these young men were put out of the Army without their cards being stamped.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The President: There was nobody put out of the Army and that statement is false.  The statement is either true or false.  It is false to say that men were put out of the Army to the extent of 30 to 40 a day.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I do not want to go further into that matter.  I will merely wind up by saying that Deputy Byrne's statement that he was anxious to have Deputy Cosgrave back and his statement in this report that Deputy Cosgrave was low enough for anything seems somewhat to conflict.  I am sorry that Deputy MacDermot has cleared out, because we might have got from him the price which his Party were prepared to pay to Britain or what the services are which, in their opinion, they are rendering to Britain, which would induce Britain to give them a better bargain than she would give to her own colonies.  I should like to hear that from Deputy MacDermot or from some of those who support him.  He said that we were destroying employment in agriculture. I know that agriculturists, and farmers generally, are going through a fairly tough time.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I have always realised it and I realise that if the policy of Deputy Bennett and his associates had been carried on during the past three years they would have gone through a tougher time still.  If the Deputy or those with him can show us how they increased employment in agriculture during their period in office, there might be something in his reasoning. I have not seen it.  Undoubtedly, our policy will improve employment in agriculture.  Employment will be given in the dividing up of the land and in the fencing in of those ranches after we have divided them up and in building houses and out-offices for landless men who will then have some piece of Ireland's ground to till and from which to provide a living for their families. In Westmeath, when I was down there during a by-election, I saw 980 acres <Col N="2569" /> of the finest land in this country run over by a man and a dog.  That was the happy condition of employment afforded by the Cumann na nGaedheal Government when they were in office. That is the way they were promoting employment.  They were certainly promoting employment for the dogs in rounding up the bullocks.  When we have finished dividing up that ranch, it will give employment to 18 or 20 families, together with all the employment that will be given in rebuilding the ditches that were razed by the British during the last 40 or 50 years, according as each patch was brought, not under the plough, but under the bullock.</P>
      <P>Let us take the system of tillage. We have now got back in this country to the wheat production that we had during the war years of 1917 and 1918. I would say that there is as much wheat grown in the country this year as we grew in 1918 and in ploughing that, preparing the soil for it and the tilling and threshing of it, together with the work in the mills, employment will be given.  I do not think that even Deputy Bennett would argue that the 960 acres with the man, the bullock and the dog will give as much employment as will be given by a pair of horses and a plough.</P>

That is the argument I am refuting.  If, instead of conjuring up lies to tell the people at the crossroads on the following Sunday or the yarns they will spin to the next Blue Shirt demonstration, Deputies will study the statistics down there, they will learn a little.  Deputy Bennett will learn a lot about calves if he goes down there.</P>

      <P>If you did, you would not be talking this way with your tongue in your cheek.  It is rather amusing to hear the Party opposite speaking about what they did to provide employment on the land during their period of office.  The farmers down in my constituency were always more or less engaged in tillage.  They believed in the plough and in tilling the land.  What was the result?  The Deputies opposite told us that our grain was worth the world's price and they told us to go and compete with the rancher in Canada, and if we grew wheat in this country as cheaply as the Canadian rancher can grow it, we would get a market for it, but that if we did not, we had no business growing it at all.</P>

      <P>They drove the agricultural labourers off the land during the ten years they were in office.  They drove every one of them off the land. We had them leaning over the fences looking at the bullocks fattening under the policy of the Minister for Grass.  That system is now changed. I know that on account of my increased tillage activities on my farm of land I had to employ three extra men, and I will be able to give them permanent employment.  Even our policy in that direction is bearing good fruit.  I can see around my district Cumann na nGaedheal farmers who sacked their men under the orders of Cumann na nGaedheal, immediately after the last general election, now running after them and getting them back.  I admit that during a period of four or five months after the last general election we had a certain amount of unemployment in agricultural districts where you had this policy: &ldquo;What way are you voting? You are not going to be employed by me if you do not vote right.&rdquo;  We have the very same kind of policy being worked out to-day: &ldquo;If you are going to work on my farm you must wear a blue shirt.&rdquo; We have that policy, and we know it. We are taking steps to deal with that particular class of gentleman&mdash;the gentleman who sacked his labourers. Fancy a farmer with 150 acres sacking two or three men and turning them out on the side of the road, while at the same time being able to keep a motor car, paying the licence, and paying for petrol, to drive him around to the Blue Shirt meetings.</P>

They are the men who come up here and talk about unemployment.  I know very well we are finding difficulties in regard to industrial enterprise.  Why?  Because we have the very same thing there. We have Deputies on the opposite benches striving to the utmost of their power to create a position of unrest in this country; endeavouring to get people to believe that the country is in such a state of unrest that it is not safe to invest their money here. Deputies should at least mind themselves when they are making those wild statements through the country. Of course we have General O'Duffy's cure for all that.  He is going to conscript the whole hang lot and drive them into my patch to-day and another patch to-morrow, all in blue shirts. We will see them turned out on the fields to work, driven, I suppose, into the cow-houses every night and stalled in with the cows.</P>

I have compared the manner in which unemployment relief money was spent during the time Deputies opposite were in office and the manner in which it is spent now.  I must say there has been a great improvement.  Far more employment has been given out of far less money.  Down in my constituency one grant of £250, which was given about a year and a half ago, if I am not mistaken, has provided constant employment for 37 men ever since.  In about a fortnight's time, when machinery has been installed, it will give employment to at least 30 more; that is 60 men getting permanent employment out of a £250 relief grant.  Beat that!  I should like to hear any of you tell us that the payment of 29/- a week was working out all right with you.</P>

      <P>I will give them to the House.  There are four other Deputies here from my constituency, and I challenge them to contradict me.  I will give the facts of the case.  Down in a place called Cloyne in East Cork there is a mineral deposit.  It was discovered some years ago, and appeals were made to the Cumann na nGaedheal Government practically every year for a grant towards development of that mineral deposit. I hold at present I think about nine letters from Government Departments refusing to give any grant towards the development of that mineral deposit. I will produce them here in the House on some occasion and read them for the edification of Deputies opposite. I made an appeal that some of the relief money be put into the development of that deposit.  We got a grant of £250 from the Parliamentary Secretary here, who went down to inspect the work.  It proved successful.  One hundred thousand tons of deposit of clay were found.  Every penny of that £250 was spent on labour in the first instance.  The arrangement was, &ldquo;If we give you a grant of £250 it will all be spent on labour and you will have to put up an equivalent amount yourselves,&rdquo; with the result that there was £500 spent on labour in the first instance.  A company was formed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but out of money subscribed by people who have faith in Irish industry, which you never had. People were found with enough faith in that industry to put £7,000 of their own money into the development of it. It was developed and at present over 30 men are employed.  Those men have been working in that mine during the past 12 months.  A short time ago it <Col N="2574" /> was decided to put up a factory beside that mine, for the purpose of preparing the stuff and sending out the finished article.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>When that factory is finished&mdash;it is practically finished now, and the machinery is going into it&mdash; it will give employment to 30 more. That makes 60 men who have found permanent employment out of £250. The Cumann na nGaedheal Government could have done that at any time during the five years prior to their going out of office, and they would not do it.  They did not want that kind of thing.  They did not want industries in this country developed, because that might interfere with their bargaining power across the water.  It might interfere with the market for bullocks. That is only one instance of the manner in which that money could be used, and one instance of the manner in which we have relieved unemployment. I will give other instances along the line.  One of the factories down there used to give employment to about 19 or 20</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan brought in a tariff here that wiped that out.  He put a 25 per cent. tariff on the raw material and a 20 per cent. tariff on the finished article.  It closed down three months before Cumann na nGaedheal left office.  That factory is giving employment to 80 hands, and another factory on the same lines started about six months ago is giving employment to about 70 hands.  Those are definite instances in which unemployment has been relieved, not temporarily, but by giving permanent employment.  We had also an old shovel mills lying idle there for several years.  The roof was gone.  It was one of the monuments to the ability of Deputy McGilligan to look after the interests of the country.  That monument was there for ten years.  An individual who had faith in Irish enterprise got those mills going.  Deputy Anthony knows the place&mdash;Templemichael. <Col N="2575" /> At present the shovel factory is giving employment to about 20 hands.  The person concerned has got a loan from the Industrial Credit Corporation with which he is purchasing machinery which will enable him to make all the forks required in this country&mdash;both hay forks and manure forks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SydneyBMinch" hpid="Mr. Minch Mr. Minch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Minch</NameTxt>
      <P>How much is the loan?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is £1,700.  In respect of that, he will, of course, pay interest and principal.  Within the next 12 months I hope to be able to stand up in this House and say that that factory is giving employment to  men.  There is nothing to stop that man from going on and giving employment to 150 or 200 hands.  He knows that Fianna Fáil has come to stay. He knows that he has a safe investment in Irish industry.  He knows that he can go ahead and that he will always have a Government prepared to stand by his industry and give him a chance.  That is the manner in which unemployment can be relieved. If Deputy MacDermot would only dig down into his money bag and start some little industry that would give employment he would do a lot better work than coming up here and talking about these men being out of employment.  Have a little faith in the country in which you are living.  If I had any money left after the raids made on my unfortunate pockets for the last ten or twelve years by Deputy Cosgrave and his hirelings, I would invest myself&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I have dealt with two industries in my constituency.  I can <Col N="2576" /> go a step further.  At the time we came into office, two flour mills had notified that they were about to close down.  Another mill had closed down three years before that.  These three mills are working now and are giving employment to 150 and 200 men, as compared with 27 and 30 men, respectively, before we came into office. That is the way to give employment and get industries going instead of the mess-up that was going on for a number of years.  I am prepared to admit that we have not solved the problem of unemployment.  The principal reason we have not solved it is the definite move made by the Opposition during the past 12 months to create a state of unrest, to foster the idea that Fianna Fáil will go out and that there will be no further protection for industry.  They say: &ldquo;You do not know what is going to happen in this country.  Look at the Blue Shirts and the I.R.A.  You are going to have another war.&rdquo;</P>

The attitude of Deputies opposite is causing unrest and is giving rise to a feeling that is preventing our industrial programme from going through as quickly as we should wish.  I have repeatedly had to explain to people, definitely and clearly, that there was no fear at all that these gentlemen who are only seeking by hook or by crook to get back would ever be returned.  I was asked these questions only a fortnight ago by a man who was interested in the starting of a tanning industry.  He would give employment at the start to 60 men and, ultimately, to 200.  He was an Englishman.  He was in Ireland a year and a half ago and he would have started work then but that he was told that President de Valera would be knocked out before the last election.  That Englishman came back three weeks ago to start an industry here and give employment because he knew very well that there was no fear of the people ever being lunatics enough to return the old gang again.</P>

The bald-headed youths do not want the ordinary youths to have any voice in affairs.  The League of Youth Movement, which is controlled by bald heads, blue shirts, and long beards, does not want to give any of the ordinary youths an opportunity of judging their actions.  Deputies on the opposite benches cannot deny that if we had the same franchise for local elections as we have for general elections, we would have a pretty fair test.

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I have given one instance of the faith that has been shown in the future of industry.  A continuance of protection is the only hope for industry here.  If industry flops, no bargain made by Deputy MacDermot, with bullocks as a bargaining power, will avail.  I am sure if the man who has established a tannery had a chat with Deputy MacDermot the Deputy might be able to ease his mind by saying whether the little tannery was to be included in the bargain and whether imports of leather were to be set off against the bargain made on behalf of the bullocks.  Perhaps the man who established a shovel, spade and fork industry in Templemichael could be told if his little factory was to be scrapped, as well as the tannery, in order to provide a market for the bullocks.  Undoubtedly these things are causing a certain amount of unrest.  That is why I am asking <Col N="2579" /> Deputy MacDermot to be more explicit than he was in the statement he made that the quota system was going to give him a better advantage, instead of being a hindrance to the export of cattle to Great Britain.  He hinted about the amount of stuff that we were to bring in and the bargain that he would make.  We want to know the extent to which Deputy MacDermot was prepared to go in the bargain.  Industrialists and labourers, who are unemployed and for whom we are endeavouring to find employment by starting industries here, would like to know the extent to which Deputy MacDermot is going to sacrifice their interests for the sake of a 980-acre Westmeath farmer who keeps bullocks, one man and a dog.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy would like an answer to that question, I would be prepared to accept approximately the same quantity of goods from Great Britain that Great Britain would be prepared to accept from us.  That seems to me to be fair enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid the Deputy has given rather a twist to the answer. If we had, for instance, 20,000 more bullocks than we have room for English imports, what would be the position? Is Deputy MacDermot prepared to say to those in the leather trade, or to those connected with the shovel factory, that they will have to close down?  Is he prepared to tell the flour millers that they will have to import English flour, because we have 20,000 bullocks that we want to get an export market for?  As these things are troubling people's minds we would like to hear Deputy MacDermot's views on them.  What better bargain is Deputy MacDermot prepared to make?  What shot has he in the locker?  What service has the United Ireland Party rendered to Britain that places it on a higher plane than Britain's own Colonies, within the Empire?  Is Deputy MacDermot going to advocate the re-establishment of the United Kingdom, as part of the bargain?  Is that what he is driving at?  Can he deliver the goods, if he is prepared to <Col N="2580" /> do so?  Undoubtedly we can provide far more employment in this country. We are doing so.  One thing I am glad of is, that no man is going to be allowed to die of starvation here.</P>

Deputies are not going to get away with the game they played down the country for 12 months, having regard to the manner in which unemployment was created, and then to come back here and talk about people being unemployed. Why are they unemployed? Why have we to provide for unemployment here?  Is it not due to their actions?  Should they not realise that, and should they not be patriotic enough, even now, to come along and to endeavour to assist in, instead of hindering, the giving of employment?</P>

      <P>I am speaking with definite knowledge. I know that in my parish there is one man who has 230 acres of land. He sacked two of his men; this man keeps his motor car in which he drives to every Blue Shirt meeting within 70 miles.  He can afford to pay for petrol but he could not afford to pay the few shillings a week he was paying to his unfortunate labourers.  We have that kind of thing going on.  Then we hear from others the cry &ldquo;whatever man works for me must wear a blue shirt.&rdquo; The sooner Deputies opposite try to change that thing the better.  We have a definite attempt made by a leader of the so-called farmers to wreck one of the biggest industries in the south, the beet sugar industry in Mallow.  This is the creature who sold his farm in County Cork and now farms the farmers for a living, a gentleman whom a Deputy on the opposite benches told a month ago was only a diningroom farmer.</P>

      <P>The Deputy had better not draw me into that.  We have that kind of policy from a leader and a member of the Executive of the U.I.P. getting up in any county and endeavouring to spike an industry that was giving employment to a couple of hundred men and, at the same time, providing an assured market to the farmers of the country.  That is the kind of policy that is going to do harm to the country, and it is doing it at present.  It is an outrageous proceeding. Then we have representatives <Col N="2582" /> coming in here talking about unemployment on the land caused by the policy of the present Government. That was Deputy MacDermot's speech, that unemployment on the land was caused by the policy of the present Government.  We have one of the leaders of that Party getting up in Cork and telling the farmers that they are not to grow beet because he was not quite satisfied with the colour of the shirts that were worn by the employees of the beet factory at Mallow. It is time that sort of game ended.  Deputies who come in here talking about unemployment would do far better service to the country if they went down to the <i>buckshee</i> leaders and gave them some kind of advice so as to try to instil some sense of responsibility into them and not carry on in the way they have been carrying on. That way is not fair and just and it will not help in providing employment. I do not wish to take up the time of the House.</P>

      <P>I have put the case before you.  Unfortunately we have an unemployment problem and we have, undoubtedly, gone a long part of the way towards solving that problem.  We could go the whole way towards solving it if Deputies opposite would give a little assistance instead of playing the game they are playing.  On the one hand they say to their followers: &ldquo;Create unemployment; you can call it unrest.  You can disturb the country as much as you can and then we can all get up here and talk about unemployment.  They will employ 200 to 300 people in Mallow at the beet factory, but you can go down and spike that.&rdquo; Do Deputies opposite think we are blind?  We have seen that game worked out time and again.  Are Deputies opposite going to accept any kind of responsibility for the action of their followers down the country?  Are they prepared to stand over the actions of those men?  Is Deputy MacDermot prepared to defend the attitude of the man who endeavours to prevent the farmers of County Cork growing beet?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>The thing is outrageous and should be driven into the heads of Deputy MacDermot and other Deputies like him who after all pretend to have some sense of responsibility.  The sooner and the oftener this thing is driven home to them the better.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We are not going to grow beet in Cork County because we do not like the colour of the shirts worn by the men in the beet factory; there are not enough Blue Shirts in the factory to satisfy us.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>And then they talk about fair play in employment and the challenge that unless 100 men out of their organisation are employed in the factory they will order their people not to grow beet.  That is what Mr. E.J. Cussen, the leader of the Party in Cork County, tells us.  These were the orders sent by Mr. Cussen to the manager of the Mallow Beet Factory.  Then they come in here and talk about unemployment.</P>
      <P>I am very glad anyway that we have provided unemployment assistance because those old lads who came along and cut down the 5/- a week they pay their men to 2/6 a week will not get them now for 2/6.  They will have to come up a bit in the wages.  We have definitely decided that no man is to be allowed die of starvation in this country.  If Deputies opposite would cease their antics and try to give a bit of assistance in tackling the unemployment problem they would be doing better work than they are doing.  If they had co-operated we would have no unemployment and we could settle the problem.  I make a special appeal to Deputy MacDermot.  If he goes over into the Department of Industry and Commerce and has a chat with the Minister for half an hour he would be shown the list of factories in his own constituency that he can start.  These will relieve unemployment and then let him dig into his handbag, pull out some of the dough he has there and invest it.</P>

      <P>I was beginning to <Col N="2584" /> wonder whether or not we were discussing the motion on the Order Paper relating to unemployment.  I do not intend to talk about blue shirts, or brown shirts or black shirts.  I intend to address myself as closely as possible to the motion before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Corry has said hear, hear.  I would suggest that the speech to which we have just listened has been directed more at members of the Opposition than to the motion on the Order Paper.  That motion on the Order Paper reads:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That in view of the continued widespread unemployment the Dáil instructs the Executive Council to make available forthwith sufficient money to permit of the carrying out of large scale schemes of public works, so as to relieve the distress caused by unemployment.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>We heard, during the course of the debate, a tirade against Blue Shirts, and against Deputy MacDermot; we have heard abuse of Deputy Bennett. I am at a loss to know whether Deputy Corry was supporting this motion or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad the Government saw fit to devote an hour or an hour-and-a-half to discussing this important motion.  Perhaps the reason is the urge that was given during the week by Deputy Morrissey.  I shall now proceed to deal with the motion without further comment on what previous speakers thought fit to say on the matter.  When we read in the Press speeches made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, in which he talks of the progress made in industry by the way of the establishment of new factories, and the creating of employment and also listening to the speeches that we heard to-day from the Government Benches, one would imagine that we were living in Paradise, and that there was no such thing as unemployment in the country.  On the other hand, we find the figures for unemployment are going up, not relying on statements made by the man in the street, <Col N="2585" /> or on statements made by the enemies of the Government, or on statements made by private Deputies in this House, but on statements which emanate from the Minister's own Department and which give the lie absolutely to the statements made in the country.  We are told one day that unemployment is decreasing.  On the following day, in the Press, we read that there is an increase in unemployment according to the latest figures available in the Department of Industry and Commerce.  Which of these statements are we to believe? Are we to believe the verbal statements made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce in that connection or are we to accept the increased figures of unemployment from official sources in his own Department?  That is one of the questions I would like the Minister to deal with when he again takes part in this debate.  We had the figure quoted in the House some time ago, to which publicity was given, that there was something like 88,000 people unemployed.  Surely after that we were surprised to hear that the official figure was something over the 100,000 mark.  I would like some enlightenment upon that aspect of the case.  Personally, I do not express any surprise at the rising figures of unemployment in this country, because of the great amount of instability that exists.  That instability is not due to the things we are told about here, such as the growth of the Blue Shirt movement, or anything of that kind.  In my view the cause is far more serious than that.  The instability which has resulted in this country, and has of course as its corollary increased unemployment, must be sought for at the top.  That instability is brought about mainly by the wild statements made by Government spokesmen.  Reference has been made to cross-road speeches.  Did anyone ever hear such a cross-road speech made in this or any other Parliament as the one we heard a while ago here? These are the kind of unfounded statements that are made by Fianna Fáil spokesmen at cross-roads and it is these statements that have led to <Col N="2586" /> increased unemployment in the country.</P>
    <P>We had an example recently of the instability, the uncertainty and uneasiness that prevailed in the country, expressed in the failure of the last National Loan.  If any evidence were required there is abundant proof in that item alone to show that persons who have money to invest are slow to put it into national security when there is no sign of stability in those who are attempting to administer the affairs of the State. One of the disquieting things that occurred in the last few months in this country was the establishment of another army.  All this has been done to gratify the ambition of the Minister for Defence who has long-ambitioned to have a private army of his very own.  Now he has got it at considerable expense to the country. Money which could be devoted to constructive efforts and works of economic value to the country, which would go a long way to help at least in the solution of this unemployment problem, is to be spent on this army. I do not pretend for one moment&mdash;I would not be dishonest enough to pretend&mdash;that unemployment is confined to this country.  We all know that it is a world problem and not merely an Irish problem.  We all know that great and strained and sustained efforts are made in every country to attempt to alleviate this problem, but so far only with partial success.  The President speaking in this House on the 2nd April, 1932, as reported in volume 41, column 905, of the official Debates, on a motion which dealt with the immediate needs of the unemployed and which was put down in the names of Deputy Morrissey and myself said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Looking around the world, and trying to understand what were the causes of unemployment in different countries, I came to the conclusion that there was less reason for unemployment in this country than in any country of which I know.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the President's own statement. I am not going to pin him to every <Col N="2587" /> word and comma of that statement, but let us take that statement in the way the English language is usually understood and emerging from that statement is the fact, at any rate, that the President believes that the problem of unemployment would be more easily solved in this country <Col N="2588" /> than in any other country of which he knows.  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned to Wednesday, 2nd May, 1934.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 2 p.m. until Tuesday, 1st May, at 3 p.m.</P>
