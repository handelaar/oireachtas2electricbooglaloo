      <P>asked the Minister for Justice whether he is aware that a farmer in County Waterford has had his cattle seized on two occasions in satisfaction of rates and succession duty although prior to the second sale he had made a declaration on oath that he was not in a position financially to meet the demands which were being made upon him; that the declaration referred to was transmitted to the Executive Council before the sale took place and that the declaration was made in consequence of a statement which the President is reported to have made at Clonmel to the effect that stock would not be seized from a person who was unable to meet his liabilities, and if the statement reported to have been made at Clonmel may be taken as representing the considered policy of the Government in such cases.</P>

      <P>If I have correctly identified the case to which the Deputy refers, the defaulter is a gentleman who succeeded a few years ago to a large holding, under the will of a relative, and took, under the same will, other valuable benefits, including a cash legacy of £400.  Within three years of this event, he made default as regards an instalment of succession duty amounting to about £9, and subsequently he defaulted in the payment of his rates.  I understand that after the court proceedings were over and when the warrants were in the hands of the under-sheriff for execution, and <Col N="1230" /> had been partly executed, he lodged some such declaration of inability to pay as is referred to in the question.</P>
      <P>A large proportion of the proceeds of sale of the first seizure made in this case went to pay expenses of maintenance and removal which were incurred solely as a result of the determined attempts made by the defaulter or his friends to obstruct the court officer in the course of his duty.</P>
      <P>So far as I am aware of the facts, the case is not one in which the defaulter deserves any sympathy. More generally, the Deputy will, I am sure, realise that it is not reasonable to expect the Executive Council to decide as to the merits of individual cases of this kind, or to interfere with the execution of court processes, and that any appeals for time in such cases should be addressed, before the matter reaches the hands of the under-sheriff, to the Department or other authority, to whom the debt is due.</P>

      <P>I should like to deal with the points raised by Deputies last evening on the Gaeltacht Estimates, and to deal as fully as possible with the various matters brought forward.  Deputy Dockrell contributed some quite interesting suggestions, and asked very pertinent and relevant questions.  As he referred to specific matters within the Estimates, I would like to deal with these in detail, in so far as it is possible to do so.  One of the Deputy's main queries was with regard to the stocks held in the depôt, and in the rural industries generally.  The position with regard to stock is that we have quite a considerable amount of merchandise in the depôt which was the work of the early beginners, who were being trained in these industries.  It has to be remembered that we have altogether 49 industrial centres throughout the country. Last year, particularly, we concentrated upon training some of these workers.  Over 300 of them were trained.  But business men will appreciate the fact that in the early stages of training one does not get the quality of merchandise that will always find a ready market.  We might claim <Col N="1235" /> to have a residue of stocks which have accumulated since the depôt was opened.  That is particularly so with regard to hand-knit goods which were made in the various centres.  There was also a moderate increase of stock in connection with certain new industries contemplated, but some of which it was found that it was hardly practicable to carry through.  However, we reduced the stock as rapidly as we could, and kept it more in conformity with the volume of turnover.  I might point out that in many respects a considerable amount of the stock is hanging over for the last two or three years. A great deal of it has been distributed and disposed of, but it is also the case that we have to continue to carry reasonable stocks so that we will be in a position to send raw materials to various depôts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy also raised a question with regard to the method of distribution of our goods, and judging from what he said, he was under the impression that we were doing a certain amount of direct distribution, so that it might be inferred we were selling to retail purchasers.  He suggested that we should follow the ordinary trade channels.  The fact of the matter is that we are following the methods of the ordinary distributing trades. We sell to the wholesale and to the retail distributing trades but in no case do we sell direct to the individual customer.  The Deputy, and also Deputy McGilligan, asked how the situation really stood as regards competition. They wanted to know if we were facing competition from machine-made goods, mass-produced goods, and so on.  That is, in fact, one of our greatest handicaps.  Machine-produced goods are competing, of course, successfully with hand craft goods.  One of the problems that is causing me considerable trouble is to find in the production of a lot of the goods operated through the different centres, how we can continue to produce hand craft goods to compete with the machine-produced articles.  It is particularly difficult to face that problem, because of the relative amount of raw <Col N="1236" /> material that has to be imported.  At least, a great deal of it has to be imported. When one works it out to find exactly how much goes to the actual producer of the goods the question arises: Is the industry worth while? For instance, if we take an article that is produced at 2/-, and if we find that 40 per cent. or 50 per cent. of the material required has to be imported, and that the ultimate result to the worker represents only ten or 15 per cent. of the actual cost of the article, then one has to sit down to consider whether that industry is worth while. That, I may say, is one of the worst problems we have to consider with regard to Gaeltacht produced goods.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan referred to that matter also and to mass production goods.  In fact, Deputy Dockrell and Deputy McGilligan more or less covered the same ground.  They did put their finger on the obvious vulnerable points in regard to the industries as administered by the Rural Industries Depôt.  We do not propose, however, to abandon such industries as we have got unless we are convinced, firstly, that they are not doing good to the extent that the expense involved justifies.  We have to remember that, however ill-conceived some of these projects were, they are in existence and it would be a serious step to make a break.  Deputy Bartley raised a question with regard to possible conflict or overlapping between the Land Commission and the Housing Authority in regard to Gaeltacht housing.  I think I can assure the Deputy with safety that there is no such overlapping and that the Gaeltacht housing officials in all cases are in touch with the Land Commission before any definite decision with regard to Gaeltacht housing is put over.  Deputy Donnchadha O Briain referred to the fact that rural industries as existing to-day were not enough.  I think we are all agreed on that.  He made some reference to the necessity of having Irish speaking officials in the Gaeltacht.  So far as I am aware, all our officials operating in the Gaeltacht through the Gaeltacht Department are Irish-speaking and if the Deputy knows anything <Col N="1237" /> to the contrary I should be very glad indeed if he will bring it to my attention.</P>
    <P>Deputy McMenamin mentioned a few matters, some of which were, and are still, a little obscure.  There were a few specific matters he brought forward. He mentioned the case of one man for whom a housing grant had been sanctioned in 1931, and he said that this grant had not yet been paid. I have made inquiries and I have been informed that no payment is withheld if the applicant proceeds with the work to the satisfaction of the surveyor.  The only explanation that can be given is that the person referred to did not comply with the obligations imposed on him.  It has to be remembered that when these grants are approved a certain amount of work has to be undertaken. We pay according to the work that has been done and on the surveyor's report of what has been done. We go further than that.  We have a system whereby those who are going to build are assured of being charged the lowest price on a contract basis, contracts having been fixed by the Department in open competition.  We are always ready to&mdash;in fact, we in all cases do&mdash;give a guarantee to the local supplier covering him for such specific goods as he may supply for the building operations that have been approved.  I do not think there is anything in Deputy McMenamin's statement.  If he has a specific case and supplies all particulars as regards the name and location of this individual we shall further investigate it.</P>
    <P>Deputy McMenamin also referred to the question of stock raised by Deputy Dockrell and Deputy McGilligan.  The position at the moment really is that we are trying to get advance orders for practically all the goods that are going to be made.  That can only be done within certain limits.  We are trying to estimate the demand and trying to have our orders in the book for advance deliveries.  I have explained that we have had to carry extra stock owing to the fact that a training period had to be allowed for the women folk who were engaged and whom it was necessary to train, and also to the fact that a considerable residue of <Col N="1238" /> stock that these trainees had produced in their early inexperienced days was not first quality goods and could not be sold as such.  I think it was Deputy McMenamin raised a question with regard to our designs.  He mentioned some specific case with regard to the depôt.  All I can say is, from what I have seen and from what has taken place, the designer is doing good work. That is more or less borne out by the fact that at the Spring Show this year the designs got the only silver medal that was awarded for the type of goods. Moreover, we find that some of our designs have been copied by a large manufacturer in the Galashiels area.</P>
    <P>Deputy McMenamin also referred, on behalf of Deputy Dillon, to the position in Annagry and Crolly.  That brings up the question of the possibility of establishing factories in the Gaeltacht areas.  I have been personally interested in trying to get these factories going.  I have at the moment a friend who is keen on getting operations going in the Gaeltacht, but I doubt very much if he will decide to do so.  The difficulties of transport, the distance from a port, the lack of facilities for getting emergency supplies&mdash;all these factors count far more than the cost of labour to the individual manufacturer.  That is why I stressed here last night that a great many other operations will have to be visualised for the future in the Gaeltacht and why I do not think rural industries, as we know them, will in any measure meet the difficulties.</P>
    <P>I come now to the most important contribution to the debate here last night.  Deputy Lynch made a great many criticisms of the activities of our Department, and laid particular stress on the fact that the Estimates this year were lower than last year.  It seems to me that Deputy Lynch either overlooked or ignored the opening remarks in my statement where I indicated exactly the reductions that had taken place, and where, I think, I gave a reasonable explanation as to why these reductions took place.  They were, as I pointed out, superficial reductions. They were reductions in the book, because, as I pointed out, the actual amounts involved in the expenditure <Col N="1239" /> were very different indeed from what the Estimates had indicated in the previous years, and included two purposes for which Deputy Lynch himself, when Minister, was responsible.  To make the position clear, I would point out again, perhaps in more detail, that in 1931-32, when Deputy Lynch was Minister, the Estimate passed in the Dáil was £53,550, whereas the actual amount expended was £25,426, or less than half the amount indicated in the Estimate. Moreover, the Estimate contained an item of £40,000 for raw materials, and the actual expenditure was £14,116. The estimate for plant was £5,000, and the actual expenditure £1,583.  That will give an indication of the value of Deputy Lynch's estimates, and it is, to me, at all events, hardly playing the game either with the House or with the public.  The estimated sales of products in that Estimate were £30,000, whereas the actual sales amounted to £10,892, almost £20,000 less than estimated. In other words, the sales were the equivalent of about one-third of what had been estimated that year. The wages to the workers in that year, 1931-32, were £6,250.</P>
    <P>We find very much the same position in 1932-33, which Estimates, it must be remembered, were prepared before we came into office.  In that year, the raw material estimate was £25,000 and the actual expenditure was £14,404.  The estimated sales were £15,000 and the actual sales £22,969.  The actual amount of the Vote expended was £26,479, on a vote of £42,000.  In 1933-4 the actual amount of wages paid was £10,020.  The estimated sales were £22,000 and the actual sales £24,245, so we find that, although the Estimates may not have looked so rosy as when Deputy Lynch was in office, the actual result was considerably better and almost double, in fact, what it had been in his last year.  It has to be allowed of course, that it takes time, and I am not claiming for the Department or for myself any credit for the growth of sales.  That growth was natural.  What I want to bring out clearly here is the fact that the Estimates, as introduced formerly, bore no relation to the actual amounts expended.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1240" /> There has been criticism from Deputy Lynch and others, and I think a great deal of that criticism is justified.  I think, however, that criticism is justified, not against this year's estimates, but against the system that was laid down there, and the way in which the system was running, and the way in which it was still running, because I am not going to take the responsibility of making changes and cutting off industries here and there, unless I see my way to substitute something else for them.  Deputy Dockrell raised the question of the distribution of the wages and other expenses, and I have the figures here for the last three years. They are: in 1932, Donegal, £2,662 4s. 2d.; Mayo, £922 7s. 8d; Galway, £708 15s. 2d.; Kerry, £13; Cork, £5; and Sligo, £174.  Those are the amounts of wages paid in the different areas, for which the Deputy asked last evening.  The amounts for 1933 are: Donegal, £3,231; Mayo, £6,696; Galway, £1,598; Kerry, £140; Cork, £59; Cavan, £66 and Sligo, £212; and for 1934, Donegal, £3,902; Mayo, £3,205; Galway, £2,341; Kerry, £471; Cork, £214; Cavan, £110; and Sligo, £127, making a total of £10,373 3s. 9¼d. for 1934.  The total last year was £12,002 and, in 1932, £4,485.  The Deputy also wanted to know what were involved in the other expenses.  They are minor items such as commission to travellers, cash discounts, allowances, and sundry expenses.</P>
    <P>To come back to the main issue, the chief feature in this Gaeltacht Vote and the matter which is exercising the mind of the Government at the present time, and my own mind and the mind of the Department particularly, is in how far this Vote is justified by results.  When one considers the amount of administrative expenses, the amount of money spent on instructors, manageresses and so on, the amount of raw material which has to be imported or which has to be purchased from other areas within the country, and the net amount that goes to the workers, I think it would be very difficult indeed to justify the expenditure of this money were it not for the peculiar circumstances that exist in these areas.  I want to say here, however, that I feel <Col N="1241" /> that entirely different lines must be examined to see if we can get better results, as I am satisfied we can get better results, in other lines of activity. I instanced here last night the result of the turf scheme.  When we got the cooperation of the turf people, we were able to get rapid development there, and the result of that will be that £60,000 will go in actual cash for the turf which will be purchased in the Gaeltacht counties.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied from all I have seen and from all the analyses I have made that that would be worth a quarter of a million turnover in an ordinary rural industry and I am satisfied also that a co-ordinated service, where the Land Commission, Forestry, Turf and Industry and Commerce were operating together is the best arrangement and I hope to secure a service on that basis whereby we will have a whole-time official from each of these.  That explains more clearly what I have in mind with regard to the point raised by Deputy Lynch here last night.  He spoke of a committee that was in existence in his time and over which he presided which gave valuable service. He was referring to the interdepartmental committee for Gaeltacht Services.  I have also the cooperation and the assistance of the same committee.  There is no doubt about it&mdash;they are valuable servants and they give every attention and make every effort to co-operate with the Department and to do all they can in their respective Departments, but it has to be remembered that their activity as regards the Gaeltacht is limited to about three or four hours a month.  They can do certain things in their own Departments but what I feel is needed in respect of the Gaeltacht, and what I hope to get, is full-time people from these Departments so that the work of the Gaeltacht will be co-ordinated right back to these Departments themselves.  I feel that a great deal can be done by getting the Departments active.  It will perhaps only show superficially in the Estimate of the amount expended, but it will show value in real results, value that we are not getting at present from these rural industries and the like.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1242" /> Kelp and carrageen are, perhaps the two matters that caused Deputies most anxiety last evening.  I explained fairly fully the position with regard to kelp.  Deputy McGilligan raised a point as to whether it would be possible to subsidise the production of iodine here.  It would be possible to subsidise it, but it would not be wise.  The total use of iodine in the Saorstát at present would only absorb about 600 tons of kelp and that certainly would not justify either a subsidy or the actual production of iodine.  The world price of iodine, as I explained, has been cut.  I have gone more fully into the figures this morning and I find that the total cut amounts to 66? of what the former price was.  In other words, iodine at present is worth one-third of what it was&mdash;at least the price that is paid for kelp for iodine purposes has been cut by that amount.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go back into past history or seem to criticise unduly my predecessor in the Ministry, but the fact is that we have a hang-over of kelp at present from 1931 and that the position with regard to the sale of kelp in that period was far from satisfactory. I may have to ask the Deputy out of his good nature to come round and explain some of the things&mdash;not that there is anything wrong, but the method or the absence of method in dealing with this problem reflects very seriously on the Department.  I do not want to go into details here, but I would suggest that if he really did know what was going on in the Department then the position, certainly in 1931, was one which should have given him very considerable cause for anxiety.  It certainly has given me very considerable cause for anxiety. The position at present is that all of last year's crop is still in Galway and that some of the 1931 crop is not fully and finally cleared up yet.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to say any more in regard to that, but I would point out that that is the type of inheritance we have got from the Gaeltacht.  I am not afraid to stand over anything we do, but I am not prepared to bring in an estimate here asking for £75,000 for specific items when I know I am only going to spend £25,000.  If I feel it <Col N="1243" /> is necessary to have £250,000 for the Gaeltacht I will come and ask for it, and it will be a matter for Deputies whether they will give it or not.  But one thing I will not do and that is, come in here with an estimate which leads people to believe that one is doing a commercial or economic job which is not being done.  I want to make that perfectly clear.  That is exactly what has been happening.  I went to come pains in my opening remarks to indicate just what had been going on and the facts bear it out.</P>
    <P>With regard to carrageen, the position is that we are giving a better price for carrageen than was ever given.  Since the Department opened, the price given for carrageen has been better than it was at any time before. We are paying 2/6 for carrageen and the price prior to the opening of the carrageen development usually ran from 1/- to 1/3.  What is the reason then that we are not getting the carrageen? The reason is very simple. Other people are now competing with us for the purchase of it.  The local agents are buying it.  We have a certain standard and we are trying to insist on getting that standard maintained. We know that the result of the activity with regard to carrageen is that, first of all, it has improved the quality and, secondly, improved the price.  It has caused competition for what we are prepared to buy.  We were in a position to buy much more carrageen last year at the full price than was offered.  I presume that does not mean that the people were not interested in selling or that they destroyed it.  The market was there; we had the money to pay for it, and what we did not buy was bought by others. <Col N="1244" /> The net result was that the people did dispose of the carrageen.</P>
    <P>After all our main concern is to ensure that the improvement does exist for the people engaged in it. There is, therefore, nothing to be said with regard to any defect in the market for carrageen.  We would like to get more and we are struggling to get more, because we believe that, having started this business and having got it almost on to a &ldquo;50-50 break&rdquo; we ought to continue it.  Actually the facts disclosed bear out that the position with reference to carrageen has not worsened in the last year or two.  In 1931-32 the amount of carrageen sold was £3,098.  In 1932-33 the amount sold was £6,827.  In 1933-34 the amount was £6,445, so I think that quite a steady market has been maintained.  We are in a position to buy more; we were in a position to buy more and we are still in that position.</P>
    <P>Several Deputies raised the question of fisheries.  I am reasonably satisfied that by the transfer to the Department of Agriculture fisheries will not suffer. After all, the activities of my Department are fairly far flung and we have forestry now instead of fisheries.  I think it is reasonable to suppose that the work will go on as usual, if not better than usual.</P>
    <P>I think I have covered all the points raised, but if there are any other points that may have escaped my attention, and I do not think there are, we can examine the Official Reports and communicate with the Deputies who raised them.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Attorney-General</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;  This Bill is the result of the recognition by members of all Parties of the necessity for strengthening the law dealing with sexual offences, particularly with regard to offences against young girls.  It has to be admitted that there has been an increase of offences against young girls in recent years in this country.  This increase may be attributed, with a considerable show of reason, to the altered conditions of modern life, with its greatly enlarged opportunities for amusement and enjoyment, and the mingling of the sexes without that supervision which obtained in former days.  It may also be said to be due in part to the relaxation of parental control.  Whatever be the causes it is clear this Bill is necessary. The Bill marks a great step in advance in the law for the protection of young girls.  It is drastic in its provisions.  The ground for the measure was cleared by the Carrigan Committee.  The report of the Committee has been of great help in estimating the problem which had to be dealt with.  We have also had in the framing of this measure the help of a Committee of members of this House, representative of all Parties. <Col N="1247" /> The desire of the framers of the measure has been to produce a workable measure adequate, in so far as legislation can be adequate, to deal with an unhealthy condition of things.</P>
      <P>In considering the measure, I ask members to realise that those who are responsible for framing its provisions approached their task with a grave sense of their responsibility.  The Bill, in its main provisions, goes as far as it is reasonable that legislation should go in dealing with the conditions at which it is aimed.  It is, I think, generally admitted that the real cure for the ills which make this Bill necessary lies with parents and those charged with the care and upbringing of young persons. That such a measure should be introduced at all, should be, if such is necessary, a warning signal to all thinking persons, and in particular to parents.</P>
      <P>The Bill proposes an increase in what is called the age of consent in respect of carnal knowledge or attempted carnal knowledge.  This increase is from 16 to 17 years.  The maximum punishment for unlawful carnal knowledge of a girl under 15 is made the same as was provided in the case of this offence against a girl under 13, namely, penal servitude for life. The maximum punishment for attempted carnal knowledge is increased from two years' imprisonment to five years' penal servitude, and in the case of a second offence there is a further increase.  The period within which a prosecution may be commenced is increased from six months to 12 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The defence formerly available, that the accused had reasonable cause to believe that the girl was over the age of consent, is to be abolished.  This defence is very seldom made in this country.  Many lawyers of considerable experience have never encountered a single instance of this defence &mdash;I have only known of one case in which such a defence was made.  The Bill proposes that the age of consent to indecent assault be increased from 13 to 15 years.  I would point out, however, that where the indecent assault amounts to attempted carnal knowledge, the age of consent is raised to <Col N="1248" /> 17.  It is unnecessary to say that a prosecution lies for the most trifling indecent assault on a female of any age where there is no consent.</P>
    <P>The principle of raising the ages to 15 and 17 respectively instead of 13 and 16 runs throughout the Bill and any necessary consequential amendments of other statutes are made accordingly.  The law relating to offences against weak-minded women is being strengthened.  The Bill makes provision for searching premises suspected to be used as brothels and for heavier penalties for brothel-keeping. It deals also with the punishment for solicitation.  The present position, in which the maximum penalty is a fine of 40/- even for the twentieth offence, is most unsatisfactory.  Under the Bill the court will have power in the case of a second or subsequent conviction to impose a penalty of six months' imprisonment.</P>
    <P>Section 17 forbids the sale or importation of any contraceptive.  It also prohibits advertisements of such things.  Section 18 relates to unseemly conduct in public.  Except in certain towns, prosecutions for such offences could not be taken summarily in the District Court, and it is obviously undesirable to have to proceed by way of indictment.  Needless to say, many proposed amendments of the law were submitted which have not been embodied in the Bill.  Some of these amendments appeared at first sight to be reasonable and worthy of adoption but on closer examination were found to be attended with practical and other difficulties.  For obvious reasons, it is hoped that amendments will not be put down without the most careful consideration. The Bill is an honest attempt to deal with a delicate and difficult problem.</P>

      <P>This Bill is really the work of a Committee, formed from all Parties of this House, which was an entirely non-political Committee.  There are certain things in this Bill which I, personally, may not or do not entirely approve of.  In a matter of this kind, naturally, it is absolutely impossible to get every mind to agree on every detail.  The Bill, however, is the result of the best effort of every member  <Col N="1249" /> of that committee to bring in the best possible Bill that could be brought in under the circumstances. I believe that, on the whole, that committee has succeeded in its work and, personally, I support the Bill and hope that it will be now read a Second Time.</P>

Personally, I hope that there will be no need for a discussion of this in either the old committee or a new committee.

      <NameTxt>The Attorney-General</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be read a Second Time.&rdquo;  This Bill is really self-explanatory. All Deputies will, I think, agree that additional control and supervision of dance halls is required.  Public dancing is organised for profit in places which are quite unsuitable for the purpose. The object of this Bill is to provide that all halls used for public dancing should be inspected by the Gárda Síochána and licensed by the District Court.  It also provides for a right of appeal to the Circuit Court, either by the applicant for a licence or by any interested party who appeared in the District Court.</P>
      <P>Section 2 sets out the matters which the justice of the District Court should have in mind when considering applications for dance hall licence.  I believe that when the Act is in force, much less reason will exist for the well-substantiated complaints which have been made in the past regarding dance halls, particularly in country districts. The Bill is a necessary one, intended to deal with a recognised abuse.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The object of this Bill, as the title indicates, is to amend and extend the <Col N="1252" /> Control of Manufactures Act, 1932. The type of businesses to which the new Act will apply will be the same as those mentioned in the 1932 Act, namely, the making, altering, repairing, ornamenting, finishing or adapting for sale any article, material or substance or part of any article, material or substance.  It is not proposed to interfere with any business whether owned by an individual or a body corporate which is at present carrying on business legally under the existing law.  The new provisions embodied in this Bill will apply only to businesses carried on after 1st July, 1934.  Individuals and companies holding new manufactures licences at the present time will retain their rights under that Act.  A new provision is inserted defining a qualified person.  A qualified person is a person born in Saorstát Eireann or a person who has been resident in Saorstát Eireann for five years prior to 1st July, 1934.  The difference between a qualified person as defined in this Bill and a national of Saorstát Eireann as defined for the purposes of the original Act is one of residence.  A national, under the original Act was a person born in Saorstát Eireann or a person who had been resident for five years in Saorstát Eireann.  That five years, however, dated from the time the question of his nationality arose; whereas a qualified person, in accordance with the definition in this Bill, is a person resident for the particular five years which preceded 1st July, 1934, and not other years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principal section of the Bill is, of course, Section 9, which replaces Section 2 of the original Act.  Section 2 of the original Act will be repealed by this Bill.  In explaining the significance of that section, I again want to draw attention to the fact that the position of existing businesses is in every case safeguarded with this qualification that the business must in each case have been carried on continuously. Under the terms of the Principal Act a business can be interrupted and resumed at a later date, but the terms of this Bill require the business to be carried on continuously in order to comply with its terms.  In other words, if a business were owned by a person <Col N="1253" /> who was not qualified but who was entitled to operate here without a licence because of the fact that it was in operation before January, 1932, should it cease operation, it could not resume business without a licence under this Bill.</P>
    <P>The safeguards for existing businesses are provided as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Paragraph (a) preserves the rights of a business owned by one individual who is carrying on business at present on the grounds that he is a national under the 1932 Act.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (h) preserves the rights of an individual who is carrying on business on the grounds that that business was carried on on the 1st June, 1932.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (j) preserves the rights of an individual holding a licence under the 1932 Act.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (c) preserves the rights of two or more individuals who are carrying on business, the capital of which is held to an extent exceeding 50 per cent. by nationals.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (h) preserves the rights of two or more individuals who carried on business on the 1st June, 1932.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (j) preserves the rights of two or more individuals who hold a licence under the 1932 Act.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (e) preserves the rights of the existing businesses owned by bodies corporate of which the capital was held to an extent exceeding 50 per cent. by nationals.</P>
    <P>Paragraphs (g) and (i) preserve the rights of businesses owned by bodies corporate carried on on the 1st June, 1932.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (j) preserves the rights of bodies corporate holding a licence under the 1932 Act.</P>
    <P>For all future businesses carried on by individuals all these individuals must be qualified persons.  Otherwise licences will be required.  Paragraph (b) makes provision for the case of one individual and paragraph (d) for two or more individuals.</P>
    <P>In the case of bodies corporate if the <Col N="1254" /> business is to be carried on without a licence over 50 per cent. of all classes of shares must be held by qualified persons and at least two-thirds (in nominal value) of every class of shares carrying voting rights must be held by qualified persons.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (f) contains the required provision.</P>
    <P>Further and consequential provisions with regard to businesses carried on in succession to a deceased person and by a bankrupt also are contained in Section 9.  It is proposed to take power in future licences to impose a statutory condition that the business shall be started within a specified time. One of the defects found in the operation of the 1932 Act was that no power to require the starting of a business within a specified time was provided. An application for a licence might be made on behalf of a firm, and the licence issued to that firm.  The firm might then decide not to take advantage of the licence for the time being, or to hold the licence against some future development, with the intention of taking advantage of it only in certain circumstances.  That situation was obviously undesirable, in so far as licences to external firms to engage in any manufacturing enterprise in the Saorstát are issued only having regard to the extent to which the existing businesses in the Saorstát or businesses likely to be established by Saorstát citizens, are incapable of supplying the requirements of the country.  There is, consequently, in relation to any industry only a limited scope for the issue of licences to external corporations or external persons, and the fact that any such external firms secure licences and then do not avail of them might cause a considerable upset in the industrial development plan.  For that reason we take power to impose that condition upon licences already issued, where the persons who received the licences have not availed of them&mdash; have not started the industry to which the licence applied.</P>
    <P>One of the principal weaknesses in the 1932 Act resulted from the alteration of Section 2 (4) while the Act was passing through the Oireachtas.  Under <Col N="1255" /> that section the onus lay upon the defendants of proving that restrictions did not apply.  It has been found practically impossible to sustain a prosecution against a company in view of the provisions of that sub-section as it finally passed.  It is now proposed to reinsert the old provision to deal with companies registered outside Saorstát Eireann.  The effect of the provisions of Section 10 is that the onus will be upon the outside company of proving the various matters set out in Section 7.  The certificate provided for in Section 10 (2) should facilitate such a company in making its defence.  As regards companies registered in Saorstát Eireann, additional powers are being taken in Section 13 to secure information.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce was empowered in Section 11 of the 1932 Act to get information by means of a notice served on an individual or body corporate.  That section is now being repealed, and it has been replaced by Section 13 of the present Bill.  Sub-section (1) contains the information which may be obtained from individuals, and sub-sections (2), (3), (4) and (5) set out the particulars which may be obtained from bodies corporate. Under sub-section (2) paragraph (a) information may be obtained as to whether the business was carried on continuously from the 1st July, 1934&mdash; whether or not it is an existing business.  Under sub-section (2) (b), information can be obtained as to whether the business was carried on on the 1st June, 1932, or whether it is owned at the specified date by the same body corporate which owned it on the 1st June, 1932.  Under sub-section (2) (c) information can be obtained as to whether the business has been carried on continuously since the 1st June, 1932, and is owned at the specified date by a body corporate, and whether half the issued shares are owned by the individual or individuals who owned the business on 1st June, 1932.  Sub-section (3) enables information to be obtained from a body corporate as regards any date specified in the notice in respect of the number of shares, the value of the shares, the voting rights attached to <Col N="1256" /> the shares, the number of shares held by each shareholder, and the name and address of each shareholder.  All this information can be obtained from the company's own register, whilst it cannot be always obtained from the Register of Companies.  As regards the nationality of shareholders, the companies cannot give the information, and accordingly sub-section (4) is inserted so as to enable the information to be got from the beneficial owner of shares. Sub-section (5) enables the Department to get the information from the last-mentioned beneficial owner.</P>
    <P>Section 14 enables the Minister through one of his officials to enter premises and make investigations. Part III of the Bill, as Deputies have probably noticed, is based entirely upon the provisions of the Cement Act. It is, in fact, identical with the relevant sections of the Cement Act, with this difference, that the word &ldquo;cement&rdquo; wherever it occurred was deleted and the word &ldquo;restricted commodity&rdquo; inserted.  I do not think, therefore, it is necessary to explain the purport of that part of the Bill, although something might have to be said as to the necessity for it.  Deputies will ask why it has become necessary to strengthen the powers of the Government in the matter of regulating the operation of external firms in Irish industry.  When the Control of Manufactures Bill, 1932, was submitted to the Dáil, I said that it represented, in my opinion, the barest minimum which any Government starting on a protective policy in a country like this would have to undertake. That opinion was based upon the fact that industrial development in the Saorstát had been late in coming.  Consequently, there was not in existence here any substantial number of persons with the technical competence to undertake the establishment of many of the industries which we hoped to bring into existence.  There would, consequently, be a very direct tendency to seek aid from outside the country in the establishment of those industries. There was, secondly, the fact that those engaged in the distribution of manufactured commodities in this country obtained those commodities almost entirely from British manufacturers, <Col N="1257" /> with whom their relations were most close, and to whom they would naturally turn when any question arose in regard to the production in this country of the commodities which they were distributing. There was the fact that the language most frequently spoken here is the same as the language spoken in Great Britain, which would facilitate the introduction of British firms into Irish industry.  More particularly there was the fact that our close geographical proximity, our close commercial relationship, and a number of other ties with Great Britain, would make it inevitable that British manufacturers, possessing as they do large capital resources, and being accustomed to pioneering in the matter of industrial development in countries outside their own, would endeavour to secure, by establishing branch factories here, the continuance of their connection with this market, despite the erection of tariff walls for the protection of Irish industry.  It is, I think, to be noted, that the expectation of that development was based not merely upon our own experience of the conditions in operation before 1932, but, also, on the experience of every other country in which similar, or almost similar, conditions prevailed.  It was considered to be undesirable, for many reasons, that that situation should be allowed to develop without taking power to deal with it.  Firstly, because there are many reasons why it is desirable that the control of industry, in the Saorstát, should be in the hands of our own citizens, and not exclusively, or almost exclusively, in the hands of foreigners; and, secondly, because it was exceedingly unlikely that any Saorstát citizen would take the risk of investing his money in industrial development here, unless he could be given some guarantee that having done so, and having developed a market for his products here, he was not to be faced with competition of a much stronger, more highly developed and more highly capitalised external company, particularly after experience had taught him that that competition was not likely to be fair competition. We felt, therefore, that if we were to get industry developed here, on lines that we desired, it was necessary, <Col N="1258" /> not merely to propose protective tariffs in order to give factories established in this country a chance, but also, that we should protect the ownership in these factories so that Saorstát citizens might be encouraged to invest their money in establishing and developing industry with the confidence that an adequate return would be forthcoming and that their capital investment would be secure.  At the same time we were not anxious to take powers of regulation in relation to industrial development, except where obviously it was necessary to do so, and then only to the barest minimum.</P>
    <P>The Act of 1932 was framed with a view to taking only those powers, the existence of which we felt was essential.  Since then there has been a fairly substantial development of industry here, and, in addition, there has been development in the number of devices adopted in order to avoid the provisions of the Act of 1932.  I think 37 licences under that Act were issued altogether.  Out of a number of applications, running into some hundreds&mdash;I have not got the exact figures&mdash;I think nine applicants were refused.  In each of the other cases either the applications were withdrawn or the applicants found some means of establishing their industry in a manner which avoided the necessity for a licence.  That situation by itself was not necessarily undesirable.  Some portion of the objective of the Act of 1932 was being secured.  Opportunities for investment in industry were being offered to our citizens, and, so long as that development did not interfere or undermine the willingness of Saorstát citizens to engage directly in commercial enterprise, it was not deemed necessary to go further than the Act of 1932, having regard to other powers in the possession of the Department which could be utilised for the purpose of securing that Government policy was not being defeated by any trick.  However, it became clear to us, 12 months ago or so, that it was necessary to go beyond the Act of 1932 and to take powers of regulation in excess of those provided by that Act.</P>
    <P>This Bill is not a Bill designed to prevent foreign companies establishing industries here.  It is necessary to <Col N="1259" /> emphasise that, because misunderstandings already as to its effect have arisen similar to those about the Act of 1932.  This Bill secures that foreign companies will not establish themselves in industry here except with the authority of the Department of Industry and Commerce.  In other words, we take powers, not to prevent those foreign firms coming in, but merely to regulate their entry, to secure that they will not come in except it is clear that their advent will be an advantage to this country and result in an increase in its industrial equipment and production.  The general policy which has been operating since the Act of 1932, and will be operated in connection with this Act, has been first to refuse licences where it is clear that the existing concerns established in Saorstát Eireann, or likely to be established in Saorstát Eireann, are capable of supplying our requirements of the goods concerned.  In some cases, where the existing concerns were not supplying all the requirements, and were slow in developing, or where it was clear that the maximum rate of development would mean that considerable delay would take place before the full production of our needs would be reached; foreign firms would be licensed to engage in the industry concerned, sometimes with conditions attached to the licence, fixing the limit of the maximum output of the goods which they could undertake in any one year.  The idea was to secure that their introduction into the country would not mean either the development of a monopoly or the prejudicing of the interests of the existing concerns.  In other cases where industries were established to work certain patents, or where technical competence of a high degree was required in order to enable the industry to carry on, or other considerations of that kind arose, licences were issued to foreign firms to engage in the industry concerned without conditions.</P>
    <P>In the case of all the principal industries, every effort is being made by the Department of Industry and Commerce to secure that they will be established in a manner which will <Col N="1260" /> keep as far as possible their effective control in the hands of the Saorstát citizens.</P>
    <P>The only substantial difference between the powers taken under the Principal Act and the powers proposed to be taken under this Bill is the requirement that not merely shall 51 per cent. in nominal value of the total shares of a company be held by Saorstát citizens but that two-thirds of the shares carrying voting rights shall be also so held.  That provision is necessary because of the practice which has developed of securing the 51 per cent.  Saorstát capital required under the 1932 Act by issuing preference shares only, these preference shares carrying a fixed rate of interest and having no voting rights. A number of companies were established without a licence under the 1932 Act by that device and, as it was obviously the intention of the Government and of the Oireachtas when dealing with the Act of 1932 that the ownership of the shares should signify proportionate control of the company concerned, this additional power is being taken.  The effect of it will be to secure that only those companies which are <i>bona fide</i> Saorstát companies will be able to engage in any industrial process without a licence.  In the case of other companies, there will be a licence required, so that considerations of policy can determine whether or not the firm concerned will be allowed to proceed.</P>
    <P>At this stage, I should perhaps deal with some of the matters raised when the Act of 1932 was under discussion. When that measure was before the Oireachtas, fears were expressed by members of the Dáil, but more particularly by members of the Seanad, and by persons outside the Oireachtas that onerous conditions would be attached to licences and, also, that there might be discrimination against certain firms. Deputies will remember that certain amendments having a bearing on these points, which were inserted in the Seanad, were the subject of dispute between the two Houses and, at one stage, it looked as if the Bill might be held up under the Constitutional clause because of the difficulty of getting agreement.  Finally, the Government <Col N="1261" /> decided that the better course was to accept the Seanad amendments and allow the Bill to operate.  The amendments related to this question of the conditions that might be attached to licences and the element of discretion that would be allowed to the Minister for Industry and Commerce in dealing with applications.  There was also an amendment dealing with a matter to which I have referred&mdash;the proving of the facts relating to any company.  The amendment inserted in that connection had the effect of practically defeating the purpose of the Bill, inasmuch as it made it almost impossible to sustain a prosecution under it.  I have referred to that matter and I shall have no need to refer to it again.  In accordance with the amendments inserted in the Seanad, it became necessary to table regulations indicating the type of conditions which might be attached to any licence.  These regulations were tabled. In fact, they had to be drafted in terms so general that they gave very little additional information to that already conveyed by the Bill.  In no case has there been a condition attached to a licence in respect of which any complaint has been received.  I shall qualify that in one respect in a moment.</P>
    <P>The ordinary conditions attached to a licence are&mdash;first, a condition requiring the person getting the licence to use in connection with the process licensed, materials of Saorstát origin. There is, of course, power taken to exempt the licensee from that provision wherever he proves to the satisfaction of the Minister for Industry and Commerce that materials of Saorstát origin are not available.  Secondly, there is a condition which requires that all materials used for the construction of works, machinery and so forth, must be produced or made in Saorstát Eireann, with, again, a provision granting exemption from that requirement where it is proved that it could not be complied with.  Thirdly, there is a condition requiring that all articles used for the advertising, sale or distribution of the products be made in Saorstát Eireann.  Fourthly, there is <Col N="1262" /> a condition requiring that the persons to be employed by the licensee be nationals of Saorstát Eireann, with power to exempt from that condition in respect of named persons where it is shown that they possess certain qualifications or for any reason are essential to the carrying on of the business. The only case in respect of which any question in this connection arose was where a condition was imposed limiting the output of a particular factory. That has only been done in a few cases where it became clear that the limitation was necessary to protect the position of existing Saorstát firms&mdash;that is to say, in cases where external firms were allowed to come in and engage in some industry which was already being largely catered for by Saorstát Eireann firms, even though those Saorstát firms were not in a position to supply the whole of the requirements of the Saorstát market.</P>
    <P>Part III of this Bill is designed, mainly, to prevent the necessity arising for having, in relation to certain other industries, the legislation we have at present in relation to cement. One of the difficulties we have experienced in securing the establishment of certain industries in the Saorstát is the fact that the size of the market here, having regard to the number of our population, is barely sufficient to maintain one economic unit of production, working full time for the 12 months.  There are industries which require the investment of substantial capital before they can be established, either because of the nature of the buildings required or the nature of the machinery required and in the case of which the investment of that capital would be entirely uneconomic unless the whole of the market in the Saorstát were available for the absorption of the produce.  People are naturally reluctant to invest money in the establishment of such industries here if there is any prospect of a second concern of the same kind being established, so that neither of the concerns could hope to keep up economic production unless the market here were to expand very considerably.  It is, therefore, proposed to take power to declare the product of any such <Col N="1263" /> industry to be a &ldquo;reserved commodity.&rdquo; That is a commodity the manufacture of which, in Saorstát Eireann, cannot be undertaken by anybody except under licence issued in accordance with the terms of the Bill. That power can only be exercised, in accordance with Section 16, in respect of a commodity which is not being manufactured in Saorstát Eireann at the time the order is made.  That power cannot be used in relation to any commodity which is being manufactured here either at the present time or at the time at which it is proposed to make the order.</P>
    <P>There is the qualifying phrase &ldquo;or manufactured to any substantial extent.&rdquo; That is necessary, because some person in a purely experimental way as a hobby may be engaged in the production of certain goods, but the intention is that Orders should not be made except where the industry concerned is one entirely new to this country. Where an Order is made it does not come into effect until it has been ratified by the Dáil.  In other words, the Dáil, in effect, makes the Order, and the result is really this: that legislation in respect of any commodity&mdash;of the type of legislation already passed in relation to cement&mdash;can be enacted by the process of making an Order and having a resolution approving of that Order passed by the Dáil and not by the more lengthy process which had to be adopted in relation to cement.</P>
    <P>The terms of Part 3 are in every respect identical with the terms of the Cement Act.  Section 22 sets out the conditions which may be attached to a licence issued under this part of the Bill: that is, a licence to engage in the manufacture of reserved commodities, and in particular power is taken to fix the maximum price at which an article may be sold and to fix the maximum and minimum quantities of the articles which may be produced, the nature and the quality of the articles, the mode of manufacture, the location of the factories and so forth.  It is not, of course, contemplated that in every case there will be one factory only, but whether there are one or more factories for the production of any <Col N="1264" /> commodity that may be declared to be a reserved commodity, the position will be such that it will be necessary to have these powers in order to safeguard the interests of the consumers. There are a very large number of conditions mentioned in the various paragraphs of Section 22.  They are all designed to enable conditions to be imposed on the licence issued under this Bill for the protection of consumers of articles in Saorstát Eireann.</P>
    <P>I do not know that it is necessary for me to say more at this stage.  I presume that the necessity for this legislation has been borne in upon most of the members of the Dáil arising out of our experience since the Act of 1932 was passed.  It may be that Deputies would think that certain sections of this Bill might have been framed differently, or that the power proposed to be taken might have been obtained in some different way, but as to the necessity for legislation I do not think there is much room for a difference of opinion.  In fact, the various indications which have been received by me for many months past, from persons associated with all parties that have been giving attention to this matter, is that the legislation is required and should be enacted without delay.  The Bill is framed so that it will become effective as from the 1st July, 1934. The Bill itself will not, of course, become law by the 1st of July, 1934, but when it does become law it will operate in respect of any business started after the 1st of July.  Persons who are contemplating establishing a business in the Saorstát during the month of July can of course, do so in accordance with the existing law, but they should have regard to the provisions of this Bill which will, presumably, become law at some time and which, when it does become law, will operate in respect of such businesses as may be established after the 1st of July next. I think it is necessary that a date should be inserted, because otherwise the intentions of the Oireachtas in relation to this Bill might be defeated in respect of different industries, particularly if there was any considerable delay in securing the enactment of the <Col N="1265" /> measure.  I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not make the objection that the matter just referred to by the Minister is, to a certain extent, legislating retrospectively. It is not retrospective morally, even if it may be legally, because the people ought to have their eyes open.  I quite admit that even if, technically, it may be classed as retrospective legislation it is altogether different from what is usually described as retrospective legislation. Therefore I shall not make that objection against the Bill.  I think that if the Minister reflects on his speech he will realise&mdash;I am not now questioning whether he has or has not good reasons for the Bill&mdash;that he has not given the House any information. If the House were interested in the matter and if the Minister's own Party were more interested in it than they actually are&mdash;I only see one stalwart on the Government Benches and generally he is always in his place&mdash;they would be here supporting the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister will agree, if he thinks over what he has said, that he has really given no information to the House but merely a few generalities.  The Act of 1932 proved unworkable for certain reasons.  There was a reference to various devices which were used to side-step, if I may use the expression, the provisions of the 1932 Act, but the Minister gave us no information about that.  Towards the close of his speech he spoke of &ldquo;our experience.&rdquo;  It may be the experience of the Minister and of his Department, but they have kept their experience in connection with all these factories remarkably well to themselves.  The Minister, I think, will agree that during the last couple of years it has been exceedingly difficult to get information from him on various subjects, information which might be useful in connection with this Bill. Now; when he is introducing rather important modifications of the Act of 1932 he confines himself to a few <Col N="1266" /> general statements.  The House has not been supplied with sufficient information to enable it to form any real judgment as to the necessity for this further step in legislation.  The Minister has given an answer, perhaps, that his Party trust him, and that there is no necessity to give information.  That precisely is what is to be feared: that the Minister, relying upon the great trust that his Party has in him, refuses information to the House and the country.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>But the Minister has not given it.  Whether or not the Minister has refused to give it, the information is not there for the House or the country.  I hope that the few general statements the Minister made are not sufficient to atone for that lack of detailed information on various points which, I submit, we are entitled to have: the real concrete reasons that have brought it home to the mind of the Minister that further legislation of this kind is necessary.  I confess that I am not surprised that legislation of this kind is necessary.  I presume we will soon have another Control of Manufactures Bill as well as a Cement Bill, to which the Minister was quite willing to refer.  But it is obvious, once the Minister embarked on a certain policy, that he was bound to advance, by the logic of events&mdash;I suppose it is portion of his case&mdash;beyond the legislation that is at any time proposed to the House. Undoubtedly the advance is rapid.  The advance of interference is undoubtedly growing.  There were certain things said by the Minister that I confess were not quite clear to me.  Perhaps they were matters of detail.  He said that this Bill does not apply to any industries already in existence, that they will not be affected.  Does that apply to Part III?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I put this case to the Minister, that there are a couple of small industries in existence, and that they are not capable of supplying the needs of the country.  The Government, <Col N="1267" /> acting on the advice of the Minister, then thinks that it is advisable to set up what I shall call for brevity's sake, a monopoly.  Is there any guarantee that these industries should continue in existence?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The phrase used is: &ldquo;not in existence to any substantial extent.&rdquo;  If the Deputy can get any other phrase I should be glad to have it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is really not the case I am making.  I must say that I read this section somewhat differently from the Minister.  I can imagine a really serious business, not merely a toy business, nor one of a purely experimental type, and yet not manufacturing to a substantial extent so far as supplying the needs of the country. That business might only supply one-fourth of the needs of the country, and yet that might not be to a substantial extent.  It might supply only one-tenth of the needs of the country, but in reality might be serious business.  As the Bill stands, there is no guarantee of its being kept in business.  However, that is a point of detail.  Various powers have already been granted to the Minister.  In his introductory speech to the Bill which is now the Act of 1932, he expressed a desire for haste. Generally he is in a hurry to get Bills through.  Apparently haste is necessary to save the country industrially. Judging from his speech, there was at that time a certain amount of keenness in getting foreign firms in, and the Minister had already anticipated the Bill.  I think his anxiety about the Act of 1932 induced foreign firms to come in.  That is how I read the Minister's introductory speech to the Act of 1932.  When I read this Bill I must confess quite candidly I came to the conclusion that the Minister's experience in that respect had not been altogether satisfactory, that he had got too many of these foreign firms in, and that possibly they were not the type he wanted.  That may or may not be so. But if you compare this Bill with the Minister's statement when introducing <Col N="1268" /> the Bill that is now the Act of 1932, I think the Minister will acknowledge that there is ground for the assumption that his experience in that respect has not been altogether, shall I say, too pleasant, from his point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House is given no information on which to base any kind of judgment. That is really my principal objection. Practically, so far as this matter is concerned, we have one-chamber legislation.  The Minister is not content to wait for the abolition of the Seanad, as no longer is a resolution of two Houses necessary.  A resolution of one House only is necessary now, and this House is asked to pass a Bill of this kind on the very limited information supplied by the Minister.  I suggest it is not likely to examine the individual cases that come up, unless in the future Deputies are approached by interested parties.  I shall return to that aspect of the matter subsequently. Supposing this country ever develops in the way in which proportional representation may develop, and if you had a number of medium size Parties, and a Government having to depend, to a large extent, on various combinations, in a situation of that kind I should be very much afraid that pressure brought to bear on individual members of the House by interested parties might be serious.  It might be rather difficult to avoid.  I am not discussing the question widely or the possibility of leading to corruption.  I am not referring to this House.  I am looking to the future, and I am afraid there is that element in it.  That is the reason I prefer something more of a judicial body which would be immune from pressure of that kind.  I am very much afraid, especially as far as Part III is concerned, that there will be undesirable pressure, say, in six or seven years' time.  I do not want to make charges or to discuss this matter from the Party point of view.  It is a serious danger.  Even though it might be to the advantage of the then Government, I would still object to it in principle. From the point of view of public life in general, it would be much better that power of this kind should be in the hands of a body that would not be so amenable to political pressure of <Col N="1269" /> various kinds as political Parties are likely to be.  I make that remark purely on the merits and without reference to any political Party.  I am afraid the experience of many countries will unfortunately bear out that view.  One of the objections, possibly, is that it will be impossible to remove it altogether. At all events, that is one of the objections that are, to some extent, inseparable from any kind of control.  Some of the dangers can be avoided by having a semi-judicial body to decide matters of this kind, and not merely the Government of the day, whether a Fianna Fáil or a Fine Gael Government.</P>
    <P>As I say, this Bill is a natural enough step for the Minister to take following what he has done already. We have always pointed out to him from this side of the House that the policy on which he was embarking would inevitably lead to more and more control and to more and more interference. I doubt very much if this will be the last example.  In 1932, when the Principal Act was being passed, there were allusions, but no direct reference, to economic penetration.  The Minister again referred to that matter to-day.  He referred to the experience that had been gained since 1932, but it was a purely general reference.  He did not give the House the benefit of that experience.  He did not give the slightest hint of the value of that experience.  He gave his own opinion on it, and it was evidently sufficient to convince him, but he certainly gave the House nothing on which the House, if it wanted to base a judgment, could base a judgment.  He spoke of economic penetration when the Principal Act was introduced.  At least, that was the purport of his remarks.  The facts were not then established.  His statements were vague then and, after a couple of years experience, the Minister is equally vague to-day.</P>
    <P>The Minister was also careful in 1932 to point out that the Act of 1932 did not interfere with the rights of nationals.  This Bill does.  It very seriously interferes with the rights of nationals.  Part III of the Bill will interfere with the rights of nationals. The Minister may get a foreign company <Col N="1270" /> into the country and give it special protection.  He may say that they will be more alive to the situation than some of the people at home.  The Minister himself pointed out that there was a certain slowness in industrial enterprise as far as this country is concerned.  Foreigners, he pointed out by implication, are not so slow.  Consequently they will get special facilities in a number of industries and nationals may find themselves crowded out. Licences may be given to a foreign firm, and, thereby, nationals, who want to set up in that industry, may be crowded out.  This Bill gives power to the Minister not merely to discriminate between nationals, a thing to which I have objected on more than one occasion, but it gives power to discriminate in favour of foreigners against nationals.  The Minister may say that it is the national's own fault, or that he will not utilise that power, but obviously one of the purposes of the Bill as it stands is to secure that. He said that the Act of 1932 created no monopolies.  This Bill does give power to create monopolies.  By a mere single vote of the Dáil, a Dáil giving as much attention to the matter as it is giving to this Bill, a monopoly is created.  I doubt if, as I say, some other machinery should not be set up to administer the purposes of Part III. It would be much better in the long run&mdash;I am not looking at it for one year or two years&mdash;if powers of that kind could be exercised by something in the nature of a judicial tribunal.  However, that is a point with which I have already dealt.</P>
    <P>The principal objection to the Bill arises out of Part III.  The Minister again says that he feels it is necessary, but he has made no case for it.  He has made no case to the House for it. He may have any amount of information which would show that the purpose of the Bill is desirable, that now is the time to act, and that he should get these powers as quickly as possible. But the country and the House do not know, if the Minister has this information, what the Minister knows.  The information is not available.  The Executive Council will decide a matter of that kind.  As I have said, there is, <Col N="1271" /> undoubtedly, inherent in this the danger of direct or indirect corruption. It will be exceedingly difficult as years go on, I am afraid, to avoid it.  I do not see how we are likely to avoid the experience of many other countries where you have had corruption connected with measures of this kind. There are details in the Bill which it is not necessary to discuss at this moment, as there will be an opportunity on the Committee Stage for doing that.  Might I suggest, as there are really what I might call only two operative clauses in the Bill, Section 9 and Section 16, that in Committee the Minister might avail himself of the opportunity to give to the House the information which induced him to think that this measure is so necessary and so urgent?  There are a number of points of detail which I have marked in the Bill, but I prefer to keep to general lines on Second Reading.  I might ask, for instance, how the provisions in Section 22 (1) in regard to the extent to which the capital invested in the business is from time to time to be owned by nationals of the Saorstát, related to the provisions of Section 9.</P>

      <P>The Minister professes to be a realist in matters regarding Irish industrial development but he never gives us any direct evidence of that.  When introducing the Control of Manufactures Act in 1932, he held it up <Col N="1272" /> before the House and the country as an instrument that was going to help him definitely in developing Irish industries.  He has had now close on two years' experience of that Act and he tells the House that it did not enable him to control all the things that he would like to control, that he came up against certain difficulties in connection with the matter and he asks the House for further powers.  As Deputy Professor O'Sullivan has stated, he has left us no wiser with regard to his experience than we were when he introduced the Act of 1932. The Minister says in connection with the weakness of certain clauses in the original Act, that he has met with difficulties in getting people to improve their general position.  The Minister might have given us a sample case in which he endeavoured to operate the 1932 Act in a particular way and the reasons for its failure.  He at any rate told us that under the licence clauses of the 1932 Act, there had been more than 100 applications for new licences, and that 37 had been granted, nine had been refused and that, in the case of the others, they found some other way of operating without requiring licences.</P>

      <P>Thirty-seven new licences were given.  We had the Minister for Forestry, or whatever the particular description of the Ministry now is &mdash;I am not quite clear&mdash;suggesting, in connection with the discussion on the Gaeltacht Estimate, that he for one did not see any general scattering of industry throughout the country and that, in fact, the day of the small industry from his particular point of view was completely gone.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce would rather seem to give us the impression that he was coming to that general conclusion to-day in connection with some of his remarks on the reserved commodity industries and it would be interesting if he would tell us, as he must have the information, what were the particular articles for the manufacture of which the 37 licences were granted; whether, in fact, these industries <Col N="1273" /> have been set up, and where, from the point of view of distribution. It would be interesting, too, from the point of view of his complaint that the 1932 Act was not strong enough in his hands, if he would review generally the type of articles to which the 69, 70 or 80 applications which were withdrawn referred, and what kind of possible distribution throughout the country it was intended to effect by the starting of these industries, if they had actually gone ahead.</P>
      <P>The Minister has actual experience to the extent of granting 37 new licences for new industries here and he might at least tell the House what these were and where they are.  In view of the main object of the Bill, he might also, I think, tell the House to what extent the capital in these 37 cases in respect of which he granted new manufacturing licences was Irish capital and how much was capital from Great Britain and Northern Ireland and from other sources, and the extent of that capital, because, as I say, one of the main objects of this measure is to secure that Irish capital will as far as possible be the capital that will feed the foundations of Irish industry here.  We have not got a single word from him in answer to any questions during all the discussions here as to the extent to which Irish capital is being added to established Irish industries or being put into new Irish industries here.  I think that where he has a definite piece of information of that type he might let us have it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The old Act is going to be left like an old tooth out of which the whole inside has been taken and, so far as I can see, there is nothing in the old Act but the provisions with regard to the issue of licences.  I must say that as a matter of draftsmanship, in the first place, and assistance to the commercial community, in the second place, I do not see why the old Act should not have been scrapped and why the present Bill should not contain the provisions that are being left in the old tooth, as I say&mdash;the matter dealing with the issue of new manufacturers' licences.  I repeat what Deputy O'Sullivan says with regard to reserved commodities.  I think it is <Col N="1274" /> absolutely necessary that such a resolution as is contemplated here should be passed by both Houses and also that the Dáil itself should have a month's previous notice of it.  In Section 22 there is a list of general conditions with which a person being given a reserved commodity licence will have to comply and, later on, there are suggestions that the wages paid by the person who is the holder of such a reserved commodity licence will have to be in accordance with certain rates which the Minister considers fair and proper.  The question arises in regard to a new manufacturer's licence, where a new manufacturer's licence is being issued to a firm for the reason that it has not the necessary Irish capital or for any other reason, that is, where a foreign company is being given a new manufacturer's licence, whether there should not be the same powers of control and the same conditions generally made applicable to a foreign company coming in under a new manufacturer's licence as are proposed to be made applicable to a foreign company coming in under a reserved commodity licence.</P>
    <P>While I point out that matter in connection with the reserved commodity licence, I think that that reserved licence should go out of this Bill.  The Minister has not given us any idea, good, bad or indifferent, as to what class of matters he has in mind as being dealt with under a reserved commodity licence.  The Minister found it necessary, he says, when dealing with the Cement Bill, to apply a general scheme of things like this. There is, perhaps, a very obvious reason for applying such conditions to the manufacture of cement here, but it should be possible to say what other classes of things there are like cement to which it would be necessary to apply a particular restriction like that.  Simply to take an arrangement which is necessary with regard to cement and then to take general powers to apply that to all kinds of things without, as I say, any information as to the different classes to which such resolution should be restricted, is making the position absurd.  If the Minister has no more to say to us and <Col N="1275" /> no more definite information to give us than he has given us already with regard to these matters, I think the introduction of this Bill is simply a glorified piece of propaganda and a piece of Party eye-wash and dope, because, from the Minister's experience, he ought to be able to tell us something with regard to the development of industries, even so far as it has been affected by the Control of Manufactures Act of 1932.  He has not told us a single thing about it.</P>

      <P>It is not very easy to give Deputies the information which they say they want, that is, information relating to the various considerations that have prompted the introduction of this measure and the various incidents that have arisen from time to time in relation to the operation of the 1932 Act, which made this measure appear to be necessary, without mentioning the names of individual firms, which I think would be undesirable.  There are a number of industries established in the Saorstát . like most of the apparel industries, the furniture industries, the confectionery industry, the soap and candle industry and most of the food producing industries, in respect of which it can be said that existing concerns are fully capable of supplying all the requirements of the country for their products, or would be capable, if ordinary developments which one might anticipate, in view of the protection afforded, were undertaken.  Into some of those very industries I have mentioned there have come during the past 12 or 18 months certain external firms by the device of issuing preference shares, which secures them their 51 per cent. of Saorstát capital, so as to avoid the necessity for the licence while, at the same time, they maintain their control in full over the factories established here.  These firms were not wanted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>They are going to stay. I am not saying that they did a lot of harm by coming in, but certain individuals <Col N="1276" /> who have been affected by their coming will argue that.  I am not saying that.  They were not wanted, however. Their coming has had this very undesirable effect&mdash;that in other industries where the same thing might have happened, or even in these industries, the owners of the existing Saorstát concerns hesitated to, or, in some cases, did not undertake the development of their own industries, involving, as it would, perhaps, a substantial capital investment on their part which would have enabled them to bring their industry up to the 100 per cent. position we are aiming at.  Therefore, it can be said that the coming in of these firms, while it did not add much to the productive capacity or the productive equipment of the country, undermined the confidence which industrialists might have had in their position here which would have induced them to have undertaken themselves the further development for which the market might call.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to those industries I have mentioned and other industries, I think we have now reached the position that we must say clearly and definitely that no more external firms are required to come into them.  We are satisfied that existing Saorstát concerns are quite capable either of supplying our requirements or of being developed to a point at which they will supply our requirements.  Consequently, in relation to such industries an application for a licence under this new Bill would ordinarily be refused.  I used the term &ldquo;ordinarily&rdquo; because there might be in relation to some application very exceptional circumstances&mdash;such a feature as an undertaking to export a substantial proportion of the total production of the factory to be established, or something of that kind, which would justify its consideration. But, ordinarily, an application for a licence to engage in any of these processes in the Saorstát would be refused.  That means that nobody can engage in these activities except they comply with the conditions set out in the Bill, namely, that the firms concerned are owned by individuals, and that those individuals are qualified persons under the Bill, or if they are <Col N="1277" /> owned by companies, that two-thirds of the control of those companies is in the hands of Saorstát citizens.</P>
    <P>Deputies devoted a large part of their remarks to the provisions of Part III of this Bill.  I want to say quite definitely that it was not my intention in framing Section 16 that the powers conferred by Part III should be exercisable except in relation to an industry not established here.  Deputy O'Sullivan spoke about the possibility of some firm engaged in industry here and supplying, say, 25 per cent. of our requirements being prejudiced in its position by the making of an Order under Part III of the Bill on the ground that the industry was not established here to a substantial extent. I do not contemplate any industry, in respect of which it would be possible to have a factory established for which 25 per cent.  of the market here would afford an opportunity of economic working, being made a reserved industry under that part of the Bill.  That part of the Bill is intended to be applied only to such goods as can only be made in the Saorstát under conditions which involve a substantial capital investment and would, therefore, have to be provided with the whole, or almost the whole, of the Saorstát market so as to make economic working a possibility.  Again, there is difficulty in giving specific examples of such industries, because people may come to false conclusions that they are going to be established by next week and that restriction upon importations will follow and, consequently, they might land themselves into debt trying to forestall the action of the Revenue Commissioners. It is not contemplated that the industries that will be established under Part III of the Bill will be in all cases, or even in the main, industries established by external companies.  In fact, in relation to most of these major industries, I think I can say that their establishment here will come as a result of a combination of external technicians with Saorstát capital, provided probably in the majority of cases through the Industrial Credit Corporation, the Government taking the initiative in bringing the proposition to <Col N="1278" /> a head.  I gave an example of a type of industry to which that portion of the Bill might relate, that is, the sheet-glass industry.  I do not know that it is practicable to establish the sheet-glass industry in the Saorstát, and that is why I mentioned it, because nobody has proposed as yet to establish that industry here.  But it is quite possible that it would be practicable to establish that industry here on the basis of the home market being available for the one factory, having regard to the capital which would have to be invested in that factory, and that unless the home market was made available it would not be possible to have that industry established here on a profit-making basis at all.  In such cases, we consider it desirable to have these powers to confine that industry to one, two, three or a limited number of firms.  Deputies will notice, however, that a firm which seeks to have an industry in which it proposes to engage made a reserved industry undertakes, and is forced to undertake, a very large number of additional commitments which it would not otherwise have to undertake.  If a licence is issued under Part III of the Bill there is a whole list of conditions that may be, in fact should be, attached to a licence of that kind which would not apply to an ordinary licence.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy made the suggestion that we might have power to attach to a licence issued under Part II the same conditions as are attaching to a licence under Part III.  There is something to be said for that.  In fact, the sole reason why I have not attempted to take wider powers in relation to the attachment of conditions to licences is because it was on that point that we and the Seanad fell out in relation to the 1932 Bill, which nearly resulted in the Bill being held up.  I do not want to go looking for trouble in that connection.  I think we could usefully have, in relation to an ordinary control of manufactures licence, power, say, to impose a condition as to location, maximum or minimum quantities of production, maximum prices, and certain other things.  We have not attempted to take these powers.  The power of attaching conditions to the <Col N="1279" /> ordinary control of manufactures licence in future, as in the past, will be the powers conferred by the regulations tabled under the original Act.</P>
    <P>But we have already had the experience in relation to one industry, the establishment of which in the Saorstát was being contemplated, where we considered it would be necessary either to have legislation of the type of the Cement Act or an Order made under Part III of the Bill when it became law, where those who were proposing to engage in the industry reckoned up the advantages of the comparative freedom they would have under the existing law, plus the chances of somebody else engaging in the industry here, having regard to the fact that they were already in and that the capital commitment was large, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, the various additional obligations that they would have to undertake under a licence under Part III, and decided that they would prefer to take whatever risks were involved in proceeding without the industry concerned being made a reserved industry.  That will ordinarily be the case, although there are some industries in respect of which the position may be different, where there are highly-organised and very heavily financed combines in the world which have shown, in other countries, that they are not unprepared to squander very large sums of money in order to prevent rivals appearing in any area which they regard as their own.</P>
    <P>We have at the present time proposals under examination for the establishment of a certain chemical industry which involves the investment of very large sums of money and where it will be necessary to take some power to prevent certain competing organisations coming into the market, because they would only do so for the purpose of losing money in order to prevent the development of the industry here.  It is to deal precisely with cases of that kind that Part III of the Bill has been framed.  It may be that there is some objection to the words &ldquo;not established to a substantial extent,&rdquo; but if Deputies can suggest a form of words <Col N="1280" /> which will clarify the meaning, I will have no objection to accepting them. The only reason why that qualification is put in is because it is quite possible that somebody in a very small way, and more as a hobby than a business, is engaged in the production of the same article which could only be made on a commercial scale in a substantial and heavily capitalised factory.  We do not want to debar ourselves from making an order in respect of the commodity concerned merely because that very small scale development is taking place in some district, of which development we may not even have heard.  The words in the Bill were the words designed to provide that safeguard, but, in effect, an order will not be made except where the industry is entirely new in the Saorstát.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Sullivan referred to the possibility of pressure being exercised upon members of the Dáil and the Executive Council for the granting of the concession contemplated in that part of the Bill to a particular company, and he mentioned the dangers associated therewith, dangers which might, he said, become aggravated if proportional representation provides the same results in the Dáil as it has elsewhere&mdash;a multitude of small parties.  He rightly said there was always that danger associated with the granting of powers regulating economic activities. There is no real safeguard against the abuse of these powers except the integrity of the majority of the members of the Dáil and of the Executive Council chosen by them.  In this case the making of the order is a matter for the Executive Council and the order does not become operative until approved of by a majority in the Dáil. It is suggested that that should be made the Dáil and Seanad.  I have no doubt when the Bill goes to the Seanad there will be an amendment to that effect and, if carried, it may be discussed here in greater detail.  In my opinion it should be the Dáil only.  The position is one in which the Executive Council should be able to enter into negotiations with firms or groups of persons for the establishment of an industry, with some certainty of being <Col N="1281" /> able to give effect to any agreement that may be made.  Under any circumstances, so long as the Constitution remains as it is, the Executive Council can only speak for a majority in the Dáil, and if it is to be in the position that it will have to face the prospect of any arrangement made being upset by the refusal of the majority of the Seanad to confirm the arrangement, then negotiation will become difficult. At the same time, if there is a reasonable case made for additional safeguards in that portion of the Bill, I am quite prepared to consider it.  In my own view it is not likely that more than two or three orders at the most will be made under that part of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I have been pressed by many organisations representing large interests to introduce legislation requiring everybody engaged in industry to get a licence.  That was submitted by the Federation of Irish Industries and by many of the trade unions catering for workers engaged in industry.  It has been pressed in respect of particular industries by associations or deputations speaking for the employers, the distributors and the workers.  In other countries they have taken these powers of regulation in respect of industry, and have apparently secured general public approval for so doing.  I have resisted the pressure.  I do not think it is desirable that these powers should be given.  They would involve a degree of interference which I do not think is necessary, which would not confer any real benefit at present, but which might involve very considerable delay in the promotion of new industrial enterprises.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy inquired about the licences which have already been issued under the existing Control of Manufactures Act.  They number 37. There were eight issued to firms to engage in various industries associated with the apparel group of industries, readymade clothing and other apparel industries.  There were three issued to firms to engage in the manufacture of footwear.  There were three issued to persons to engage in the manufacture of paints and varnishes of various kinds; two to parties to engage in <Col N="1282" /> packing; two to firms to engage in the assembling of bicycles; two to firms to engage in the manufacture of egg-cases and similar packing materials; two to persons to engage in the production of bacon and pork products; and one each for the following:&mdash; Wood-lasts, linen, waterproofs, hosiery, monumental stone work, paper bags, oxygen gas, furniture, golf clubs, oil refining, medicinal preparations, handbags, slicing machines, the packing of lubricating oil and the repairing of plant.  I am not in a position to give the Deputy the location of any of the factories, nor can I say definitely that all those who got licences among the 37 have, in fact, made use of them and established factories for the working out of the process.  I mentioned already that that was one of the difficulties we had to contend with, that we had no power to fix a time limit for the starting of the process in the licence&mdash;a defect which has been remedied in the present Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In the cases where licences were issued it could be all foreign capital and, in fact, there is no power to fix a specified proportion of Saorstát capital.  Either a firm was refused a licence or was granted one which would permit it to have entirely foreign capital.  In fact, in some cases licences were issued to companies. registered outside, although we usually endeavour to have companies registered here, even though the shares may be held outside the country, because there may be some tax advantage in that.  At least, some of the profit comes to the Exchequer if not to the citizens.  I merely mention this for the purpose of illustrating what has happened in relation to a number of industries for which licences have been issued under the 1932 Act.  The position has been reached, in respect of some industries, that no new licences will be issued under any circumstances, because existing concerns have developed to the point where they are more than capable of supplying all our requirements.  I think these are <Col N="1283" /> the principal points raised and, as the Bill appears to be acceptable in principle, I take it that the main discussion will arise in Committee.</P>

      <P>With your permission, Sir, I should like to say a few words. In commenting on Part III of the Bill, the Minister mentioned that a firm would be restricted in the nature and quality of the reserved commodity manufactured.  I should like to ask the Minister if he has power, under any other section, to review the manufactures of people who have got the protection of tariffs.  Why I make the point is that at some exhibitions of manufactures one finds that there is a tendency to tell one: &ldquo;That is what we are manufacturing and you have got to take it or leave it.&rdquo;  My feeling is that, when the Dáil gives a liberal tariff so as to assist a firm in manufacturing materials, that firm in return should give us the very best they can.  I think that there should be some authority to see that the nature and quality of the material is up to a certain standard. I should like to know whether or not the Minister has power to review any of the other products that have got the protection of a tariff.  I do not want, at this point, to mention particular articles or particular commodities, because I do not think it is desirable. I am speaking in a general way, and I feel that if, to use the Minister's own words, we have reached the point where existing firms are capable of supplying the needs of the country, they should give us a quality that is purchasable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in complete agreement with the Deputy.  Any firm that has got the benefit of a protective duty should give the country the best it can produce at the lowest price, but there is, in relation to Saorstát firms, no statutory power to carry out, say, an inspection of the quality of the product and insist upon a certain standard.  It would be very difficult to carry out.  There is power, under the Control of Prices Act, to examine prices having regard to the quality and, if the prices are excessive, <Col N="1284" /> having regard to the quality, to bring about a reduction.  What is more effective, however, is that there is power in the Department of Industry and Commerce to warn such firms if the standard is not improved, the protection will be withdrawn and that power has been exercised from time to time.</P>

      <P>I move: That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>This Bill is being introduced to amend and extend the Gaeltacht Housing Act of 1929, which was the Principal Act dealing with the Gaeltacht housing.  The 1929 Act, which was the first and Principal Act, made provision for the sum of £250,000; subsequently under the amending Act of 1931, an additional £100,000 was provided, making a total provision for grants and loans for housing in the Gaeltacht of £350,000.  The present Act proposes to increase this amount by an additional sum not exceeding £300,000, thus increasing the amount under the Principal Act to a sum not exceeding £650,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1285" /> Section 3, sub-section (1) increases the former maximum grant of £80 in the case of occupiers of holdings of a poor law valuation of £10 and under as follows:&mdash;(a) in the case of an occupier of a holding of a valuation of £5 or less, the maximum grant is increased to £90; (b) in the case of an occupier of a holding of a valuation of more than £5 but not exceeding £10, the maximum grant is increased to £85; (c) in the case of an occupier of a holding of a valuation exceeding £10, the maximum grant remains at the former figure of £80.  In determining the amount of the valuation of the holding, regard will be had to all the holdings in the possession of the applicant, if he should own other holdings than that on which the existing dwelling stands.</P>
    <P>Sub-section (2) limits the amount of grant and loan that may be made under the Principal Act to a sum not exceeding £160.  By this sub-section in cases where an increase in grant is given, the loan (the maximum amount of which was formerly £80) shall be correspondingly reduced so that the total amount of grant and loan shall not exceed the £160.  Experience of the Principal Act has shown that there are substantial numbers of poorer Irish-speaking homesteads in the Gaeltacht unable to avail of the Act through inability to provide the money required for the erection of a house over and above the amount of the grant or to assume liability for a loan of the amount necessary.  The increase of the grant in the cases of poorer persons is designed to meet this difficulty.  At the same time the reduction as from 1st October next in the rate of interest payable on loans from 5½ per cent. to 4¾ per cent. will operate to make the burden of a loan in all cases less onerous.</P>
    <P>Section 4 restricts the operation of the Act to Irish-speaking households, i.e., homesteads where the Irish language is in habitual use.  It is felt that as the primary purpose of the Bill is for the benefit of the Irish-speaking districts, the operation of the Act should be confined to Irish-speaking households.  The Local Government housing provisions are considered adequate <Col N="1286" /> to cover all non-Irish-speaking households, i.e., those in which English is in habitual use.  While the financial assistance under the latter Act (the Housing (Financial and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1932) is not substantially less advantageous, the administration of the Gaeltacht Act extends to the Irish-speaking families a larger measure of co-operation in the building of the houses, the absence of which co-operation in the past had proved an effective barrier against participation by those families in the advantages of earlier Housing Acts.  That circumstance is the justification for this Act and the explanation why it would be impracticable to deal with the problem of housing in the Gaeltacht through the instrumentality of the general housing legislation of the Saorstát.  The surveyor of the Department supervises the selection and laying out of the site.  As soon as the stones and other materials, which the head of the family can himself supply, are on the site, an instalment of the grant is made to enable him to engage the skilled labour.  The Department organises a scheme of combined purchase of the materials which the head of the family cannot himself provide. Under this scheme he is able to procure these materials at specially cheap rates.  The quality of the materials is ensured by the Department's surveyor, who is empowered to reject any defective goods.  The Department arranges, where desired, to guarantee the payment of the supplier's account out of the grant or loan in order to establish the credit of the purchaser.  By these means the small-holder is protected at every point against excessive charges, defective materials and other risks. The administration of the Act is carried out in the Irish language.  The surveyors with whom the Irish-speaking families in the Gaeltacht have to deal are able to discuss the business with them in their own language and use that language only.</P>
    <P>Section 5 repeals the provision in the Principal Act by which three-fifths of the available funds were earmarked for certain areas to the extent to which those areas could absorb this proportion. Since the passage of the Principal <Col N="1287" /> Act special attention has been devoted to these areas and a marked impression has been made on housing conditions there.  While the policy which underlay the provision will be continued it is felt that the provision itself is no longer necessary and might tend to hamper the effective administration of the Act.</P>
    <P>Section 6 repeals the Amending Act of 1931 and makes the funds provided more readily available for the provision of houses in the Gaeltacht.  The Amending Act of 1931 imposed certain restrictions by the Department of Finance and it is felt that these are not now necessary and might unnecessarily delay the operation of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The first thing that one might say about this Bill is &ldquo;Ma's maith é is mithid.&rdquo;  We have been waiting long enough for its advent.  For over 18 months I have been impressing on the Parliamentary Secretary here by questions, and on the various matters that arose, the great necessity there was for making further provision for Gaeltacht housing.  This is the first provision that the Fianna Fáil Government has made for this particular service since they came into office.  I should like to have heard from the Minister at this hour of the day whether the £350,000 that had been made available under 1929 and 1931 Acts has been practically entirely allocated or expended?  I should like to have heard from him how much of the £350,000 was given by way of loan? Deputies will remember that the provisions of the original Act made it possible that the sum available should be expended either as a grant or as a loan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think I understood from the Minister's statement that the policy he found before him is the policy that he has continued.  Under that policy, as far as possible, all applicants for new houses were encouraged to take as much grant as they were entitled to, and to go for as little as possible in the way of loan.  I am pleased to understand that that is to be the policy in the future.  There is no question <Col N="1288" /> about it that any burden, no matter how trifling it may appear, under which persons in the poorer areas in the Gaeltacht place themselves, makes life harder for them.  I have no objection at all to the limitation which the Minister puts on the loans.  Even if the loans were fixed at a lower limit I would have no objection to them.  It has been found in the past that very few people indeed looked for the maximum loan.  I take it that the allocation of the further £300,000 now being made available will be made on the same lines as in the past&mdash;as much as possible by way of grants and as little as possible by way of loan.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Bill fixes the maximum. Sections 3 and 5 should be read together.  Section 3 is in some sense a substitution for sub-section (4) of Section 11 of the original Act.  Sub-section (4) of Section 11 of the original Act, as the Minister pointed out, ear-marked three-fifths of the total amount then being made available by that Act for these areas in the Gaeltacht, where the total valuation divided by the population was a guinea and less, in order to enable the Department to get at the very worst slums in the Gaeltacht. These, by the way, had never been effectively touched before.</P>
    <P>Great as was the work that was done by the Congested Districts Board in their day, I am afraid when they came up against the difficulties that were facing them in these very bad areas they took the easier line of shelving them.  It was only by the 1929 Housing Act that the Government came effectively to the aid of these persons.  I was glad to hear the Minister say that the money available has been entirely utilised in those areas.  I take it now since the Minister is repealing sub-section (4) of Section 11, that he feels it is no longer necessary to allocate any portion of the money beyond what will be done by the machinery in the office. As far as the new section goes I have no fault to find with it.  A building grant of £90 is available where the valuation does not exceed £5.  A grant of £85 is available where the valuation is over £5 and under £10, and £80 is made available where the valuation is over £10.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1289" /> I take it that the grants for poultry houses and pig styes will be still available in addition to these grants of £80, £85 and £90.  That is to say, that in addition to these grants for human dwelling houses, the applicants might also apply for a further grant of £5 for a hen house and £5 for a piggery.  As a matter of fact it was part of the policy behind the Act at the start that we should encourage applications for this type of accommodation, because it was thought, on advice from the Department of Agriculture, that in the economic development of the Gaeltacht these were two possible ways by which the position of the people there should be improved&mdash;that is by poultry rearing and pig feeding.  I have already referred to sub-section (2).  I have no objection to that in defining the total amount even though making an increase in the grant to keep the maximum available for any individual at £160; that is, the maximum allowed by way of loan to any person would, I take it, be £70.</P>
    <P>I am not easy in my mind about Section 4.  While it has attractive features for anybody who has a real interest in the Irish language I have a kind of fear of it.  It is the kind of section which I would recommend the Minister, as far as he can manage it, to have discussed absolutely non-politically. I may put down an amendment on the Committee Stage, not in any very pressing way, but just in order to give an opportunity for discussion. I would suggest to the Minister that, if there is a general feeling throughout the House against the provisions of Section 4, he might leave it to a free vote of the House.  I think he will find many persons in his Party who will not entirely like the implications of that section, just as I am perfectly certain that in my Party I would find very many who might not agree with my point of view.  I have not consulted any of my Party on this matter &mdash;not even Deputy Mulcahy, who is beside me.  Quite possibly he may entirely disagree with my point of view. I have no doubt at all, for instance, that Senator Blythe would disagree entirely on the matter.  I should say for the benefit of other Deputies, who <Col N="1290" /> may not have closely read the Bill, that this section shuts the door completely on any household in which Irish is not the ordinary language of the people.  I think nobody who knows anything of my history will say that I have not in my time been a pretty strong advocate of the Irish language.  What I fear about this is that you might injure the language movement very seriously by the too rigid enforcement of a section of this kind.  I can visualise, for instance, those very poor areas to which I referred a minute ago, mostly Fíor-Ghaeltacht, and with very low valuations, where you might have in amongst the lot a house in just as bad a condition as all the others in which Irish may not be the ordinary language of the household.</P>
    <P>If Connemara Deputies were here, for instance, they would know of many cases of girls going over to America, staying there for a period of nine or ten years, putting together £100 or £200, and the minute they have it they come back to the side of the mountain to settle down for their lives.  They may have got out of the habit of using Irish as their ordinary language.  I think it would be a mean kind of thing, if you were dealing with all their neighbours, that because of the fact that this particular household were not using Irish as their ordinary language you should entirely exclude them from the benefits of the Act.  Of course, undoubtedly, if you did it, you would first of all have that household opposed to Irish for the rest of their days.  It is an extraordinary thing that you find always in poor areas, not only in the Gaeltacht or in country districts, but in the city, that there is far greater <i>esprit de corps</i> amongst the poor than there is, for instance, amongst the middle classes or the well-to-do.  Take that household I have mentioned.  The neighbours will have got their houses. They will feel that there was an injustice caused to this particular household, and they, too, will begin to be rather embittered against the Irish language because of their sympathy with the persons who have been excluded on account of this particular section.  That is my point of view in the matter, at any rate.  It is, as I say, <Col N="1291" /> a matter that I should like to have discussed entirely non-politically, and in an atmosphere in which the minds would be spoken freely, and merely with a desire to Lave the Bill operating in the best manner possible.  With a view to having a discussion on those lines, I intend to frame an amendment for discussion here on Committee Stage.  Naturally, I am supporting the Bill in the sense that it provides this further £300,000.  I was very glad indeed to note the Minister's remarks that this money will be made more easily available without too many financial restrictions.  That is all the more necessary because, as the Minister must be aware, the number of sanctions that have been held up&mdash;and the holding up of sanctions means the holding up of building&mdash;must amount to some thousands during the past couple of years.  Therefore, as I say, I welcome the Bill, and I welcome the removal of the financial restrictions which might hamper progress.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>I too, welcome this Bill, and I agree with the last speaker in the matter of its application to the Fíor-Ghaeltacht areas.  I think that the principle of preference should be retained for the Fíor-Ghaeltacht areas, as distinct from the Breac-Ghaeltacht. There are many reasons.  Connemara has been specifically mentioned.  The officials of the Department know well that there are a great many applicants in the Fíor-Ghaeltacht who cannot avail themselves of the Gaeltacht Housing Scheme&mdash;either the old one or this new one&mdash;for the reason I mentioned last night on the Estimate.  I am sorry that the Minister did not catch my point accurately last night when I referred to the Land Commission certificate.  It is not a question of overlapping at all.  The Gaeltacht Act provides that sanction cannot be given unless the Land Commission gives a certificate that the lands of the applicant will not, later on, be subject to rearrangement.  I would say that the lands of the majority of the people living in the Fíor-Ghaeltacht areas are in such a condition that the Land Commission cannot give that certificate. That is a very real and serious <Col N="1292" /> difficulty.  In my opinion, it will not be possible to spend all the money on the Fíor-Ghaeltacht areas because of the condition in which the holdings are. For that reason I should like to see the principle of preference retained.  The lands in the Breac-Ghaeltacht parts will be much less subject to rearrangement than in the Fíor-Ghaeltacht areas. There is not so much congestion, in the first instance.  The housing can be immediately improved there.  I am very doubtful myself&mdash;about any policy of intensive house building in the Fíor-Ghaeltacht area, that is the Fíor-Ghaeltacht from Spiddal to Carna.  The place is very congested.  I am quite satisfied that the remedy there is to take people out of it.  I do not see how anything else can be done.  I think that in the Fíor-Ghaeltacht areas the principle of preference should be retained, and I hope it will be retained, in the Bill.  I should like to see the further application of that principle of preference in favour of the districts in the Fíor-Ghaeltacht, in which there are summer colleges.  It is important to have the houses there made as good as possible.  The people can make a fair amount of money in the summer time by housing students who come to learn Irish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like also to see a less rigid insistence upon the piggery and the hen house.  I do not say that the clause dealing with these should be cut out altogether, but where the Department is satisfied that there is sufficient alternative accommodation for poultry and pigs, the erection of these conveniences ought not to be insisted upon.  I think there is another convenience that should be brought in and that is for sanitary arrangements.  Something ought to be done in that respect. There is a further matter in connection with this scheme that I do not like, and that is inviting contracts for the supply of material from traders.  I think there ought to be an option whereby the people who get sanction might be enabled to buy materials from the most competitive suppliers and that they should not be tied to particular contractors, which operates under the Local Government Housing Act.  I know, possibly, there may be objection <Col N="1293" /> to that.  Suppliers may not be inclined to give credit unless the Department orders direct from headquarters, but I know that complaints have arisen as the result of that arrangement.  It is not a very important point.  I certainly would impress upon the Minister the point I raised last night and that he did not seem to appreciate.  That is in regard to the Land Commission certificate.  I know the areas the Minister is most anxious to serve and these he will find most difficult to serve.  That is a point I wished to raise last night and I hope the Minister will consider it now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will find, I think, that the housing census shows that Gaeltacht areas were the really complicated areas from the point of view of housing conditions.  I think it would be most desirable, now that he is introducing a measure increasing the amount of money available, that he would give the real amount of work done in the past; that is that he would give a statistical summary of the houses built in the Gaeltacht in each county, and the total amount of money given in grants and given in loans.  We have got to the point now when, I take it, the whole of the money already voted is, as one may say, spent or, certainly, allocated, and I think the House is entitled to a picture of what is being done under the previous Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question raised as to sub-section (4) I quite agree that in partly Irish-speaking districts the economic conditions are such that they might involve unfairness and difficulties in discriminating between people who are Irish-speaking and those who are not, and that there might be some case for removing that clause as far as they are limited to partly Irish-speaking areas. When you come to the Irish-speaking districts, where you have a wider area and more diversified economic conditions, a certain amount of unfairness might be involved.  Considering the amount of the grants available for those deriving their living from agriculture under the 1932 Housing Act it would be unnecessary, and the restrictions might be retained with regard to <Col N="1294" /> the purely Irish-speaking districts.  It has to be borne in mind too, that this expenditure is being specially made as one of the efforts to keep Irish as the living language in Irish homes in circumstances that it will not only live there, but extend.</P>
    <P>The most recent statistics available with regard to the Irish language as a home language in the purely Irish-speaking districts, not to talk about the partly Irish-speaking areas, show the language is in a very grave condition, even in those limited areas regarded as purely Irish-speaking.  I do not know what condition the inspectors in the administration of this Act have come up against, or that they will want to change, in regard to the purely Irish-speaking districts.  The inspectors engaged in this particular work should look, in a very objective way, to the linguistic conditions of the people they are dealing with.  We ought not, in any light-hearted way, to remove any conditions from this Act that would make the Irish-speaking people feel that we were not catering definitely for the Irish language in the home, or that would relieve the inspectors, either engaged in field work or at headquarters, of that important aspect of things; that is that this is definitely intended to encourage the Irish language to continue as the home language.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Mulcahy and Deputy Lynch both raised the question as to the experience we have had up to the present.  The actual amount of <Col N="1295" /> grants which have been sanctioned and ear-marked is £238,736.  The actual amount of loans is £108,460, making a total of £347,196.  These figures are approximate, but I think that they almost exactly represent the position up to 31st May last.  With regard to the number of houses, the total is 1,848; under £5 valuation, 1,266; between £5 and £10,396; between £10 and £15, 119; between £15 and £25, 56; over £25, 11.  The improvements number 1,402&mdash;under £5, 1,056; between £5 and £10, 229; between £10 and £15, 64; between £15 and £25, 44; over £25, 9.  It will be seen that the figures for the majority of both houses and improvements refer to the lower valuations&mdash;under £5.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main question raised by Deputy Lynch dealt with Section 4. This is a matter that has given us a great deal of thought.  As Deputies know, there is a good deal of difference of opinion on this issue.  I think, however, that Deputy Mulcahy has practically met any argument that could be advanced on the basis on which Deputy Lynch proceeded.  We feel, as the Deputy explained, that this Act is specifically planned to assist those people in the Gaeltacht because they are Irish-speaking.  When the various types of grants and loans available under the local authorities are considered, which grants do not differ very much from those given to the Irish-speaking districts, no reasonable objection can be made to confining the operation of this measure to the purely Irish-speaking households.  There are very definite advantages in confining it to these households.  It does seek to protect those people in the Gaeltacht who are purely Irish-speaking. There is more in the protection and facilities it affords, in my opinion, than there is even in the slight difference in the amount.  There is, for instance, the protection afforded them by the survey and by the guidance in the selection of the site.  The most important aid, perhaps, is that to which Deputy Bartley, apparently, objects.  I have gone closely into this question of the prices the contractors are willing to quote to the Department. <Col N="1296" /> I have contrasted those with the figures which would be charged to an ordinary retail shop or to a retail purchaser. I am definitely of opinion that it would be a terrible mistake to depart from the method at present in operation.  I think that it definitely gives a substantial reduction to the man who is building his house.  It does more&mdash;it ensures that the standard of quality will be maintained.  I cannot see what argument can be advanced on the basis suggested by Deputy Bartley&mdash;that we should allow the people to go to any store in a district, make their selection of materials, place their order and be at the mercy of the local shopkeeper. After all, the local shopkeepers where houses are going to be built have an opportunity of sending in an estimate. Contracts are placed as near as possible to areas where the building is to be done.  That is the obvious thing to do from the point of view of convenience and with a view to saving transport charges.  I have examined this matter closely.  I have seen the contracts and the files and, from what I have seen, no argument can be advanced for making that change.  The contractors are willing to quote very keen prices when they know that there is a possibility of being put on the list for a substantial number of orders. Every local contractor is in a position to quote if he so desires.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear Deputy Lynch refer to the extension of the grant, and to reducing the loan to the minimum. I feel, as he does and as anybody who has had any experience of these matters must feel, that the loan is often a serious handicap to the very best type of people.  The really honest people are very often afraid of the loan. It is the type of people who intend to repay and make good the loan who hesitate before they undertake the responsibility.  I should like to feel that we were in a position to go even further, because the people who most need the accommodation and the grants are those who are least able to bear anything in the way of loan charges.</P>
    <P>The Deputy referred to Section 3 and spoke of the worst slums in the Gaeltacht. I am not satisfied that the <Col N="1297" /> worst slums in the Gaeltacht have been wiped out.  A good deal has been done but while there is a slum in the Gaeltacht we should not rest content.  With regard to the poultry houses, these are not only still available, but invariably they are insisted upon except where the Department of Agriculture tells us they are not really necessary, that the people have special accommodation of their own, or that some other facilities are available or that, for some reason, the requirement should not be insisted upon.  In all other circumstances, we do insist upon these poultry houses. Deputy Lynch spoke of having the discussion of Section 4 on a non-political basis.  I feel that the entire Bill should be discussed on a non-political basis. If any amendment to that section is proposed, it can be considered, but I should be very slow to admit that any alteration of Section 4 should be entertained by the House.  Deputy Bartley raised a question as to the preference to the Fíor-Ghaeltacht area.  I think he was slightly at cross-purposes with Deputy Lynch.  I do not think that he was making quite the same argument.</P>
    <P>However, that is a matter of detail. But it raises an important point with regard to the Land Commission and the arrangements that the Land Commission might be making in an area.  I cannot see what alternative we have but to be in close contact with the Land Commission in this matter. Surely Deputies will agree that no purpose is going to be served by deciding on the rebuilding of a house and the expenditure of £90 in a grant and another £30 or £40 by way of loan, if the Land Commission is coming into an area in three or four months, or one-and-a-half years afterwards and altering the whole complexion of it.  They may be restriping the land.  They may find that they want to relieve congestion: that where there are ten holdings now they only want five, and they may decide to take five migrants out of that area.  At the moment I cannot see much point in that suggestion.  I think that the closer the co-operation is between the Land Commission and the Gaeltacht housing section the better for all concerned. It will ensure that there will be uniformity of action and that there <Col N="1298" /> will be no overlapping.  I still feel that the question of the Gaeltacht housing section, proceeding on its own, without giving any consideration at all to what the Land Commission may be doing in an area, would be slightly foolish.</P>
    <P>On the question of sanitation I do not know that I can say much.  That involves, of course, an entirely bigger issue than what we are attempting to deal with in this Bill.  To me it suggests the question of drainage and proper sanitation in an area rather than in the houses themselves.  That, however, can be looked into.  I think these were the chief points that were raised.  If there is any other matter, amendments can be put down and they will be dealt with on the Committee Stage.  We will be glad to consider them.  As I stated in my introductory remarks, this is really a continuation of the original Act.  The slight amendments that are involved in it are merely improvements in the grants and an elimination from the 1931 Act of the financial control which we felt might, in some cases, hamper us in our work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the Minister rather evaded the question that I asked him, whether he would allow, supposing an amendment were brought forward in connection with Section 4, a free vote of the House on it.  He said he would like it discussed on a non-political basis.  I will give the Minister an indication of what I have in mind.  I think he misunderstood Deputy Mulcahy, or perhaps I did. What I understood Deputy Mulcahy to say was that Section 4, as it now stands in the Bill, should be retained as far as the Breac-Ghaeltacht is concerned. That is that you cut down the line completely in the Breac-Ghealtacht as against the household in which Irish is not the ordinary language, but that in the Fíor-Ghaeltacht areas, which coincide with the very poorest areas, you should retain the preference which was contained in sub-section (3) of Section 11 of the Principal Act.  If I put down an amendment in that direction, retaining Section 4 as it stands in the Bill for the Breac-Ghaeltacht and retaining the provisions of sub-section (3) of Section 11 of the Principal Act as far as the Fíor-Ghaeltacht <Col N="1299" /> is concerned, would the Minister be prepared to allow that to be discussed purely on its merits, and have it voted on on its merits without the Whips being on?  I have not consulted anyone in my Party about this. It may be that some members on this side will not agree with me at all in the matter.  I do not intend to influence them in any way in connection with it, but I would like to have this discussed entirely on its merits, because obviously the aim of all sides in the House, in a matter of this kind, is to turn out the best piece of legislation that we can for the benefit of the people and of the country.</P>

      <P>I was not really evading the question so much as making it clear that the whole consideration and operation of this Bill would, I naturally <Col N="1300" /> thought, be on a purely non-political basis.  At the same time I do not think I would be prepared to commit myself to a free vote of the House on this.  The Department, very definitely, after their experience, insist that this Section 4 ought to stand and for the reasons I have already given: that the Acts administered by local authorities make adequate provision so far as the people in other areas are concerned. We feel that it ought to be stressed that in the interests of the Irish-speaking areas this question of the consideration being confined to purely Irish-speaking families should be insisted on.</P>
