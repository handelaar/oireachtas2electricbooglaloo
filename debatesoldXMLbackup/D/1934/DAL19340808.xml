      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised the question of service with the Minister for Agriculture last night.  He agreed to consult with the Minister for Industry and Commerce with regard to service by registered letter as an alternative to personal service.  I raised an objection to service by registered letter unless it had been proved that every effort had been made to effect personal service.  The penalties laid down in this Bill are very severe.  In this particular case that we are discussing the penalty is £20.  I am of opinion that, where the penalties are so severe, every effort should be made to have personal service effected before resort is made to service by registered letter.  I think that sub-section (3) should be amended to meet my point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is necessary to amend the section to provide for that.  There is a recognised method of service.  In all measures of this kind power is taken to effect service by sending notice by registered post.  The practice, however, always is to effect personal service, where possible.  It is only where the operation of an Act might be held up by inability to establish contact with an individual that this method of service by registered letter is resorted to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>Sub-section (3) should be drafted so that it would not come into operation until every effort had been made to effect personal service. In the sub-section it is an alternative to personal service.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It permits of it where service in any other form is not practicable. I am telling the Deputy what is the practice.  Every Department of State has considerable experience in this matter, and in all Bills of this kind you have the same provision permitting of the service of a notice by registered post where service in any other form would be impracticable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>Very strong objection can be taken to this form of service, and it should not be resorted to except in a case where a man is evading service.  That should be set forth in the sub-section, so that it would be made clear that the Department was driven, in a case where a man was evading personal service, to avail of the power of effecting service by registered post.  Here there is a penalty of £20, and I think where the penalty is so heavy there should be personal service.  Take the other cases where there are minor fines imposed. Take, for example, the attendance of a juror.  Personal service is required there.  The maximum fine is £3.  Here it is £20.  I think it is only right that the Department should use every effort at personal service before adopting this form.</P>

      <P>On Section 87 and with reference to Section 87, 88 and 89, I think the Minister ought to give the House some idea as to the circumstances under which he thinks it may be necessary for him to enter into those businesses&mdash;warehousing and drying cereals, and all that sort of thing, for which he is taking those powers.</P>

      <P>The power conferred upon the Minister under those sections cannot be exercised by him until the necessary funds have been voted by the Dáil.

      <P>When this House is asked to pass legislation giving the Minister power to do certain things, and particularly giving the Minister power to enter into businesses that are conducted by the trading and commercial community at the present time, surely he ought to inform the House why he is looking for those powers. If he thinks that he is not likely to use them there is no reason why he should not tell the House or why the House should put into the framework of its legislation powers for this particular class of thing.  I think it is an absurd action on the part of the Minister to tell the House: &ldquo;This is only legislation; this is only law.  We will not be able to do anything under this until we come and ask for money to do it.&rdquo; I think we are entitled to know what the law is for, and what are the circumstances that the Minister foresees and thinks may at some time drive him into the position that he will have to enter into those businesses.</P>

      <P>The circumstances would be similar to those under which corresponding powers to take over flour mills and maize mills are provided under the main Act, that is, if the owners of those grain stores keep them out of use, and refuse to sell or lease them or make them available for the purposes of the scheme, and it became necessary to use those compulsory powers in order to get possession of those stores and use them.  It is not anticipated that circumstances will frequently arise in which those powers will have to be used, but it is necessary that the power should be there, so that there will be no possibility of the interests of the country being prejudiced by individuals acting in such an unreasonable manner.</P>

      <P>Has the Minister lived until this time of day and not realised that in regard to the simplest business something has to be learned?  Those who follow that business for a livelihood learn it best, because their whole livelihood is at stake.  When they fail, a civil servant is to come along&mdash;a civil servant whose concern is to come in in the morning, get away in the evening, and consider what weather he will have for his holidays.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I had to more carefully learn the business I follow now, because I was up against it.  It was not a late hour in the morning, or an early hour in the evening, or fine weather for my holidays that I could afford to consider. I would have to consider my business if I woke up at night.  People who have pursued their business under those conditions fail only because of circumstances beyond their control. Where they fail, the Minister comes along and in effect says: &ldquo;Come, get out of my way.  I will put in a civil servant, and he will make it pay&mdash;not with his own money but with the State money.&rdquo;  All the Minister can say is that he would have to try.  Take care that the Minister and other Ministers have not already bitten off more than they can chew.  They have in other sections here sought power to take up land.  Now they are going to erect a new store and a new kiln to dry this corn, where private enterprise failed in certain conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should not deal with such a very important matter, which involves so much, in such a flippant manner.  If circumstances which would make this necessary should arise, we would all wish the Minister success, because the country would be hinging upon that.  The Minister should explain more fully the circumstances under which he would attempt this. The trade now cannot afford to build huge warehouses and to carry the grain over.  Perhaps the Minister does not know&mdash;and I do not know if the Minister for Agriculture would be able to advise him&mdash;that the best place to store corn is in the stack.  It is by storing it properly in the stack that you can obviate the necessity of kiln drying. When you put it in kilns it has to be turned, and turned properly.  The ordinary labourer cannot turn the corn unless he has had experience of how to do it.  He could very easily burn it in the kiln.  It also wants sufficient turning while on the lofts.  I do not think it necessary in this section to give the House some idea of the cost of building a store.  That is only the initial <Col N="2297" /> cost, but, if it was not suitable for corn, it might be suitable for something else later on, when the Minister for Agriculture starts slaughtering meat for sausages, tripe, and things like that.  A building is always useful, if only as a shelter for cattle, or for foddering cattle, while the upper portion could provide a home for jackdaws. The Minister could give us some idea of the cost and why it should fall on the State.  Does he anticipate that the cost will be so heavy that the ordinary trade cannot bear it, and that for want of a better name a speculative trader will not take the risk involved? If the ordinary trader will not take the risk, is it fair to ask the taxpayers to take it?  The ordinary trader has experience of the trade, but the ordinary taxpayer cannot be expected to have it.</P>

      <P>When we introduced a voluntary scheme for fixing prices last year the merchants were got to accept it in practically every town where oats and barley are bought.  That was for last year only.  However, there were two or three counties where we did not get merchants to adopt it.  Suppose we were to fix a price for oats and barley, and that no merchant could be got to buy oats and barley, what are we to do except to erect stores, or buy stores, or having taken stores that are already there, give them by lease, sell them to co-operative societies, or carry on the business ourselves.  That is the necessity for this section.  There is always a necessity for sections like this in this sort of legislation, where people may refuse to carry out the provisions of an Act, either for financial or political reasons.  If the whole business of the country is going to be held up for such reasons, we must be prepared, by having power to take over existing businesses, having paid fair compensation, and either leasing or letting them to other people, or carrying on the business ourselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the amount we intend to spend, we have circulated a Supplementary Estimate for the Department of Agriculture, but we have not included any expenditure under this head, because we do not think it will be necessary in the near future to <Col N="2298" /> spend money for this purpose.  As Deputies are aware, before spending any money a Supplementary Estimate has to be introduced, and the Dáil will be fully aware of anything that is being spent for this purpose.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid coming events cast their shadows before them. The Minister has now disclosed his fears as to where he is travelling. Last year there was an inducement to buy.  I think he was referring to the spring price for corn, and the guarantee from the Government that if the merchants found corn on their hands at a certain date, it would be bought up.  In a few places, I believe the Minister was not able to find merchants who would fall into line and accommodate themselves to that situation. I think he insinuated that there was a loss there.  Now he fears an extension of that to the whole country. That is exactly the point I was making, but I did not come down to the details that the Minister has accommodatingly come down to.  He fears he will fix a price based on certain things, and that at that price he may not find traders to buy.  The trader buys to sell in a consumption market, and if the Minister fixes a price that is above the lawful price in that consumption market, then the trader cannot buy, because there is nothing in it for him.  He can only buy and sell to &ldquo;make a bit.&rdquo;  If the price fixed is such that he cannot buy at his price or is such that he cannot use the corn to produce beef, pork, etc., then the trader cannot do business. That is the crux of the whole thing.  The Minister says that if he cannot do business he will come along and take the risk.</P>

Has the Minister not made the point that if there is a fear that the ordinary trader will not buy at the price fixed, as an alternative the Government must have stores.  The Government will go into business, and <Col N="2299" /> they will pay the price.  I take it the Minister has said that, and I am discussing that point.  The Minister is afraid that the price he must fix, in order in some way to approximate with the formula he promised the House he was going to use, to cover the cost of production plus a margin of profit&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Part IV of the Bill contains provisions relating to the sale and purchase of oats and barley and the milling of oatmeal, and the point the Deputy is now raising was discussed on Part IV.  This section deals with the erection of corn stores, but the Deputy is not in order in discussing the price of corn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>If I may mention a few connecting links, the Minister does not want stores if the corn can be disposed of in the ordinary trade.  He is going to fix a price by a section of the Bill, but when the ordinary trader has to pay that price to the farmer producer, the Minister is afraid that the trader will go out of business rather than pay it.  I am sure the Minister is conscious that the trader cannot remain in trade if he has to pay that price.  Hence the Minister wants power in Section 87 to erect stores, and there being so much moisture in our corn, he wants to have kilns to dry it.  It is in reference to that point that I mentioned the price. I am not dealing with what the price should be, although price is the prime factor necessitating this section.</P>

      <P>I am not talking of the producer or the consumer now.  I am dealing with the storage of corn by the Government and the necessity for it. The ordinary trader will not handle it. That is quite obvious and logical from the statement of the Minister.  The Minister realises that danger and that weakness in the whole of this Bill. Until yesterday he did not tell us that he considered the use of it would be as an element in the fixing of the price.</P>

      <P>The Deputy himself has wisely said that the question of price was dealt with in other sections of the Bill.  Surely the factors to be taken into consideration by the Minister in fixing the price have nothing whatever to do with the erection of grain stores or giving the Minister power to acquire land for the erection of stores.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is no danger that the ordinary flow of trade will not be held up, then there is no necessity for these powers.  It is because of the danger that the ordinary flow and exchange of trade will be held up that it is necessary to have these stores. The Minister wants the burden that the ordinary trade will refuse to carry taken off the ordinary trade, which is in the hands of experts, and taken up by civil servants who are not experts. I should like the Minister to explain where he proposes to find a market.</P>

      <P>Can I put it this way? For what purpose is the grain to be stored?  Why should the Government ask for stores for grain?  What do they want to store it for?  Before the Minister gets the power and spends the money to store this grain, I should like to know what need there is for storing this grain in this coming year that was not there last year or the year before when the area under oats and barley was at least as much as it was this year and when the crop was more prolific. I suggest that the only reason for storing it is that there will not be an outlet.  He is going to store something that there may never be an outlet for and the loss will fall on the taxpayer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, in defending his claim to the powers set out in Section 87, said they were necessary to ensure the successful operation of such a price-fixing scheme as he embarked on last year, when he said: &ldquo;Certain merchants for financial and <Col N="2301" /> political reasons refused to operate my scheme.&rdquo;  That is about the weakest defence I have ever heard put up in this House for power to acquire stores and grain kilns when we remember the catastrophic result of the Minister's intervention in the grain situation last year.  If the Minister's intervention with his grain kilns and stores is to be anything like his intervention in the grain situation last season, that is the most potent argument that could be advanced against giving the powers he seeks under Section 87.  He summoned his experts around him last year; he assessed the quantity of oats in the country, and he forced the cereal content of the maize-meal mixture up to 40 per cent., thereby substantially increasing the cost of the mixture to the farmers and, at the same time, substantially reducing its value as a fattening agent.  Having compelled the feeding community to bear that burden, we arrived at the conclusion of the season about a month ago to find that there were no oats left. The Minister has made such an error in his calculations and forced so much oats into the maize-meal mixture that he has denuded the market and driven the staple of the poor people's diet&mdash; oatmeal&mdash;up to a price that it has not touched since 1925.</P>
      <P>That is the success of the Minister for Agriculture in administering a price-fixing scheme last year.  He doubled the burden on the backs of the feeders; he seriously interfered with their market for disposing of their live stock; and he created a situation in which in the months of June, July and August, when potatoes are scarce and oatmeal is widely used, oatmeal reached a price higher than it had ever reached for seven years.  The success in administering that scheme is advanced here as a good reason for empowering him to take over grain stores and kilns and run them with an equal measure of success.  The grain merchants, who warned him of the folly of what he was embarking upon some months ago, have been amply vindicated and the Minister has been shown in this matter, as in almost every other matter to which he has put his hand, to be a grossly imcompetent man.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2302" /> It is very largely because he is a grossly incompetent man that we draw the attention of the House to the danger of putting added weapons in his hands.  He has got his majority downstairs in the Library and if we challenge a division on this they will all come trotting up.  They will not ask what they are voting about; they do not know what they are voting about; and they do not care what they are voting about.  They will all march into the Lobby and give him these powers, right or wrong.  But for the few members of the Party who happened to drift in here instead of camping in the Library, I think it is right that they should walk into the Lobby in full realisation of what they are doing.  They are simply giving matches to an infant child.  If he does not burn himself with them and burn a large section of the community, it will not be the fault of the Fianna Fáil Party. The Minister wants these powers simply because he and his colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, are labouring under the extraordinary misapprehension that they are better able to run everybody's business than anybody else in the country.  It will be a costly business to teach them that they cannot.  However, I note a valiant look of self-sacrifice on the face of every member of the Fianna Fáil Party.  They are apparently prepared to pay the price.  I wish they could be brought to remember, when they are paying this extravagant price for the lessons they are so painfully learning, that it is not their own money they are spending.</P>

      <P>The Deputy accepts the other half, I think.  The Deputy says, &ldquo;The grain merchants warned him of his folly.&rdquo;  There is not a single grain merchant whom I have met who has not said that I was right and that they were wrong.  Deputy O'Neill is sitting behind Deputy Dillon and he knows what the grain merchants said, as he was at the meetings.  The grain merchants and the maize millers said that we could not put up a scheme for the use of the oats and barley in this country.  I said that we could; they said that we could not, and that is the difference between us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was right and they were wrong, and now Deputy Dillon comes in here and talks about the grain merchants who warned me of my folly.  It was I who warned them of their folly, and they admit it now, those of them who are honest enough to admit it.  I met the maize millers a month ago, and they admitted that they were wrong when they did not do what I asked them to do last year.  They approve of this Bill that is being brought in now. They know this scheme can now be worked.  They have discovered from experience that it can be.  Deputy Dillon said the voluntary scheme was a huge success.  It is to remedy defects in that scheme that we want this clause.  In the case of the last scheme there were certain counties in which merchants would not work it.  The co-operative societies would work it if they had the stores.  The merchants had stores lying idle and they would not give them to the co-operative societies.  We are now taking power to take those stores from the merchants and hand them to the co-operative societies if the merchants are not prepared to use them.  It is because we stand for the farmers and the producers and it is because we may deprive some of the merchants of their illegitimate profits that we have Deputy Dillon and others criticising our action.  I have never known Deputy Dillon to stand <Col N="2304" /> for anybody only what he calls the business community, whoever the business community in this country may be.</P>

      <P>Yes, for fattening.  The Deputy ought not to take it for granted that the Irish stuff is always inferior. He should try to look up these things and see what the scientists say about them.  These men carry out their duties in a scientific way and they have found that we can grow as good grain here as they can in America or in the Argentine.  It may be a blow to the Deputy to hear that we can do as well <Col N="2305" /> here as the people in other countries, but it is nevertheless true.  The Deputy should look up the records and inform himself on these matters before he makes any statements of the type he has made.  The Deputy talks about putting up profits.  That is what we are out to stop.  I said that this measure was not introduced for the benefit of the merchant or the maize miller.  We brought in the original Act in order to get the producing farmer the best price possible and to let the consumer get the article at the lowest possible price.  It is altogether for the benefit of the farmer.  What tends to reduce the profits of the middleman will never meet with approval from Deputy Dillon.</P>

      <P>It appears that the powers asked for by the Minister will not be used by him unless as a last resort.  I quite appreciate the reasons that have prompted the Minister to introduce this section.  I remember at the beginning of last season when oats were being marketed the Minister was endeavouring to come to some agreement with the merchants in regard to the price that would be paid for the oats at that particular period.  If my memory serves me right the Minister failed on that occasion to come to an agreement with the merchants.  There is absolutely no doubt that, as a result of that disagreement, thousands of farmers were compelled to sell their oats at prices ranging from 7/6 to 8/6 and 9/- per barrel, a price which, everyone must admit, taking everything into consideration, was not an economic price for the farmer.  After a few weeks the Minister came to an agreement with the merchants whereby a guaranteed price of 10/6 was decided upon.  Very many farmers had previously sold their oats at the very low prices to which I have referred. I think I would be right in saying that it is with a view to preventing that state of affairs taking place this year that the Minister seeks these powers in Section 87.  In regard to the buying of stores and the carrying on of business by the Minister and his officials, I think everyone will agree that it would be better if the necessity <Col N="2306" /> did not arise.  I want to press upon the Minister the necessity for coming to some agreement very early in the season as to what price he proposes to give for oats.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is more or less incidental to the point I am going to make in regard to the taking over of stores. It might happen that there would be disagreement over a price to the extent of 6d. or 1/- a barrel, and it might also be that the amount involved would be less than the amount of money which the Minister would spend in the acquisition of stores.  It would be better business if the Minister could come to an agreement with the merchants that would enable him to give a price to the farmer for his oats that would pay him and thus obviate the necessity of embarking on this venture in the taking over of stores.  Everybody knows that would be a very costly affair.  As the old saying goes, the cost might overcome the profit. One must admit that the Minister is making an honest effort to prevent a repetition of what took place last year, and my only hope, as representing a constituency in which oats are largely grown and in which very many farmers suffered serious losses in the early part of last year as a result of the low prices prevailing, is that something will be done this year that will recoup them for those losses.  I hope the Minister will come to some agreement that will enable the farmers, if there is a necessity to hold back their oats for a few weeks, to do so in the hope that such holding back will help to repay them.  I hope that the price agreed upon will be such as will meet with the general approval of those engaged in the industry.</P>

      <P>I may be excused for asking if it is the Minister's idea to have a guarantee to the corn merchants to have certain prices at certain times of the year?  That was the offer made last year.  I admit the Minister did make a success of this plan last year in that he absorbed the whole of the oats grown, but at an enormous cost, and conferred benefit, generally in the case of purchasers who were persons of a speculative turn of mind.  The advantage that the farmers derived in one way was countered again in a very decided way.  I agree that there is no fattening for cattle like maize and the Minister should know that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked the Minister a plain question.  He is asking power under Section 87 to run to kiln-dried and to store all the grain he may have.  I ask him this question.  As a result of his intervention in the grain situation last year, is it not true to say that the price of Indian meal mixture was substantially raised to the feeder?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not true, also, to say that the artificial scarcity of oats in June, July and August left the small farmer who was consuming oatmeal in the position that it raised the price from 16/- per ten-stone bag last April to 24/- per ten-stone bag to-day.  Will the Minister not agree with me that the burden of expense laid upon the <Col N="2309" /> fattening and consuming community if it could be assessed, is far greater than any advantage that accrued to the grain-grower in terms of money?  Would it not be cheaper from the point of view of those consumers if the grain-grower were given a subsidy out of the Central Fund, a subsidy furnished by the taxpayer.  That is all I ask.  I could agree if you fix a price, the right benefit that might flow from that course of action, but the burden of my case is that the Minister's fixed price makes it impossible to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I submit to the House that whenever a Minister who was a politician, surrounded by permanent officials who were civil servants, intervened in trade they must make a mess of it, and always have done so.  If you took 12 grain merchants and put them into the Department of Agriculture to do the work of the permanent officials, they would make a mess of it.  If you took 12 officials out of their offices and put them into a corn merchant's stores, they would make a mess of it.  Even if they came there under the leadership of the Minister for Agriculture of Saorstát Eireann they would nevertheless make a mess of it. That is what they did last year and that is what they will do every year.  The average person will be unable, at once, to measure the damage done because it is extremely difficult to estimate the added cost in the case of maize meal mixture.  But if all these costs were added together I venture to say that the Minister's interference would be shown to cost the consumers of grain, who are almost exclusively the small farmers, something like half a million sterling.  Is there any Deputy in this House who imagines that when he gave the Minister for Agriculture power to fix the price and percentage of maize meal mixture, he gave him power to lay upon the backs of the small farmers of the country a financial burden of not less than £500,000? This section is going to give him permanent power at his own sweet will, or any other Minister for Agriculture, to repeat or increase that burden when everything is fixed.  I think Deputies should fully realise what they are doing when they accept this section of <Col N="2310" /> the Bill.  Of course, Deputies not familiar with the consuming end of the business&mdash;the pig business, the fowl business, and the cattle business&mdash;may not know these things.  They do not know that the small farmers along the western seaboard during the months when potatoes are short consume meal instead.  If they did they would see that these people got a fair crack of the whip and that substantial justice was done them.  It is not substantial justice to take £500,000 from one section of the community and to hand it over to another section of the community.</P>

      <P>This difficulty arises if there is a statutory obligation on a Minister to render accounts.  That statutory obligation is regulated by the Comptroller and Auditor-General and gives the Department of Finance the right to demand whatever form of accounts they want.  They have a very strong prejudice against ordinary trading or profit and loss accounts. What they regard as accounts are the accounts of outgoing and incoming receipts.  From that point of view they are of no value whatever.  They require profit and loss accounts.  I have no objection whatever to the Ministry of Finance getting any accounts in whatever form they want them, but I also want them to provide Dáil Eireann with a commercial profit and loss account so that ordinary members of the House will be able to assess the true condition of whatever enterprise the Minister is engaged in, and if there is a statutory obligation on the Minister to prepare such accounts, it will be within the competence of the Public Accounts Committee, for instance, to ask for their production.  If that is not so, then the Public Accounts Committee cannot demand such accounts as of right.  I have no objection to the section or the amendment, provided that the Minister, on the Report Stage, will take it on himself and on the Minister for Industry and Commerce to furnish profit and loss accounts as well as the other accounts.</P>

The Minister will find that the suggestion to delete that section came from the Department of Finance and I press on him that this is an occasion on which, while giving the Department of Finance everything they want and giving them no cause for complaint, he should also say that, looking at it from a business point of view, he wants to see those accounts from the point of view of the ordinary commercial profit and loss accounts.</P>

      <P>It is all right to be taken on as an inspector.  You or I or anybody else might be taken on. But it is on the expert knowledge of the inspectors that the whole economic position of the country will depend. Just imagine the case of a man with 200 or 300 stall-fed cattle.  These men come in to his premises, mark those cattle and set down the date on which they are to be slaughtered.  I do not think there is a man in the country or in the world who could do that. Anyhow, the Minister thinks otherwise. I am not considering whether there is or there is not a person to be got capable of doing it, but I would like to know what the Minister has in mind as to how he is to proceed to get the best inspectors he can out of the materials at his disposal; and what way he intends to proceed to get them?  The Appointments Commission is the machinery, I suppose, through which they will be got.</P>

It is a stupendous job; how many inspectors will he appoint?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure about the number, but there will probably be <Col N="2318" /> about 100.  The positions will be advertised in the ordinary way by the Civil Service Commissioners.  The candidates will stand an educational test first&mdash;a written examination&mdash;and then those who will have passed the educational tests will be examined by a selection board as to their knowledge of cattle.  How that is to be done will be a matter for the Civil Service Commissioners.  Even if I had my own views about that I would not be at liberty to instruct them how to proceed. We say to the Civil Service Commissioners that we want men with a practical knowledge of cattle.  It is for the Civil Service Commissioners to decide how these men are to be tested for the positions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>At what stage are they going to mark the cattle?  There is a section in the Bill that these inspectors must define the date on which the cattle are to be slaughtered and the date on which the owner is to start fattening or tieing them up.  This Bill is fixing the date before which cattle cannot be slaughtered.  The Minister will acknowledge that that is a very delicate and difficult thing.  You will want standards of fattening before anybody can decide those questions. The Government should not travel too quickly on this road.  The Minister should give the House some idea as to how he will get these men.  It would be well now to know the remuneration those men will get.  That remuneration will be an index of the standard that will be required of them. The whole success of the working of this Bill when it becomes an Act will depend upon the confidence the public will have in those inspectors.  If the public have not confidence in those inspectors, not all the Parties in this House if they were to unite could administer the Act.  That is to say, unless the people have confidence in the inspectors.  The key of this Bill when it becomes an Act will be the inspectors, and I submit that the Minister should give the House some <Col N="2319" /> idea as to how he is going to recruit them.  He should tell the House what practical knowledge he will require and what standards he is going to have.  I cannot visualise how any man &mdash;even if he knew all the theoretical knowledge that is written about feeding&mdash;will be able to judge a beast so as to be able to say that a beast that is quarter-fat, half-fat or three-quarters-fat, will be fully fat on a certain day, provided uniformity of feeding goes on, uniformity of health and all that kind of thing.  No man can do that except a man with 100 per cent. practical knowledge, and practical knowledge comes only from experience. You only get experience by age.  How can you get a bunch of 100 young fellows to have that practical knowledge? I think the Minister is expecting to get 100 men who were not obtainable in this or any other country.</P>

      <P>I do not visualise a man going in on a farm looking at cattle and saying: &ldquo;There are four cattle which are fit for slaughter in a week, four more which are fit for slaughter in a month, and four more which are fit for slaughter in a month's time.&rdquo; What he will do will be to mark out certain cattle which he says will be fit for slaughter, say that day week.  He will then say: &ldquo;I will come back and see the rest of them in three weeks' time.&rdquo;  We do not expect him to mark the cattle three months ahead.  We just expect him to say what cattle are fit for slaughter, say in a week, or in a fortnight at the outside.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course the whole truth about this business of inspectors and examining cattle is that the Minister is taking over holus bolus these provisions from the British Bill. It is because Mr. Elliot has put all these things into his Bill, and possibly because Mr. Elliot has said that these things can be done, that our Minister also thinks they can be done.  But Mr. Elliot and Dr. Ryan are going to get the shock of their lives.  It will not take 100 inspectors to carry out this Act; it will take 1,000.  And every expectant follower of Fianna Fáil will be queuing up at the office of the Civil Service Commissioners, praying that his ship will come home and that he will be appointed an inspector under this Act.  I do not believe that 100 inspectors will cover the country or anything like it.  When you realise that under this Bill it will become an offence to offer for sale any beast that has not been certified by a Government inspector as being fit for sale for slaughter, or that has not been certified as being fit for slaughter, just conceive a fair in any of the country towns with which we are familiar with small farmers coming in from all sides.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have yet to hear from the Minister how he will differentiate between two men standing in the fair both with cattle which might be classed as forward stores or classed as cattle fit for slaughter for local consumption, and the man who is selling cattle admittedly for slaughter. The man who says &ldquo;these are only four months stores&rdquo; can sell them whether they are marked or not.  The man who says &ldquo;I am hoping that whoever will buy these will slaughter them,&rdquo; commits an offence unless he has had them marked.  We must assume that the inspectors will be entitled to say in respect of certain cattle: &ldquo;It does not matter what you <Col N="2321" /> say; these cattle are fit for slaughter and should be marked.&rdquo;  The end of it will be, that 80 per cent. of the cattle will be marked for safety or the owner will try to get them marked. They will apply to the inspector to come and mark them in order that they can get leave to sell them for slaughter or for consumption.  How many inspectors will it take to go round the district, covering the land of every small farmer, prior to a medium sized fair?  The inspector will have to go in on the land.  The cattle will have to be found and shown to him.  Can we imagine that he will examine the cattle and mark them in less than half an hour on each farm? If we say that in the half hour we make allowance for the time he will be travelling from one farm to another, working eight hours or ten hours a day, without any stop to get a bit to eat, he will examine cattle on 20 farms. Yet the Minister tells me that 100 inspectors will be sufficient to mark all the cattle in the country.  Does any Deputy in the House believe it?  I am convinced that this scheme will break down.  It is impracticable, but at least we ought to realise what it is going to mean.  Does any Deputy in the House really feel that the small farmers of this country will conform to a practice whereunder they are not allowed to take a beast to a fair without asking leave of an inspector?  Does anybody in this House believe that the taxpayers of this country want to pay sufficient inspectors to inspect beasts and fix a day for their slaughter? Deputy Belton has referred to the qualifications of these men.  Any man who has to live by cattle raising or has cattle on his land, considers himself to be as good a judge as his neighbour of the quality of his cattle. The Minister forecasts that 100 young men, not necessarily with any qualifications of a special character, but just men with general experience, who will satisfy three gentlemen sitting in Dublin that they know something about cattle, are going to be given the right to walk into any farmer's house and tell him what cattle he may sell and what cattle he may not sell.  The question of telling a man what cattle <Col N="2322" /> he will sell will arise on another section.  We are now considering the question of inspectors.  Just imagine what we are being asked to do&mdash;to give the Minister authority to appoint an unlimited number of inspectors at a salary yet to be defined to examine every head of cattle and every sheep in this country.  And it is all because Mr. Elliot says it can be done!  That is quite good enough for the Minister for Agriculture for Saorstát Eireann.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this discussion is scarcely relevant to the appointment of inspectors, but of course one must make allowance for Deputy Dillon's ramblings on this as on every other section that comes before the House.  I should like Deputy Dillon to point to any single section in this Bill that in any way resembles the British Bill.  If we had the same problem in this country as they have in Britain, I do not say that I would be a bit beyond copying the British Bill, but we have not the same problem and there is not a single section in the Bill which is similar to the British Bill.  Deputy Dillon takes it for granted that we copied the British Bill.  Of course that is what he would do.  He copies everything British.  He always has and always will copy everything British.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are looking for inspectors.  &ldquo;Experts&rdquo; is a superlative term.  I was told at one time that there is no such thing as an expert.  All we can do is to get these men as expert as possible for their work.  These men will be paid about £5 10s. per week plus travelling expenses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>£5 10s. a week!  Every single one of them will take bribes. They ought to get £500 or £1,000 a year to keep them free from bribery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are men in this country who would not take bribes if they were only getting £1 a week, but Deputy Belton may not know them.  If Deputy Belton were moving in honest circles he would know them.  Deputy Dillon just shows what he knows when <Col N="2323" /> he says that the inspector will take half an hour to mark the cattle.  They would want to be expert inspectors to mark a man's cattle in half an hour.  If a small farmer brings his cattle to the fair, unless a butcher who is going to kill them buys them, there is no obligation on the farmer to hold them back.  Unless the butcher buys them to bring them to slaughter, the farmer can sell.  If the marking provisions are in force, the butcher cannot take the beast unless it is marked.  But the marking provisions may not be in force all the time.  That part of the Act may be operative only during part of the year.  If it is operative, the beast cannot be bought unless it is marked.</P>

      <P>I do not want, on this section, to cover ground that would be more appropriately covered under another section but I do not want to let an opportunity, which may not arise upon another section, pass.  Surely the Minister sees the key position in which these inspectors will be placed.  You will get men at a £1, £1 10s. 0d. or £2 per week to do their job honourably but why do we pay judges a high salary?  In order that they will deal out justice.  Here, we are offering men only £5 10s. 0d. per week to mark cattle honestly showing that they will be fit for sale on a certain date and not before.  One of these men earning £4 or £5 a week may be offered £20 by a big cattle man to let his cattle out.  Does the Minister contemplate being able to employ 100 men in a temporary capacity&mdash;I take it that this will be a temporary job&mdash;who will be proof against the temptation to accept a sum of £20 to let cattle through?</P>

      <P>The customs official carries out certain duties in the way of examination and collection but he is supervised.  These men will go on to a farm or into a yard and examine cattle to see if they are fit for sale.  I take it that their word will be final. In the other service, you have an organisation with a tradition.  Men who left the service are enjoying the pension they earned.  This is a new idea and it is designed to meet an emergency.  I think that it has come to the Minister's notice that when he issued licences in the beginning of this year there was trafficking in them before they were a week old.  Will there not be trafficking in these permits?  Of course there will.  You would get fellows who might be regarded as experts who would give £5 10s. 0d. a week for one of these jobs and make a good thing out of it.  Some of them would give £20 a week and make a good thing out of it.  Deputies know that that is true.  If a good type of man is not got for this job it will mean corruption from beginning to end. A higher salary will have to be paid than is proposed in order that the inspector may feel that it is worth his while minding the job and that a sum of £20 would not compensate him for the risk of being found out and losing the job.  Penalties are prescribed in this Bill for practically every human being in the country but no penalty is prescribed for the inspector who does not act straight.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister will deal with what I have to say in qualification of Deputy Belton's remarks. The logical conclusion of Deputy Belton's argument as to raising the salary of inspectors is that we ought to send out High Court judges to mark the cattle.  That is the logical conclusion. Of course, that is right at the very foundation of our whole objection to this bureaucratic interference with the everyday life of the people.  We are going to appoint a number of inspectors at £5 or £5 10s. a week.  These men will be the judge between me and my neighbour.  My whole means of livelihood is going to be passed upon by these young men who will be sent out all over the country.  When it is a matter of a dispute between me and my neighbour we pay judges £1,700 a year and the Chief Justice £2,500 a year or more, and we hedge them round with every kind of protection in order that they will do equity between two citizens.  But under this Bill we quite calmly announce that we are going to send a horde of inspectors all over the country at £5 a week who will be the absolute arbiters of a man's means of <Col N="2327" /> livelihood.  That is, of course, the whole objection to bureaucracy&mdash; making the people of a country the slaves of permanent officials.  It is wrong.</P>
      <P>The Cereals Bill and this Bill are founded on bureaucracy.  A situation is rapidly developing wherein no citizen of this State will be able to undertake any legal activity whatever without a licence from one inspector or another. Sooner or later, when that develops far enough, there is going to be a terrific burst up.  The people will revolt against it.  It is a rotten tendency.  It is very widespread all over the world at the present time. Almost every Government in the world has come to the conclusion that it can run the everyday affairs of its citizens better than the citizens themselves. Bureaucracy is rampant, and we are getting into the same groove.  It is expensive and inefficient and it is tyrannical.  These inspectors, no matter what personal virtues they may have, will be the instruments of that inefficiency, extravagance and tyranny every day that they are out through the country.</P>

      <P>The objection that Deputy Dillon has given expression to, in so far as the inspectors are concerned, could be applied to every walk of life.  At the Horse Show this week one will find farmers' stock paraded before inspectors who give decisions as to their qualities.  It is the same through the country.  Shows of various kinds are held.  Cattle are paraded before inspectors at different centres and they give decisions as to their qualities.  You have bull shows and heifer shows held through the country at certain periods of the year.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>These inspectors, who are just human beings like the rest of us, give decisions according to the best of their knowledge and experience.  The people who exhibit the stock are not always satisfied with these decisions.  One man may feel <Col N="2328" /> that a decision given to some other person should have been in his favour, but the inspectors, being human beings, have to decide such matters almost every day in the week.  They had to do so long before it was decided to introduce this Bill.  That is my reply to the objections Deputy Dillon has raised in the case of the inspectors. Deputy Belton stated that these men would have to be of an exceptionally good type because otherwise, as he said, cattle traders, feeders, and others might come along and say to one of them: &ldquo;I will give you £25 or £30 if you mark so many cattle for me.&rdquo; The reply that I have made to Deputy Dillon applies here also.  I instanced for him the case of Customs officials who are employed along the Border.</P>

      <P>They are employed there by the Department of Finance at £2 10s. or £2 15s. a week.  Some of them are working on approved routes.  If Deputy Dillon's argument is to be accepted, a business man might approach one of these men and ask him to allow a ton of sugar or some other dutiable goods to be brought across the Border free.  The Deputy's reasoning and argument could be applied to every walk of life.  If that is the conception that Deputy Dillon has of human nature, bad as it is, well, it is a fairly low conception indeed.  I do not share his view.  If you get together 100 individuals for any purpose you will not find that all of them will be perfect men, no matter what standard you set and no matter what type of examination you hold; but taking this question in general, I fail to see how it should be impossible to get men who will decide on the merits of the case.  I do not think that the fears expressed by Deputy Belton are legitimate.  If they are, then the same fears can be expressed in relation to other positions as well as those to which this measure will apply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If you have to buy his honesty then you would be better off without him.  So far as the farmer is concerned, we have temporary men dealing with things of far more importance than the work that will have to be done under this Bill.  For instance, there is the question of licences for bulls.  Whether a licence is issued or not may mean anything from £25 to £30 to a farmer.  We have temporary men doing that work.  Bulls are passed or rejected on their report.  Then we have our own inspectors in the Department of Agriculture.  They are not highly paid.  They pass bulls for premiums, and a premium is going to make a difference in the price of a bull of in or about £30.  I have never heard of even one case where anything wrong took place in connection with these premiums.  I am sure there never has been a case although it would pay a man to offer a bribe in order to get a premium.</P>
      <P>As regards the number of inspectors, what I said was that we mean to appoint from 100 to 120 when the Bill goes through.  We do not mean to implement the marking provisions of the Bill immediately.  When they are implemented by order, then we will want up to 300 inspectors.  The question of the census does not arise at present.  These 100 inspectors will be there to operate the fixing of prices and the provision dealing with free meat.  If there is any complaint or report that a butcher bought a beast under the fixed price, an inspector will go to his shop and examine his books to find out whether the complaint is right or wrong.  They will also look after individual contracts as regards the free meat issued.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the whole Bill is rotten.  I just put this to the <Col N="2330" /> Minister, whether he would consider the question of consolidating all the veterinary duties that are at present being carried out under a variety of Acts: the Dairy Inspection Act, the Meat Inspection Act, the Bovine Tuberculosis Act and others, and see whether it would be possible to have all these duties centred in one individual in a smaller area than is at present covered by each individual appointment.  It seems to me that many of the duties which will have to be discharged under this Bill could be done by the same individual: that a good many jobs could be attended to by the one individual on the same trip.  One can well imagine that an inspector for store cattle or fat cattle would be able to examine for bovine tuberculosis as well.  I have not a scheme worked out in my mind, but I throw out the suggestion to the Minister.  I think it is one that is worth looking into.</P>

I understand that the marketing question is left for a later day.  I should like to know from the Minister how an inspector can turn around and see that the butcher pays say 25/- a cwt. for cattle.  An inspector is to be appointed under this section, and I should like the Minister to tell me in as few words as possible how he is going to carry out the duty which the Minister intends him to carry out. If a butcher comes out to a fair he will probably buy cattle.  He will probably buy them for £10 or £11 a head as the case may be.

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The significance is that in the Public Offices (Fees) Act there are certain provisions which it might be very difficult to observe in this connection. For instance we could not take cash.  I am not sure whether we could take postal orders, but I think we could take only money orders in the case of fees.  If our inspectors are going around and are offered a registration fee in cash by a butcher we might be very glad to take it, and allow the inspector to send it on to us.  One could imagine various occasions on which we might like to be exempt from the Public Offices (Fees) Act.  In the case I have mentioned we would have to send back the cash to the butcher, and tell him to send us a money order instead.</P>

      <P>It was passed for some purpose at the time.  It has been in operation for about 60 years, and the abuse which it was introduced to correct has entirely disappeared. People have forgotten all about it. The legislators of those days were no fools, and they may have found that accepting fees in coin or currency resulted in the promotion of embezzlement. It is for that reason that they passed this Act.  Is it wise to go back of that in order to serve some trifling expediency, because bear in mind that if sub-section (2) passes in this Act the Public Offices (Fees) Act is finished. Every Minister will use this as a precedent whenever he wants to get rid of the formalities required by the Public Offices (Fees) Act of 1879.  I do not press the point, but it is perhaps a matter which the Minister will ask his Department to enquire into between this and the Report Stage. Unless the Minister has some precedent, or thinks it is very necessary, I suggest that he should drop sub-section (2).</P>

Otherwise, you might have the case of people applying for a licence to the Local Government Department being asked: &ldquo;Are there any sanitary regulations in connection with slaughter houses in, say, Offaly&rdquo; and the answer being that there are&mdash;that the county council adopted some Sanitary Act in 1905, the statute then prohibits the Minister from issuing a licence to that party until he has sent down an inspector to satisfy himself that that party is complying with the provisions of some Sanitary Regulation, the existence of which may be forgotten by everybody in Offaly, and the record of which remains lying in the Department of Local Government and Public Health.

      <P>This situation may arise, a person may contemplate taking certain action in the event of A.B. not being on the register.  He would know that there would be no use <Col N="2339" /> in taking action if A.B. were on the register.  That person may not want to show that he is concerned to know whether A.B. is on the register or not, until he is sure, so he pays one shilling and runs down the column.  If he cannot find the name, he proceeds to take whatever action he contemplated.  That is what that provision was originally put there for.  I imagine that in 90 cases out of 100 it would be used by solicitors or persons in that capacity who want to refer to the register.  I cannot imagine that it involves any great cost, while it is one of those checks on bureaucratic control upon which I set a certain value.  It gives a citizen a certain right to check up things for himself, and to prevent him doing that frivolously he is charged a nominal fee.  I submit to the Minister that it is a bad principle to wipe that provision out of existence No matter how excellent permanent officials are, there is a constant trend towards strengthening their hold, and restricting the right of the citizen to interfere in matters in which they are concerned.  It is bad to yield to that pressure.  As the Minister says, other Acts which provide for registers provide for the right of the individual citizen to go and examine them.  I urge him strongly not to take that right away here.</P>

      <P>I do not like to force this amendment, because I am afraid the Deputies may think there is something in it which is really not intended.  Deputies should realise that, while some of these Acts have been in operation since 1924 this provision was never availed of in a single case.  At the same time it is a rather expensive matter.  It would be all right if we could wipe out the names in the folio, but occasionally the whole thing has to be revised, and there are so many alterations that it becomes rather unsightly.  We have to have it rewritten, which is rather expensive, yet it is never availed of.  The only case, I think, that Deputy Dillon <Col N="2340" /> has made is that a person may like to come and look at the register and not tell anybody what his business is.  I can hardly imagine how that could be because, if there is an illegality being committed or anything like that, naturally there is a report made by some inspector which goes to the Minister and action is taken. The only case in which we were ever asked for a certified copy, as far as I know, is in connection with court proceedings.  I think the ordinary citizen has never asked for it.  I should like the House to agree to the amendment, but I do not like to force it for fear I might appear to be doing something for which I have not stated the full reason.</P>

      <P>Surely in a Bill under which from 500 to 750 inspectors may be appointed at £5 10s. 0d. per week, plus travelling expenses, it is a poor thing to effect an economy at the expense of the register which the unfortunate citizen has for his inspection. It only requires an expenditure of about 30/- per year and for the preservation of his liberty spare him that, when you propose to spend his money to the tune of 750 times £5 10s. 0d. per week, and give him his 30/- per annum.  It cannot cost more than that.  It is a trifling concession to perhaps an old-fashioned reverence for personal liberty and an old-fashioned antagonism to the triumph of bureaucracy.</P>

      <P>I raised the question arising under paragraph (d), sub-section (3) of Section 12, as it appeared yesterday in the Cereals Bill.  That relates to the power vested in the Minister to withdraw a man's registration for no <Col N="2343" /> other reason than that he has been adjudicated bankrupt.  Has the Minister had time to consider that in connection with the Cereals Bill?</P>

      <P>The Minister prefers to retain that power.  I submit that it is trenching on the discretion of the Bankruptcy Court to inflict a penalty on a bankrupt over and above what the bankruptcy judge thinks just and equitable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I considered that amendment this morning in connection with the Cereals Bill and the same would apply here.  The Deputy will notice that the section says:&mdash;&ldquo;The Minister may at any time ... cancel the registration of any premises&rdquo; for the various reasons set out, one of which is being adjudicated bankrupt.  I think that the Minister would not exercise that power of cancellation unless it was a very flagrant case and that the person should not be allowed again to deprive the sellers of cattle of part of the price due to them, as he may have deprived them before his bankruptcy took place.  But in a case where a person had made a very good settlement and done his best to pay off his creditors, and where it appeared that the man was making an honest attempt to go on with his business again, I do not think any Minister will exercise this power.  It has been put into all these Acts.  I have, however, ascertained to-day that that power has never been exercised so far under any Act.  No Minister so far has exercised that power of taking a man off the register because he has been adjudicated bankrupt.  Although there have been cases of bankruptcy, the Minister concerned in each case thought it was only fair to give the bankrupt another chance.  Evidently he was impressed with the reports he got that the bankrupt was inclined to make good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a grave matter. It is not a crime in this country to go bankrupt; and it is not a misdemeanour; <Col N="2344" /> it is not a breach of the law.  It is merely compliance with certain statutes which provide a certain course of action by a person who finds himself unable to meet his commitments.  The bankruptcy code lays down a very exhaustive scheme to deal with the affairs of such a person.  In no part of that is the person held up to odium as a miscreant or a person who has done anything wrong or who is necessarily deserving of censure.  Why should we make it the occasion of prohibiting him from engaging in a certain trade, over and above whatever restrictions may be placed upon his activities by the bankruptcy judge who has heard all the details of his case?  The Minister said yesterday that the reason we would prevent him specially from dealing in cereals, while we would have no power to prevent him dealing in boots, groceries and drapery, is that he would ordinarily be dealing direct with the farmer as a producer if he was dealing in cereals, and we want to protect the farmer because the farmer may think that while he is on the register we vouch for him. I think that is going too far to accommodate carelessness on the part of a person selling or buying, and it is putting a stigma on the man who may have gone bankrupt through no fault of his own and it is trenching on a province which, in my opinion, this Bill should not touch upon at all, and that is the province of the general scheme of bankruptcy law which is no simple matter to consider much less to handle in this offhand way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Broderick Mr. Broderick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broderick</NameTxt>
      <P>Under paragraph (e) in this section it sets out that the Minister may cancel registration if the registered proprietor of such premises has been convicted of an offence under any section of this Act. There appears to be contained there an enormous power.  A man may be convicted in perfect innocence.  He may not be aware of the working of the Act, yet if he is convicted it is in the power of the Minister to put him out of business altogether. <Col N="2345" /> Once you deprive him of his registered premises he is out of business. I think that is extremely drastic.  It is an arbitrary power not demanded by the circumstances of the moment. I would ask you seriously to reconsider the drafting of that particular portion of the Bill.  It is quite conceivable that for a trifling offence a strong opinion may be held on it and a conviction may result. The moment that happens the Minister has power to put the man out of business altogether.  I am quite satisfied that the Minister is not going to do anything harsh or use this power drastically, but nevertheless it is a power that ought to be considerably restricted.  It means life or death for anyone in the business.  Any offence against the Act, no matter how trivial, that results in a conviction will enable the Minister to use this power.  You are not dealing with men who are aware of the law in this particular connection, and power of that kind in the hands of the Minister ought to be surrounded by very careful restrictions and regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We could not operate an Act like this unless that provision were there.  It might be that a person would find it paid him to be convicted occasionally.  For instance, a person continuously trafficking in free meat tickets might make a big profit and it might pay him to be convicted every three or six months. We might catch him out only at such periods although he would be carrying on all the time.  The only thing in such a case would be to remove him from the register.  There are other offences, such as not paying the fixed price, and if a person were convicted on a number of occasions, the only way we could deal with him would be to remove him from the register. That power is certainly necessary. We have much greater power in the Cereals Act.

      <P>On the point you have raised, that is, the question of <Col N="2346" /> the fraudulent use of the tickets, I would be the last man in the world to defend a person guilty of such conduct. As regards anyone convicted for such an offence, there is no alternative to putting him off the register.  It must be remembered, however, that in this case you are not dealing with people who can afford to have typists and clerks.  This thing will be a very big strain on them from the point of view of trying to keep their accounts.  There may be a trifling offence where there is no intention to deceive and where they are doing their best to comply with the law.  In such a case I think the power of removing that person from the register is a power that the Minister should not have.  As regards the power to deal with people guilty of fraudulent acts.  I am in favour of giving it no matter how drastic it would be.</P>

I cannot see why he should take it upon himself to be the sole judge.  He might not have the same anxiety in a case as a district justice who would know the whole circumstances and who would have the evidence first hand.  I believe the District Justice would be the proper man to decide.</P>

      <P>Might I suggest to the Minister something which might meet the criticisms now offered?  He might in this section take power to cancel for a fixed or an indefinite period. He has power to cancel more or less definitely.  I do not see that he has the power to restore the registration. It is easy to see that there could be a good deal of harshness in dealing with a case where cancellation takes place.  The proprietor would then have no premises, nothing to look forward to in the way of getting back his business.  If the Minister takes power to cancel for a period only, then obviously there would be room for representation by the proprietor and he might mitigate any hardship that had arisen&mdash;hardship such as the people opposite have been describing. <Col N="2347" /> I think the section could be amended in that way so that there might be some means of appeal with regard to a particular sentence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>This section proposes to make a levy upon the butcher.  The Minister told us upon the Second Stage of the Bill that the one and only object of the Bill was to provide a market for our surplus cattle.  He now proposes under this section to impose a levy on cattle and sheep slaughtered here for consumption at home.  Then he went on to argue that the butcher was going to pay that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, the consumer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>That the consumer was going to pay that.  I should like to hear how the Minister reasons that out.  He proposes to fix a price which the butcher must pay.  He talked round a price of 25/- per cwt. which the butcher must pay.  Then he talked about £1 a head, which seemed to be something very provisional.  I think the Minister has in his mind something far above £1 a head for good beef. Therefore, for good beef he must have in mind something far above £1 per head&mdash;nearer £2 a head&mdash;and he asks this House and this country to believe that the butcher is going to pay that. It is a good butcher, even in the city of Dublin, who will kill six good beasts in a week and ten sheep&mdash;£6 for the beasts at £1 a head and £2 10s. 0d. for the sheep at 5/- a head&mdash;£8 10s. 0d. There is not a butcher in Dublin but <Col N="2351" /> would be glad, after paying all expenses and paying a foreman butcher's standard wages per week, to be able to say: &ldquo;I have £8 10s. 0d. profit after paying everything.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister thinks that that butcher is going to be able to continue and pay £8 10s. 0d.  Of course he is not. He is dealing with bullocks, heifers and sheep&mdash;killing them and turning them into meat&mdash;and he must get his profit.  The Minister says that he fixes a price which the butcher must pay, and because he fixes the price that the butcher must pay, it is either the butcher who must pay the levy or it is the consumer.  If the Minister would fix a price at the world price of beef and mutton and say that the butcher must pay that price, and, in addition, must pay the tax or the levy that the Minister imposes, then I agree with the Minister.  If the Minister will standardise his prices at the British prices&mdash;the Birkenhead prices&mdash;and say that the Dublin butcher must pay the Birkenhead prices and pay, in addition, a levy of £1 a head on cattle or 5/- a head in the case of sheep, and let him pass it on to the consumer, then I would agree with the Minister that either the butcher or the consumer pays that levy.  But if he will not pay world prices, or Birkenhead prices&mdash; which are synonymous terms&mdash;then the producer pays it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister talks of 25/-.  Why does he fix 25/-?  At the present time we have £6 of a duty on a ten cwt. beast going into Britain.  We have a quota for which the British issue licences.  They are handed out by the Minister to selected people, including Britishers.  The British exporter can come along and get licences from the Minister for Agriculture here, but the feeder and producer of Irish beef cannot get one unless he is a blackleg of the &ldquo;John Brown&rdquo; type.  The Britisher can get that licence.  What is it worth to him?  It is worth at least £5.  So, there is lopped off the world price of meat, that the Minister is dealing with in this Bill, £11&mdash;well, say, over 50 per cent.  Let us take it at 50 per cent., <Col N="2352" /> and after 20/- being paid here the world price of similar beef would be, roughly, £2.  The Minister's suggestion here, or the implication in his suggestion on the Second Stage, was that he had in mind 25/- a cwt. as the standard minimum price.  In connection with that 25/-, the Minister would turn round and say: &ldquo;Well, I am increasing the price of meat here 5/- a cwt.&rdquo;  He would be about 15/- a cwt. below the world price for such meat.  Therefore, he can fix a price that is a bit of an increase on the present artificial prices.  Nevertheless, out of whose pocket is this £1 coming? It can only come out of the pocket of the man who is not getting the world price of meat.  It can only come out of the pocket of the producer&mdash;not of the consumer, nor of the butcher.  That is what the Minister proposes to put over by levying on the butcher the £1 after the Minister fixes for the producer in this country a standard price &mdash;that is, 15/- a cwt. below the world price.</P>
    <P>In a previous Bill which we had today the Minister is attempting to fix a price, by manipulating mixtures, for home-grown grain.  This is the market for home-grown grain.  There is no other market.  This is the market here also in this connection, and the market here, as fixed by this Bill, will be 15/- a cwt. of beef below the world market price.  Therefore, the fixed price of home-grown grain must be a corresponding percentage below the world price of grain.  Because the Minister does not come up to the world standard prices&mdash;wholesale prices&mdash;he is taking it out of the pockets of the producer.  This is his levy of £1.  If that £1 was not there, it is equivalent, I suppose, roughly, to at least 2/- a cwt.  Instead of 25/- it should be 27/-, and still you would be 13/- below the world price, or the price at Birkenhead.</P>
    <P>I challenge the Minister to take any bunch of cattle he likes: weigh them in on a Dublin scales: put them on the Dublin market; let him pick 50 per cent. of the worst of them; put licences on them; and send them over to Birkenhead&mdash;I will bet him that I will get 100 per cent. more for them in Birkenhead.</P>

      <P>The producer is paying this levy and he has to accept from the Government here a standard fixed price of 15/- less than he would have to accept if we had a commonsense Government in this country.  The producer has to accept 15/- less.  The butcher is paying that much less.  The butcher is asked to pay £1 more but he is not going to pay it.  That extra £1 will go on the consumer.  It has been already taken off the producer who has to accept 15/- less than the world price.  As a sop to the alleged tillage farmers we are to have the price of our cereals fixed by a mixture, increasing the percentage if there is a surplus left and diminishing the percentage if there is not.  Anybody who has a store and who will not trade according to orders must get out; his store will be taken from him.  This is the ultimate market of our producers; this is the ultimate market and it is going to mean 25/- for beef.  That ultimate market will regulate the prices for oats and barley and it is no matter what any little Hitler may do in Merrion Street.

      <P>Deputy Belton challenged the Minister to fix a minimum price for cattle on the basis of <Col N="2355" /> prices in the world market.  Before the Minister decides whether he will accept it I think it might be as well if an alternative basis of prices were put forward.  I offer the Minister the basis of the cost of production according to his own Department's experts.  Some time ago I gave in this House figures that were taken from those issued by his own inspectors.  I took the cost of production of one cwt. of beef live weight.  To refresh the Minister's memory I will quote the figures again. Beef cannot certainly be produced more cheaply than store cattle and this is the production cost of store cattle:&mdash; Seven cwts. of hay, 28 cwts. of silage and two cwts. of crushed oats were fed to two lots of cattle in 112 days.  One of the lots gained threequarters of a lb. per head per day and the other lot gained one lb. per day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGovern</NameTxt>
      <P>I have it nearly off.  I have practically the whole statement finished, and by mentioning it now the Minister will have more time for considering it.  Deputy Belton has submitted one basis and I am submitting this as an alternative basis. Anyhow, if I might be allowed to proceed to give the cost of production, I am quite satisfied to leave to the Minister the fixing of the prices if he does not accept my figures for seven cwt. of hay.  I would say that would be 15/-, a very moderate estimate. The 2 cwt. of crushed oats consumed, I do not know would the Minister consider 16/- too high an estimate for the oats.  I would leave it to himself to fix the estimate.  As for the cost of the silage, I have no figures.  The only figures I got were the figures complied by Imperial Chemicals, Ltd., of 8/9 per ton or 12/3 for the 28-cwt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Thus the ration for 112 days which produced ¾ cwt. live weight in one of the lots and 1 cwt. in the other, costs as follows:&mdash;7 cwt. hay, 15/-; 2 cwt. crushed roots, 16/-; 28 cwt. silage, 12/3, making in all £2 3s. 3d. That is the cost of the food without taking into account the value of the grass.  Then there are the labour of attending the cattle, the cost of insuring the cattle against all risks, interest on the capital invested, and the profit for the farmer.  I leave the Minister to fix a price on these figures.  Let him give the labourer who attends the cattle a fair wage after consultation with Deputy Norton or any other member of the Labour Party.  Any insurance company will give him the figures for insurance to a fair amount, to cover cattle dying or any other risk that he might wish to cover.  Then for the money invested in the business, he can fix any interest he likes.  I leave him then to fix any profit he chooses for the farmer and add the item to £2 3s. 3d.  These are the items supplied by officials of his own Department on which farmers are asked to produce beef at £2 3s. 3d. per cwt., and when he tots these items up he can fix a fair price.  I do not think <Col N="2357" /> he can find fault with the experts of his own Department and I offer these items to him as an alternative basis, if he does not like to accept Deputy Belton's figures.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broderick</NameTxt>
      <P>Before we come on to the trading portions dealt with by Deputy Belton and Deputy McGovern, there is the question of the responsibility of the Minister under this Bill. You are now dealing with the levy and the levy is not liable to be paid until the inspector has marked the animal and it is delivered up to the trader. What are the responsibilities of the Department in connection with that levy?  The butcher pays £1 for slaughtering the animal, after which he brings it in and slaughters it.  It has been passed by one officer of the Ministry and a tribute is paid to the Minister for that right of slaughter. The man who pays that assumes that he is getting a perfectly sound and healthy animal.  Then another officer comes along and condemns the meat of that animal.  What is the responsibility or liability of the Ministry in connection with that matter? Surely it cannot be held that they are free from responsibility.  The inspector of the Department has marked the beast, sheep, or whatever it may be, as an animal fit for slaughter.  The butcher is charged £1 for killing the beast or 5/- in the case of a sheep.  After slaughter, another officer of the Ministry or of another Department, I shall assume, condemns that beast.  What becomes of the responsibility of the Ministry in regard to the fee of £1 which has been charged for killing the beast?  I think the Ministry cannot get out of responsibility in this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would point out to the Minister that his Department is now accepting a responsibility which it has evaded for a long time.  It has been regarded as a gross injustice that one section of the community should guarantee by their own losses the health of the meat exposed for sale.  I cannot see whether the Minister is now accepting responsibility for any condemnations that occur of meat from a beast on which the fee has been paid.  I should like <Col N="2358" /> the Minister to answer the question. With some knowledge of the subject I can say that these condemnations of meat, in whole or in part, are more general than the public is aware of. I do not think the Minister is quite as ruthless as his words on a previous stage would indicate when he said that if these men could not carry on they must get out.  I do not think he would be quite so ruthless as that.  From the Labour Benches I heard a good deal of talk about profiteers on that occasion. Does the Minister accept such responsibility for these condemnations as is implied in the guarantee of his officer that the animal is one fit for slaughter?  When the butcher accepts that guarantee, the liability must be on the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have no responsibility for seeing that an animal is sound. When the marking provisions are brought into operation, our inspector will mark the animals and will say that these animals cannot be slaughtered before a certain date.  But nobody, under this Bill or any other Act, can compel a butcher to buy a certain animal.  If the butcher believes that an animal has tuberculosis, even though the animal is marked by our inspector for slaughter, he need not take it.  He can leave it there, so that the butcher is in no worse position than before.</P>

      <P>Deputy Belton talks about a price which is 15/- below the world market.  I do not know how he makes that out because I thought Deputy Belton agreed on the Second Stage that before the quota came into operation, the difference between the tariff <Col N="2359" /> and the bounty would be about £4 5s. 0d.  Therefore on a nine-cwt. animal the difference would be about 9/- per cwt.</P>

If the Deputy did not exaggerate so much, he might be taken seriously but he does exaggerate his case very often and it is not necessary because sometimes he has a good case.  He says that the producer is going to pay this levy because we are below the world price. The Deputy several times on Second Reading said that the producer must pay this but he is now twisting and wriggling and he is trying to save himself by saying that we are below the world price.  Of course the Deputy knows that it is no such thing.</P>

That is, to get the producer what he was entitled to before the quota came into operation. Before the quota came in, I said he was getting the full export price less the difference between the tariff and the bounty.  In other words, he was getting £4 5s. 0d. or £4 10s. 0d., according to the bounty, less for his beast than he would be getting if there were no tariff.  We want to get back to that position and to correct the effect of the quota.  It is on that basis that the price will be fixed.</P>

      <P>You say that inside this House.  When you had a lot of the &ldquo;slugs&rdquo; around you, you said that but you would not say it man to man.  We know, however, that we have to accept a price 8/- or 9/- lower than we accepted a year ago, so that we have to bear the full brunt of the economic war.  That is the position which has been admitted by the Minister.  I do not know whether the quota system is part of the economic war or not.  I do not know whether it is an intensification of the economic war or whether, for some British reason, the quota was put on.  But the British tariff was the British line of attack in the economic war.  All the blows we are getting from the British economic war will remain.  The loss of this 8/- or 9/- on our beef, admitted by the Minister, is to continue.  He has nothing to offer for that.  The Minister is putting 2/- per cwt. on to the price of beef, in the form of a levy on the butcher, but even if we get the advantage of that 2/- our price would be still 6/- or 7/- less. We are not to get the advantage of that levy.  The Exchequer is to get the advantage of it.  The true position is that we have to accept 6/-, 7/-, or 9/- less for our beef.  The butcher goes on as of old; the consumer goes on as of old, and the consumer pays 2/- as a tax on his beef.  Where does the amelioration come in?  How does this Bill help the producer&mdash;the front-line trencher in the economic war?  The Minister made one fatal admission the other day regarding a matter which, since he came into office, he has been trying to misrepresent and to deny. He denied that there was a difference in the price of beef, prior to the quota, measured by the difference between the British tariff and our Government subsidy.</P>

He put a figure on that to-night that relates to present conditions of 8/- or 9/- per cwt.  Now there is a levy of £1 per beast.  Let us take it roughly at 2/- a cwt.  He says that because the producer will have to accept 8/- or 9/-, more or less, than he would normally by taxing the trade and collecting half off the butcher, that it does not come off the producer. Where can it come out of except out of the trade?  It is no different from this position: that if, instead of fixing the price at about 25/&mdash;that figure fits in with the other figures&mdash;we fixed it at 27/-, would not the producer still be working on 6/- or 7/- below what he formerly got, and 10/- or 12/- below the world price?  How the Minister can say that this 2/- is going to be paid by either the butcher or the consumer beats me, when the producer on the Minister's own admission has to accept 8/- or 9/- a cwt. less for his beef, which is 25 per cent. less than he would have to accept if we had no economic war.</P>

      <P>The Minister has told us that there will be no compulsion on the butcher to buy.  In view of that, we surely have the right to ask why the Minister should send his inspectors around the country to mark cattle to play the dog in the manger &mdash;neither to buy the cattle nor to let anybody else buy them.  Why mark the cattle and prevent other people from buying them?</P>

      <P>I think this point arises on the section, because the Minister told us that there will be no compulsion on the butcher to buy. Another point that the Minister lost sight of was the price to be paid for store cattle under this quota system. It may be all very well for the man who has beef to sell if he gets the fixed price and gets a licence.  But the man who has store cattle to sell will get no licence.  The shipper will get it.  In that case the people who rear store cattle in the poorer parts of the country will find that there will be no purchasers for them.  When the Minister takes upon himself the right of control and introduces that principle in this Bill, he ought to carry it to its logical conclusion and fix a fair price for all classes of animals.  I hope the Minister will consider that before the Bill goes through, and that people who rear all classes of animals will get a chance of disposing of them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>We have been discussing practically everything but the section.  We have been discussing sections 19 and 23.  I rise for the purpose of making an observation on one of the sub-sections lest it might be said afterwards that we overlooked something that ought to have been attended to.  Sub-section (7) of the section provides:</P>
      <P>Service of a copy of a certificate made under this section may be made by delivering it to the registered proprietor of the registered slaughtering premises to which it relates or by leaving it with a person over the age of sixteen years at the said registered slaughtering premises or by sending it by registered post addressed to the said registered proprietor at the said registered slaughtering premises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That deals with the cancellation of certificates for registration of premises. So that perchance if I, or some member of my family over the age of 16 years, happen to be in a butcher's stall registered under this Act any time after the passing of the Act and the Minister's agent finds it necessary to serve a certificate on the registered proprietor he may hand it to me or to any other customer in the shop, and <Col N="2366" /> that will be held to be binding service on the unfortunate owner.  I think that sub-section ought to be deleted. Its insertion may have been due to a mistake or it may have been intentional, but in any case it is a sub-section that ought not to be allowed to stand in the Bill.</P>

      <P>I do not think that the Minister was fair to himself in his reply to the implications that I have put on the responsibilities of the levy when he said that there was no obligation on a trader to buy.  Does not the Minister realise that a trader cannot buy anything but a marked animal? That carries a guarantee with it from the Ministry.  It does not meet the question at all to say that there is no obligation on the trader to buy.  The trader can buy nothing except animals that have been branded by the Minister's officials for which he must pay the State a certain levy.  I do not see how the Minister can get away from his responsibility by ignoring the very big question involved in this.  The Minister cannot have a levy and he cannot give the undertaking that the levy implies without, at the same time, accepting responsibility.  The Minister cannot get away from his responsibility for compensation.  You cannot meet the question by saying there is no obligation. I am sure the Minister will readily admit that there is, because if he is to continue trading at all he can only trade by taking in some animal branded by his officers and for which he must pay a levy.</P>

      <P>This is one of the principal sections in the Bill and will require a great deal of discussion.  It has reference to the marking of cattle for slaughter, and under it an inspector may enter upon land on which he even suspects that cattle are kept.

      <P>The amendment to Section 20 is merely to exempt cattle kept by institutions for their own use.  It reads: &ldquo;In sub-section (1) (a), after the word &ldquo;slaughter&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;for sale.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 20 is one of the most important parts of this measure, under which an inspector can walk into land and mark cattle.  It says:&mdash;&ldquo;It shall not be lawful for any person (a) to slaughter for human consumption in Saorstát Eireann any unmarked cattle.&rdquo;  I do not see how the provisions in paragraphs (c) and (d) and sub-section (1) of Section 20 can possibly be carried out.  An inspector may enter any land or any premises on which it may be suspected <Col N="2372" /> cattle are being kept.  I take it that is governed by some governing Statute which requires an inspector to present himself first to the owner of the land, to ask permission to enter, and that it does not give an inspector an unlimited right to trespass on any land which he wishes to enter upon.  The Minister will remember an earlier section by which an inspector was to carry a certain identification which he should produce on being reasonably required to do so.  Is not that so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore I take it that Section 19 will not exonerate the inspector in effect from that obligation by giving him a general authority to trespass without let or hindrance without his having asked leave of the owner of any premises which he proposes to enter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not necessary. This, as a matter of fact, is to exempt him from any offence by way of trespass.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely sub-section (1) might be made effective to exempt him from any action for damages in respect of trespass by merely providing that he should first present himself at the residence of the owner and notify him of his intention or notify whoever may be in the house of the owner or by some other means notify the owner of his intention to inspect, and afford the owner an opportunity of exercising his statutory right to demand a certificate of identification? Otherwise you give that man the right to wander on to a man's land without any precautions.  I do not really know how far this sub-section would go to give an inspector certain rights to expect that certain dangers would not be present on the land.  I think it is only proper, if an inspector has a right to go on certain premises, that provision will be made to afford the owner an opportunity of warning the inspector of any unseen danger on the land and of satisfying himself that the inspector is a person duly <Col N="2373" /> authorised to go upon his land.  I commend that strongly to the attention of the Minister.</P>
      <P>Remember, a situation might arise in which an individual or a class of individuals had been trespassing upon a farmer's land for some purpose for which the farmer had little or no sympathy.  He might go to his land one day and find a person trespassing and examining his cattle and he might misinterpret that person's purpose. He might take vigorous measures to remove him from the land and might even perpetrate a technical assault before the inspector had time to produce his certificate of identification.  I desire to avoid the possibility of such a thing occurring.  For that reason, I put it to the Minister that it is idle to put into one part of the Bill a section which obliges the inspector to produce a certificate of identification and in another part a sub-section which permits him to go on the land without producing it at all.</P>
      <P>Coming to Section 20 (1) (c), take any farmer who comes into a fair with forward store cattle and the local butcher comes up and makes him a bid for them.  He might very well sell them to him.  If the butcher choose to buy forward store cattle for his particular trade, in ordinary circumstances the farmer would not be concerned to restrain him from so doing. If the farmer goes into the fair with forward store cattle, not enquiring and not caring what purpose the potential purchaser requires the cattle for, he commits an offence, inasmuch as he is doing something that is unlawful in offering or exposing for sale for slaughter for human consumption an unmarked beast.  The moment he goes on the fair green with these cattle and offers them for sale he commits an offence.  I say that is absolutely impossible to administer.  It is futile to be enacting legislation that is absolutely impossible of administration. The law never takes cognisance of an unfulfilled intention.  Here you are passing legislation which will require the court to inquire into the farmer's intention in respect of the ultimate fate of the cattle that he brought out for the purpose of exposing for sale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2374" /> Paragraph (f) provides that &ldquo;it shall be unlawful to buy or offer to buy for slaughter for human consumption in Saorstát Eireann any marked cattle at any time before the date indicated by the mark on such cattle as the earliest date on which such cattle may be slaughtered.&rdquo;  Supposing a butcher buys cattle for the purpose of keeping them for a certain time and when they are finished slaughtering them and offering them for sale for human consumption, does not that constitute a breach of the statute; or does he only commit an offence if he slaughters the beast on the day on which he purchased it?  Can the Minister define for us what purchasing cattle for slaughter means? Does it mean that if a butcher purchases a beast as a calf and keeps it until it is a two-and-a-half year-old bullock he commits an offence, inasmuch as he bought the calf for slaughter for sale for human consumption? If he buys a yearling bullock and keeps it one and a half years and then slaughters and sells it for human consumption, is that buying for slaughter for sale for human consumption? If he buys it six months before he slaughters it, or if he buys it one month or seven days before he slaughters it, or if he buys it the day before the day on which he slaughters it, is that buying for slaughter for sale for human consumption?</P>
    <P>The same dilemma arises under paragraph (e).  Supposing a farmer in perfect good faith sells to a man who keeps a butcher's shop and also has a farm a bunch of cattle, having no reason to believe that the man intends to slaughter any of them immediately. Supposing the butcher picks out one or two of the dozen and slaughters them and puts the other ten out on after-grass to finish them, is the farmer committing an offence under this Bill? I submit that the provisions in Section 20 are absolutely unworkable except by caprice.  When I say that I mean that no citizen knows what his obligations are, what his statutory rights or duties are under this Bill, and cannot know because they are incapable of definition. Any statute of which that can be said is bad law.  It is the fate of <Col N="2375" /> statutes drawn on bureaucratic lines to break down and the end of this is going to be that the inspector will settle the law.  We will find somewhere enshrined in this statute that the Minister may make such regulations as he thinks necessary to carry the statute into operation.  The end of it will be that we will have the Minister and the permanent officials legislating for this cattle business and none of us can buy or sell a beast except in accordance with the rules and regulations made in Upper Merrion Street.  From the point of view of the people that is a bad system; from the point of view of the State it is absolutely unworkable and from the point of view of law it is a rotten thing to be passing legislation which does not give the people any clear indication of their rights or duties.  I think these are aspects of the question into which the Minister should look more fully before he can hope to get the Bill carried into law.</P>

      <P>The observations of Deputy Dillon are to the effect that the Bill is impossible of administration.  I believe it can be administered; he believes it cannot, so I suppose there is no use in arguing over that point.  The Deputy asks for an interpretation of certain clauses.  That is a matter for the District Justice, not for me.  With regard to the reference to trespass by the inspectors, in the ordinary way a farmer will make application, after an order comes into force for marking, to have his cattle inspected.  In the ordinary way, if he has cattle he believes are fit for sale for slaughter, they will be inspected and it is to be presumed the inspector will call to see where the cattle are.  Suppose we had to investigate a complaint about a beast being sold to a certain butcher which was not marked as an inspector would mark it, but which purports to be so marked, it might be necessary for the inspector to visit certain lands to examine if other cattle were marked like that.  He might think it well to go without the knowledge of the owner and I think he should have liberty to do so.  If the owner were to commit a technical offence in the way of a technical <Col N="2376" /> assault before the inspector produces his authority, it will be regarded as a real assault because the inspector will have the right to be there.  It would be just the same as if a Civic Guard were there and were assaulted.</P>

What is the use of a Committee Stage if the House is to pass a section, the meaning of which no Deputy knows and which the Minister does not even understand? This is really a preposterous section. <Col N="2377" /> We are told by the Minister that the proper person to define the words in the statute is the district justice.  The district justice is not making the law. It is his duty to find out what we intended to enact and the position now is that none of us can tell.  What does the Minister mean by buying a beast for slaughter for human consumption, by selling or exposing for sale a beast for slaughter for human consumption? How on earth can any man make up his mind on the merits or demerits of the section if he does not know that?

      <P>I think the Deputy is raising unnecessary difficulties.  That is fairly obvious because while he says the Act cannot be administered he goes on to talk about the interpretation of different sections.  If a man is in the habit of buying cattle and feeding them for a week or a fortnight, that would be taken into consideration.  If a man is in the habit of keeping cattle a week or a fortnight before slaughter, that will be considered.  But where a man keeps animals in his yard, and has no land on which to keep them, and where formerly he always did slaughter animals immediately after buying, a different case would arise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said a minute ago that he will not send an inspector to anybody who does not apply to have his cattle inspected. Therefore, if I bring cattle into a fair is the responsibility mine that they are not sold and should not be sold for slaughter in Saorstát Eireann?  Is that responsibility upon me?  How do I know whether the man who buys them is a butcher from Dundalk or Kilkenny, or somewhere else.  Under this section it is an offence to offer those cattle for sale to a butcher.  It seems the responsibility is on me if I want to avoid a prosecution to see that the cattle are not sold for slaughter in the Saorstát. Is it fair to put that responsibility upon me?  I must see that those cattle are not slaughtered in the Saorstát. That shows the difficulty there will be in administering the Act.  A person cannot avoid committing an offence under certain sections of this Bill.  It is not compulsory on any farmer, so far as I understand it, to have his cattle marked; yet he cannot expose those cattle for sale unless he takes on the responsibility of seeing that they are not slaughtered in Saorstát Eireann.  Is that proper legislation. If the Minister wanted to mark every beast in the country he might send out inspectors to do that; that would be one way of going about it; but that is for the Minister.  As the Bill stands, anybody who does not apply to have his cattle marked, no matter how honest he is, if he brings his cattle into <Col N="2379" /> a fair, is made responsible for seeing that the man who purchases them is not a butcher in Saorstát Eireann. What is the position of many butchers with land of their own?  It might well be these cattle were not fit for slaughter for a month, or perhaps only one or two of the bunch may be fit for slaughter.  In these circumstances will it be an offence for the farmer to offer them for sale?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>At question time to-day I had on the Order Paper the following Question:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To ask the Minister for Agriculture if he will give the reason for the refusal of his Department to issue an export licence to the purchaser of cattle at a sale at Kilfinane, Co. Limerick, on 24th July, by the county registrar for arrears of land purchase annuities.</P>
      <P>The Minister in his reply said that an application for export licences was received from a person who stated that he had bought cattle at the sale referred to, and the licence was refused because the purchaser was not recorded as having shipped cattle in 1933.  As a supplementary question I asked the Minister if he was not aware that other purchasers at similar sales all over the country were granted export licences. He replied that permits were issued to buyers at similar sales, but that they were genuine purchasers.  I further asked him did he insinuate that the purchaser at the Kilfinane sale was not a genuine purchaser, and the Minister did not answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sale at Kilfinane was a registrar's or sheriff's sale for cattle seized on a warrant issued by the Land Commission for arrears of land purchase annuities.  Ten cattle were seized in this instance and put up for sale in Kilfinane pound.  The original owner of the cattle was not a buyer, owing to inability to pay the money; and a buyer, not a native of County Limerick, but from somewhere else, bid for the cattle and another purchaser, who happened to be myself, entered into competition with this buyer to obtain possession of those cattle.  This buyer evidently was a good buyer.  The Minister himself has referred to him before now, or to similar buyers, as public spirited gentlemen, who were entitled to get licences.  This particular gentleman was a particularly good bidder because he did not cease bidding when the amount of the sheriff's warrant and all the other costs were realised, but continued to bid above and beyond that amount.  I outbid <Col N="2382" /> him, as I had a perfect right to do, and my bid was the last bid and the cattle were knocked down to me. I then turned around to the Superintendent in charge of the Guards and stated that I intended to apply for a licence to export the cattle and that, in the meantime, seeing that some of the cattle were not in good condition for removal&mdash;one of them is still in a bad condition from the treatment it received in the pound&mdash;that I would retain them in a field adjacent to Kilfinane until such time as I could arrange for their removal.</P>
    <P>Subsequently I wrote two letters, one to the Minister, asking for a licence to export, and the other to the Superintendent, stating that the cattle were at a certain place and that I expected protection for them.  They did get protection of a kind.  A few days later I got a letter from the Superintendent saying that he could not protect them indefinitely and suggesting that I should get a herd.  I neither asked nor desired any treatment better or worse than is meted out to other people.  This public spirited gentleman, in competion with me, would, if he had been the final bidder, have got a licence from the Minister to export those cattle and, in addition, police protection, or even police conveyance, as far as I know, to carry those cattle to the farthest point in this State where he could ship them, and he would have got all the resources of the State to help him to carry them; but I am apparently, as the Minister insinuated to-day, a faker and not entitled to the same consideration as those buyers who come from the North of Ireland or from Mountjoy or from anywhere else&mdash;nobody knows where they come from.</P>
    <P>There are cases, unfortunately, in this State of unfortunate farmers who allowed their cattle to be seized because they cannot pay those annuities. Some of them are keeping them by mortgaging their creamery cheques for the next five or six months.  Some of them are unable even to do that.  We had an instance at that same sale of another man whose ten dairy cows were seized.  This man's son was in bed sick and his wife dying, and when <Col N="2383" /> he asked the sheriff's representative to leave him one cow, in God's name, to get milk for his sick boy and his dying wife, he was refused.  When I go forward to assist in getting for the other farmer who could not buy those cattle something like a decent price, in competition with another buyer who gets all those facilities from the State, I am called a faker.  The cattle are there still, and I am hoping to sell them, and I will sell them to the Minister now if he will make a fair bid.  The Minister still insinuates that it was not a regular sale.</P>
    <P>We had another Bill yesterday during the course of the discussion on which the Minister was taunted with discrimination in the question of the issue of licences.  He said that there is no favouritism in the matter of licences as between one individual and another&mdash;none whatever.  Yet here we have a case of palpable discrimination. A gentleman from the North of Ireland or from Mountjoy or from Timbuctoo is to get licences to export cattle, but an ordinary member of the community, a Deputy of this House, who bids for those same cattle, and who outbids this public-spirited gentleman, is called a faker by the Minister, and refused a licence.  The Minister says that he is open to a charge of collusion.  My particular desire, as I said, in this particular sale, was to see that the farmer who unfortunately had to sell those cattle, got a fair price for them, and that they were not confiscated.  My desire was to get the best price that could be got for them&mdash;the Minister's desire should be the same as mine&mdash; and if I wished to bid against this public-spirited buyer, I am logically entitled to obtain a licence, and to obtain the protection of the law just as much as the other buyer is.  The Minister is not entitled to get up here and say that I am not a genuine buyer, and to insinuate that I am a faker.</P>
    <P>I am afraid, unfortunately, that there will be similar sales to this&mdash;many of them&mdash;and that other citizens of this State will possibly bid for the cattle seized.  It may be that many of them will outbid the John Browns and the <Col N="2384" /> Edmund O'Neills and the other gentlemen.</P>
    <P>If the John Browns and the O'Neills are to get export licences and police protection for cattle purchased in such a manner, and if they are to get these privileges at the expense of this State, then the ordinary individual, who outbids the John Browns and the O'Neills, is entitled to the same consideration. I want the Minister when he is replying to state definitely whether it is his considered policy or not that at these sales certain privileges are going to be extended to one individual and that people who enter into competition with this individual are to be debarred by the Minister from receiving any similar privileges or any help whatever from the Ministerial Departments.  If there is to be no genuine competition at these sales, then the cattle of the unfortunate farmer will, to all intents and purposes, be confiscated; because this particular buyer&mdash;John Brown or O'Neill&mdash;will give the lowest price possible for them.</P>
    <P>I am willing to admit to the House that the price that I paid for these cattle, even though I outbid this public-spirited gentleman, was so small a price that it was not a reasonable price to give this unfortunate farmer.  That is why I am anxious that the privilege of receiving an export licence should be extended to any other buyer at these sales.  In that way the buyer will know what he may expect in the sale of the beast and thus he may be prepared to give a better price.  As a result the unfortunate farmer whose cattle are seized will at least have the satisfaction of knowing that the cattle will make something commensurate with their value.  Seizures are being made at almost every second farmer's door in my county and in other counties, too.</P>

      <P>Before the Minister rises to reply, I want to inform the House that a nephew of Deputy Bennett who is a solicitor in Kilmallock has been present at these sales that have taken place in the County Limerick&mdash;not very many sales, four or five &mdash;and he has purchased the cattle offered at these sales.  Whether that is with his own money or Deputy Bennett's money, or money collected from the farmers throughout the county&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>You are not the Ceann Comhairle.  The Ceann Comhairle will decide whether I am in order or not.  The question I want to ask the Minister is whether this gentleman, who has the same name as Deputy Bennett, applied for and got any licence to export cattle bought at these sales?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that I ought to let Deputy Crowley's remarks go without some intervention from me.  The gentleman to whom he refers is a solicitor.  It may be that as a solicitor he is acting for certain people.  I do not know.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>He certainly was not acting for me.  I can give the Deputy and the Minister an assurance on that. I certainly was a genuine buyer on this occasion and the Minister can have the cattle now if he wishes to purchase them.</P>

      <P>In order to get some clarity on this question I want to give some information as to how these licences are issued. They are issued, in the first instance, to the people who exported cattle in the corresponding month last year. Further to that, by an agreement with the Consultative Council on Cattle there is a certain number reserved for outlying districts where the buyers do not enter&mdash;the West of Ireland and Donegal.  In addition to that a number of licences are being issued to those cattle dealers who were out of business last year owing to sickness or some other cause like that but who were <i>bona fide</i> in business in the last seven or eight years.  Apart from that a number of licences have been left over. These do not amount to more than one per cent. of the total and they are at the discretion of the Minister for Agriculture. Now, out of that lot, licences have been issued to some of those who bought cattle at some of the sheriff's sales.  That has been done in consultation <Col N="2387" /> between myself and the Minister for Justice.  The Minister for Justice was anxious to break a certain movement in the country.  That movement started with a refusal to pay annuities and rates.  Where public spirited citizens came forward to purchase these cattle&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Then Deputy Bennett is one.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Justice agreed with me to give licences to break that wanton movement.  It has been broken, and will be broken, and there is no doubt that it is necessary to break that movement.  If that were a movement that was not countenanced by any responsible Party in this House we could afford not to take it seriously. But when we had Deputies opposite taking part in this movement, and at these sales buying their cattle back, it was obvious that it was not through want of money these cattle were being seized, but that the Deputies took part in it in order to show good example to their followers.  These men had their cattle seized.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>And more of them will be seized.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I say.  There are Deputies opposite who are prepared to have their cattle seized by the sheriff in order to gain a kind of popularity amongst their followers. They are prepared to stand the cost of the sheriff's sale.  There are a few unfortunate Deputies on the opposite benches who went through that spectacle of having their cattle seized by the sheriff and then went to the sale and bought their cattle back again. It was quite obvious that if we were to issue licences to those people who had their cattle seized, and who went to the auction and bought the cattle back themselves&mdash;thus showing themselves to be great patriots amongst their followers on the opposite side&mdash; the result would be that they could <Col N="2388" /> have their cattle seized, come in and buy them, get permits for shipping them, and thus they would probably lose nothing at all by the transaction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>Then that is an admission by the Minister that this licence has some value?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As I say, we had to make a distinction.  Where there is a genuine sale, or where a person goes in to buy these cattle, not that he wants to buy them for the owner or buy them for the purpose of handing them back to the owner, but where he buys them in the hope of making some money out of them, we do give a licence, because these are people we want to encourage. If there are people in the country who are prepared to go into these sales and buy cattle which have been seized from people who have refused to pay their rates or annuities, and if these defaulters find that the game is not worth the candle, they will soon pay their rates and annuities.  Deputy Bennett admitted in his speech that he wanted to get the best possible price for the cattle.  I am sure Deputy Bennett did not want to put the profit in his own pocket, but he wanted to hand it back to the original owner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I will pay a better price the next time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>He wanted to hand it back to the original owner.  That is the very thing we want to stop, and that is the very thing we are determined to stop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe this particular owner would take it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be surprised if the Deputy would put the money in his own pocket.  I would be surprised if the Deputy would engage in a traffic of that kind, making a profit out of the misfortunes of his own followers.  The people who genuinely buy cattle at these sales deserve our help, because they are doing a good national service, but the Deputy, if he tries to make a profit in this way, is putting blood-money <Col N="2389" /> into his pocket.  After getting one of his own followers into a muddle he is trying to make profit out of the sales of their cattle.</P>

      <P>What are your people doing who buy these cattle?  Is it not blood-money in their case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It surely is blood-money if the Deputy encourages his followers to do a certain thing, and if he buys their cattle and tries to make a profit out of them, when these cattle are <Col N="2390" /> seized because the people accepted the advice of Deputies opposite.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFagan" hpid="Mr. Fagan Mr. Fagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fagan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>They are all right.  We are going to encourage these people who buy cattle which have been seized from people who have refused to meet their liabilities on the advice of Deputies opposite.</P>
