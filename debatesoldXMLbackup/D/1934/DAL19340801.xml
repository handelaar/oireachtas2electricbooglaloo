      <P>The proposed widows' and orphans' pensions scheme is at present being considered by the Executive Council and the Bill will be introduced as early as possible. The scheme will be administered by the Minister for Local Government and Public Health.  The date from which pensions will commence to be paid will be fixed in the Bill, but it is not possible at present to state whether pensions will be paid from 1st October next.</P>

      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is in the negative. A complaint has recently been made to the Controller of Prices regarding the retail price of mutton and the matter is being investigated.  Some time ago a complaint was made to the Controller regarding the prices being charged for potatoes, and I am informed that the Controller of Prices satisfied himself that the prices complained of were not unreasonable.  No complaints have been received in respect of the other commodities mentioned in the question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The steamer service between Bantry and Castletownbere is operated by the Bantry Bay Steamship Company, Ltd., in which the Great Southern Railways Company has a substantial interest, but not complete ownership.  I am informed that the question of discontinuing the service has been under consideration more than once since 1924, and has now reached an acute stage by reason of the growth of competition from motor vehicles on the roads and privately owned boats.  I understand that negotiations are proceeding between the steamship company and the railway company.  Having regard to the alternative means of transport now available, I do not consider that a <Col N="1899" /> subsidy from public funds could be justified.</P>
      <P>Apart from the private boats, two omnibus licensees operate between Bantry and Castletownbere, and seven persons in Bantry and Castletownbere &mdash;in addition to the Great Southern Railways Company&mdash;hold licences for the carriage of merchandise by road, covering the area.</P>

      <P>I am not prepared to agree that the conditions under which loans are granted by the Agricultural Credit Corporation do not provide reasonable credit facilities for the people engaged in the agricultural industry.  The rate of interest at which loans are granted is primarily a matter for the Corporation, but it should be pointed out that the Government are at present assisting the Corporation to make advances for special schemes at a rate less than their standard rate.  I am not aware that anything in the Acts under which the Corporation carries on its business deters it from granting loans at rates of interest which it considers fair and reasonable, having regard to all the interests concerned.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the Minister should have given some reasons to the Committee for asking it to disagree with the recommendations from the Seanad.  A house with a £5 valuation is a very small one.  As well as I remember, the valuation of a three-roomed house is about £7&mdash;a house that would be somewhat on the lines of a labourer's cottage.  I do not know that you could get a house built now that would have as low a valuation as £5.  In the City of Dublin an allowance is made in respect of houses with a valuation under £8.  If the rates are paid by a certain date such premises are only liable to two-thirds of the assessment in respect of municipal rates.  I suppose that if the Minister has made up his mind about this there is no more to be said on it.  As the Bill stands the allowance made is so small that it is hardly likely to be availed of by anybody.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is necessary to detain the House discussing this matter at any length.  The fact is that the proposal as it stands in the Bill and as passed by the Dáil represents a concession which was made following representations which were made to me that undue hardship might be occasioned in the cases of certain small cottage properties which were let at uneconomic rents.  Accordingly, as I have already said, I brought in the concession which is embodied in the Bill as passed by the Dáil.  The question of what the limiting amount of that concession should be was discussed here at length.  I do not think <Col N="1904" /> it is desirable to occupy the time of the House on a day on which there is so much important business to engage its attention by prolonging the debate on this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter was not debated at any great length in the House.  It was the subject of consideration for about an hour.  My information is that since it was last discussed here one more fashionable stallion, as these animals are described, has left the country.  The position that we are in now is this: that, presumably, three-fourths of the higher priced stallions have left Ireland, and that there are not more than two animals now standing in this country at a fee of over £150.  When we last discussed this I understood that the matter was to receive the consideration of the Ministry.  If it be thought that an increase of the bounties, or the withdrawal of the restrictions on the operation of a percentage of the bounties, meets the case I want to say that it does not.  The position at the moment is that this country will probably lose, if it has not already lost, its character as a high-class bloodstock breeding country.  If the Ministry are satisfied on that, then there is nothing more to be said about it.</P>

      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The principal object of the introduction of this Bill is the fixing of a minimum price for oats and barley. In the Principal Act, as introduced in 1933, there was a guaranteed market provided for oats and barley.  At that time we considered it sufficient, because we thought that trade would go on in the normal way, with merchants purchasing their requirements from the farmers, and maize millers in turn purchasing corn from the merchants. We thought that, with a guaranteed market, the price would remain at a reasonable level, but last year we had a rather disastrous fall in the price of barley and oats after the harvest. Even though we tried to assure the merchants and the millers that all the oats and barley in the country would be used we could not induce the merchants or the millers to pay a reasonable price for the barley and oats on the farmers' hands.  The result was that corn was sold by the farmers in some cases as low as 6/6 or 7/- a barrel&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and now it is being sold by merchants and maize millers with a surplus at as high a price as 17/- a barrel.  I have stated over and over again that the Cereals Bill was not brought in, in the first instance, for the benefit of either the merchants or the maize millers.  It was really brought in for the benefit of the producers.  We mean, by further legislation, to see that the producer gets a fair price for the corn that he has to be sold.  We tried by negotiation last year to get that price for them, but neither the merchants <Col N="1907" /> nor the maize millers had any faith in the scheme.  They considered it impossible to get all the corn in the country used up.  We assured them in the Department of Agriculture&mdash;I met them personally&mdash;that we would raise the percentage to a sufficient level to absorb all the oats and barley, but they did not believe it could be done.  At the same time, of course, there was the usual propaganda from Press and politicians that the loss of the British market was responsible for the low price.  That propaganda was responsible, to a great extent, if not altogether, for the low price which the farmers got.  The prices, as I have said, for oats and barley at the present time are very high.  We have been approached on many occasions in the Department of Agriculture during the last few months to lower the percentage.  We did lower the percentage from 33 to 15, but still the prices remain high.  We cannot lower the percentage further, because, in the first place, we would be acting very unfairly to the maize miller who did his duty last harvest in buying sufficient oats or barley for the 12 months.  If we were to lower the percentage further, or give up the mixing proposals altogether, it would mean that that particular maize miller would be left with oats or barley on his hands, and would not, perhaps, have any way of disposing of it.  It would also have the effect of giving an impression of instability to the scheme to maize millers who did not do their duty last harvest.  They might think that, in future, by buying a six or nine months supply they would be acting &ldquo;cute.&rdquo; We do not want to give them that impression.  We want to give them the impression&mdash;and I think they have got the impression now&mdash;that the man who took our advice after last harvest was the man who did act &ldquo;cute&rdquo; in buying sufficient oats and barley for his full requirements.  Those who opposed us and took the advice of the propaganda against us were by no means cute, because they have now to pay 16/- or 17/- a barrel for their oats.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are taking power in this Bill to fix the price of oats and barley.  It is <Col N="1908" /> not certain that we will have to use that power this year.  There is, I think, a general desire amongst merchants and maize millers to stock up fully this year when the harvest comes in, and it is quite possible that oats and barley may go to a higher price than we would regard as sufficient as a minimum price, but we have the power, at any rate, and if the price falls below what we consider to be a fair figure we can step in and fix the price.  Under the fixed prices there will be, of course, certain machinery necessary.  All those, first of all, who have to use home-grown grain under the Cereals Act&mdash;that is to say, maize millers and oat millers&mdash; will have to buy their oats and barley from a registered dealer, that is a dealer registered under this Bill.  A registered dealer may be either a maize miller or an oat miller, or a person who is at the present time an oat merchant.  Those registered dealers will have to pay a fixed price, and the price will be fixed according to quality, that is, on the bushel&mdash;oat bushels or barley bushels.  Another provision in this Bill is the power to mix oat flour with wheaten meal or with wheaten flour for the making of bread.  I am very doubtful that that will be necessary during the coming 12 months, but if it should happen that we have a bigger yield from our oats than we expect at the moment it may be necessary.  As a matter of fact, the acreage under oats this year is lower than it was last year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>And the crop lighter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Unless the yield is considerably better it will not be necessary to use this provision with regard to the mixing of oat flour.  With regard to this, I might say that tests have been carried out over the last nine or 12 months both in the mills and in the bakeries, and the bread which was derived from the mixture of five, ten or 15 per cent. of oat flour was not distinguishable by colour from the whole flour bread.  I mention that fact because a certain newspaper described this bread as black bread, some six or eight months ago when it was being discussed.  The correspondent who wrote the account said he had not seen <Col N="1909" /> it himself.  Certainly he had not.  It was, as a matter of fact, on show at the Spring Show in Ballsbridge.  The loaves were there to be compared, and I think it would be impossible for any person to distinguish them by colour alone.  As far as flavour goes, I think anybody who tested the bread pronounced it much nicer in flavour than the bread made from the 100 per cent. wheaten article.  Unfortunately, our oat crop may not be sufficient to bring these provisions into operation this year.  If that part of the Bill is adopted it will mean the usual consequential provisions, such as the keeping of records of the amount of wheaten flour and oaten flour used by each baker.  It is the millers will do the mixing.</P>
      <P>A third provision in the Bill deals with the mixing of dried milk with flour for bread.  That has been done by a number of countries during recent years, and it is claimed that it has been very successful both in America and on the Continent.  It would naturally make a more perfect food to have dried milk mixed with the flour, because certain deficiencies in a carbo-hydrates diet of bread would be filled by the addition of dried milk.  We have been testing it here, and as a matter of fact some bakers do turn out some bread containing milk&mdash;pan loaves&mdash;which are very popular in the city, and I suppose elsewhere.  We have also been experimenting with certain different percentages of dried milk in the flour.  It is certainly a feasible proposition.  The only thing requiring further investigation would be as to the most advisable percentage of milk powder to use. From the agricultural point of view, of course, it would relieve the huge surplus of skim milk that we have in creamery districts.  The skim milk would be used for this purpose, as it is the protein of the milk is required more than fat.  If that part of the Bill is brought into operation by order, it could not possibly be adopted before the beginning of next summer, because we would not have supplies of dried milk available until about that time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not give them at the moment.  We have the costs worked out.  The provisions with regard to fixing the price of oats and barley, and mixing oat flour with wheaten flour will naturally lead to other difficulties.  One of the difficulties that we have been up against, to a slight extent last year, and to an increasing extent as time goes on, is the matter of storage and kilns.  We were fortunate last year and the year before in having a dry harvest.  If we were to have a bad harvest or wet weather, with a large amount of oats, barley and wheat coming in, we might find great difficulty in dealing with the corn, as farmers would be compelled, more or less owing to the condition of the corn, to deliver it to the merchants or the flour millers, as the case might be.  There are numbers of kilns and stores that are not in use and, as far as we can find out, the present owners are not inclined to bring them into use.  Neither are they inclined to dispose of them.  They are adopting a dog-in-the-manger attitude, and will not use them or give them to anybody else.  There are provisions in the Bill enabling the Minister to take over these stores and kilns at a fair valuation.  There are provisions in the Bill dealing with valuation.  There is also power for the Minister to take stores by agreement as well as by compulsion, and there is further power enabling the Minister either to use the stores himself, or to let them to other persons, or to sell them.  Of course, adequate compensation is provided for any stores taken over by compulsion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from the major principles of the Bill there are a number of amendments of the Principal Act.  Perhaps it may be difficult for Deputies, in many cases, to follow these amendments without going to a good deal of trouble and studying them with the Principal Act.  I will mention them now as they are taken in the Bill. Section 5 amends Section 3 of the Principal Act only with regard to definition.  This would be necessary when the provisions with regard to mixing oaten flour came into operation. Section 6 gives the Minister for Industry and Commerce power to vary the preliminary quota period, a power <Col N="1911" /> which he had not under Section 27 of the Principal Act.  Section 7 amends Section 28 of the Principal Act, and enables the Minister to issue a quota up to 100 per cent.  As the section stood he could only give a certain specified quota.  As Deputies are aware there are mills that go in altogether for the milling of whole wheaten meal.  As the Principal Act stood the Minister for Industry and Commerce could not give them a quota because the Act said that a certain definite proportion could be milled in the whole year.  As amended he can give them a quota.  Section 8 amends Section 28 of the Principal Act, making it an offence to mill more than the quota allowed of wheaten meal.  That was overlooked in the framing of the Principal Act.  Section 9 amends Section 30 of the Principal Act.  The fine for milling in excess of the quota was 3/- for every 400 lbs.  Under this Bill that fine is changed.  It is much higher on big quantities than in the case of smaller ones.  In fact, it makes the maximum fine 30/- for 400 lbs. Section 10 amends Section 31.  Under the Principal Act a person who failed or refused to make a return was guilty of an offence, but strange to say we did not make it an offence for a person to make a false or misleading return, so that a miller who wanted to fulfil the obligation could make a return which could be misleading.  That is now made an offence.  Section 11 amends Section 32 and gives the Minister for Industry and Commerce power to make regulations in relation to mills the quota for which does not exceed 1,000 barrels, and in relation to other mills.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce is anxious to deal leniently with small mills, making less than 1,000 barrels, and wants to make different regulations for them.  Section 12 amends Section 32 in regard to the records to be kept of wheat purchases.  Under the Principal Act we laid it down that flour millers should keep returns of the wheat brought to their premises, but we found from experience that a miller might have wheat brought to a store elsewhere within the country.  It is important to have a return made of any <Col N="1912" /> wheat he may have purchased, whether it was brought to his premises or not. Section 13 amends Section 34 with regard to the revocation of licences.  It defines more precisely the power given to the Minister.  Where a licensed flour miller was anxious to get a permit to mill wheat on commission for farmers he could not get it.  There is certainly no reason why he should not. The Principal Act is amended there.</P>
    <P>Section 17 amends Section 54 of the Principal Act.  Under the Principal Act, in the case of death, the appropriate Minister could register the personal representative in lieu of the person who died, but in the case of a transfer of ownership, he had to remove the original person from the register and register the new owner. That section is being amended to deal with a change of ownership in the same way as that in which we have been dealing with a change in the case of death&mdash;by registering the new owner in lieu of the other person.  Section 18 amends Section 55 of the Principal Act.  It exempts registered manufacturers of compound feeding stuffs from furnishing returns.  It was extremely difficult, and, in fact, it was claimed to be impossible by the manufacturers of compound feeding stuffs, to keep the records as laid down in the Principal Act.  It meant that where they were using, as some of them claimed to be using, twenty or thirty different ingredients and making all sorts of mixtures such as pig mixture, calf mixture, laying mixture and fattening mixture, they had to account for every single pound of meal taken out of every package or sack on the premises, and they found it extremely difficult to keep all these records.  We are exempting them from keeping these records because we feel that it is not necessary that they should keep them.  They can be supervised quite efficiently without keeping these elaborate records.</P>
    <P>Section 19 amends Section 60 of the Principal Act.  A person cannot claim in future the right to inspect any register on payment of a fee of one shilling.  That is a provision that was in the Principal Act by which any person could walk into the office and, on payment of a fee of a shilling, inspect <Col N="1913" /> the register.  The privilege has never been claimed, and we earned no shillings under that section.  In any case, it is inconceivable that any person would come in except as a matter of curiosity, because if there is a case in court and if there is any genuine reason for wanting the information, a person can get a certificate from the Minister. Section 20 amends Section 61 of the Principal Act.  It gives the Minister power to cancel a registration if he is of opinion that there has been a contravention of the Act or any regulation made thereunder.  The Minister could not cancel a registration under the Principal Act until a conviction was got in court.  Some of those cases are extremely slow, and it takes a long time to get a case proved in court. Some of the smaller millers have taken a chance and have absolutely defied the law and tried to make money quickly before a conviction takes place.  This section, I may mention, is being put in at the request of the maize millers themselves, that is, the reputable maize millers, and, in fact, of the whole body of maize millers, because I think they are, up to 98 per cent., in the organisation.  They do not want to see a few small men getting away with this fraud.  There is a provision, however, by which the Minister, first of all, gives seven days' notice, and if he is requested to hold an inquiry, he must do so.  He appoints an inspector, and at the inquiry the aggrieved miller may be represented by counsel, or solicitor, or he may appear on his own behalf, as he wishes.  This inquiry must be held, and nothing can be done until the results of the inquiry are reported to the Minister.</P>
    <P>Section 21 amends Section 68 of the Principal Act.  It will be unlawful under this section for a farmer to effect a nominal sale to a miller for the purpose of getting wheat ground for his own use and, at the same time, draw the bounty.  The Principal Act did not intend to give the farmer a bounty on wheat which he used in his own household, but we know that in certain cases farmers bring in their wheat to the miller and nominally sell it to him, and then, after getting their <Col N="1914" /> bounty, take their wheat back again, when ground, for their own use.  This section is introduced to make that illegal.  Section 22 amends Section 70 of the Principal Act.  When calculating the average price of home-grown wheat, fractions of a penny will be disregarded and the nearest penny taken. After all the wheat sales certificates had been returned to the Department of Agriculture the average price was calculated.  It might work out to three or four places of decimals which made it extremely difficult to calculate, and quite a lot of the time of the staff was occupied in making out the different amounts due by way of bounty to each farmer.  In future, we mean to take the nearest penny.  If it is a halfpenny or over, we will take the penny above, and if it is under, we will take the penny below.  Section 23 amends Section 71 of the Principal Act.  In future, no bounty will be paid on any fraction of a barrel of wheat.  That, of course, also created difficulty and trouble in calculating the bounty that should be paid on 3½ stone or 4¼ stone over the number of barrels a farmer would have.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The bounty is the same for everybody, but the miller pays differently on grade.  Section 24 amends Section 80 of the Principal Act. As the Act stood, if a person could procure maize by any means other than being a maze importer or maize miller, it was quite lawful for him to sell that maize.  It will be unlawful for anybody to sell maize in future.  Of course, some illegality was obviously committed in the securing of the maize by that person, but it was still lawful for him to sell it.  Section 25 amends Section 83 of the Principal Act.  In future, a manufacturer's name must appear on the label attached to each sack of maize meal mixture.  That is another provision which is being asked for by the maize millers themselves.  Those maize millers who are trying to evade <Col N="1915" /> the law are not attaching their names to the sacks, with the result that if a sack is got afterwards anywhere, we cannot trace it back to the manufacturer to bring a charge.  The maize millers' organisation is anxious that this should be done.  Section 26 amends Section 85 of the Principal Act.  It makes it unlawful for any person to import flour without a licence.  It enables licences to be given for the importation of flour.  Section 27 allows bread, buns and other products of wheat to be sent by post where the parcel is in value less than 10/- and in weight less than 5 lbs., and where it is a gift for the person to whom it is sent.</P>
      <P>The last amending section of this Bill is Section 28, which amends Section 92 of the Principal Act, and it enables licences to be issued for all imports containing wheat products.  I have dealt with these items at length, because I felt that it was rather difficult for Deputies to get at all the various amendments of previous Acts.  They are, of course, matters that could much better be dealt with on Committee Stage, because each section stands on its own, more or less.  The big principles of the Bill, however, which I take it will be discussed on Second Reading, are the power to fix a price for oats and barley; the power to mix oat flour with wheaten flour for the making of bread; and the power to mix dried milk with wheaten flour for the making of bread.  The question is whether these powers are necessary or justified in present circumstances, and it is because I believe those powers are necessary that this Bill was introduced, and I recommend it for Second Reading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very voluminous document to digest at such very short notice, and I think it would be as hard to digest it as the bread proposed or specified for the country now.  The Minister said that, boiled down, the main principles of this Bill are to give him power to fix a price for oats and barley, power to mix oats with wheat flour for our daily bread, and, further, power to mix with the wheat and oats dried milk for our daily bread.  I think when we deal with <Col N="1916" /> the points that the Minister made an exhibit of in his concluding remarks we will be giving the country enough to digest in more ways than one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister wants power to fix the price of oats and barley.  Is there not an economic power to fix the price of oats and barley?  What materials does he propose to use in fixing that price?  He told us that, in the absence of some legislation like this, nine months or so ago oats and barley were sold very cheaply.  Later on they reached nearly war prices, and that has continued up to the present, and he blames the farmers who rushed to sell their oats and barley after the harvest last year for not taking his advice.  I think a lot of farmers who retained their oats and barley are blaming themselves that they did not sell them in the harvest.  Of course, superficially-minded farmers look upon oats as a crop which only wants a few days' ploughing and a few days' sowing; you then close the gates and have nothing more to do with it until the reaper and binder is put in in the harvest when it is threshed and stored and sold as a finished article.  The superficially - minded farmer who reasons in that way can afford to smile. But the man who delves in the economic depths of the subject cannot afford to smile.  We have not yet evolved an economic strain of barley here to produce the amber-coloured beer, and outside the little that is used for distilling and the percentage that is used in brewing in this country, which together are a small percentage of the total crop of barley raised, all the barley is used for feeding.  As to the oats crop, a little is milled for oatmeal for porridge, or, as it is known in the country, stirabout, and for the odd little oat teacake made here and there, but the oats that is used for human food is a very small percentage of the oats crop of this country.  So that to fix a price for oats and barley you must have stern regard to the economic value of the oats and barley, not as a finished article, but as a raw material to produce the finished article.  A cry has gone up in this country for a number of years from farmers who claim to be tillage farmers and who want a <Col N="1917" /> fixed price for oats and barley.  First of all, their panacea for the ills of the tillage farmer was the mixture.  I was at a public meeting in Athy on the day that mixture was baptised.  For a good while it went the rounds of the public platforms and the Minister for Agriculture, or Deputy Ryan, as he was then, was afraid to touch it.  He did touch it, however, and I am afraid it has burned him.</P>
    <P>The Minister has to amend a number of the sections in the Bill which he introduced last year.  He finds that it is necessary to fix a minimum price for this raw material.  I cannot see how any man can arbitrarily fix a price for a raw material unless a price is fixed for the finished article that that raw material will be used to produce.  Oats and barley, no matter what concoction you mix them with, whether maize or anything else, have to be fed to animals to produce the finished product. The price of those animals regulates the price of the oats and barley, and the Minister and his Cabinet are only tinkering with the basic industry of this country by thinking that they can meet in a back room and say that the price of oats and barley will be so-and-so.  The prices of all commodities in the world are ruled by world conditions.</P>
    <P>Let us take an extreme example. Suppose the Minister fixed the price of barley at 14/- per feeding barrel and the price of oats at 12/-, and we farmers all came to the conclusion that that would pay us to grow them.  Supposing we all grew barley and oats and dumped them on the Minister and demanded our 14/- and our 12/-, where would he get the money to pay?  To fix a price for barley and oats must presuppose that some people will be got to buy that raw material at that price and use it in producing the finished article and be able to sell that finished article at an economic price that will pay them for their labour and for the cost of the raw material at the price fixed by the Minister and his colleagues.</P>
    <P>Last year conditions were not good enough, and the Minister wants to improve on them.  Are the prospects for <Col N="1918" /> the finished article as good this year as last year?  When the Minister was squaring up to his Bill last year he had no notion that there would be a quota for fat cattle&mdash;that there would be any obstacle in the way of our feeding as many stall-feds as we liked in this country and finding an open market for them in Great Britain, even though that open market would only be open to us when we paid a tax of £6 on each beast going into it.  The Minister knows a considerable number of stall-feds were tied up, knowing they had to jump that barrier of £6 a beast.  He also knows that when the 1st January came, no matter what tariff barrier we were prepared to jump going into the British market, we could not get in all the beasts we had, and we were allowed to send them only half the number of fat cattle that were exported in the corresponding months of the previous year.  The Minister knows the bungling that took place in his Department, which resulted in the transfer of about £60,000 of the cost of that beef out of the pockets of the producers into the pockets of the dealers.</P>
    <P>The Minister sheds crocodile tears to-day, and he reminds the millers that the Cereals Act of last year was not intended for them but was intended for the producers.  What sympathy has he shown the producers in the matter of beef for the British market?  I hope the Minister will apply himself to this point, for it is the kernel of the whole situation.  The main point is, what can we get for our beef?  Every pound of beef, no matter what its price, may be made to represent a certain weight of oats and barley converted into beef in the bodies of the bullocks and the heifers.  What we get for the beef has a direct relation to the oats and the barley.  A certain amount of oats and barley, with other mixtures, will produce a certain weight of beef, and obviously the price we get for the beef regulates the price of the oats and the barley.  There is no other way of regulating it in this or any other country, and to attempt to do so would be only tinkering with the subject; it would be merely pulling wool over the people's eyes.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1919" /> The Minister knows of the artificial shortage that came about in regard to oats, and he is aware that that was due largely to one factor.  The feeders who had thousands of cattle tied them up.  I knew some people who had 40 cattle and they tied them up.  They had two or three licences.  They had to keep them on hoping against hope that they would get a market for the animals. The cattle had to be fed.  They ate all the oats the feeder had together with what he had to buy.  They had to be kept alive and in condition.  The demand on oats affected the supply and the effect on the supply had an effect on price.  Prices were put up.  It is because there was an unexpected artificial consumption of our foodstuffs that prices went up.  The hardening of prices took place from last January onwards.  At the end of the season many people who had fat cattle had to let them out on grass.  They could not get a market for them.  I wonder, as regards those stall-feds for which a market could not be got, what standard price could anybody fix on the oats they consumed?  It would not be a bob a barrel, because it was all wasted. When the article was finished there was no market.</P>
    <P>I will again ask the Minister to give us some idea of how he will fix the standard.  What will guide him?  It will not do to say: &ldquo;Take an average acre of oats; it took so much labour and seed to put in the crop and it took so much to harvest, thresh, grind and make it available for food, human or animal.&rdquo;  Suppose we fix the cost at 10/- a barrel in order to allow a bit of profit for the farmer's supervision and allow for rates and annuities that the Minister tells us it is a matter of public spirit to pay three or four times, what is the position?  As regards the annuities, the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Lands and Forests, is sending out the sheriffs all over the country to collect them.  Supposing the Minister leaves a little margin in that connection, does he imagine that that is the price that is to be fixed?  Let us say 10/- or 12/- or any arbitrary figure based on the cost of production.  It is not a finished article, because that <Col N="1920" /> article has to produce beef, eggs, poultry, pork, etc.  How will the price you get for those finished articles relate to your costings?  Of course, the people can be taxed while they have a few pounds in order to produce an artificial price, but there is an end to that.</P>
    <P>As we are talking about meal, I am sure there are many Deputies who recollect the old country saying about the meal tub and going to the bottom. The Minister is rushing headlong for the bottom.  We are going to have wheat and oats in bread.  Possibly we will have black bread.  I have eaten bread from foreign wheat, home milled. I have eaten oaten bread.  I can eat anything the ordinary man can eat. There must be extraordinary men on those benches opposite if they can eat a mixture of oats and wheat.  Let us deal with wheat.  I thought there was a big push for wheat.  I thought that we could grow wheat.  What is the need to mix it?  The Minister said, down South, that there was a danger of giving the people&mdash;the smoking public &mdash;an overdose of home-grown tobacco&mdash; that they might stop smoking.  I suppose we might be able to stop smoking, but we could not very well stop eating. Is not the Minister travelling on dangerous ground?  Is he not taxing very much the tastes of the people by putting, in the loaf that we use, a percentage of home-grown wheat?  I am a stronger believer in wheat growing than the Minister is, and I carried on a wheat growing compaign for years and wrote many pamphlets on it before the Minister thought of wheat; but I put this to the Minister: that he is enforcing a mixture of Irish grown wheat in our flour that is not suitable to produce a baker's loaf.  If the Minister will attempt to contradict that statement when he is replying, I shall be glad if he is able to contradict it, but I will not be satisfied with his contradiction until he produces&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The Department of Agriculture has issued pamphlets on this subject, and if the Minister attempts to controvert my statement, then, the sooner he <Col N="1921" /> withdraws those pamphlets, issued by the Department over which he presides, the better and the sooner he will be acting consistently with the policy of the Department behind him.  Now, in addition to that mixture of Irish-grown wheat in our flour which, according to the boasts from the opposite side, should reach the percentage of 20 this coming year, if the area they expected and boasted they would have under wheat in the Saorstát this year comes up to expectations, we should have, with an average yield, 20 per cent. of our wheat requirements for our daily bread produced in this country this harvest.  Now, 20 per cent. would be quite enough to attempt in changing the loaf, but the Minister is going to put in, I think he said, 5, 10 or 15 per cent. of oats in the flour, and that that would not be noticeable as regards colour; but what as regards taste and flavour?  Of course, I will not pursue the scientific side of that any further, because the Minister has a medical degree and I have not.  I might be going beyond my depth if I did pursue it.  Why does not the Minister encourage still further the extension of the wheat crop rather than mix oats through it?  We can buy a barrel of wheat&mdash;the best wheat in the world&mdash; for 15/-.  We will get 20 stone of wheat for 15/-.  Would it not be better, when we have an over balance of soft wheat of our own, to buy some hard wheat and try to keep up the standard of our bread rather than lower the standard of our bread still further by mixing oats through it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our oat crop is smaller than last year.  Why is there the anxiety to find a market for the oats this year when we have a less area under oats and the cost of the oats will be nothing at all like what it was last year?  The Minister knows very well that a big percentage of the oat crop is reaped already.  The farmer knows approximately what his crop will yield on the day he reaps it, and the yield of oats this year, per acre, will be much less than last year.  In fact, with the exception of hay, in all probability the yield of all crops will be less than last year.  Still, by some peculiar kink, the Minister wants power to force us to <Col N="1922" /> have oat flour in our bread.  He goes further and wants power for us to have dried milk.  I think this is more of a joke than a serious proposition.  I forget what exactly the price of dried milk is now or what it has been. Deputy Curran, I am sure, will have an idea of it.  I remember, a few years ago, being shown over a creamery in Tipperary&mdash;perhaps the leading creamery in the country, a creamery in Tipperary town&mdash;and their store was filled up with dried milk.  My recollection is that the price they were receiving for that was many times greater than the price of flour or wheat or oats.  So, to go and mix that kind of stuff with our daily bread&mdash;well, I do not know what it will do or how it will affect the bread as food, but I know that if a similar price is expected for the dried milk that the dairy co-operative creamery expected for its dried milk, then the price of the loaf should go up rather than remain normal.</P>
    <P>Conversely, if the price of the loaf will remain normal, the price that could be returned for dried milk will be uneconomic and it will not pay for use as a mixture in bread.  I think, speaking generally, the best price that can be obtained for skim milk can be obtained in normal times by feeding that milk to pigs.  I think in creamery districts it is reckoned in normal times to be worth about one penny a gallon. I would be very interested when the Minister is replying if he would tell us how much dried milk he will get out of a gallon of skim milk, the cost of drying this, and in what ratio he proposes to mix that dried milk with wheat and oats.  It might have the effect of whitening the dark bread.</P>
    <P>The Minister has featured just the three points that I have dealt with.  I do not want to labour them unduly or to add any more to what I have said. But as a farmer, of course, I would be interested in a high price for anything I have to sell.  So will anybody, just as well as a farmer.  But we are not fools. We are not satisfied with the price that is built up by artificial means.  If the Minister fixes a price that at first sight is a profitable price, we want to have some stability about that price and we want to be assured that that price <Col N="1923" /> comes out of the product of the article that our product is made to produce. We do not want a high price, an artificial price at the cost of the taxpayer. Speaking in a narrow kind of way just now, let us have a selfish view, if you like, let us have an agricultural view. The agricultural industry of this country keeps going about 80 per cent. of the population.  If the Minister fixes an artificial price for these cereals&mdash;which would be, we will say, about 5/- per barrel above the economic price&mdash;let him remember that we are 80 per cent. of the population.  Substantially we will pay 80 per cent. of that five shillings which the State will have to give to inflate the price.</P>

      <P>I am not a bit concerned. I have the same interest in one as in the other.  The Minister was confronted some months ago with a problem and he solved it by destroying the only means by which he could improve the price of oats and barley. He hailed as a national policy the slaughter of 120,000 calves.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaSnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is so much like soup that I would not pass a comment on him.  We will have 120,000 fewer cattle to eat oats and barley next winter.  Perhaps that is the secret that is worrying the Minister; that there will be less live stock to provide a market for oats and barley next winter.  Incidentally, I may remark that these calves realised the maximum price of 6d. a piece to the owner.  As time goes on, there will be of the various ages of cattle kept in this country 120,000 less.  The opportunities we have of sending them out of the country are being curtailed.  Therefore, the market for oats and barley is being curtailed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like the Minister to apply himself to that problem.  Let him explain, in a coherent way, how he <Col N="1926" /> hopes to continue producing oats and barley at the present rate, and get a remunerative price for that oats and barley if he continues to adopt his national policy of the destruction of the market for oats and barley.  That market is, and will continue to be, the live stock of the country, yet he finds it essential because of his outlook, that the surplus live stock should be curtailed and thinks it good that it should be curtailed.  That is the reason he gives and others give as to why the market for our surplus live stock must be limited.  If we are to limit the production of live stock, to our requirements, we must limit the production of feeding to the limited number of our live stock for our requirements.  Is it not a sad commentary upon our national Government to find responsible Deputies sent to this House with 7,000 or 8,000 voters behind them, in Galway, Cork, Laoghise and Cavan who cannot find anything better for their families than potatoes and buttermilk? And yet the Deputies who represent them here in this House are only smiling at a situation that anybody who takes the pains to think for five minutes sees clearly and in fact, cannot see any other solution&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Ceann Comhairle is satisfied I will give way, for a moment or two, but perhaps, better still, I will finish and give way altogether.  I would like the Minister in a calm way to tell us why he is <Col N="1927" /> using the knife to destroy 120,000 calves in the next two years.  Presumably he will use the knife from January to March next and will continue to slaughter 120,000 calves in the following season and so on.  Our cattle after three years at that rate will be reduced by 120,000 per annum and we will have lost three generations of calves of 120,000 making 360,000 in all less to consume our oats and barley.</P>
      <P>The Minister's policy is more tillage at a guaranteed remunerative price. Let the Minister apply himself to this problem and explain to the House and the country how he can increase the area under tillage while there are 360,000 cattle sold from stock at 6d. apiece to the owners, and 10/- to England for taking them away. Will he tell us where or how in such circumstances he can get a market to consume the increased oats and barley produced?  Where will he get a market to take the present rate of production of oats and barley?  He can only guarantee a price out of the taxpayer's pocket, accelerating our speed on the road to bankruptcy.  Of course, he turns around and says &ldquo;I'll see that 15 per cent. of oats is put into the wheat or flour grist that is to make bread.&rdquo;  We have already 20 per cent. of soft home-grown wheat mixed with our flour.  The Minister has made no discrimination between soft and hard wheat.  He is giving a flat bounty to grow any sort of wheat; so long as they till the ground he does not care whether it is hard or soft wheat that is grown.  With 20 per cent. soft wheat and 15 per cent. of oats we have 35 per cent. of new material put into our flour and the Minister will fix the price for the oats that is going into that flour.</P>
      <P>I do not think there is any need to pursue this matter any further.  I shall offer my unqualified compliments to the Minister and the Cabinet if they can perform, what no man has ever yet been able to perform, that is to provide remunerative markets for any crop or any commodity, having no relation to the finished article, when that crop or commodity was the raw material used in its production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1928" /> It all boils down to this.  Under the Minister's régime we have lost the market for the stock to which we fed our oats and barley.  The price we got in that market regulated the price that oats and barley were worth to us here.  Again, there is a £6 tax on stall-fed cattle going out of the country.  That tax is limited to 50 per cent. of the normal export and now the Minister thinks that by fixing a figure for oats and barley that we will be prosperous.  That figure can be obtained and maintained only in one way, and that is by the taxpayer, and four-fifths of the taxpayers will be agricultural producers.  If there is to be an increased price four-fifths of that price is to come out of the agricultural producer's pocket, and then the Minister and his officials will take a bob from the fund, and hand it back to the agricultural producers, and the poor agricultural taxpayer will cover the walls of the country with the cry &ldquo;Up the Republic.&rdquo;</P>

He suggested that I should wait until the Deputy had finished. My only purpose in rising now is to refer to the statement made by Deputy Belton.  I think what he said was that it was a sad state of affairs to think that there were Deputies in this House from Cavan, Laoighise-Offaly, Galway, Cork and other places, sent here by an average of 7,000 or 8,000 people who, at the present time, were living on potatoes and buttermilk or potatoes and salt, I do not know which.</P>

I do not know what the Deputies from Cavan and <Col N="1929" /> other places think about that statement but I want to tell Deputy Belton&mdash;and I want it to appear on the records of this House just as his lying charge will appear&mdash;that the people in my constituency are not living under such conditions.  They are just as well fed as the people of any county in the State and that is good enough.  The best proof of that is that they gave Deputy Belton and the like of him his answer at the last three or four general elections and, if there was a general election in the morning, the spirit of the Galway people, no matter what way they may be fed, is such that they will show the same confidence they have already shown in this Cabinet and will return supporters of the present Government in greater strength than ever to do what is right for this country.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>You must be taking it out of season.  If we consider the position of those, whom this Bill is intended to benefit, at the period when we took over office in this country and the hopeless condition in which those who were prepared to till and work their land were placed by the previous Administration, I think we must come to the conclusion that this Bill is only supplying a long-felt want.  Deputy Belton speaks about markets for the farmers' products to-day.  Where were the markets for these products in 1925 to <Col N="1930" /> 1931, in competition with maize meal, and imports of grain from all parts of the world?  It was in competition with these imports that we had to find a market.  Anybody looking at the figures, relating to the tillage area in this country from 1923 to 1931, can read in them the number of markets we had.  Our tillage area was reduced by some 100,000 acres.  They can read them also in the export of human beings from this country and in the rushing of those driven off the land by the bullock into the cities and towns looking for work that they could not get.</P>
      <P>I remember making repeated appeals from these benches to the late Executive Council to make some attempt to provide the farmers with a market for their oats and barley but the cry here always was &ldquo;You can face the open market against the rancher from Canada, from the Argentine and from South Africa. You can face all those and meet them in the open market and take what you get.&rdquo;  I have seen the position in my own constituency every harvest.  The farmer came into the towns with samples of barley asking the few brewers &ldquo;For God's sake will you take it and pay me what you like, pay me when you like, but take it anyway.&rdquo; I have seen some instances in which samples were taken of barley and the farmer only knew what he was going to get for that three months after he had delivered the grain into the maltster's stores.  He had to be satisfied with that.  There was very little use appealing to Deputy Blythe or the rest of them here for any satisfaction in those days.  We had to find a way out of that position for the farmer and we found it.</P>

We are remedying <Col N="1931" /> the position or preventing its repetition by this Bill.  I admit that the merchants made a haul last year and a pretty considerable haul when they bought oats after the harvest at 5/6 and 5/- per barrel.  That condition of affairs is not going to last.  We are going to see that, on the day the farmer threshes his oats, he knows the price he is going to get for it and if Deputy Belton is anxious about the price I can tell him it is the cost of production plus something in the shape of profit&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>That was the position until very recently.  Deputy Belton asked what is the occasion for fixing prices.  Anybody who looks at the price last harvest and the price within the last month, should have no occasion to ask that question.  Everybody knows that the general custom amongst farmers, who have no means of keeping their oats, is to rush the oats into the market the day after the threshing.  The farmer has to accept what is going then whether he likes it or not.  We are now going to fix a price so that the farmer will get at least the cost of production and something over for that oats.  The price of oats in the present market is somewhere about 16/- per barrel.  At least, I saw oats sold in Cork during the last week at £9 per ton.  There was no difficulty in getting that. Still, that is the oats for which the farmer was told last harvest by the so-called Farmers' Party and the Cumann na nGaedheal Party, we would not be able to find a market.</P>
      <P>There was, we were told, no market for it and it could not be sold.  Last year it was all sold and more would have been purchased if it could be got.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1932" /> We succeeded in providing a market last year for the farmers' grain.  The market was there and advantage was taken of it.  It is interesting to compare the position of the Guinness and Beamish firms last harvest with their position during the previous harvest. Last harvest, representatives of these firms were rushing around the country asking the farmers if they had barley for sale and what price they wanted. That was a very big change from the day when the farmer would go into these people and ask them to take his barley.  They would tell him then that he would know the position in three months' time.  Guinness and Beamish had to come along last year and buy the barley in the farmer's yard.  They had to tell the farmer what the price would be before it was delivered.  That was a big change.  They had to buy in competition with the miller, who was also compelled to purchase.  Only 6,500,000 cwts. of grain were brought into the Free State last year.  There is still that market for Irish grain and it is a market which can be supplied. There was a very keen need for the definite fixing of the price of grain&mdash; both oats and barley.  Last year, the wheat millers, at the start of the season, rushed around buying wheat at 12s. and 13s. a barrel.  They said to the farmer: &ldquo;It does not matter to you, the Government will make up the difference.&rdquo;  We saw these millers writing to the farmers a week afterwards stating that the price they allowed for the wheat was wrong and that they could now pay 17s. or 17/6. That was a big change.  We know very well that the farmers must sell their crop after the harvest.  We are going to see that advantage is not taken of that fact by the merchant.  This need was felt not alone this year or last year but for the last ten years.  The farmer is as much entitled to the cost of production as is the manufacturer&mdash;the man who makes boots or clothes or any other article.  We are going to see that he will not be fleeced by any merchant.</P>
    <P>Deputy Belton has alluded to the class of bread made with the percentage of oats.  I have used that bread myself and I can find no fault with it at all.  It is far better than the bread <Col N="1933" /> made from black oats, hulls and all, which Deputy Belton ate in Belfast in 1918.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>And I had to do so, too. I can see no difference between the loaf containing the oats and the ordinary wheaten loaf.  I should like the Minister to reconsider the point in regard to the farmer who takes his wheat to the miller to be milled for his own use.  I do not think that that farmer should be penalised by being deprived of the bounty.  In my opinion, it would be very easy to get round the clause in the Bill.  If I were taking any wheat for my own use into the mill, I should get around that clause in a minute.  I think that the clause, as it stands, is useless and that it is only penalising a man who does not deserve to be penalised&mdash;the farmer who takes his wheat to the mill and gets it milled for his own use.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that practically the same thing that he is doing in connection with oats and barley should be done in respect of wheat.  I think that we have gone beyond the bounty stage in regard to wheat.  The price should be fixed at the cost of production, with something over.  Instead of paying the bounty, the millers should pay that price for the wheat, mill it, and pass it on.  The time when the Government should be asked to make up that price by bounty or subsidy has gone.  The price of wheat should be fixed at about 30s. a barrel, and that price should be paid by the miller direct.  There are too many middlemen involved in the job and there is too much money wasted in milling, inspection and in the cost of officials.  We had complaints perpetually in regard to this question.  I remember hearing last year that the racehorses on the Curragh could not be fed on Irish oats because they were not hard enough and that foreign oats had to be imported for them.  They <Col N="1934" /> would not jump sufficiently well on Irish oats.  We had that kind of complaint coming week after week and month after month from people who did not want to use anything Irish, who did not want to use Irish grain, and who said that the pigs would not fatten if they did not get whole maize.  The some story was told about the bullocks I do not agree with Deputy Belton when he says that when the grain farmer ploughs his field and sets his crop he locks the gate until harvest. There is such a thing as rotation of crops.  The following year that field will be growing root crops.</P>

      <P>I would be very sorry to discuss all the meetings that Deputy Belton attends.  I think I have covered all the points that I wanted to refer to. The Bill undoubtedly provides a fixed price for the farmers' grain and is fulfilling in that respect at any rate a long felt want.  I am sure that the farmers of the country will be grateful for it.  The farmers who were compelled last year, owing to circumstances, to sell their grain at one-half or one-third the cost of production will be very grateful for this Bill.  I do not think that they will be at all thankful to Deputy Belton for the manner in which he dealt with it.  At any rate, it provides the farmer with a fixed price for his grain.  Whether that fixed price will be high enough is a matter for future consideration.  We will endeavour to see that it will at least meet the cost of production for the farmer who ploughs and tills his land. The man who does that is certainly entitled to that much consideration.  I am glad that this Bill has been introduced, and that the Deputies opposite were persuaded to wait a little while for their holidays so that the Bill might be passed through all its stages before the harvest.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardCurran" hpid="Mr. Curran Mr. Curran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an aspect of this Bill which I would like to put before even Deputy Corry and the Minister for Agriculture.  As I have said before, I agree that the farmer is entitled to the cost of production just as well as any other individual in the State, but what about a farmer who buys that mixture afterwards?  Is he entitled to the cost of production?</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCurran" hpid="Mr. Curran Mr. Curran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
      <P>The facts, as I know them, do not bear out that statement. The Minister is very much concerned at the present time about the pig population <Col N="1936" /> of the country and about the production of bacon.  What position are they in at the moment?  This Bill that we are discussing and the admixture are very much concerned with the production of bacon, and probably fowl. There is very little mixture now being fed to cattle or live stock because it does not pay.  We are led to believe that the Minister is in a very difficult position now trying to fill the British Government's quota.  I am sure he will agree that he cannot fill it.  The reason is of the cost of feeding stuffs. I know that the price charged for a 20 stone sack of mixture at the present time is round about 19/6, in places. Due to that, the farmers have gone out of production.</P>
      <P>Speaking from experience, I can say that the small farmers of the country, and even cottiers, have been the greatest pig producers.  Invariably they are better than the more extensive farmers.  Evidence of that is to be found in the fact that they have been the largest purchasers of feeding stuffs from the creameries and merchants, but they have gone out of production owing to the cost of this cereal mixture.  It is a grand thing to boast here, or anywhere else, that we are giving a particular price to the farmer who grows grain.  I agree that he is entitled to the cost of production, but the man who buys the mixture is entitled to get a fair return for his labour, and if he does not get it, then the thing will not work.</P>
      <P>I know that this trade is being cornered considerably at the present time.  The small farmers have gone out of pig production.  I know a merchant who used to do a very extensive business with farmers and he is now keeping up to 600 pigs.  He probably thinks it a good thing to do. He wants to keep his business going. But the effect of all this is that the cost of production has been increased so far as the small farmers are concerned. They cannot afford to buy the mixture and they are going out of the business.  It is well known that the pig population of the country has been considerably reduced.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">

      <P>Would the Deputy allow me for a moment to relate an experience <Col N="1937" /> that I had in that particular connection. I want to refer to the case of a gentleman who writes letters to the newspapers about once a fortnight complaining about the mixture.  Some of us happened to go to him about 12 months ago looking for a store.  What was his reply to us?  It was this: that he said he was making £2,000 clear profit on pigs probably in the last 12 months.  He said that he would not be such a hanged fool as to give up his store when he could make a profit like that.  The gentleman in question is Mr. Frank Buckworth, of Cork, who writes to the newspapers complaining of the Government's admixture scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardCurran" hpid="Mr. Curran Mr. Curran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have said, I am quite agreeable that you should give the farmer who grows the grain a price to cover the cost of production, but I want to emphasise this: that the farmer who buys that grain is entitled to a fair remuneration for his labour, and he is not getting that at the present time.  The price may be considerable at the moment.  The Minister can go around the country and say: &ldquo;If only the farmers took my advice and kept their oats what a grand thing it would be.&rdquo;  If we all knew what was going to happen in 12 months' or two years' time I suppose things would be grand, but the fact is that we do not know.  The price of pigs has fallen within the last week 4/- or 5/- per cwt.  In view of that, farmers are not prepared to pay an enhanced price for the mixture.  The Minister has prohibited the export of live pigs.  Why?  Because of his effort to try and fill the quota allotted to this country in the British market which, he thanks God, is gone.  That is why the export of small pigs is prohibited. Very extraordinary powers are taken under this Bill, and all those powers <Col N="1938" /> are put into the hands of the Minister and the Government.  Very wide powers of compulsion are taken.  It is all compulsion now so far as this and other Bills are concerned.  There is scarcely anything one can do now except by legislation.</P>
      <P>I am afraid that this Bill is not going to be of any benefit to anyone. I am not going to deal with the wheat problem but, if, as Deputy Belton says, people have to eat black bread, I will probably exist on it as long as anybody else.  I am rather amused at Deputy Corry when he says the price of wheat should be 30/- a barrel.  I suppose it should in order to pay, and I can assure Deputy Corry that if the Government turns around and fixes the price at 30/- I will be ready for them too; they will not get much of my money.  Personally, I should prefer if wheat were 50/- a barrel, as in the old days, when it was grown extensively in this country.  That is what it was when the farmers of this country depended on wheat to meet what in later years they met out of the raising of live stock.  If the Government wants to bring about that state of affairs I have no doubt at all the farmers will be ready and willing to deliver the goods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In those days that I speak of&mdash;and I have learned from people who can remember something about those days &mdash;I think the wheat was largely exported.  I can say that Government intervention has very serious effects on the whole industry, and this Bill, as I said, is largely responsible for dealing with the bacon industry.  I say that the amount of mixture which is being bought for anything other than pig production or probably for fowl is very small, and if the Minister says he is going to guarantee a price to the grain growers he ought to see that the people who buy it get a fair return for their money.  I know that during my time at farming&mdash;and I have been farming for a fairly good number of years&mdash;the barley growers were always able to look after themselves.  They always had, as a bone of contention everywhere, the price for their barley.  I do not object to their getting a good price <Col N="1939" /> for their barley.  I certainly do not, but there is no use in their thinking they can get it off their neighbour to turn it out in bacon, beef or anything else, if he does not get a fair price for his product.</P>
    <P>There is only a percentage of this country suitable for barley growing. Coming up to Dublin yesterday I saw most beautiful crops of barley.  They were delightful to look at, and will give a good yield, but there is no reason at all why people in the non-barley growing districts should be made paupers, so to speak, at the expense of those who are living in barley growing districts and whose land is suitable for growing barley.  That has been the position all those years.  The barley growers were always able to write letters to the Press, saying that they should get this, and that and the other thing&mdash;they should get everything.  I do not mind if they get £2 a barrel from Guinness or Beamish, but I would tell the Minister that if he is going to see that the grain growers get a fair price, which I consider they are entitled to, it is also his duty to see that the people who buy the mixture for which he is responsible will get a decent return also.  How that will be brought about in the absence of a more reasonable frame of mind on the part of the Government is a matter which I will leave the Minister to decide.  In any case, he need not think that any of that mixture which we are legislating for here to-day will be given to cattle or anything else.  It will not.  It will be fed only to pigs or fowl, and for that reason it is his duty to see that the people get a fair return.  We can legislate here and we can produce this mixture, and all that sort of thing, but mind you, it is not going to be bought because it is not a paying proposition to buy it.  At the present time it is not a paying proposition.  It is not bought, with the result that one of our great branch industries in the country is quickly deteriorating&mdash;the pig industry&mdash;and nobody knows that better than the Minister himself.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I must again protest against this Bill because it means that the people I represent will have <Col N="1940" /> to pay an increased price for feeding stuffs.  Deputy Corry said that the late Government were not prepared to help those who were ready to work the land.  I would like to repeat what other speakers have said, that some people have got the impression that tillage is the only thing which gives employment in this country.  I have some experience of it.  Last year was the first year I had experience of being able to cut my corn by machinery.  I had 23 acres of oats, and my own son cut it with a reaper and binder and tractor.  It did not give a single day's employment to anybody. I say that that is the position. I think it is most unfair that unfortunate people in my constituency who were always able to live should now have things made harder for them.  I always heard them say in my own shop that if they could buy feeding stuffs cheaply they could carry on.  Deputy Corry talks about a man who made £2,000 on pigs last year.  I may give the name of Jeremiah Creedon, of Kilnamartra, with whom I had a <i>toisheen</i> last Saturday in Macroom. He told me that he had never voted for me and never would, but he had lost £300 since this trouble started.  I have information like that from the people, although we heard from the Minister for Finance a few weeks ago about people making more money than in 1931.  I would repeat the demand I have made on several occasions here that as agriculture is the most important industry in the country a commission should be set up to examine people from different parts of the country who carry out different systems of farming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Corry talked about maize meal.  He says he has found a market. Where has he found the market?  I put it to the Minister to tell us where he has found that market.  Has he not found it amongst the poorer people of this country?  I put it to Deputy Corry that within the last month I was notified about a meeting of an organisation called Cumann Cosanta na Gaeltachta in my constituency. The meeting was called for the purpose of protesting against the policy of the Government.  They put forward <Col N="1941" /> a scheme whereby they claimed a bounty of 6/- for every sack of meal going into the area.  If that is not proof of the injustice of this policy I think there is no good in speaking in this House on the subject.  I would say also that all the people who are connected with that organisation are supporters of the present Government.</P>
    <P>I again repeat that it is about time this whole question should be inquired into impartially.  Deputy Corry talked about the late Government letting down the people who grow these crops. They did not do so because as Deputy Hogan often said &ldquo;I am not going to encourage the production of a grain crop as a cash crop.  I will encourage it for the purpose of feeding it on your own land.&rdquo;  That was the purpose, and that was the right purpose.  The late Government preserved a market for the commodity produced in that way, but now, unfortunately, the people are being driven into the position that oats will be stuffed into them in order to cover up the incompetency of the present Minister for Agriculture and of the Executive Council.  The cost of production applies to every article the farmer produces as well as to grain.  Deputy Curran asked why the pig industry has gone down.  Is it not because the cost of feeding stuffs has gone up, with the result that while large shopkeepers can produce a great many pigs small farmers are being driven out of the industry? Before putting this Bill into operation I ask the Minister to set up a Commission to inquire into the position impartially and to hear people from all the areas affected.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SydneyBMinch" hpid="Mr. Minch Mr. Minch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Minch</NameTxt>
      <P>I had not time to read the details of this Bill.  Since I came to the House I looked into it, and I find that it affects three interests, the producers, the manufacturers and the buyers.  Producers of grain will probably heartily welcome the Bill, manufacturers will not mind it, but buyers will probably kick against it. Therefore, any criticism I have to offer would be presumably from the point of view of the manufacturers. I do not believe there is much in the <Col N="1942" /> Bill that will frighten them.  On the contrary, I think I can speak on behalf of the millers, and those who handle grain in other respects, who will be the parties for carrying the ideas in the Bill into practical effect, that they have nothing to be frightened of.  I think they will co-operate.  I also believe that the producers will be very satisfied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have not been able to look fully into all the sections, I should like to get some information from the Minister with regard to the fixing of prices.  What time has he in mind for the setting up of prices for the different grades?  Will he wait for the merchants or the milling interests to do so?  Will he then step in, on the grounds that prices are below what he considers should be fair prices, and raise them by order?  I am not pressing the Minister for an answer now if he is not prepared to give it, but he understands that it is an important matter in facilitating the working of the Bill.  If prices are opened, and if they are to be interfered with afterwards by Government intervention, by the use of the powers contained in this Bill it would be desperately unsatisfactory for the business people concerned.  The Minister, at the same time, might have the threat of the Bill overhanging the dealers or the factors.  That may make them more careful, as it were, in seeing that fair prices are given, and viewing the position broadly.  I ask the Minister to bear in mind that all factors and dealers are not always looking for the last ounce, or trying to extract, as it were, the last penny from the producers under what would be the fair price, or they are not prepared to try to work in with the spirit of the Bill. I know that no matter what legislation comes in, and no matter how tight it is made some people can manoeuvre and get round it, and that ultimately legislation will have to be introduced to keep them within fair and prescribed limits.  All the firms are not like that, and on behalf of the Members of the Maltsters' Association, who are men of good standing I can say that they want <Col N="1943" /> to make things easier for the Minister and are anxious to co-operate with him in the spirit in which he has introduced the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not speak on this Bill but for the remarks that I heard Deputy Corry make about a merchant and a very big stock feeder we have in Cork.  He is one of the most important men in the South of Ireland in the cattle and pig industries.  I refer to Mr. Buckworth. I was sitting beside him at a function in Cork about a fortnight ago and he complained very bitterly to me of the losses he had sustained this year. He said that if he made any money on pigs last year he had lost it this year. He has 50 fat bullocks at present and only got a permit to ship two weekly. Deputies can understand what it means to have to keep 50 bullocks.  If they are not fed they will lose condition. As Mr. Buckworth complained bitterly of the losses he had sustained during the last 12 months, it is hardly fair to have his name mentioned in this House, or to say that he made money last year, seeing that he has lost such a pile of it this year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanGoulding" hpid="Mr. Goulding Mr. Goulding">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Goulding</NameTxt>
      <P>Despite what some Deputies on the opposite benches said, I am afraid that when the market for oats opened last year some of the merchants took advantage of the anxiety of the people to sell, and did not pay what could be considered a fair price.  There is nothing to show that as soon as the oat crop is in this year people will not rush to sell it. They are anxious to pay their way. Many of them are dependent on their crop of oats in order to meet the demands of shopkeepers, of the Land Commission, and others.  I hope that every effort will be made to see that what happened last year will not happen this year, and that the corn will not be sold at a sacrifice.  I should like to know what precautions are being taken to prevent that.  What chance would farmers have when they go to town to sell their corn if they find that, perhaps, there is a conspiracy amongst merchants to pay only a certain price.  As the farmers will be <Col N="1944" /> anxious to sell, and not to bring the corn home again, what steps will be taken to see that a fair price is secured?  Complaints were made last year that the bushelling was not fairly made.  Men going to certain towns said that merchants bushelled the corn in different ways, some making 38 lbs., others 39 lbs., and others 40 lbs. to the bushel.  An effort should be made to see that the bushelling of corn this year is checked, so that there will not be any chance of farmers being victimised. Those who grew black oats last year had to sell at an absurd price, some producers getting only 4/6 a barrel.  Those who grow black oats are really the hardest hit section in the country, and an effort should be made to see that they get a fair price for this year's crop.  The Minister has not told the House what he considers to be a fair price for this year's crop.  It would be well if the people knew what the Minister considered to be a fair price, so that there would be no danger of selling the corn at a sacrifice.  The Minister said that an effort would be made to have egg powder used by bakers.  It would be a good idea if that was made compulsory.  The addition of milk powder would mean that we would get a better loaf, have a better market for waste milk, while an industry would be created in the manufacture of that product.  I understand certain bakers are using it at present, but it would be a good idea if it was generally used.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGovern</NameTxt>
      <P>I gather from reading the Bill that it is amending the 1933 Act in some respects.  My objection to the Principal Act was that there were too many restrictions on producers by the introduction of too much control.  This goes even further because it introduces more and more control.  Everything is to be controlled by inspectors from top to bottom and not only that, but the licensing system is being extended.  For instance, no man can now buy a bag of oats or barley unless he is licensed.  I do not know so much about the barley trade but I do know the oat trade in some parts of the country.  There are many small farmers who, when they want <Col N="1945" /> to sell a bag of oats, take it to the nearest shopkeeper and sell it to him. Perhaps they have not got a second bag to sell.  These people, in order to oblige that farmer, have the right to buy the oats.  If this Bill goes through, what position will these people be in in the circumstances of the present time?  They must sell to a man with a licence and that man may be 20 miles away from them, and he may not think it worth his while to come into some districts where there is rarely a bag of oats to be sold.  How does the Minister propose to deal with a case of that sort?  I am afraid the thing will need to be very carefully considered, because this taking control of everything and altering the system that has obtained in certain districts from time immemorial is a dangerous principle.</P>
      <P>There is another matter which I should like to bring to the attention of the Minister.  When the 1933 Cereals Act was going through this House, I remember that Deputy Dillon drew the attention of the Minister to some of the effects the Bill would have on certain districts in the Gaeltacht where people used Indian meal, and he pointed out that the maize mixture would not suit those people.  The Minister promised that he would get reports from his officers and that not only would he consider them, but he would act upon them.  I should like to know in how many cases the Minister has acted on these reports, and from what counties he has got reports. If he wanted reports of complaints, an abundance of complaints could be supplied in regard to the working of that Act in County Cavan.  I can undertake to supply such complaints if the Minister will give an undertaking to allow Indian meal to come in to people who have been hard hit by these restrictions and regulations.  If he gives such an undertaking I will undertake to provide complaints from certain districts in County Cavan which have been very hard hit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position there is that they use this meal for the rearing of bonhams and, having raised them, they sell them to people across the Border for feeding into pork and bacon.  They find that <Col N="1946" /> this maize mixture does not suit the feeding of young pigs.  A small quantity is sufficient to bring on a little pig but the principal ingredient of the mixture which they make up themselves is Indian meal because they found that to be the most suitable food. They find now that the maize mixture does not agree with these animals.  I should like to know if the Minister is prepared to implement the promise he made to Deputy Dillon when the last Bill was going through that he would be prepared not only to consider but to act upon reports of people being at a disadvantage because of these regulations.</P>
    <P>I also agree with other speakers on this side of the House with regard to the price of grain and the price of other commodities.  After all, we have to remember that grain, or, at any rate, a certain class of grain, is only the raw material of agriculture.  It is not the finished product, and it is really the price of the finished product that matters. It may be all right for grain-growing districts to secure a good price for their grain, but as Deputy Curran and others have pointed out, there are other people who are producing produce of another description.  They have to buy this grain, and they are the people who are living in the poor and mountainous districts&mdash;very small farmers and labourers.  These people are hard hit by these regulations and by this control of the price of grain for the advantage of people who are in much better circumstances with regard to the quality of their land and otherwise.  I think that the people who are raising young pigs, and who have small means and inferior land, and who cannot go in for grain growing, should be considered.  The people who are raising turkeys to sell at 4d. a lb. cannot afford to give the high price for grain which they are charged in these districts into which it will be imported from the south of Ireland&mdash;from places like Co. Kildare and Co. Dublin.  It is brought down there, and passes through many dealers' hands.  They will all be licensed men who can form a ring at any time, and can not only mulct the seller but can mulct the buyer.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1947" /> When it goes through all these hands and is retailed, the price will be beyond what they can afford to pay having regard to what they get for their produce, and yet these people cannot go in for grain growing and cannot go into production, the alternative being that they are to be thrown on unemployment assistance or home help.  I find that that is not very easy to secure because there are plenty of people looking for it at present and it is very difficult to secure it.  The only remedy, then, is to give these people a chance to carry on and to work out their own existence as they have done formerly.  I would ask the Minister to consider this matter very carefully, and to remember that there are districts to be considered besides the grain growing districts and that even though the prices for grain are too low in one district at a certain season of the year, that does not prevent the prices of grain being too high in another district, where they have to buy at a different season. Those people cannot go out and buy grain when it is cheap.  They have to buy a few shillings' worth or a pounds' worth when they have the money and when they want it.  They cannot afford to buy for storage purposes.  These people must be considered and I hope the Minister will give consideration to the matter before this Bill finally passes.</P>

      <P>Deputy Belton, in leading off this debate, spoke of fixing the price of oats and barley and asked what were we going to do with them afterwards. This led Deputy Belton on to a discussion of the number of fat cattle in the country, which, I think, could be better dealt with in a few minutes. I will leave it aside for the moment because I intended to deal with that question and especially with Deputy Belton's prophecies on the matter last January.</P>

I am afraid that Deputy Belton has got an inferiority complex since he joined that Party.  I remember seeing him down in the Rotunda and in the Mansion House when he was a free lance.  He made great speeches about self-sufficiency and about getting away from the foreigner and all that sort of thing, but now Deputy Belton does not mind the Argentine ring who were able to put maize up to £12 a ton.  He was quite prepared to accept that but he is not prepared to accept a fair price from this Government for home grown grain. What is to prevent the Argentine doing the same again?  What is to prevent maize going up to £12 per ton?  The people in the Argentine are not going to mind what we get for pigs, poultry or cattle, but as long as it is an outsider, whether John Bull or the Argentine, Deputy Belton is quite prepared to take his ruling, but is not prepared to take any regulation made by this Government.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>He ought to know that. The Deputy says that Irish wheat is not suitable for bakers' bread.  I corrected the Deputy before in this House on that, but evidently he is not willing to learn.  If he does not believe me, he can enquire from any baker or flour miller and he will find that what I am telling him is true.  There is a large proportion of soft wheat in bakers' bread&mdash;up to 40 per cent. of the type of wheat that we are growing here generally; that is wheat like Queen Wilhelmina, which is more generally grown than any variety here.  Two-thirds of the output of the flour mills is household flour which is milled entirely from soft wheats, weak wheats if you like, as opposed to strong wheats.  Therefore, 66 per cent. of the complete output of the flour mills is household flour entirely from weak wheat.  Forty per cent. of the bakers' flour is from weak wheat.  So that of all the wheat we use 79 per cent. is weak wheat and only 21 per cent. strong wheat.  The problem, therefore, does not arise about the growing of strong wheat until we have first grown 80 per cent. of our full requirements. That is, until we have over 600,000 acres grown here we can continue to grow <Col N="1951" /> weak wheats like Queen Wilhelmina, Stand Up, and the other varieties grown.  We are told by experts who examined this position that some varieties we are growing, like Yeoman and, of course, in particular the old Irish wheat, the Stettin, are either partially or altogether hard wheats.  There is no great difficulty about hard wheat. In six or seven years' time, with a very big push, we may reach 600,000 acres. In the meantime, we can be experimenting with hard wheats, as we are doing.  Why, therefore, raise this question of hard wheats for the present?</P>
      <P>The Deputy asked one sensible question, I admit, and that is, why do we not concentrate on a greater production of wheat rather than turn to the incorporation of oaten flour in bread.  We are doing our best to get more wheat grown.  We went from 20,000 to 52,000 acres in the first year.  This year, on the preliminary census, we have gone to 89,000 acres.  Whether that is right or not, I do not know.  Probably it is not more than 1,000 or 2,000 acres out.  We have, therefore, roughly 90,000 acres this year.  At that rate of advance of 40,000 acres per year we will take a long time to reach 600,000 acres.  But, if you take the geometrical progress we are making, we will not take long at all, because we are doubling up each year.  We would reach 600,000 acres in about four years.  I do not mind the cynicism of Deputy Belton since he joined that Party because, as he said himself, he was really an enthusiast for wheat growing when I knew him first.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be for the raw material, for the skim milk at 1d. a gallon.  I know it is being retailed at 30/-, but it can be retailed at less if it was turned out in bigger quantities. I was told by some creameries the other day that they are selling the skim milk for various purposes at about ¾d. a gallon.  They are finding it rather difficult to get skim milk at the present time.  I cannot understand certain Deputies talking about the cost of feeding pigs.  I know people who are finding it difficult to buy small pigs, and certainly they are very dear.  When Deputies speak on those matters, if they are not talking dishonestly they are talking in a very uninformed way. Deputy Belton talked about an artificial price and an economic price. I would like to know exactly what the Deputy means by an economic and an artificial price.  Where does the dividing line come in?  Is it an artificial price if we put on a tariff, a quota, grant a subsidy or give a bounty?  They would all appear to be more or less artificial and, therefore, <Col N="1953" /> we depart from the economic price immediately if we do anything like that.  I take it, therefore, that the price of every agricultural commodity in this market is artificial&mdash;potatoes, wheat, barley, etc.  The subsidies and bounties on exports have the effect of raising internal prices.  I take it every one of these devices creates an artificial price and we depart there from the economic price.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>According to Deputy Belton the prices for certain commodities are artificial prices.  If Deputy Belton admits that, then I submit that no farmer could live here on the production of any article at the economic price; that is, the natural price he would get without a tariff, a bounty, a subsidy or a fixed price.  There is no doubt some other country would swamp our market.  For instance, the world price of butter is down to 60/- or 70/- a cwt.  The world price of eggs is far lower than ours.  The world price of wheat is 15/-.  Our farmers could not grow it at that.  The world price for every single article is lower than our price.  We know that bacon was coming in here at 36/- a cwt.  Our own bacon is now selling at 100/-.  If you withdraw the tariff the pig producers will have to go out of business.</P>

We have protected the market for our own people and he tells us that the prices are artificial.

The Minister is comparing prices which he alleges are artificial with the prices of certain commodities that are finished products.  Oats and barley, that are essential feeding stuffs, are not finished products.  When fixing a price for an unfinished product, the raw material of another industry, you must be sure that the output of that other industry will have a further enhanced price above the economic price, or otherwise you cannot fix the artificial price for the raw material.

      <P>Deputy Corry wanted us to remove the restrictions on farmers getting no bounties where they bring wheat to be milled for their own use. That point was raised on a former occasion.  I do not see why a farmer producing wheat for his own use should get a bounty on it.  That means that the farmer would be getting wheat for his own use at 15/- rather than 24/- a barrel.  Why should he get wheat cheaper than the consumers in the towns?  The farmer brings his wheat to the miller, and it is worth 15/-, together with 7/- or 8/- of a bounty. He gets the bounty and puts it in his pocket, and that means that he is bringing back wheat at the rate of 15/- a barrel for his own use.  Why should he have that advantage over the town consumer?  That is why I think the farmer in that case should not get the bounty.  Deputy Corry said that the clause could be evaded, but I will have a chat with the draftsman and see if it cannot be made more watertight. Deputy Corry said that instead of a bounty on wheat the millers should pay the full price and there should be no bounty at all.  That is worthy of consideration. I do not believe it could be done under this Bill by way of amendment.  It appears to be too big an item for treatment that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Curran said that there are not enough pigs in the country to fill the quota, because the prices of feeding stuffs are too dear.  The ingenuity displayed by the Opposition, in blaming me and the Government for everything, is extraordinary.  I am quite sure that if the quota was lower and there were too many pigs, Deputy Curran would not get up and congratulate me on that, but would say instead that I was no use because I did not make the quota high enough, and it is because it is high enough that he finds fault with the policy of the Government on that score now.  I think that that is not a good Opposition. When we were in opposition we were discreet, and we only found fault with the then Government when we had reason to find fault with them&mdash; although I admit that that was very <Col N="1956" /> often&mdash;but we did not find fault with them where there was no fault to be found.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, Deputy Curran made the complaint that pigs were not paying, which is altogether wrong, and there is no use in discussing it. He said that farmers were getting out of pigs and were not buying the mixture, and the reason he gave was that pigs went down 4/- in the last week. Imagine that from an intelligent farmer! Because they went down 4/- last week he gives that as a reason.  If it was that amount for the last 12 months it might be understandable, but because they went down 4/- last week this whole catastrophe has happened, according to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Leary, I think, is overanxious. I do not think that feeding stuffs are going to go up.  It must be remembered that they are based on the price of maize as it is imported, and that has been a fairly constant price for the last 12 months or two years.  With the price of the home-grown grain incorporated it is costing 17/- a barrel for oats.  I do not think the prices are going to be anything like that under the operation of this Bill.  I say that even if we did not bring in this Bill they will not go to that price again, because merchants and maize millers will buy sufficient corn this year to fill all their requirements and there will not be that rise in prices.  Accordingly, I do not think that there is any fear of prices going up as a result of this Bill.  I think that they are more likely to come down somewhat, because surely oats will not be up to 17/- a barrel or anything like that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Minch said that the producer will benefit from the Bill.  I hope so. He says that the manufacturer will be in difficulties.  I say that he buys oats, maize, barley, or whatever he wants and puts on whatever he thinks are fair profits and charges the sum total to the consumer; so that the manufacturer is not concerned very much with regard to prices.  He was concerned a little when this came in first with <Col N="1957" /> regard to the technical difficulties of milling oats and so on, but the price does not matter to him at all.  The consumer, possibly, will suffer, Deputy Minch thinks, but I think not.  I have already given my reason for that. Deputy Minch, however, asked an important question, and that is, whether we would fix the price, say, a month before the harvest or wait to see how the prices go before fixing it. It is quite obvious that this year we will have to wait to see how prices go, because this Bill is not likely to be through both Houses until well into September; and this is a very early harvest and the market will have opened for oats and barley by that time and we would be too late to anticipate it this year.  Accordingly, I think that we have to wait.  In any case, however, I should be inclined to wait and let prices open first.  If they were not what we considered fair, we would fix the price immediately.  I do not think there need be any hardship there.  The great difficulty of fixing a minimum price, from the point of view of the producer, is that every buyer may come down to our minimum price. If they were a little higher in such circumstances, we might be better pleased.  I think that we should avoid fixing the price until we see how things go first.</P>
    <P>I think that deals with Deputy Goulding's question also about fixing the price.  With regard to bushelling, which he was afraid of&mdash;the actual operation of bushelling&mdash;we can make arrangements with regard to the type of bushel to be used, and I do not think we will have any complaints on that issue.  With regard to the question of a fair price, even if I had in mind what I believe to be a fair price for oats and barley, it would not be correct for me to mention it here.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was just going to tell the Deputy my reason.  There is a consultative council under the Principal Act, and that consultative council is called together to consult on such questions.  They have always been called, for instance, for the change of regulations or a change in the percentage <Col N="1958" /> of mixture.  Surely, a question like this is most important&mdash;the question of the fixing of a price&mdash;and certainly the consultative council should be consulted.  The usual procedure is that the council comes along and I tell them what I propose to do. They either agree with me or they object, but so far, with all those consultative councils set up under those Acts, the consultative council and I have always agreed; that is to say, I have never issued an order so far against their wishes, although I have the right to do so.  I believe, therefore, that I might get agreement with the consultative council on this fixed price, whatever it might be, and would not feel that I was justified in stating what that price was until I had consulted with them.</P>
      <P>Deputy McGovern says that there is too much restriction on the producer. He is wrong in one thing.  No man, he says, can buy oats or barley without a licence.  That is not true.  The maize miller or the oat miller cannot buy oats and barley except from a registered dealer, and the registered dealer cannot buy it except at the fixed price, but he need not be a registered dealer. For instance, a buyer of oats for the feeding of horses or a buyer for a forage merchant here in the city need not be registered.  They can buy oats or barley without being registered.  It is only the maize miller or the oat miller that cannot.  A seed merchant, for instance, would be able to buy under this Bill.  When we brought in this maize mill legislation in 1932 I think there was a three days' discussion on the Second Reading, and there were hundreds of objections to it and hundreds of complaints about it.  They have all come down now to one, practically, and that is the question of price.  We have had a few complaints about the mixture being unsuitable.  I think that Deputy McGovern said that it was unsuitable for young bonhams.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must say that in saying that he is entirely at variance with the scientific experts in this and other countries and he is entirely at variance with the agricultural colleges that have been set up here and in other countries.  He is entirely at variance with these authorities <Col N="1959" /> because all these people say that you must have a balanced ration and that pure maize fed to small pigs is a waste; they say that small farmers who would feed pure maize to small pigs were acting unwisely.  We are doing them a service in preventing them because it is an entire waste to do so. Deputy McGovern asked about these reports.  I promised when the original Act was going through that I would send down inspectors to report on this. With regard to pure maize the regulation was that it was to be sold in stone packets.  The case was made in regard to Kerry and Donegal that the pure maize was used as human food and that we would be doing a hardship by insisting on the stone packet.  We were asked to allow pure maize to be sold in these two countries by the cwt.  I gave an undertaking that after a little time I would send inspectors down to these areas to report to me on how the Act was working; and I said I would consider their reports and adopt them if they considered it was necessary to make a change.  I sent the inspectors.  They came back and said that the people in Donegal and Kerry who were hitherto using pure maize for human food were now using a mixture of maize and oatmeal.  A short time after that the inspectors went to West Cork and other places and as a result of their report we reduced the stone packet to a ¼ stone packet.</P>

      <P>I am quite satisfied there are people in Cavan who are not satisfied with the maize mixture and there may be a certain amount of reason as to why these people on the mountain side are dissatisfied.  They feel they could get pure maize cheaper than the mixture. But, on the other hand, these people are possibly raising pigs and if bacon is sold in Rathdowney, as the Deputy mentioned, the farmers there <Col N="1960" /> are buying bacon cheaper than if there had been no tariff on bacon.  So they cannot have the advantage without also coming into the general policy.  I may say that there are people also in other parts of the country as well as in Cavan who are using the mixture.</P>

After another six months we sent inspectors again, and they came back and said they were more than satisfied with the regulations and we reduced the packet from 1 stone weight to ¼ stone weight.  That was the effect of the report.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, I wish to point out that the next item on the Agenda is the Slaughter of Cattle and Sheep Bill.  Normally, considering the remarkable provisions for restrictions on the sale of cattle contained in this Bill, the House might reasonably ask, at a time when the normal Press facilities of the country are not available, that the discussion on the Second Reading of this Bill would be postponed until the country generally would be able to get an interpretation of the terms of the Bill and when there might be some exchange of public opinion on the matter. There is this additional point which I wish to raise as a point of order.  The Bill as circulated discloses that a levy will be raised in respect of every beast slaughtered.  That is, it proposes to impose a direct piece of taxation.  In the first place, the long Title of the Bill, as disclosed to the House, did not show in any way that a levy of that particular kind was contemplated. <Col N="1961" /> When under the Agricultural Produce (Amendment) Cereals Act it was contemplated to propose a levy on the sale of wheat, that was definitely proposed in the long Title.</P>
      <P>When the First Reading of the Slaughter of Cattle and Sheep Bill was proposed here, the House could not possibly understand that it was proposed to impose taxation by this Bill. This Bill proposing a levy seems to me to be an unprecedented departure from order.  Before the circulation of this Bill was asked for, a Ways and Means Resolution ought to have been discussed in the House when the House would have an opportunity of discussing in Committee what this levy was, the extent of it, and for what exactly it was to be used.  I submit that in the first place it has been an unprecedented departure from order to produce a Bill of this kind without a Ways and Means Resolution, and, secondly, that it would be out of order to proceed with the Bill until the House has an opportunity of discussing the proposals for imposing a levy in respect of the slaughter of animals in the absence of a Ways and Means Resolution being placed before the House.</P>

      <P>Deputy Mulcahy has raised two points of order. First as regards the absence of publicity for this important measure owing to the strike in the printing trade, the Bill has been ordered by the House for consideration to-day.  That order can only be discharged and superseded by the House itself.  The second point presents more difficulty.  According to Standing Order 101 every Motion for any aid, grant, charge or levy on the public should be preceded by what is usually styled a Ways and Means Resolution unless such charge is merely incidental to a Bill.  In the case of the Cement Bill the House agreed to the passage of the Bill though there was no such preliminary Resolution.  It seems to me, however, that the levy is a fundamental principle of the Slaughter of Cattle and Sheep Bill, and as this measure deals with an industry of basic import, the Chair is of opinion that the precedents referred to by the Deputy should be followed and that a ways and means resolution should <Col N="1962" /> be put down for to-morrow, and the Second Reading postponed until to-morrow.  Before giving a definite decision I should like to hear the Minister on the place of the levy in this Bill.  Could the levy be regarded as merely incidental?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <P>(b)  that when such loan was so made there was an arrangement or understanding between the said Corporation and such society that the amount of such loan and the interest thereon would be secured (in addition to any other security which may have been given) by a charge on the uncalled capital of such society, if and when such charge could lawfully be made....</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of the amendment is to delete words that were found to be unnecessary, or, perhaps I should not say unnecessary, but rather that would defeat the effect of the clause.  In this arrangement made by the Agricultural Credit Corporation with the societies concerned, it was explained by the Minister for Defence, in my absence, that there was an understanding between the Credit Corporation and the Minister for Agriculture that the position would be made right legally at a later date.  The rules of the society enabled them to charge their uncalled capital, but the law did not, as it stands, enable the Agricultural Credit Corporation to take that charge.  If these words were to remain in it was doubtful whether we might not have lost the whole effect of our Bill.  In <Col N="1964" /> any case, they are not necessary.  When the attention of the draftsman was called to the matter he agreed that they should be removed.  It is really a legal matter whether the words would defeat that clause or not.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardCurran" hpid="Mr. Curran Mr. Curran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
      <P>It was a power that I did not want to give them.  The Bill was introduced to give the Agricultural Credit Corporation power to have unpaid-up capital at their disposal as a security.  I think the whole matter is not to the best advantage of the creameries, because if a creamery is in a bad financial position like that it will not be in the position to carry on or to keep going.</P>
      <P>I happen to be a member of a creamery society myself.  I joined only a few years ago and the reason why it is not able to pay as much as other creameries is because of the fact that it has a certain amount of interest to pay.  The Minister told me on one occasion that my creamery was a bad one.  I know that even to-day the price we are paying is practically a halfpenny more than is required in other places. That is due to the fact that the overhead charge&mdash;the interest&mdash;was militating against that particular creamery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister wants to safeguard the Agricultural Credit Corporation by providing that the unpaid capital can be called on if the creamery is not in a sound position.  Some other means <Col N="1965" /> should be adopted with these creameries than that.  I am perfectly well aware, and the Minister himself knows, that it is creameries which are in a bad financial position which will look for credit.  Some other means ought to be adopted than calling upon unpaid capital, which will not be much in any case.  I put this point before in the absence of the Minister.  I know the Minister wants to safeguard his own side.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood, when the Bill was being introduced, that it was an empowering Bill rather than a retrospective Bill.  Unless I am mistaken, this particular clause as drafted is one that seeks to give to the Agricultural Credit Corporation certain powers in excess of anything they have at the moment.  I had no objection to this Bill as an empowering Bill, but to copper-fasten or to control the conditions in respect of a lending corporation, giving them authority they had not got before, is certainly seeking an extension, the first intimation of which we have in the powers of this measure. As far as uncalled capital is concerned, it certainly is a very great power to give by a measure in respect of advances made some time previously.  In these matters we would require to exercise something amounting to almost judicial discretion.  If a lender advances money he does so on the security that is there; he gets no more. If a statute is introduced to strengthen his position he has much greater title to his money than before.  I would like the Minister to leave this matter over till the Report Stage and look into it.  The Bill, as I understand it, was not for the benefit of the Agricultural Credit Corporation but rather to give whatever help the statutes up to this had not provided for the co-operative societies.  In other words, to go on the principle of raising debentures, and to give them an opportunity to get out of their immediate difficulties.  But as I read this clause, if the particular phrase is taken out we certainly will be presenting a cheque to the Agricultural Credit Corporation unless I am mistaken.  Unless the Minister can satisfy us about that, I think he should <Col N="1966" /> leave the matter over to the Report Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to remind Deputies of the position at the time. The Government at the time&mdash;it was about 1929 this thing occurred&mdash;and the Minister for Agriculture in particular, were anxious to start creameries in certain areas.  The way those creameries were financed was that there was a rather irregular way of assessing so many shares on each shareholder or supplier according to the number of cows he had.  Suppliers only paid a very small amount of the share.  I do not remember the exact amount, but it was only something like 1/- or 2/6. The remainder was advanced by the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  I do not think that Deputy Cosgrave or any other Deputy would like to see the Agricultural Credit Corporation done out of that money.  The Agricultural Credit Corporation at the time realised that it had not full powers to do that, but it was told that there was a Co-operative Bill in preparation and that things would be made right for it under the Bill.  If it went to court it would be difficult for it to prove its full title.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Agricultural Credit Corporation made the advance, and those creameries were to collect 2/6 per share per year and pay that to the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  Some have done that.  Others have not. Others say that they find it impossible to collect the money on the shares. They are not defying the Corporation. They say that they are doing their best. I do not know whether they are or not, but the point is that the Corporation feels it has not a proper title to this uncalled for capital.  The point was in doubt, and it was made clear to the <Col N="1967" /> Corporation that it would be made right for them in future legislation. With regard to the amendment, an objection was made by the legal adviser to the Corporation that these particular words, &ldquo;if and when such charge could be lawfully made,&rdquo; might destroy the whole effect of the Bill, as the courts might hold that it could not be lawfully made at the time.  The draftsman agrees that the words should be removed.</P>

The principal intention of this Bill, I understand, is to deal with such creameries.  He gave me to understand there were creameries from which he was unable to collect the levy, and that was the principal reason for the introduction of the Bill.  I asked him on that occasion for certain information which I thought would be forthcoming on this occasion.  Several Bills have been rushed through here to-day, and it would take a superman to understand the whole of them.

      <P>Travelling creameries have been tried to some extent in County Kerry.  They are not all that has been written about them in the newspapers, but they should prove useful from one point of view; that is, to try out a district in which we are not sure of a supply. The Minister who acted for me on the Second Reading of this Bill explained that very fully.  He explained that we very often get a request&mdash;almost a demand&mdash;from a district for the starting of a creamery.  They tell us that there will be no difficulty in securing a supply of 3,000 or 4,000 gallons of milk. We find, on investigation, that that is a very optimistic estimate.  Eventually, perhaps, a creamery is built at a cost of £1,300 or £1,400.  Then we find that the milk supply, instead of being 3,000 <Col N="1970" /> or 4,000 gallons, is considerably below that figure and the creamery is a failure.  In the other case, the travelling creamery goes to a district and tests it out for a whole season.  If it is not a success, the travelling creamery can be moved to some other place for another season.  As a permanent institution in a successful district, the travelling creamery would not pay as well as a fixed creamery, but it would have a certain advantage.  It might cover a district of 15 miles by five miles.</P>
      <P>Somebody asked, on Second Reading, if the creamery would go into everybody's yard.  It will not do that. It will stop at certain points&mdash;say, at cross roads&mdash;and take the milk of a certain number of farmers at each stop. It would do a rather long stretch of country&mdash;say 15 miles long by 5 miles &mdash;by making three or four stops.  It has, in this way, an advantage over the fixed creamery, which could only cover a five-mile radius, at the outside. As Deputy Curran knows, a five-mile radius is rather big.  A three and a half mile radius would be more satisfactory. A travelling creamery would deal with practically the same amount of milk as the fixed creamery by taking about 400 gallons at each stop.  That is, as regards capacity.  The expense of managing it would not be very much different. When you have an auxiliary manager in the fixed creamery, you would have the same type of man in charge of the separating part of the travelling creamery.  An auxiliary manager, with the help, perhaps, of a boy, might suffice in a fixed creamery, but, in the case of the travelling creamery, you must have a skilled lorry driver.  In that way wages might be a bit higher in the case of the travelling creamery.</P>

      <P>What would be the cost of production?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not worked out that fully, but I am giving some of the differences of cost.  The cost of equipment would be cheaper in the case of the travelling creamery.  The lorry would cost about £250.  The separator, crude oil engine, and so forth, would cost about £400.  You must, of course, make some provision for water supply at the stops.  The total cost would be <Col N="1971" /> about £760.  In the other case, building would cost about £350, crude oil engine and separator, £550, and water supply £100.  The total cost might come to £1,000.  The capital cost in the case of the fixed creamery would, therefore, be about £1,000, and, in the case of the travelling creamery, about £700.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards depreciation, the position is altogether different.  In the case of the fixed creamery, depreciation would be at the rate of about 5 per cent. on the building&mdash;say £17 10s.  In the case of the lorry, depreciation would amount to about 25 per cent. Depreciation in respect of plant would be about 20 per cent.  Depreciation would be much higher in the case of a travelling creamery than in the case of a fixed creamery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCurran" hpid="Mr. Curran Mr. Curran">

      <P>How many of these creameries have been working?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have only one working but we hope to get two going this season on Dingle Peninsula.  I do not know whether we will succeed or not. From the figures I have given, any Deputy can make out a rough estimate of the merits of the two creameries. The figures I have given are only estimates. So far, the creamery has been tried only from the point of view of efficiency.  It is quite efficient in the separating of the milk.  We have not been viewing the thing at all from the point of view of costings.  It would take two or three years' working before we would know what the cost would be but we are of opinion that depreciation would be heavy.  We know what depreciation in the case of a lorry would be. We estimate that depreciation of separating machinery would be much heavier in the case of a travelling creamery than it would be in the case of a fixed creamery.  That, however, is only an estimate.  The conclusion to be drawn is, I think, that, if there is a sufficient supply of milk, the fixed creamery is much more economic than the travelling creamery.  But on the <Col N="1972" /> other hand, for the purpose of trying out the idea a travelling creamery would be very useful and should get a trial from that point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCurran" hpid="Mr. Curran Mr. Curran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the extra cost of the travelling creamery&mdash;the extra cost of manufacture&mdash;would it be fair to draw that conclusion?  What I mean by that is that where you have a fixed creamery the cost of production would be somewhat lower.  The experiment might succeed there while it might fail in the case of the travelling creamery.  I understand that the average supply for a creamery is round about 5,000 gallons of milk a day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RichardCurran" hpid="Mr. Curran Mr. Curran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  But still the principal thing in the case of a creamery is a good milk supply.  I had been putting the point to the Minister for Finance, in the absence of the Minister for Agriculture, that the travelling creamery would cost more, and I wanted to know whether the Government would bear a share of the cost of the production because the Minister had pointed out that they could not produce an article as cheaply as the ordinary creamery.  I said that for that reason it would not be fair to draw a comparison between the two.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The only thing to be taken into account is the supply.  If we get 1,500 gallons inside a four-mile radius we will certainly come to the conclusion that an auxiliary creamery would be justified.  It would not matter what the cost of the travelling creamery was at all.  It would not enter into it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder whether the experiment is worth the expense unless there is some use afterwards for the travelling creamery in counties like Kerry.  On the question of cost there is only a difference of about £400 at the outside between the travelling creamery and the auxiliary.  Unless the Minister is able to find use afterwards for the travelling creamery I do not know if the game is worth the cost. I wonder how long the try out of an area is to go on before a creamery will be built, because I have particulars of <Col N="1973" /> an area in mind in respect of which returns were furnished to the Minister's Department close on two years ago. That area has not yet been supplied with an auxiliary creamery.  It seems to take that particular branch of the Department as long to move as it would take to settle the whole Irish question. I do not know exactly what is wrong with them, but they seem to have gone into the ways of an old fogey.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCurran" hpid="Mr. Curran Mr. Curran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
      <P>And you have not been able to shift them.  That is surprising.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>We will try and shift them.  If they do not do something we will move them out.  That particular area has been already tried out.  Returns have been obtained and these were handed into the Department 12 months ago.  The people of the district have this difficulty to contend with: that those in the neighbouring creamery areas are getting the benefit of the butter bounty, while they have still to depend on the old separator system. They are not getting the advantages of the bounty that is being paid to their more fortunate neighbours.  I would suggest to the Minister that, instead of going ahead with this experiment, to find out where he will put creameries, he should put up creameries in the areas that have already been tried out, and let the experiments wait.  In this particular area that I speak of, he need not carry out an experiment at all. The area is there, the cows are there, and I see no reason for further delay in putting up a creamery.  The returns in connection with it were sent in nearly two years ago, and it is about time that something was done.  The cows have already been guaranteed, and the milk supply is available.  The thing has been in hands long enough God knows, and it is about time that the Department came to a decision on it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the idea of the travelling creamery not something in the nature of prospecting in an area? I think the Minister should give us an idea of what he considers would be a successful experiment.  It strikes me that if you start to prospect in this way in an area that people are not going <Col N="1974" /> to go whole-heartedly into it or put up the required number of cows if they are faced with the danger mentioned by Deputy Corry that they may have to wait a long time from the date of the withdrawal of the travelling creamery until they get a fixed creamery, or the danger that, in the opinion of the creamery authorities, it would not be a business proposition to put up a fixed creamery in their district.  I would like to have some more information from the Minister.  I am sure the Minister is not going to send a travelling creamery into an area unless he gets an invitation by way of a petition from the farmers living there.  I imagine that he would require some inducement of that sort.  This is a very difficult matter.  I am afraid that in the case of a travelling creamery farmers may have fears of one kind or another and may not go to the expense of buying a lot of cows.  The position in the case of a fixed creamery is quite different, because, of course, it would not be erected unless a district had been tried out and it could not be taken away on wheels like the travelling creamery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexHaslett" hpid="Mr. Haslett Mr. Haslett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haslett</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexHaslett" hpid="Mr. Haslett Mr. Haslett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haslett</NameTxt>
      <P>In that case I think the Minister is rather under-estimating what that plant would cost.  There are a number of things that will have to be taken into consideration.  The question of a water supply is one.  I have had some little experience of creamery work.  In my part of the country we find that it is much more satisfactory to bring in the milk by lorry from a district rather than to put up a separating station there: that is if the district is within reasonable reach.  The Minister talked of an area 15 miles by five.  For a long time I have thought, in connection with the creamery movement, that it has been a great mistake to have too many separating stations erected.  It would have been better.  I think, to have concentrated on a more substantial plant at one point and bring the milk to it from the surrounding areas.  A <Col N="1975" /> creamery across the Border that was taking a good deal of milk had to cease doing so because it could not get the bounty on the other side.  We have put a lorry on and we are taking the supply that formerly went to that creamery.  We find that the arrangement is working very well.  We have put in another separating plant.  That has helped to reduce our overhead charges, because we are able to work a larger supply of milk and butter.  All the work is being done by the one plant.  That enables us to have proper control.  I agree that if there are districts too remote from an existing creamery this new arrangement may work well.</P>
      <P>I think if it is at all possible that the milk could be brought by lorry or cart we should go slow about those travelling creameries.  Where does the State come in?  What contribution is it making towards this? In one district the people may get together and put up a co-operative creamery without any aid.  They have had to do it.  We have had to do it.  One would like to know just what help the Minister contemplates giving.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The success of the experiments would depend altogether, I think, on the supply.  If there is, within a certain radius which would normally supply a fixed creamery, sufficient to run that fixed creamery, then we take the experiment to be successful, and we authorise the building of a creamery.  That brings us to the question asked by Deputy Haslett. Do not assume that the Government is going to do all this at all.  When this Bill is passed it will be quite possible for any creamery to ask for a licence to operate a travelling creamery in some outlying district. Any co-operative creamery might get a licence to run a travelling creamery, and having proved the experiment to be successful they might build a fixed creamery, or otherwise they might say: &ldquo;No; it is not going to be a success&rdquo; and the thing would be dropped.  It is only in a case where the Dairy Disposals Board are working <Col N="1976" /> that the Government would come into it through the Dairy Disposals Board.  The Dairy Disposals Board may do experiments of this kind.  They are, as a matter of fact, doing it in Dingle, but that is, of course, their territory.  It is the territory of the Dairy Disposals Board, and it is their business to work that territory.  If it were territory which should properly be covered by the existing co-operative society the Dairy Disposals Board would not come in.  They would let the co-operative creamery deal with the district if they wished.  There will not be any money lost on the experiment. Deputy Corry speaks about a loss, and asks if it is worth while. There need not be any loss.  Even if this thing goes on for 12 months a lorry is a lorry afterwards.  It is a year older, of course, but it is a lorry anyway.  The separating machinery can be used in the fixed creamery the same as on the lorry.  Even the stands can be used as platforms if we cannot make any better use of them.  Deputy Corry speaks about his own particular area.  What I have said refers to that, that is, that if there is a co-operative creamery there which is anxious to make the experiment it can get a travelling creamery.  It is a matter for consideration, but I think they would get a licence to test out that area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have the number of cows, but when we build a creamery the number of cows are not there at all.  That is not a good test.  The test is whether they will bring their milk to the creamery or not, and how much milk they will bring.  It is the only test that is any use.  In East Cork we have encouraged co-operative creameries to expand.  We have given all the encouragement we could to one particular creamery.  We helped them to get a loan, to expand, and build auxiliaries.  In regard to another one, we asked them to expand, and said we would give them all the help we could. Those co-operative creameries ought to expand, and they are not very quick about moving.  I think they are really the fossils and not the Department of <Col N="1977" /> Agriculture.  It is those co-operative creameries in East Cork that are not making a move.  We should only be too delighted if they did make a move. If they definitely refuse to move&mdash;they have not done so yet&mdash;it might then be a question for us to consider whether or not we would do anything. We have not reached that stage yet.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Sub-section (3) says that the Minister may at any time at his absolute discretion revoke a licence granted under this section.  Is such drastic power necessary?  I do not accept the Minister's statement that if a licence were revoked there would not be a loss.  There is bound to be a loss.  Even if the lorry is still there, one must allow for depreciation.  The same applies to machinery.  If it is an experiment, I take it it is an experiment in the broad sense; having succeeded in one or two districts, it may go into another.  That particular sub-section would, to my mind, damage the prospect of intensifying this type of experiment.  I take it that the experiment is in the nature of seeing whether there is ground for a creamery being established in that district.  Has the Minister any views on the travelling creamery succeeding on its own and just maintaining itself?  The expenses are so heavy that it is not likely.  Whether it is an experiment in the sense of waiting to see if there is a supply of milk for the establishment of a creamery, or whether it is to remain there for a while to allow for some returns to be made on the money, that power to revoke a licence at the Minister's absolute discretion is a very drastic one.  Perhaps the Minister would consider that point on the Report Stage.</P>

Up to the present at least three inspectors from the Dairy Disposals Board have visited that district and made reports to the Minister. I know that the lists of cows have been supplied to the Department on at least four separate occasions.  The number of cows is 3,500.  If the Minister has <Col N="1978" /> any doubt as to the supply of milk he can go down to Mogeely any day.  The creamery there starts separating at 7 o'clock in the morning and finishes at 4.30 that evening.  The same applies to the Glenville creamery, which is another auxiliary creamery.  They are at present trying to manage the work of at least five extra creameries owing to the delay in getting along into steam.  There is no use in talking of co-operative creameries in that particular area, and the Minister knows that.</P>

After all, I think it is definitely up to the Minister's Department to make some move in this matter now. The returns have been sent in repeatedly, and if the Minister has any doubt about the matter he can send his inspectors to Mogeely and Glenville. I should be pleased to meet them any day, and let them see the quantity of milk that is going in there.  At present fourteen lorries are drawing milk to one auxiliary creamery.  The thing is completely uneconomic at present.</P>

      <P>I did not intend to intervene in this debate, but I gathered from the speeches made that some Deputies are inclined to be sceptical about this travelling creamery question. I should like to mention just a few points.  It has certainly been looked forward to by the people in the mountainous areas of Kerry as a way out of their difficulties.  It has also served as an experiment in a particular area.  I believe the travelling creamery has come to stay, and that it will pay for itself in this way, that while you have auxiliaries or central creameries in a county, the travelling creameries will act as feeders, and as a means of linking up isolated districts.  The <Col N="1979" /> travelling creamery has been tested in North Kerry, where the maximum capacity was up to 700 gallons per hour. That appears to be a very fair return when compared with the supply to large creameries.  The travelling creamery will be a great boon to people in congested and mountainous areas and should pay for itself.</P>
      <P>Deputies who asked why these creameries were introduced have no conception at all of the great benefit they will be to counties like Kerry.  On behalf of the people in South and West Kerry I wish to congratulate the Minister on bringing the question to this stage.  We have seen the matter tested in North Kerry, and we know it is going to be a success.  When the people in other counties realise that there will be a demand for an extension to other areas.</P>

      <P>This section says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1) It shall not be lawful for any person to tender or supply any milk or cream to any creamery which has been established or is being maintained in contravention of Section 13 of the Principal Act, and every per son who tenders or supplies any milk or cream in contravention of this sub-section shall be guilty of an offence under this sub-section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the last occasion this Bill was before the House I asked the Minister who was then in charge of it to say how many creameries he wanted to bring under his wing, which would be affected by the levy, because I believe that is the principal reason for its introduction.  I was led to believe that there were creameries from which the Minister would not be able to collar the levy of 3½d. per pound.  I also wanted to know the supply to these creameries.  As I was not able to get the information then I would like to have it before this section is passed. The levy has had serious reactions on <Col N="1980" /> creameries with which I am concerned. In May we got a demand for £1,000 odd, and in June for £1,200.  We got nothing from the Minister.  Now he wants to turn round and to collar some creameries that want to evade some clause in the Principal Act.  Just like the pig question, the people will have to pay for everything they produce.  I want to know from the Minister how many creameries he wants to deal with now, the supply to these creameries, and the total levy it is proposed to get.</P>

      <P>It would not be right to do so.  They were started by certain people, principally in Cork.  The farmers brought milk there, had it separated, and made into butter.  If we send an inspector there under the provisions of the Act to ask who owns the place, farmers and men working about say they do not know.  As no one knows, the inspector, if he wants to enforce an order, cannot do so.  The House passed an Act in 1928 in order to regulate the creamery industry, and, as Deputies know, a very large sum of money was spent in buying out the proprietors and handing over the creameries to co-operative societies. The late Government considered that necessary in order to safeguard the position, and not to allow the late proprietors to come in again and put up creameries in opposition or to allow one co-operative creamery to start against another.  Under the Act of 1928 the Minister for Agriculture must give a permit to start a creamery, and he must be satisfied that there is a need for a creamery and that it is not in competition with other creameries. These creameries are in competition with others.</P>

      <P>Within the last year. They are in competition with other creameries and they were put up purposely to hit other creameries.  We cannot sue them under the Creamery Act or close them, because we do not know in law who owns them.  Also, they are not paying any levy.  That is true, but it is only part of the trouble. The only way we have of dealing with them is the method proposed in Section 4.  Deputy Cosgrave will, I am sure, be quite familiar with the procedure in the case of a derelict house in the city.  When we want to get at the owner, we post a notice on the building telling him to come along to court on such a date.  That is all we can do, and we are going to do the same thing here.  We are proposing that a notice <Col N="1983" /> be posted on the door when we cannot find the owner telling him to appear in court to answer the charge on a certain day.  If he does not appear, we deal with him, and if he does, the summons is amended to include the person who appears and who proves that he is the owner.</P>

      <P>I do not think the Deputy quite grasps the nature of the <Col N="1987" /> Advisory Board which is to be set up under this section.  It relates only to the functions of the Minister for Industry and Commerce under the Bill, and these functions are concerned only with the distribution amongst manufacturers of the various parcels of tobacco in the rehandling station after they have been graded and packed.  The Minister, in that connection, would have nothing to do with conditions of employment or anything else, and the Board would in no sense be advising him in such matters.  They are a Board representative of the manufacturers for the purpose of ensuring that the opinions of the manufacturers with respect to allocations of tobacco as between themselves will be fairly and properly considered.  It does not appear, therefore, that there should be anybody on this Board except the people concerned with the particular matters, and they are the manufacturers only.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;The retailers believe that manufacturers have set up premises where goods are sold to the public for less than the invoiced prices to legitimate traders.  The object is the elimination of retail traders and the substitution of machine and store trade. By eliminating employment, manufacturers might expect to increase already big profits.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I should not like to express an opinion on that, because it does not appear to have any relevancy to the particular matter which Deputy Corish's amendment concerns.  It is proposed that the Minister for Industry and Commerce shall have certain functions under this Bill with respect to the distribution amongst the manufacturers of tobacco grown in the Saorstát and rehandled in the licensed rehandling stations.  It is felt that there should be a body set up composed <Col N="1988" /> of manufacturers to ensure that, in making allocations of the tobacco, the Minister will act fairly as between one manufacturer and another and to ensure that only tobacco suitable to the particular processes carried on by any manufacturer will be sent to him.  That is the sole function of this board, which has nothing whatever to do with anything concerning the retail trade, the wages of workers or the interests of growers or anything else.  It is concerned only with that particular point of the allocation between manufacturers of the tobacco available.</P>

      <P>As it stands at present the section reads &ldquo;If any person (being a grower, curer, rehandler or manufacturer) makes, in any return or other document....&rdquo;  The insertion of the word &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; might be considered in relation to this section.  Mistakes may be very easily made by persons not accustomed to reading Acts of Parliament or even to making returns.  Although the mistake might be a very serious one, there might be no criminal intent or no desire to deceive.  The Minister is probably as well acquainted with agriculturists as anyone else, and he can understand how a man, unaccustomed to making returns, furnishing documents, or anything of that sort, may make mistakes in regard to them.  I think it would be an injustice if these men were convicted of making a false return, which was made owing to a mistake or something of that sort.  As the section stands, they can be prosecuted and convicted for what would be regarded as a very serious mistake, although not so intended.  The Minister, I am sure, has experience of the Revenue mind with regard to these things.  It is a very severe mind.  It is not one that is directly applicable to the people concerned, such as growers, <Col N="1990" /> rehandlers and so on, and I think the word &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; might be inserted in this particular section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy will realise that if the word &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; were to be inserted the onus would be on the Minister to prove that the person actually knew he was making a false return.  I think that would be extremely difficult.  The Revenue Commissioners have a strict code, but they must bring an offender before the District Justice.  I think the Deputy will admit that a District Justice is usually inclined to be lenient to the farmer when the Government is prosecuting. In all cases he will give the benefit of the doubt to the farmer.  If the Minister, as prosecutor, had to prove to the District Justice that the farmer not only made a false return, but that he knowingly made it, I am afraid we would never get a conviction.  I think the grower or curer or rehandler is quite safe in appearing before the District Justice.  Also the words &ldquo;in any material respect&rdquo; are included in the section here, so that it will have to be a very serious error.  If the person who is prosecuted were to say that it was just a mistake, that he was prepared to make it good and to do the thing right in future, I am sure he would get off.</P>

      <P>I do not think the District Justice has any option.  As the section stands, I think he has to convict. An explanation may modify the conviction, but it is the conviction which matters.  The fine of £100 provided for here satisfies me that it is the revenue people who are on the spot. They always like three figures.  Two figures have no attraction for them whatever.  For persons accustomed to making returns it is all right as they will take precautions, but for people who are not so accustomed to it it is quite a different matter.  The insertion of the word &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; would not mean any relaxation on the part of people who have to fill up these returns.</P>

      <P>I appeal to the Minister to accept the suggestion of Deputy Cosgrave.  The Minister seems to pin his faith to the fact that the District Justice will be on the side of the farmer, but the District Justice will have to interpret the section as it appears here.  He will have to impose the fine, but he can recommend that it should be reduced.  There is no reason why there should be such a drastic provision in this section.  I ask the Minister to accept the suggestion of Deputy Cosgrave and put in the word &ldquo;knowingly.&rdquo;  Anyone might make a mistake.  Even the Minister might make a mistake, and he is accustomed to filling up forms.  The only reason which would justify the section as drafted is if there was an intent to defraud.</P>

      <P>I suggest that the Minister should eliminate the word &ldquo;grower&rdquo; from the section and deal with the rehandlers and manufacturers. Most of these gentlemen are very clever and are used to juggling with the revenue authorities and can be trusted to fight them.  I suggest if the Minister took the word &ldquo;grower&rdquo; out of the section and let it apply to the rehandlers and the manufacturers it would cover the whole business.  I should not like to see the manufacturers left too free in this at all, because, from my experience of them last year, they are allowed to rob the farmers to the best of their ability. The ordinary farmer is not accustomed to filling up forms, and the forms you get in connection with tobacco growing <Col N="1992" /> are so puzzling that you would nearly want help to fill them yourself, not to say the ordinary man who is not accustomed to filling up such forms.  I suggest you leave the grower out of the question and deal with the manufacturer and the rehandler.</P>

      <P>That is the very thing that vitiates measures of this sort.  We must be just to all persons, no matter to what class they may belong.  You should not commence legislating with a prejudice against any class.  Injustice  bound to come from it, and it will react upon you.  It will come back and perhaps hit the Deputy himself later on when the people with no property have got complete control.  The following section gives a picture of the revenue mind.  The manufacturer convicted of an offence loses his licence. I wonder have the Revenue Commissioners ever made a mistake, or even the Minister?  We have had experience of the Minister this evening when he submitted a Bill containing the most extensive amendments to a previous Bill of his that one ever has experienced in connection with an Act of Parliament.  More than half of the measure&mdash;and it was a very big one&mdash; was taken up with sections amending his misdeeds, his misconceptions, his lack of foresight, or something else of that sort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now he has the grower, the handler, and the manufacturer in his hands, and he is treating them very differently to the courteous and gentle manner in which the House treated him this evening. In the following section the licence is withdrawn for a simple mistake on the part of the person concerned. Let us say that one is asked to direct somebody on a road.  Mistakes have often been made in that connection.  Would you describe that as &ldquo;false and misleading information&rdquo;? In this case the person is to be fined £100, if he happens to be the grower, the rehandler, or the manufacturer. The Minister may not have the power to do this himself, but  ought to press on those considering the matter that it is unfair to certain people who may be unaccustomed to fixing up these documents, or even to <Col N="1993" /> those who are, because they happen to commit a very simple, <i>bona fide</i> mistake, to make them liable to a fine of £100, and subsequently to the loss of their licences.</P>

      <P>So far as amendments to an Act are concerned, we had 133 amendments to a Land Bill at one time. So far as this section is concerned, the grower, who will be in 99 cases out of 100 a farmer, may not have the necessary knowledge for filling up complicated forms sent out by the revenue authorities.  The manufacturer is in an entirely different position.  The manufacturer may be found putting 5 per cent. of Irish tobacco into his blend instead of 20 or 25 per cent., and he may say: &ldquo;I made a mistake.&rdquo;  I think he should be punished for that mistake.  The manufacturer should be very carefully watched this year and next year.  I would be in favour of giving the Minister full power in that respect.</P>

      <P>I am informed by people who are growing tobacco that a certain amount of notice is necessary &mdash;at least a month's notice.  You have the seeds in March and the plants in May.  But it must be understood that certain preparation of the land has got to take place, and it may be necessary to do that in the autumn of the previous year.  There is no date down here in this particular section.  An area order, if it be published too late, may not give the required time.  I understand a considerable amount of manuring must take place, and in some cases that is done months before the seeds are planted.  Perhaps the Minister will consider the question of an early publication in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>?</P>

      <P>That certainly could be considered, but I do not know that it <Col N="1994" /> will meet the Deputy's point.  Suppose we were to publish in September of the coming year what the total area will be, and the maximum amount to be allotted to each person, that does not tell any particular person that he will be growing tobacco.  In another section he is asked to make application for a licence before the 31st December. If we left the date 31st December we could not issue licences and notify farmers how much tobacco they will be allowed to grow, if any, until the middle of February.  We will have to push that date forward if we are to do anything.  Some farmers object to that date as being too early.</P>

      <P>The position would be this.  The rehandling might not be concluded by December, and you would not know exactly how much tobacco you would have until the rehandling is concluded.  So far as the manuring of the land is concerned, it should be done in October, and people should have a reasonable opportunity of knowing, if they specially prepare the land in October, that they are going to get a licence for growing tobacco on that land.  It is generally admitted that manuring at the point of planting is not good.  Better results are got when the manuring is done some months in advance. The date, the 31st December, might possibly meet that, provided the people get a reasonable indication from the revenue authorities that they would get a licence and would not be disappointed.  If the Minister is satisfied that the 31st December will suit, and before that date the revenue authorities are in a position to give these people licences, then that would cover it.  The general method is that they advise by letter that a licence may or may not be granted, and if they indicated in that letter that the licence would be granted within a definite time it would not disappoint anybody.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the one, I think, that raises that question.  My information is much the same as Deputy O'Reilly's information, that earlier manuring must take place.  If that be so, as I am informed by a grower, the application to the Revenue Commissioners in respect of a licence must be made within the last six months before the commencement of each year.  If we take it that the application would be made in June or July, will the grower get information in September or October as to the areas that will be allotted to him?  If not, one of two things may happen.  A man may manure land on which he will not be allowed to grow tobacco, and it takes a much heavier quantity of manure than another crop, and it may be that he will incur considerable expense and not get the advantage of it. Accordingly, I think that in this particular case the Minister should ensure that the Revenue Commissioners would reply promptly, that there would be an early allocation of the actual area to be allotted, and that, having made that early allocation of the area and given an early reply, the individuals concerned will not be at any loss.  They may have been able to stand some loss during the last year or two, but with the prices now available there is no margin whatever for such contingent losses as would arise in a case of that sort.</P>

      <P>I suggest that the Revenue authorities ought to be able to give a definite reply to the applicants by the 1st December.  The date for applications ought to close on 1st November and the reply should be given out at least by the 1st December. It does not make much difference to the farmer if he gets a refusal by the 1st December, because, after all, it is practically the same treatment that you give land for beet as for tobacco, and you can fill in the ground with beet instead of tobacco.  Practically the same circumstances occurred with me this year.  I applied for five acres and I only got one, so I had to fall back on another crop.</P>

      <P>The Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Agriculture are concerned principally in this.  But I think that the Revenue Commissioners would welcome an earlier date than 31st December.  Certainly, from an administrative point of view the Department of Agriculture also would welcome it.  I am afraid, however, that we would be making a great mistake in changing the date here.  For instance, the 30th April is the date for a wheat grower.  His crops are sown and he is looking forward to the harvest for his cash.  Last year, however, we had to bring in an amending Bill to extend the date, and this year I am afraid that we will have to bring in a further amendment to this already very much amended Bill, as Deputy Cosgrave says, to extend the date.  We cannot get those farmers to register as wheat growers until they actually have the grain ready for sale.</P>

If the date was put down before the 31st December and growers were entitled to get a licence at any date before that, provided that the licence was made definite, I think that would cover it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder what is the position in regard to rehandlers' licences this year?  As the Minister is aware, there is not any great difference in the price of tobacco to the grower, and on that particular point he has fixed it at 5d. to the rehandler.  If the rehandling licences are confined to the co-operative societies of growers, who have rehandling stations fixed up themselves, in that manner 2d. or possibly 3d. out of the 5d. will find its way back and could be added on to the price of the tobacco.  After all, there is a very strong argument for confining rehandlers' licences solely to co-operative societies of growers.  I understand that in Cork our co-operative society can deal with 15,000 lbs. of tobacco a week in the season.  That would mean that we could deal with practically from 250 to 300 acres of tobacco in the tobacco season.  I think that the Minister should take steps to see that that full quota is reserved to the co-operative rehandling society in Cork. After all, the more tobacco you get in the less your overhead charges will be and the better chance the grower has of getting back, in addition to the price of his tobacco, 1d. or 2d. of the rehandling money passed on to the price of his tobacco.  I think that only a very poor case can be made for granting rehandlers' licences to proprietors, who start out on their own thinking that there is something in the game, as a lot of them did last year and made fortunes in a day.  It was from 11d. to 2/- a lb.  Very many of them made a fortune on the business last year, and I see no reason why they should be continued now.  If the Minister continues to give licences to those people he will find himself in the same position as that in which the co-operative creameries <Col N="1998" /> found themselves some years ago. He will have to come along and buy out their interests if he now allows these vested interests to grow up.  This is the time to hit those people on the head and get rid of them.  There is no room for too many middlemen coming between the producer and the manufacturer in this country.  Unfortunately in the case of every business got up by the farmer these middlemen creep along and skim off the cream.  That is what happened in connection with the rehandling position, and that is what will happen again unless they are carefully watched.  From what I can see, I think the co-operative society in Meath will be able to cope with a large quantity of the tobacco there.  I think there are a couple of other co-operative societies which are prepared to go ahead as rehandling stations.  If there are 1,000 acres under tobacco there is only room for three or four rehandling stations at the outside in order to deal with that acreage on an economic basis. I do not see that there is any room for others stepping in.  It takes a bit of time to train the girls and men at rehandling tobacco.  We have already a staff trained in Cork.</P>

      <P>Yes, Cork is always first. The unfortunate part of it is that unless a sufficient quota of tobacco is available to give enough work to the co-operative societies that are dealing with rehandling, these societies will not be able to go ahead.  Should there be a balance after the co-operative societies have dealt with what they are capable of dealing with, these other fellows might take it on.  But as things stand, I do not see any room for proprietary rehandlers or any necessity for issuing licences to them.  I think the time has gone when the middleman should be allowed to step in between the producer and the manufacturer. There is no room for middlemen, and the sooner they are squelched the better.  This is the proper time to stamp them out.  I would like to hear some definite statement from the Minister with regard to rehandlers' licences.</P>

      <P>With regard to rehandling stations, I would like to see all this work done by the growers themselves through the co-operative societies.  But I think we have not got sufficient capacity in the rehandling stations which are run by co-operative societies at the moment.  It would, therefore, be necessary to license certain proprietary rehandling stations. We must consider, of course, the application of any person in the rehandling business.  There were quite a number in the business last year, and it is possible that some of those will not go on under the new conditions of strict supervision and so on, and also under a limited and specified rate per lb.  It is also quite possible that some of the existing rehandlers will be disqualified under this Bill as they are also manufacturers. The remainder will have to be considered.  It may, as a matter of fact, be necessary to license some proprietors in order to help out the co-operative rehandling stations for a year or two, say, until one more additional co-operative rehandling station would get into the business.  I would like, however, to say that those proprietary rehandlers are not to be regarded as having any inflated vested interest.  I do not think they have any great vested interest.  They have some small plant.  If we find after some time that there will be sufficient co-operative rehandling stations to deal with the whole crop, I think it would be the policy of this Government, or of any other Government in this country, to hand the business over to co-operative societies.  It would be very much like the creamery business in 1928 when the proprietary creameries had to be bought out and handed over to the co-operative creameries.  I think in this case there should be very little to buy out because there is no vested interest in it.  It will be known that this business will go to the co-operative concerns when they are formed, but at the moment we cannot confine it to the co-operative concerns.</P>

      <P>I consider that those rehandling charges are bound to act against the proprietary rehandler. The co-operative rehandler leaves the <Col N="2000" /> profits with the producers but the proprietary rehandler will, of course, make as much as he can out of it.  By allowing the work to be done by the co-operative rehandling stations the producers will be certainly assisted.  As far as the capacity of the rehandling machine is concerned, I have to say that the actual capacity of the Randalstown rehandling station in Navan is equal to a capacity of dealing with 5,000 acres.  That machine alone could cope with the total production for a number of years anyhow.  At any rate, I believe that the result will be that the co-operative rehandling stations will get most of the rehandling work and farmers will find it to their benefit to become members of these societies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another point. It is stated further down in the Bill that an official will be stationed practically permanently at the rehandling stations.  For that reason, the lesser the number of rehandling stations, the lesser need there will be for these officials and you will not have so many on the job.  In that way there will be a saving also.  I think the Minister ought to give some guarantee that the co-operative societies will at least get their full quota.  At all events, that they will get a chance of dealing with what they are capable of rehandling and if there is a balance left over let it go to the others.  I think this is the time, before the vested interests grow up, to deal with this matter.  Any private individual who had a rehandling station last year paid for his whole plant and equipment in addition to making a bit of profit.  The farmers who had the courage last year to start rehandling stations themselves and form their co-operative societies deserve consideration and support from the Minister.  I know that at one period the Munster Co-operative Society owed the bank £4,500.  That was a fairly large obligation and they cleared it off.  As Deputy Donnelly says, they made a handsome profit but if they did, it was due to their own initiative.  The abolition of the duty on tobacco last year was a chance given to the growers and it should not go to the lad with the travelling bag and an <Col N="2001" /> old Tin Lizzie who went around the country buying tobacco.  These gentlemen in some cases made £400 to £500 a day out of the pockets of the taxpayers of this country or out of the money that was supposed to go to the farming community.  Having made their profits last year, they can have no vested interests now.  I warn the Minister that next year and the year after we would like to squelch these fellows.  They will be looking out for vested interests.  If there is any balance after the portion that can be dealt with by the co-operative societies, a licence, of course, might be given to the proprietary rehandlers. But I do not think from my knowledge that even if instead of 1,000 acres, 2,000 acres were grown this year, there would be any balance left for these people. I think they are fully capable of dealing with the whole lot.  I see no room for any others.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 22 provides that the Revenue Commissioners shall consider each application made to them for a curer's licence or a rehandler's licence and may refuse such application on any of the grounds referable to such application specified in regulations made by them under this part of this Act.  And it goes on to say what the procedure in granting every licence is.  The Revenue Commissioners have a right to refuse an application, apparently, without any right of appeal. They cannot grant one.  Apparently the position is that they can recommend a person for a licence to the Minister.  They can state their case to the Minister and he can grant or refuse.  He can say &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No,&rdquo; but the licence will be actually granted back through the channels of the Revenue Commissioners again.  Would it not be more equitable if the application refused by the Revenue Commissioners as well as that granted should both be passed on to the Minister with the remarks of the Revenue Commissioners upon them?  I suggest that to the Minister for his consideration. It is provided in sub-section (3) that &ldquo;the Minister shall consider every application transmitted to him... and may at his absolute discretion recommend the Revenue Commissioners to grant or refuse any such application.&rdquo;<Col N="2003" /> That is at the absolute discretion of the Minister.  I hope politics will be ruled out.</P>

And I think that the Revenue Commissioners, having authority to grant, should not be given authority to refuse without giving the applicant a chance to put his case before the Minister.</P>

      <P>The Revenue Commissioners look at the matter from the point of view of trying to safeguard the revenue.  If they believe that the growing of tobacco by a certain man would be a danger to the revenue, they would refuse him.  They are going to issue regulations stating the reasons on which they refuse.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners may rule a person out on revenue ground.  They may say that it is dangerous for this man to grow tobacco because he did not carry out our regulations last year, and his growing this year would be a danger.  It would be pilfered and so on.  They will issue regulations from the revenue point of view.  They will also issue regulations from the agricultural standpoint.  The Minister for Defence mentioned some of those during the Second Stage of the Bill.  For instance, those who grew tobacco last year, and grew it well, would naturally obtain sanction.  The Minister for Defence spoke of experiments that had been carried out in congested districts of <Col N="2004" /> Mayo, Galway and Kerry where they have small farms and claim to be able to grow tobacco.  If these experiments were successful one would be very much inclined to extend the area to small farmers who cannot take advantage of other schemes such as the growing of wheat or beet.  These are agricultural considerations.  The curer's licence follows the grower's licence. Every curer is a grower.  There is provision where the curer is not a grower where five or six farmers might combine or persons with a glass-house which he would not be using at the particular time and who might cure for others.</P>
      <P>That would be an instance of curers who are not growers but, generally speaking, the grower will be the curer, so the grower and the curer will naturally be considered from the agricultural standpoint as soon as the Revenue Commissioners have said &ldquo;Well he is all right from our point of view.&rdquo;  Then in regard to the question of rehandling stations that has been raised here, co-operative societies might be a big consideration with the Department of Agriculture, and also the question of the location of these rehandling stations.  It must also be remembered that the officer who grades the tobacco, who has most to do with the kind of tobacco that should be grown, how it should be graded and how it should be rehandled, will be an officer appointed by the Minister for Agriculture, so that in that way the Minister for Agriculture will have a good deal to say to the rehandling stations that should be registered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I made does not cut across the reasons given by the Minister, if for revenue purposes the Revenue Commissioners refuse any of those licences.  As I suggest, the section should be amended, the Revenue Commissioners could make their case and state their reasons why in their opinion this licence should be refused, giving a summary of the reasons on an endorsement to the Minister for Agriculture.  If the Revenue Commissioners could make a good case the Minister for Agriculture could accept it.  That would theoretically <Col N="2005" /> leave full power to grant or refuse a licence to the Minister dealing with these three stages of the industry&mdash; growing, curing and handling, which belong to agriculture.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MatthewOReilly" hpid="Mr. M. O'Reilly Mr. M. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>The principal objection which the Revenue Commissioners have had to granting a licence has been that the curer or grower lived in close proximity to a factory.  The idea behind their minds in that was that the manufacturer is allowed drawback on a certain percentage of his stocks and there was a danger that the grower or curer might in one way or another be able to get stocks into the hands of the manufacturer for which he would get a drawback to which he was not legally entitled.  I do not think that, normally, the Revenue Commissioners have any objection to granting the licences.  Their only objection is where the grower has not proved himself efficient or where he has been carrying on malpractices such as I have described.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>If that case were made to the Minister by the Revenue Commissioners, he would see the force of it at once and he would simply agree to their recommendation.  My suggestion is that the Minister should be the ultimate authority in all that section of the industry which is connected with agriculture.  The dangers connected with the proximity of a grower to a factory and the possibility that stocks might come to the factory on which a rebate might be claimed, are matters which could be recommended to the Minister for Agriculture and he would see the force of them.  He could either accept or reject the recommendation. The whole point I am endeavouring to make is that in that section of the industry that is purely agricultural, the Minister for Agriculture should be the sole authority just as in the section dealing with industry, the Minister for Industry and Commerce should be the authority.</P>

    <P>(3) If whenever any order under sub-section (1) of this section is in force, any rehandler pays to any person employed at a rehandling station wages at a rate less than that applicable to such person under such order, such rehandler shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to a fine not exceeding one hundred pounds.</P>

      <P>To delete sub-section (3) and substitute the following two sub-sections:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(3) Where an order under sub-section (1) of this section is in force, a rehandler shall pay to every person employed at a rehandling station wages at not less than the rate applicable under such order to such person clear of all deductions, and if such rehandler fails to do so he shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to a fine not exceeding one hundred pounds.</P>
      <P>(4) In the immediately preceding sub-section the expression &ldquo;deductions&rdquo; includes deductions for or in respect of any matter whatsoever (other than deductions under the National Insurance Act, 1911, as amended by any subsequent enactments or deductions authorised by any Act to be made from wages in respect of contributions to any superannuation or other provident fund) and notwithstanding that they are deductions which may lawfully be made from wages under the provisions of the Truck Acts, 1831 to 1896, and where any payment being a payment authorised to be received by an employer under Section 1, Section 2 or Section 3 of the Truck Act, 1896, is made by any employed person to his employer, the employer shall, for the purposes of the foregoing sub-section, be deemed to have deducted that amount from wages.</P>

    <P>This amendment provides power to enforce an order made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce fixing the <Col N="2008" /> rates of wages to be paid to employees at rehandling stations.

      <P>In sub-section (1), line 30, to delete the words &ldquo;common prostitute&rdquo; and substitute the word &ldquo;person.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I think the section would be improved if this amendment were accepted.  As the section stands at present it is open, I think, to two grave objections.  One is that it uses a term which perhaps&mdash; I am not sure&mdash;has not any clear legal signification.  The decision, in the first instance, as to whether that term is applicable to a certain person who would be likely to be charged rests with an ordinary constable.  That, I think, is a matter of possible danger to respectable members of the community. The other point in regard to it is this: that the section gives certain protection to respectable male members of the community, to protect them from accosting, or soliciting, in the streets, but it does not give protection to respectable women members of the community who may be accosted for improper purposes by males while going about their legitimate business. I think that if the Minister were willing to accept the word &ldquo;person&rdquo; instead of the words &ldquo;common prostitute&rdquo; it would get rid of a term which may be of doubtful legal meaning and it would give protection also to respectable women from molestation by males when going about their legitimate business and when they may be exposed to such molestation.</P>

I am not prepared to accept the amendment.

      <P>I think that different considerations are involved in the case of this amendment. I do not know whether the Minister meant, when speaking a moment ago, that he is not in a position to accept any amendment that may be put up to him on this Bill.  I think, at any rate, that these amendments deserve discussion and consideration. The Minister may possibly not.

      <P>I have no objection to that phrase.  I think that a committee of that kind is in a different position from an official committee of the House.  As no advice from that committee has come before the House, Deputies are quite unaware of the decisions that it may have come to.  It <Col N="2016" /> is only by raising these points that we can find out the matters that were considered by that representative committee. I think myself&mdash;I am sure&mdash; that dangers are likely to arise from the fact that a person may be charged and convicted on the evidence of a single person in respect of an offence of this kind.  I am told by people who have given a good deal of attention to social work that it may happen, and does happen, that women going about their business at night legitimately and properly, may be accosted for some improper purpose, and that a complaint to a Guard may be met by a counter-complaint from a man that she has accosted and solicited him.  That is a very unfair position in which to put even the most competent and honourable Guard: to decide between two such people.  The fear in the minds of working women who are out late at night is that they cannot get protection from improper molestation because any complaint they may make may be met by such a counter-complaint, and that counter-complaint, if supported and the matter goes into court, may lead to the conviction of a particular woman properly seeking protection for herself.  She will really be running the danger of being charged with a very grave offence, that offence being proved on the evidence of one witness alone.  I think that for the protection of such people it is proper that this clause should be added to the section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Rowlette</NameTxt>
      <P>It is with considerable reluctance that I think it necessary to make some observations on this section, but I think that there may be considerations bearing on this section which, perhaps, may be more present to the mind of a member of my profession than to those of most of the Deputies of the House.  I think it would be a mistake if the section were accepted without any consideration of the possible consequences or of some conditions which may arise if it should become law.  I take it that the intention of the section is to prevent the use of those so-called contraceptives, when they are used in order to facilitate licentious relations between unmarried people of different sexes without some of the ordinary and natural consequences following such relations.  If one were convinced that the section would be likely to bring about the result, which I am quite sure is in the minds of those who framed it, one would not dream of offering any criticism of it, but I think there are <Col N="2018" /> certain results which are quite likely to follow if this section becomes law. In the first instance, I doubt very much if the prohibition of contraceptives is likely to act as a deterrent to the relations in regard to which it is intended that this section should act. What is more likely to happen is that those who wish to obtain such apparatus may make arrangements to obtain it by some underhand means. The trade would become illegal and may be driven underground.  Consequently it would be much less easy to control than it is at present.  Moreover, it should not be forgotten that elaborate apparatus is not necessary for such purposes as those contraceptives are sold for.  As we may learn from letters in the daily papers it is common knowledge that contraceptive apparatus is manufactured with the greatest ease from the ordinary contents of any household, so that from the point of view of effectiveness I think it extremely unlikely that this section, if enacted, will have any real effect in diminishing the use of contraceptive measures where used deliberately to cloak licentious practices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from the use of contraceptive apparatus for such purposes, one cannot overlook the fact that there are cases in which contraceptives are employed by many people for what they believe conscientiously to be quite legitimate purposes.  I am not going to consider the justification of the use of contraceptives in the manner that is frequently spoken of as birth control. I am quite aware that the general moral judgment and feeling in this country is against any such practice, and with that feeling and opinion I find myself personally in agreement, but there are instances which require some more consideration than if dealt with simply by an appeal to common feeling or common moral judgment.  The problem not infrequently arises where a respectable married woman is in ill-health. She is told that her health or her life may be endangered should she again have to undergo the trials of pregnancy and childbirth.  In such a case two alternatives are open to her. There is the alternative of abstaining <Col N="2019" /> from marital relations.  In that, there are very considerable practical difficulties in many households.  It is not necessary, I think, to define with any exactness what those difficulties may be in a constricted household, with narrow accommodation, where a wife and her husband are living on affectionate and proper terms.  There are certain dangers to herself arising out of abstention in such conditions.  It is not uncommon to find that women who have adopted this alternative suffer from grave nervous disorders as a result of the strain under which they are forced to continue.  It is common knowledge too that such abstention may lead to very grave marital unhappiness, and possibly may lead to infidelity on the part of the husband. Those are matters which cannot be lost sight of.  They are practical, everyday matters of fact.</P>
    <P>The other alternative open to a woman who is in the unfortunate position of having received a warning that if she continues her ordinary married life her health or her life may suffer; that is the adoption of contraceptive measures to prevent pregnancy occurring. That is a matter which she herself must decide by her own conscience, under such guidance as she conscientiously sees fit to seek.  One cannot overlook the fact there is a considerable number of people in this condition both in this and in other countries who do not adopt the view that the use of contraceptives in such a position is contrary to morality.  I am quite aware that the other view is generally adopted in this country.  I do not at all wish to question that those who adopt that view should be bound by their own consciences in the matter, but we must not overlook the fact that there are others who do not adopt it as a point of conscience&mdash; whose conscience is quite easy in adopting the second of the alternatives open in the case I have spoken of.  It is not possible to enforce moral principles by statute, and however strongly we may wish that this alternative were not open it is an alternative which many women put in that dilemma will choose to adopt.  It is questionable whether it <Col N="2020" /> is either feasible or just to try to enforce morality by statute.  We all agree that people should do what is right from the common point of view of the community as well as from that of the individual conscience, but it is not a practical matter to enforce a general moral standard by statute.  I am not sure what view the representative committee, to which the Minister has alluded, took of this particular section of the Bill, but I would call the Minister's attention to the fact that in this one section the Bill goes considerably further than the Report of the Select Committee which reported a couple of years ago.  That Committee, the Minister will recall, recommended that the sale of contraceptives should be controlled by similar conditions as those which control the sale of dangerous drugs.</P>
    <P>It may be a matter of considerable difficulty to adjust, but, certainly, the Committee did not recommend that their sales should be entirely prohibited, or rendered a grave offence, as is done by the Bill.  While I regret it, I thought it my duty to draw attention to some of the risks and the dangers which may arise from the enactment of this section.  I think I would not be doing my duty if I did not point out that there are certain considerations and certain conditions which may arise, which may have very grave effects on the health of respectable and virtuous married women if this section is enacted.  There are other dangers which may arise that have been pointed out in the Press with regard to the different uses of contraceptives, if and in so far as the section is effective in preventing persons who wish to use contraceptives for what I may call licentious purposes.  If in so far as the section would be effective in preventing contraceptive measures, it would be likely to lead to an increase in crimes such as criminal abortion and criminal infanticide.  If criminal abortion and criminal infanticide are increased the state of the country will be rendered worse than it is at present by this section.</P>

      <P>I hope the Minister <Col N="2022" /> will consent to take amendment No. 19 in lieu of amendments Nos. 18 and 20. I recognise that the Minister's intention in amendments Nos. 18 and 20 is practically the same as my intention in amendment No. 19, but I think he will recognise that there are other considerations, and that his amendments hardly go as far as is desirable.  Under the sub-section as it stands, if a judge or a justice decides to exclude the public from the court, he can only leave in the court such persons as are defined by the sub-section, or by the section as amended by the Minister's amendments. I suggest that that is hardly adequate.  I ask him to consider the case of a defendant who may be a lad of 17 or 18 years.  There is no limit as to what the age of a junior defendant may be who is charged with an offence under this Bill.  A young lad of 17, 18 or 19 years of age may be in the dock for a very grave offence.  Unless some such amendment as No. 19 is accepted that boy will be left without the support of a father or of any near friend. He will be in an atmosphere of complete strangers.  He is not necessarily a guilty person because he is in the dock, and he may be perfectly innocent of the charge made against him, but during the whole of the trial, which will be a very grave trial for him, he is left without the moral support of any near friend.  Not merely in the interests of common humanity, but in the interests of justice, a young fellow in that position should have the support of a father or a near friend during those very critical hours for him.  Again, he may have to give evidence in his own defence.  It is certainly desirable in the interests of justice, as well as in the interests of common humanity, that he should be in a normal state, and not be subjected to the hardship of listening to a case against him in an atmosphere which is strained, and without the moral support of anyone with whom he is familiar.  He is probably a stranger to his solicitor, and certainly to his counsel, and he is put into a very difficult position if he is to do himself justice in giving evidence after listening to a case pressed against him for several hours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2023" /> In Amendment No. 20 the Minister intends to provide that during the examination of a particular witness that witness may be accompanied by a friend.  I submit to the House that that is not sufficient, and that during the whole course of the trial the defendant should have, if a young fellow, the support of some near friend. Again, the aggrieved party in regard to whom the charge is brought should have with her, if a young person, regardless of her state of health, the support of her mother or other female relative, in whom she has confidence, and with whom she is at ease.  There is another point to which I wish to draw the Minister's attention.  Some of these cases will at least give rise to the necessity of expert evidence being given, either for the prosecution or for the defence.  As the Minister is aware, it is often necessary for an expert witness to give evidence following on the hearing of evidence given by other witnesses, and much of that evidence will be based on the opinion he formed on the facts, and on the opinion given in evidence by the other witnesses.  Unless a more liberal interpretation is given than that given by the Minister in his amendments, it would be impossible to make use of the expert evidence in the way it should be made use of in such cases.  I hope the Minister has not any hostility to my amendment.  After all, it leaves the whole matter to the person best fitted to decide, the magistrate or the judge. Everyone has confidence that they will use their discretion properly and in the interests of justice and humanity.  If a judge decides to exclude the public it remains for him to decide who will be left behind.  He could make exceptions in the cases I have mentioned, the near friends of a defendant or an aggrieved person.  He can also permit such witnesses as are necessary to remain in court.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the force of the argument put forward by the Deputy, and I may say that I am in entire sympathy with him from that point of view.  The only difficulty I have with regard to the Deputy's <Col N="2024" /> amendment is that it is always considered advisable, for the protection of the judge, when imposing limitations such as are proposed to be imposed in these particular cases, that the limitations shall be clearly defined.  That is the only objection I have with regard to Deputy Rowlette's amendment.  I am keeping in mind that perhaps some amendment might be framed which would cover all these eventualities the Deputy has in mind and I hope to introduce something in the Seanad which, I believe, will meet the Deputy's point of view.

    <P>This is designed to protect the interests of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  It is similar to the <Col N="2028" /> corresponding section in the Shannon Act of 1925.</P>

      <P>(1)  The scheduled works shall, while in the exclusive possession and control of the board, be exempt from assessment for poor rate and also from assessment for any other rate made by a local authority.</P>
      <P>(2)  In this section the expression &ldquo;local authority&rdquo; includes (in addition to the meaning given to it by the Principal Act) any body of persons having power under an Act of the Parliament of Ireland or any local or personal Act of the United Kingdom Parliament or any private Act of the Oireachtas to assess and levy a rate on land or on persons in respect of their occupation of land.</P>

      <P>Before Section 9 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>If and whenever the execution of any of the scheduled works under this Act involves the diversion, removal, or other interference with any public road or bridge the following provisions shall have effect, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  where the execution of the scheduled works involves the closing of the road or bridge to traffic the board shall construct and shall maintain while such road or bridge is so closed to traffic a temporary road or bridge in the same or some other convenient situation sufficient to carry traffic of such quantity and character as normally such road or bridge;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  the Board shall at or before the completion of the scheduled works either restore the road or <Col N="2029" /> bridge to its former condition or construct, after consultation with the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, a new permanent road or bridge in the same or some other convenient situation sufficient to carry the like amount (in quantity and character) of traffic as the original road or bridge was able to carry and not substantially less convenient in gradient and curve than such original road or bridge;</P>
    <P>(c)  where the board constructs a permanent new bridge and such bridge confers substantially greater advantages on the public of any county or urban district than the original bridge, by affording an improved means of communication or otherwise, the board shall certify the cost of such new bridge and the Minister for Local Government and Public Health shall certify what part of such cost in his opinion ought reasonably to be borne by the council of such county or urban district, and thereupon a sum equal to the part so certified of such cost shall be raised by such council as part of the expenses of the maintenance of county or urban roads (as the case may be) and shall be paid by such council to the board;</P>
    <P>(d)  if any doubt, dispute, or question shall arise as to whether the board in the construction, maintenance, or restoration of any temporary or permanent road or bridge pursuant to this section has complied with the provisions of this section, or as to whether a permanent new bridge constructed by the board confers substantially greater advantages on the public of any county or urban district than the original bridge, such doubt, dispute, or question shall be decided by the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whose decision shall be final.</P>
    <P>This is also a section similar to that in the Shannon Act of 1925.  It provides that where a public road or bridge has to be closed, because of the execution of these works, the Board shall construct a new road or new bridge in <Col N="2030" /> the same or some adjacent place.  If the new road or bridge confers substantially increased facilities on the district, the question of a contribution from the local authority arises.  It is provided that the contribution shall be paid, any dispute in that connection being determined by the Minister for Local Government as representing the local authority in the matter.</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    <P>Sections 9 to 15, inclusive, agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 16.</P>
    <P>(1)  Whenever the Minister is satisfied, on the application of the Board, that the erection of buildings or of a particular class or particular classes of buildings under or within a particular distance of any particular transmission wires involves risk of injury to the public or to such buildings or the occupiers thereof and that the removal of such transmission wires to another site would impose unreasonable expense on the Board, the Minister may, if he so thinks fit, by order (in this Act referred to as a building prohibition order) prohibit the erection of any building whatsoever or any building of a specified class or specified classes under or within a specified distance of such transmission wires.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (1), page 8, line 40, to delete the words &ldquo;impose unreasonable expense on the board&rdquo; and substitute the words &ldquo;involve unreasonable expense or substantial technical difficulty.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This, in a sense, is a verbal amendment designed to delete these words and to substitute the words set out. There might be cases in which alteration of the lines would involve technical difficulty more than a matter of expense, and it is necessary to have this safeguarding clause in.</P>

      <P>Before Section 17 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2031" /> (1)  No person shall erect or construct or begin to erect or construct any building or structure of which any part is within or projects over or will, when such building or structure is completed, be within or project over the relevant area of any transmission wire unless he has, at least two months before beginning such erection or construction, given to the board notice in writing stating his intention to erect or construct such building or structure and stating all relevant particulars of such building or structure.</P>
    <P>(2)  Every person who erects or constructs or begins to erect or construct any building or structure in contravention of this section shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to a fine not exceeding £50 together with a further fine not exceeding £1 for every day during which such building or structure or any part thereof continues to be within or to project over the relevant area of any transmission wire.</P>
    <P>(3)  In this section the expression &ldquo;relevant area of any transmission wire&rdquo; means the area with 25 yards on either side of the straight line joining the centres of the bases of any two consecutive posts, pillars, or other erections supporting such transmission wire, and the expression &ldquo;transmission wire&rdquo; means a wire or line carrying electricity above ground and forming part of the transmission system or of the distribution system.</P>
    <P>This amendment is necessary, as the Board represented that they may not be aware that a building is about to be erected in a manner which would be prohibited under the Bill.  This section requires two months' notice of the intention to build, and it also defines the danger area.</P>

    <P Just="Center">FIRST SCHEDULE.</P>

      <P>We are changing the words &ldquo;The raising of&rdquo; to the words &ldquo;Making provision for controlling&rdquo; and the reason for the amendment is that the intention is to vary the levels from time to time, by means of sluices, between 110 feet and 112 feet.  As this Schedule stands at the moment, it might be held that the only power of the board is the power of raising the level to 112 feet, and it is necessary to make it clear that they can vary the level between 110 and 112 feet.</P>
