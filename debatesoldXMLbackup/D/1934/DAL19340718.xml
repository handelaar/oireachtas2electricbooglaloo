      <P>I should like to draw the Minister's attention to the fact that I got a similar answer three months ago.  The facts are that a large number of people built houses in the belief that they were going to obtain a loan from the county council only to find that the county council were legally debarred from giving them the money.  As a result, a number of these people are threatened with writs by builders' providers. Could the Minister give an assurance that the county councils would pay the money and have the Bill made retrospective?</P>

They have been receiving unemployment benefit and are at present in receipt of unemployment assistance.  Efforts have been made and will continue to be made through the employment exchange to find work suitable to their condition for them.  Whether or not they can have preference for employment generally will depend not on me but on the attitude of prospective employers.

      <P>James Dowling, 2C Corporation Place, Foley Street, Dublin, a self-employed chimney sweep, made application for unemployment assistance on 18th April, 1934.  The application was referred to the Court of Referees by the unemployment assistance officer, under Section 20 (2) of the Act, for consideration and recommendation.  The court, after hearing the evidence of Mr. Dowling (who was present) in support of his application, recommended that the application be disallowed on the statutory grounds that the applicant failed to prove that he was genuinely seeking and was unable to obtain suitable employment.  With this recommendation the unemployment assistance officer agreed, and accordingly disallowed the application as failing to satisfy the condition imposed by Section 15 (1) (b) of the Unemployment Assistance Act, 1933.  With regard to the other inquiries made by the Deputy, my Department, in determining Mr. Dowling's applications for a qualification certificate and unemployment assistance, was aware of all the circumstances mentioned in the Deputy's question.</P>

      <P>The statistics of the Land Commission in regard to the acquisition and the division of land are kept by counties, not by districts, and a considerable amount of research and a case to case examination of files would be necessary <Col N="1607" /> before the situation in a particular district could be set out in the manner desired by the Deputy.  The Deputy may take it, however, that the Land Commission proposes to acquire land for the relief of congestion in every district in which suitable land is available.</P>
      <P>In County Clare as a whole some 28,000 acres of untenanted land are at present inspected or in course of inspection with a view to acquisition and division under the Land Acts, 1923-33.  Over 2,000 acres are in definite course of acquisition (mostly in the northern portion of the county).  In addition, some 2,000 acres of lands already acquired in County Clare are in hands for division.  That makes a total of 32,000 acres available or under consideration for division in County Clare at present.</P>
      <P>The Land Commission have already divided under the Land Acts 1923-33 a total of nearly 20,000 acres in County Clare among some 1,300 allottees.</P>

      <P>A week ago, Sir, I raised the question of the propriety of the Government's introducing 16 New Bills at this stage of the Session, and I want to repeat that objection now. It is perfectly true that the Ministry can force 16 Bills through Dáil Eireann by announcing their intention of sitting continuously until those Bills are disposed of; but it is equally true that this House, having sat continually since January practically, should not be asked to discuss and to consider 16 measures, some of which are of considerable importance and many of which are of great complexity.  If the House is forced to do it, it is only right that the country should know that those Bills will not receive the consideration to which they are entitled, because the members of the House, having devoted the length of time which they have devoted this year already to the consideration of legislation, should have a holiday before they are asked to undertake another large legislative programme.</P>

    <P>There were times when the House was ready to deal with business and the Government was not in a position to bring it forth.  We are now, as I say, asked to undertake this enormous programme.  There are two alternatives open to us.  One is to postpone some of those Bills until after the recess. The other is to give them all inadequate consideration.  I want to <Col N="1609" /> urge most strongly on the Government that they should pick out of this mass of proposed legislation such measures as they consider to be absolutely necessary and urgent and let us dispose of them and then go into recess and take up the remainder of the legislation on our return.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>As has been pointed out already, all those Bills have been considered to be necessary by the respective Departments concerned and some of them to be urgent.  The Government is prepared to give every facility to enable adequate discussion to be given to those Bills.  Certain Deputies may feel tired&mdash;it may be the exception to the rule&mdash;but there is no reason whatever, so far as the Government is concerned, for not giving adequate discussion and it certainly is not going to put any obstacle in the way of allowing adequate or the fullest possible discussion on them all before they are put into effect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That form of reply was already vouchsafed to the House by the President, and the implication contained in the proposal is that the Government are prepared to sit here till Christmas if the Opposition desire it.  That is an old trick for applying the Closure and it amounts to exactly the same thing.  I respectfully submit that commonsense suggests to everybody that the House should not be asked to consider important legislation under conditions such as those.  If we are required to sit here until those Bills go through, the net result will be that the measures will pass through this House without the consideration that they ought to have, and the Ministers know that.  They, with their automatic majority, can regulate the business and can regulate the time.  I am simply asking that arrangements should be made whereunder the Opposition could give the Government such co-operation as the Government is entitled to, and that is the careful consideration of any legislation they bring before the House. With the best will in the world we are satisfied that if this programme is adhered to, the Government cannot expect the co-operation to which they <Col N="1610" /> ought to be entitled, and that is the full and careful consideration of the measures by every Deputy in this House.</P>

      <P>I should like to join with Deputy Dillon in his remarks on this matter.  I consider that it is absolutely unfair that the Minister for Justice should pick out and select such an expression about some members of the House being tired.  It is not a matter of being tired.  It is not a matter of any individual Deputy being tired.  After all, what really matters is that the people of this House are business people and have a lot of things to do.  The majority of them are engaged in farming pursuits, and this is the busy time of the year and has generally been recognised as such.  In fairness to the people, who are courted by every political party at election times, we ought to be able to give them an opportunity of attending to their business.  In that way, if some of those Bills are left over&mdash;the Minister said that some of them are urgent&mdash;well, let the urgent ones be taken out as such and dealt with.  They could be adequately dealt with and our own business will not suffer as a result.  I think that at least the members of the House who are engaged in farming pursuits are entitled to that consideration by the Government.  They have always got that consideration.</P>

      <P>An indication was given already that the Government proposed introducing additional Bills and I think that the House understood they would see the First Readings of those Bills on the Order Paper to-day. I would ask the Minister for Justice to say what additional Bills are going to be put before the House and when he expects to be able to ask for leave to introduce them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that this is deserving of more adequate explanation by the Minister.  Deputy Brennan has pointed out that most of the members of this House have to earn their living as well as to attend this House.  A great many of the members make considerable sacrifices of their business, whether farming or otherwise, and there ought to be some show of reason for this procedure.  Most of us who live in the country have a great deal of work to do in connection with crops at the present time, and if the work is not done we will all be involved in very heavy losses.  If 16 Bills are to be adequately considered we ought to be here for at least 16 weeks from this date.  That will bring us down to October or November. Surely the Government are not going to submit that such a proposal is reasonable.</P>

      <P>Certain of those Bills, particularly those connected with the Department of Agriculture, are considered to be very urgent, but it is not the intention of the Government to take any Bill in this session which is not considered absolutely urgent. If the Minister for Agriculture were here he might be able to indicate the grounds for the urgency of certain of those measures.  I understand, however, that the Cattle Bill and the Cereals Bill and some others are urgent and I think that Deputies on the other side of the House who know something about the matter will agree as to their urgency.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it is amendment No. 4.  We can discuss both amendment No. 2 and amendment No. 4 together.  As the Bill was introduced when an order was made declaring any commodity to be a reserved commodity <Col N="1615" /> no power was conferred upon the Executive Council to limit that order in the matter of time.  It is considered desirable that in relation to any class of goods that may be declared to be a reserved commodity under that Part of the Bill that that reservation should be only for a stated period and that when the order is made the duration of the order should be indicated.  That is the purpose of amendment No. 4, which reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 13, before Section 16 (4), to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(4)  In making an order under this section the Executive Council may, if they so think fit, fix the period during which such order is to remain in force.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 2 provides in the case of any company which is engaged in the manufacture of a commodity under a licence conferred under Part III of the Bill that if the licence ceases to be operative, due to the expiration of the time for which the order was valid, the ordinary provisions of the Control of Manufactures Act will apply in relation to that company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the Minister to give an indication of the type of commodity which he has in mind.  I take it that the Minister must have some class of commodity in mind under which the persons given this licence would be deprived of the protection that the licence particularly gives them.  I would like to know what really the Minister's intentions are because there seems to be quite a number of things involved in this.  The doing away with the licence after a firm had established themselves here, is a matter that is in question.  If the intention of the Act is really effective with regard to the firm, then that would leave the firm here with the monopoly.  No other competitor would be likely to come into the market and the effect would be to leave the firm with the conditions imposed on it under the various headings in Section 2, conditions dealing with wages, work, production, etc.  On the face of it some further explanation from the Minister as to what he has in mind should be <Col N="1616" /> given.  To my mind, the meaning of limiting the licence would mean giving the particular firm a chance of developing into a monopoly and then relieving them of restrictions which it was thought necessary to impose upon them when they were given the monopoly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The order under Part III of the Bill is something different from the licence issued following the making of an order which order declares a particular commodity to be a reserved commodity.  The main effect of the order is to prohibit any person engaging in the manufacture of that commodity without a licence.  The cancellation of that order whether due to the expiration of time or to any other cause would then permit any person qualified under Part II of the Bill to engage in the manufacture of that commodity.  The company which under Part II of the Bill required a licence would still require a licence to engage in the manufacture of that commodity, but the company which would be entitled to do it without a licence could do it without a licence because the order was no longer valid.  This amendment is intended to provide that the restrictions imposed by making the order under Part III will not operate indefinitely but shall only operate for a definite period.  It is undoubtedly correct that the fact of making an order under Part III of the Bill and then conferring a licence upon a particular company or companies to manufacture the commodity would give that company or companies a monopoly and when the order ceased to be valid, due to the expiration of time, they would be established in the market and would be able to compete effectively against any newcomer.  The effect of the section is to give it to them indefinitely and that is unsatisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will find it difficult to explain that the amendment would do anything but set up a monopoly.  The licence will require them to conform to certain regulations regarding maximum price, pay, charge for production, the nature of their production, the mode of manufacture, the employment of nationals, the extent of raw materials <Col N="1617" /> used and whether produced in the Free State and quite a number of rather useful provisions like that. The Minister's proposal contemplates the possibility that, after persons had established themselves here in a monopolistic position under a licence, those restrictions would be taken off them, and that they would be perfectly free to do what they liked with regard to raw materials, minimum and maximum price, quality, mode of manufacture, packing and management?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Not quite.  The Deputy is again mixing up the order with the licence.  An external company engaging in the manufacture of any article here which had been made a reserved commodity by an order under Part III, and which had been granted a licence under Part III, if it wished to continue in the manufacture of those articles after the expiration of the order under Part III, would require a licence under Part II&mdash;a licence to which could be attached any of the conditions that may be attached to a Part II licence.  They would cover the employment of nationals, the use of Saorstát materials, and things of that kind. The conditions would not cover all the conditions that might be attached to a Part III licence, such as maximum price and so forth.  In those circumstances it would be open to any person qualified as a national of Saorstát Eireann, or any company entitled to operate without a Part II licence, to engage in the production of the same commodity in competition with the existing concerns.  At any rate the period of duration of the order will be a matter which will be brought to the Dáil for approval, and which must be approved of by the Dáil before the order can become effective, and before anybody engages in the manufacture of the commodity concerned or gets a licence under that Part of the Bill.  Full information regarding the intentions of the Government and of the Dáil as to the duration of the order will be available to everybody in advance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister will agree that the limitations <Col N="1618" /> with regard to licences which may be imposed upon a manufacturer under Part II do not apply to nationals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The position then is that in so far as nationals are concerned they may be given a particularly privileged position under Part III with the restrictions that I mentioned, and that if the period is knocked out then a national monopoly established here is completely relieved of all the restrictions that I mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>But it would not be in any sense a monopoly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>But surely if a national is in the same position as a non-national, if he gets a monopoly here he can build up his industry, or if it is a company it can build up an industry here and establish itself in such a way as to squeeze out any possible competitor.  The Minister, I am sure, does not contemplate that under Part III all the monopolies which will be established will be non-national monopolies.  He may have power under Section 2 to put in any kind of restriction he likes on a licence, although if he has that power I do not see why the details would not be specified in Part II in the same way as they are specified in Part III. Leaving non-nationals out of consideration, as regards a national of the State coming in under Part III, as the Minister expects many of them will, if the order has a limited period then the restriction he is subject to with regard to the use of native materials, the employment of non-nationals in his concern, either as workers or as managers, and all those other restrictions with regard to maximum price, quality, etc., go by the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I think criticism from the opposite angle of that taken by Deputy Mulcahy could be much more strongly used with regard to this amendment.  Is it not conceivable that a manufacturer looking over the possibilities which Part III of this Bill offers him would be rather deterred by <Col N="1619" /> the prospect that his monopoly is only to be given for a certain fixed period?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>That could be argued, too.  I will let the Deputy argue that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>The mere introduction of this almost suggests to a subsequent Dáil the possibility of reducing the period.  With regard to the principal point in Deputy Mulcahy's criticism, surely with the example of sugar before him he will see that the possibilities of holding a monopoly when the legislation that established that monopoly is no longer operative would not be very strong; that a firm having pioneered a business, having trained employees, having spread information through the country with regard to the processes of manufacture and so on would not, if its monopoly powers were removed, be at all in the strong position which General Mulcahy visualises. I should rather think that a manufacturer looking ahead would see a danger, having, perhaps, gone to great trouble and worked without any great profit for a number of years that, when his privileges were taken from him by the mere expiration of the term fixed in the order, very intense competition might arise&mdash;competition which might have the goodwill of the Government of the day.  In my opinion the objections to the amendment from the opposite angle to that which Deputy Mulcahy suggests are very much stronger indeed than the objections he has raised.

      <P>Let not this amendment pass from the attention of the House without this much being said: the whole principle underlying Part III of the Bill is rotten.  In order to get its rottenness overlooked, Section 22 was put in, with all the beautiful conditions. <Col N="1620" /> Section 22 and this amendment are simply the Prices Commission in the tariff ramp.  They are put in in order to create a sense of false security. Exactly the same thing would happen in the event of the Minister getting this amendment carried through as happened in connection with the Prices Commission.  Suppose he gets power to fix the time limit, it would be said &ldquo;Dail Eireann has the control of this question.  This matter will have to be discussed with Dáil Eireann.&rdquo;  What in fact will happen is that the Minister will come in with the order.  The Fianna Fáil Party will withdraw to the library to correspond with their constituents. When the division bell rings they will march into the Lobby and vote for any order which the Minister for Industry and Commerce stands over. Criticism of that procedure will be answered on the Minister's part by saying &ldquo;Oh, but there is a time limit fixed.  This man who is going to get a monopoly will be exposed to the full blast of competition just after he has been able to struggle to his feet.&rdquo; What will in fact happen and what must happen if the Minister wants some commodity which has to be declared a reserve commodity under Part III, is that he must get a manufacturer who is prepared to undertake the work.  The manufacturer will go into the Minister's office and say &ldquo;Well if I am to put my money and my work into that scheme I must have sufficient time to establish myself in an effective monopoly for all time.&rdquo;  The Minister will say &ldquo;We must put in some time limit.  We must put up some show of respectability when I am pushing this order through the House. How long will it take you to get a monopoly?  How long will it take you to firmly dig yourself in?&rdquo; The manufacturer will assess the period of time which will be necessary to give him a strangle hold on the market in that particular commodity in this country.  He will then put four or five years on to that and say: &ldquo;Let that be the period of the order.&rdquo;  Of course, having got the order in those terms he will operate his monopoly.  The pro tection of the reserved commodity order will fall away from him at the end of <Col N="1621" /> the period, and he will be nominally exposed to the full blast of competition. He will, in fact, be absolutely and unshakeably entrenched in a monopoly behind a prohibitive tariff barrier.  If the amendment passes as it is, it seems to me that, if Dáil Eireann makes an order declaring certain commodities to be reserved commodities, the only way to discharge that order is by another resolution of the House.</P>
      <P>We will be told that that is protection, but, of course, it is not, and it is not, for this reason, that if the Government persuades men to sink large sums of money in any enterprise and to back a large vested interest in some undertaking that the Government induced them to go into, it becomes virtually impossible to alter the arrangement without providing compensation from the Central Fund for the individual whom the responsible Government of the day led into embarking on that enterprise.  In theory, it is quite possible to remove all the protection and to say: &ldquo;You took your chance and it has not come off; the Government has changed its mind and is going to withdraw the reserved commodity order,&rdquo; but, in practice, it is virtually impossible and will never happen.</P>
      <P>When we were passing all this tariff legislation, the Minister for Industry and Commerce used to say that there would be no rise in prices.  He gave that up after about the first six months, but when he was in the first fire of his enthusiasm, he used to laugh to scorn the suggestion that tariffs involved any increase in the cost of living, and used to say to us then: &ldquo;We have secured that by setting up a Prices Commission,&rdquo; and the Labour Party were thrown into ecstasies of joy at the prospects of a Prices Commission. The poor old Prices Commission has met.  The flour millers went into them and walked around them, under them and beneath them&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the lucubrations of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and it very often takes time to unravel the twisted proposals he brings <Col N="1623" /> before the House.  You will notice that he becomes extremely uneasy when the process of unravelling proceeds.  When the Prices Commission was put into operation in order to restore the confidence of the unfortunate consumer, he came to realise at a very early stage that the protected manufacturers could make fools of the Prices Commission when they wanted to, and could, eventually, arrive at a stage when they would say to the Prices Commission: &ldquo;Now try and find out what you want to find out&mdash;try to arrive at any conclusion,&rdquo; and the Prices Commission was absolutely helpless, as they will be.</P>
      <P>I forewarned the House that the safeguards which these amendments proposed to put into the order that will be made under Part III, and the safeguards adumbrated in Section 22 for incorporation in a licence, will prove every bit as ineffective, because the total effect of Part III of this Bill is to set up monopolies in this country, which, once entrenched and well established, will walk on this Dáil and on everybody else who tries to cross their path.  We are seeing that situation develop in this country at the present time; we are seeing a situation in which the interests of the consuming public are being absolutely forgotten, and before I pass from this amendment I want to say that I commend the attention of the Minister for Industry and Commerce to a report that was recently issued in connection with the affairs of Newfoundland.  It outlines the causes for the economic collapse of Newfoundland.  It was set up on the occasion of Newfoundland inviting the British Government practically to take over the Government of that Dominion, and it pointed out that the economic collapse of Newfoundland resulted on a policy very similar to what we are pursuing in this country, and that is, that the principal industry of Newfoundland, the fishing industry, was forgotten, and allowed to sink into practical ruin.</P>

      <P>The Minister has indicated that if this amendment is opposed he will withdraw it.  I have not the slightest desire to mould this measure in any other way than that in which the Minister wants to mould it. The Minister has complained already with regard to the Control of Manufactures Act that if certain things had not been done with that Act some of the things we complain about in regard to the development of industry here would not exist to-day.  None of us believe that, and in discussing this matter <Col N="1625" /> here now I simply want to know what the thing is about.  The Minister's presentation of his amendment here shows that he really does not know what it is about, and that he does not know what the effect is likely to be on any order he may issue.  It has, perhaps, been suggested to him that these ideas of orders and licences ought not to be eternal.  I have pointed out to him certain things that may happen under a period order of this particular kind in certain directions, and Deputy Moore has pointed out the effect that there may be in other directions.</P>
      <P>If the Executive Council can make an order declaring something to be a reserved commodity and that is putting the reserved commodity resolution into active operation, I take it that they can annul that order.  The Minister takes no power over the annulment of a licence except on the application of the person who has the licence, or where a person has committed an offence.  But surely the Minister does not intend that a contract entered into with some particular firm or persons to come in and establish themselves here as a monopoly over a certain area is going to be an eternal thing?  As far as paying certain compensation on the annulment of it is concerned, that is certainly a matter very much in the future.  But I think that, if a monopoly is handed over to any particular firm, whether national or non-national, to develop an industry here which is very much protected all round, you are making a present of a certain position to that firm and whether, when that is withdrawn, another present should be issued is another thing.  I think that the Minister has not fully considered the effect of putting in such a clause as this, as far as he is concerned.  He is welcome to it if he wants it, but he has not fully considered the questions raised as to the difficulties it presents to himself in the carrying out of the measure.</P>

      <P>Not unless that is stated in the Act.  In this case they are given power to make an order which cannot become effective until approved of by the Dáil.  There is no procedure laid down for the cancellation of the order. Cancellation will require legislation&mdash; legislation which could not be introduced without a breach of faith with those to whom licences have been given, unless at the date on which the order was made it was understood by those who received the licence, and agreed to by them, that the special position conferred upon them by the making of the order and the granting of the licence was going to terminate after the expiration of the particular period.  The proposal in the amendment is to take power to fix, at the date upon which the order is made, the duration of the period for which the commodity will be a reserved commodity in respect of which the provisions of Part III of the Bill will apply.  We think it is desirable that there should be power to fix the duration of the order if it is thought fit to do so.  The amendment does not require that a date should be fixed in respect of every order.  It only gives power to fix a date on which the order will cease automatically to have effect if it is thought fit to impose that restriction.</P>
      <P>I am not pressing the amendment.  I think it is an improvement on the Bill, however, and, therefore, I introduce it. I thought also that it would meet some of the objections raised to this Part of the Bill during the Committee Stage discussion.  If there is strong objection to it I am quite prepared to withdraw it; but if the Deputies opposite are not objecting to it, then I prefer that it should be inserted in the Bill.</P>

      <P>It seems to me that in that case a manufacturer would be much more nervous in taking advantage of the Bill because of the amendment. Fifteen years is not a very long time in the life of an industry, and he might see the possibility of these maximum prices limiting very seriously his profits for several of the first years. Consequently if, after a period of 15 years, all his privileges were to be withdrawn there might not be a very great inducement to him to negotiate. I rather think that that objection is much more serious than the objection of Deputy Mulcahy.  I certainly would like to see the amendment withdrawn from that point of view.</P>

I do not contemplate that an order will be made in respect of any industry except as a necessary step in the establishment of an industry here and following discussions with the interested parties.  In that case, the question of the date of the duration of the order, the date which will be fixed for its expiration, <Col N="1628" /> would be all questions that would arise for settlement during the course of these discussions beforehand.</P>

      <P>I should like the Minister to clarify the position a little more.  The Minister's difficulty appears to be, and he is trying to meet it by this amendment, that if an order was made without having fixed the period there is no machinery for fixing the period or annulling the order.  At the same time, he tells us that the order, as a matter of fact, may or may not have a fixed period.  In case an order is issued which has not a fixed period what will happen if the Government require to terminate the order?  Is the Minister covering that case by this amendment? If an amendment is being put in to cover the cases it ought to cover them fully.  The Minister stated that there will be two classes of orders, one with a fixed period and the other without a fixed period.  I understand from his statement that his amendment covers only the orders that will be made for a fixed period.  What will happen the others?  In case the Minister, in some years time, wants to terminate an order, has he power under this?</P>

      <P>The following provisions shall have effect in relation to the making of an order under this section, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a)  before making such order the Executive Council shall publish, in the <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> and in such other manner as they think best adapted for making public their intention to make such order, a notice of such intention, and such notice shall state the commodity or commodities the subject of the proposed order, and, if the Executive Council propose -to fix a period during which such order is to remain in force, the period proposed to be so fixed, and shall also state the time (in this sub-section referred to as the time limited for making objections) within which <Col N="1630" /> any objections to the making of such order may be made, and the time limited for making objections to be so stated shall not in any case be less than 30 days after the date of the publication in the <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> of such notice;</P>
    <P>(b)  any person objecting to the making of such order may within the time limited for making objections send a statement in writing to the Executive Council of his objection and of the specific ground on which it is based;</P>
    <P>(c)  the Executive Council shall not make such order until the expiration of the time limited for making objections and until they have considered such objections (if any) to the making of such order as may have been made within the time limited for making objections.</P>
    <P>During the discussion on the Committee Stage, objection was taken to the terms of Section 16, on the ground that inadequate notice might be given of the intention to make an order, and that, consequently, members of the Dáil and interested parties throughout the country would have little opportunity of preparing their case against the order, if they had any case at all. I indicated that I was quite prepared to provide in the Bill that a fairly substantial period should elapse between the date upon which the intention of the Government became known and the order became effective.  It is proposed here that if the Executive Council intend to make an order declaring any commodity to be a reserved commodity, notice of their intention shall be published, and at the same time an indication could be given of the period, which shall not be less than 30 days, within which any persons may make any objection they wish to the making of such an order by the Executive Council.  It provides that the Executive Council shall consider all such objections and that the actual implementation of its intention shall not take place until the expiration of the time within which objection may be made and fixed on the occasion of the publication of the intention to make the order.  That will provide, not merely that every person engaged in <Col N="1631" /> any industrial or commercial occupation in the country will be able to bring before the Executive Council any objection that he may have to the making of such an order, but also before members of the Oireachtas, so that full and adequate information will be available when the question of approval of the order arises for discussion in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>The suggestion may be made that the objections received to the making of an order should be published in some way or conveyed to members of the Dáil, but it is quite obvious that there are strong arguments against that course.  Persons may not be disposed to make objections, which would have to have very serious consideration given to them, unless they were assured that their objection, or even the fact that they had made it, was not going to be made public.  There are persons who would be, for various reasons, disinclined to appear in the picture if they knew that the fact that they had made an objection and the nature of the objection would be published.  I think the procedure outlined in the amendment is the best to meet the point raised in Committee.  It provides adequate time between the notice of the intention and the actual making of the order, and it provides machinery for the making and the consideration of objections to the order.</P>

      <P>Amendments Nos. 8 and 16 are cognate to amendment No. 6, but as they introduce new matter of substance, they are out of order.  However, I shall allow the Deputy, when he moves amendment No. 6&mdash;on <Col N="1632" /> which, of course, he may challenge a division&mdash;to refer to the subject-matter of amendments Nos. 8 and 16, if he so desires.</P>

      <P>I beg to move amendment No. 6:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 13, Section 16 (4), line 28, after the word &ldquo;resolution&rdquo; to insert the following words:&mdash;&ldquo;of which one month's notice shall have been given.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>My object in inserting this amendment was that the House would have at least one month's notice that a proposition of this particular kind was coming before it.  Under the Bill as introduced the Minister could give the usual four days' notice of a proposal to pass a resolution and that resolution could be put through the House by the Government majority, making a particular commodity a reserved commodity.  Then the Executive Council would be in the position to make an agreement in respect of any commodity, and to enter into that very particular type of sacred contract that the Minister indicated; that is, a contract that would involve a resolution of this House to annul.  As some Deputies have indicated, it might involve legislation that would include compensation at the expense of the public to somebody who was supposed to be affected by the withdrawal of the licence.  The amendment that the Minister has moved gives, I submit, nothing but breathing space to the House.  It gives promise of no information, good, bad or indifferent, from the Minister to the House and I feel that, together with the Minister's amendment, amendment 6 is also required,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel a bit hampered by the short notice that amendments 8 and 16 are out of order.  I received notice to-day only at question time, and in the circumstances I would like to take advantage of the Ceann Comhairle's suggestion that I might refer to the subject-matter of them.  The Minister does not promise a scrap of information and we all have experience of the difficulty of getting information from him; even Deputy Moore has experienced that difficulty.  I want to provide machinery so that when making a proposal to this House that <Col N="1633" /> involves the House in such very serious contracts and possible consequences, certain clearly necessary information should be given.  I think the Minister would be treating the subject in a very haphazard way and would be treating the House in a very light fashion if, when asking the House to enable him to enter into such serious contracts, he refused to give the House the information under the particular headings I have detailed here in the Schedule.</P>
    <P>I think that when the Minister is going definitely to make an inquiry, whatever be the body that will make that inquiry for him, the inquiry should range over the items mentioned in the Schedule and that this House should, if a resolution is put before it, be told the total quantity and value of the commodity manufactured in Saorstát Eireann during the last year or three years and should get information with regard to the total quantity and value of the imports which it was necessary to introduce into the Free State in order to supply the market here, where there was a lack of the commodity manufactured here; that we should have some information as to the effect on the revenue of making this item a reserved commodity. I feel that we should have full information with regard to the employment given already in the making of that commodity here and with regard to the employment that it was contemplated would be given; that we should have some information as to what was involved to the distributing trade here, because there are some articles that, perhaps, a careful inquiry might disclose, are manufactured here, and if they were manufactured here and the machinery of distribution radically altered we might lose as much in employment and as much in the earning capacity of a considerable section of our population as we would gain by having some of them turned over to the manufacturing end, and that when taking into consideration the possibility that in some of those industries it might be necessary to import the greater part of the raw materials, the national result might not be of such a kind as to warrant going through the process of <Col N="1634" /> establishing the industry, through the machinery of this Bill at any rate.  I think also that the House should be given some information as to the wholesale and retail prices of the commodity in Saorstát Eireann for the last couple of years and some indication as to what the effect of the Minister's proposal, in setting up the industry here as a reserved commodity, would have on the wholesale and retail prices; and that, as well as that, we should have some information as to the extent to which non-nationals were going to be employed as workers in the industry and on the managerial side. We should also have some information as to the extent to which the raw materials for the development of the industry are available here, and, if they are not available here, where they are going to be got from, what they are, and the probable total cost of the import of raw materials every year.</P>
    <P>In putting down amendments of this particular kind, however, I was tempted to do so by reason of the spirit in which the Minister discussed Part III of the Bill here in Committee. The Minister was not so sure at all that he had, or that he knew where to go to find, the machinery that would safely guide him in carrying out the necessary examination or in coming to the desirable conclusions in cases of these particular kinds.  I did not want to suggest to the Minister any particular machinery, but I wanted to suggest to him what that particular machinery would do in a certain way and leave it open to him to use whatever machinery was best, whether the machinery of his Department, or that of the Tariff Commission, or that of any other special body he might wish to set up to examine the matter.  I think, however, that the Minister will not be treating his responsibilities properly in the matter, in view of the nature of the contracts that are going to be entered into, if he comes to this House with simply a proposal and without any detailed or systematised presentation with regard to the industry as it stands and the industry when he expects to have it developed.  He may receive objections of all kinds, but I do not <Col N="1635" /> think his approach to the matter should be guided by the type of objections he receives.  I think that, as well as hearing some of the results of his consideration of these objections, we should also hear in this House the full results of his wider and more systematic examination of his proposals.</P>
    <P>I take it, Sir, that I am not able to move amendment No. 8 or amendment No. 16.  In view of the amendment the Minister has already moved, I do not know that any useful purpose would be served in pressing No. 6, but I should like to hear from the Minister as to the general kind of information he proposes to put before the House when putting up his resolutions, and I should also like to hear whether or not he would have been glad to accept amendment No. 8 and amendment No. 16 if they had been presented to him on the Committee Stage, and if he was not in the position that the Ceann Comhairle was now ruling them out of order.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <P>I do not think I would. I fully agree with the Deputy, however, that all possible information that is available and that can be published, having regard to the effect of its publication, should be made available to the Dáil when the motion for the approval of an order is being discussed or put before us.  Such procedure, however, and making it a statutory requirement on the Minister to furnish that information in the form of a written report, are very different things, because, in relation to a number of industries, the information which the Deputy says must be made available either would not be available at all or could not be published without doing considerable damage to individual interests.  Therefore, the element of discretion must be exercisable.  I do not want to go through the various items here, but merely to give an indication of the type of difficulties I see.  As far as No. 1 is concerned, any information that the Department of Industry and Commerce has, or could have, concerning the total quantity and value of a particular class of goods, either manufactured in the Saorstát or imported into the Saorstát, <Col N="1636" /> is published.  It is published in so far as it is possible to publish it, because, in respect of manufacture, there might be some limitation under the Statistics Acts which might prevent us from disclosing information which could be identified as concerning a particular firm.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It does to a large extent. No doubt, more up-to-date information can be given in reply to a Parliamentary question than is available in the published reports, but the published reports are intended to contain all the information on that point.  As far as No. 3 is concerned, that is a matter in which information could be obtained easily in reply to a Parliamentary question.  Numbers 4 and 5 relate to the total employment given over a specified period, and the total wages paid over a specified period. Again, in so far as that information comes through official channels in the Department of Industry and Commerce and is capable of being published in a manner which is permitted under the Statistics Acts, that information is published; but if there is only one firm concerned, and if the information, when available, is identifiable with the particular firm, then we not merely officially consider it undesirable to publish the information but we are actually debarred by statute from doing so, and it is desirable that it should be so.  In so far, however, as it is possible to give that information to the Dáil, I agree that it should be given, but I do not agree that it should be a statutory obligation.  The only way to bring that about would be to proceed to amend the Acts which, under certain circumstances, debar us at the present time from publishing certain information and to amend them in such a way as to give us power to get the information and to compel the firm or firms concerned to furnish that information knowing that it was intended for publication.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as No. 6 is concerned, the information there is, undoubtedly, information that should be given to the <Col N="1637" /> Dáil in support of any motion for the approval of an order.  No. 7 comes in much the same category as Nos. 4 and 5, and No. 8 would have to be very largely an estimate.  So far as No. 9 is concerned, it is very doubtful if the information could be obtained.  I am not quite sure of the machinery that is to be employed for that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Prices Commission would take at least two weeks to make people realise that their investigation was serious.  In view of the difficulties of that kind it would take at least two weeks.  In regard to amendments Nos. 10 and 11 I must say that again it would be a case where in relation to these matters information may be made available without any difficulty whatever. In other cases, it would be obviously withheld.  I agree with regard to amendments Nos. 12 and 13 that the information should be made available. It could be put at the disposal of the House.  But, on general principles, I say that the Dáil should not agree to accept any motion of the kind contemplated in Section 16 unless it was fully satisfied on all the points or nearly all the points referred to in Deputy Mulcahy's Schedule.  In saying that, I think it would be undesirable that a statutory obligation of the kind should be placed upon the Department of Industry and Commerce to make that information available in the particular form that Deputy Mulcahy suggests.  I think the Deputy can be certain that having regard to the information available and to the machinery open to the Deputies and the actual discussion that takes place upon motions that all the information that should be made available will, in fact, be made available before the motion is approved of.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 13, Section 16 (4), line 28, to delete the words &ldquo;Dáil Eireann&rdquo; and substitute therefor the words &ldquo;both Houses of the Oireachtas.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister's proposal is that, on resolution passed here, he can go and make any contracts which seem desirable to him&mdash;contracts which involve entering into very serious undertakings, so serious that it would take legislation to break them.  I know that we have had a Bill passed through this House wiping out the Seanad.  But the Seanad is not gone yet and it may not go for some time. It may not go at all.  I think it is a most exceptional departure from precedent that a matter of this kind should be dealt with by resolution passed in the Dáil without its having to come before the Seanad at all. There is no part of our financial business transacted here that does not come to be reviewed in one way or another by the Seanad.  Money Bills are sent on to the Seanad.  It cannot hold up Money Bills but any Bill passed here can be held up by the Seanad.  If so held up it cannot become law within 18 months after its being sent to the Seanad.  I submit that the passing of a resolution of this particular kind should go to the Seanad as well.  There might be some kind of restriction on the Seanad in holding up a matter in the same way as there is restriction placed upon them in dealing with Bills sent up by the Dáil.  But to put the Dáil in the position, on its own resolution, to do what would require legislation by the two Houses of the Oireachtas is quite unprecedented.  I submit that this resolution should be submitted to both Houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In proposing that the order to be made under Part III of the Bill should become effective when approved of by the Dáil only, I had not referred to the existing situation only but also to any situation that was likely to exist here so long as the present constitution of the Oireachtas remains.  The Executive Council is elected by and is responsible to the Dáil.  It cannot function except it <Col N="1639" /> commands a majority in the Dáil. There is a constitutional requirement which makes it illegal for it to continue to act if it has lost the confidence of a majority of the Dáil.  There is no such requirement in respect of the Seanad.  It may happen at any time that the Executive Council has not got the confidence of the majority of the Seanad.  The present Executive Council has not that confidence.  It could not with any certainty propose measures in the hope that they would be passed by the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In dealing with matters of this kind it seems to me that it is the Dáil that is mainly concerned, because the particular safeguards which were erected under this Part of the Bill could to some extent be furnished in another way in what could properly be described as finance measures over which the Seanad would have no power.  It is most undesirable that objectives of this kind should be achieved otherwise than by direct legislation of this nature. I would be very slow to adopt any device of taxes or impositions designed to achieve the same end, merely because of the difficulty of securing the enactment of any Bill.  But, having regard to the fact that the Executive Council must enter into prolonged negotiations with very large and important groups or corporations, negotiations involving an expenditure by those persons of very substantial sums of money, it is obviously desirable that the Executive Council through those negotiations should be in the position of saying: &ldquo;Well, so long as we retain the confidence of the Dáil we will be able to get the approval of the agreement on the merits.&rdquo;  On the other hand, no matter what the outcome of the negotiations may be or how favourable the negotiations may be to the people of this country, there is always the possibility of their being rejected in the other House upon Party grounds or upon political considerations.  They may be rejected because the members of the Seanad may have a different outlook. It is for that reason only that this particular provision was inserted in the Bill.  It is an arguable case, and having <Col N="1640" /> regard to the needs of the country, to the present situation and to the situation that may exist until the Seanad ceases to be operative, I think it is desirable that this section should remain unaltered.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy mentioned that the Seanad has to approve of any Bill passed by the Dáil and can hold up any Bill except Money Bills.  The Seanad can hold up any Bill.  But if it rejects a motion of approval of this kind its rejection would be final, unlike a Bill which would become law in 18 months despite the Seanad. That, in itself, is another reason why the Dáil alone should be brought into consideration in this matter.  The tendency in all countries is to increase the power of the Executive to do things by regulations and orders which some years ago would only be done by legislation.</P>

      <P>I am merely saying it would be quite practicable to provide that having got from the Legislative Assembly, having got from the Parliament of the country, authority to make such orders, the Executive should be allowed to do so without further reference to Parliament.  We decided it was not sufficient merely to get the approval of the Parliament for the making of these orders by the Executive, but that in the exercise of the powers the Executive should again be subject to Parliament.  That is why the Bill is framed in the particular form in which it is framed.  It was purely practical considerations that made it appear to us incumbent that only the Dáil, and not the Dáil and Seanad, would be asked to approve of the measures of the Executive.</P>

The Minister is mildness itself to-day.  He refers to the Seanad with feeling and with tact.  Lest its feelings might be hurt, he does not even refer to the crude fact of the pending abolition of the Seanad. What is happening?  The last time the Minister was speaking about the Seanad he was thumping the desk.  He was saying if this House thought that Fianna Fáil was going to leave this country in the hands of the Jamesons and the Granards he for one was not going to do it.

I think that is a perfectly legitimate comment on the observations we have heard from the Minister, because, having had a diatribe on the subject of the Jamesons and the Granards, we discovered that the Minister himself on matters political was beholden to the Jamesons and the Granards, and that having wrapped the green flag round them here for the purpose of holding them up to public odium in Dáil Eireann he was reluctantly forced to admit that he himself, the Party and the country, had been beholden to them.</P>

      <P>It is not my intention for a single moment to question your ruling.  I am, however, prepared to submit further that the Minister's objection, that giving the Seanad an opportunity of reviewing the decisions of Dáil Eireann in the matter of those licences would in fact give the Seanad an opportunity of holding up those orders indefinitely, does not hold water, because this Statute is the instrument whereby the Seanad would get the right to examine the orders or the licences issued under this Statute, and this Statute could prescribe limitations to the Seanad's power in holding up an order made under the Bill.  There is no reason why the Bill should not prescribe that no order under this section shall come into force unless and until a resolution has been passed by Dáil Eireann approving of such order, and shall further not come into operation for so many weeks unless the order is further approved by Seanad Eireann. Again, it might be proposed that the <Col N="1644" /> order should not come into force unless and until it had been approved by Dáil Eireann and approved by Seanad Eireann, or in the event of Seanad Eireann refusing its approval that Dáil Eireann should be called upon to confirm its original motion approving the order in question.  As a matter of fact the Seanad does contain a number of men who have much of interest to contribute on subjects such as would arise under the heading of those orders.  It contains a number of men of wide experience in trade and industry in the country, as the Minister for Industry and Commerce has good reason to know.  It seems to me that these men ought to be given an opportunity of offering their views on the proposals made under this Bill, and at the same time the ultimate power of Dáil Eireann to over-ride the Seanad within a reasonable time should also be reserved.  It is obvious that if the Minister or this House came into conflict with Seanad Eireann, and had no means of resolving the conflict, the Minister could achieve a very similar purpose by the operation of the Finance Bill, and so achieve his purpose without reference to the Seanad at all.  Therefore, it would be a good thing; while giving the Seanad an opportunity of reviewing those orders it would provide also that, if Dáil Eireann finds itself in conflict with Seanad Eireann, in a comparatively short time it could over-ride the Seanad's objection and proceed with its resolution approving the order submitted by the Minister.</P>

    <P>Amendment No. 8 not moved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 9:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 13, Section 16 (6), line 39, to insert after the word &ldquo;commodity&rdquo; the words &ldquo;but shall, if such order fixes a period during which it is to remain in force, cease, from and after the expiration of such period, to be for the said purposes a reserved commodity.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is consequential on amendment No. 4.</P>
      <P>Amendment put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>The following amendment was agreed to:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(10)  In page 15, Section 22 (1), line 14, after the word &ldquo;commodity&rdquo; to insert the word &ldquo;manufacture&rdquo;.&mdash; (General Mulcahy.)</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 11:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 15, Section 22 (1), paragraph (g), line 40, to insert at the end of the paragraph the words &ldquo;and sold to any person carrying on business in Saorstát Eireann.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I think it was Deputy Moore raised on the Committee Stage the question of the conditions that may be attached to a licence under Part III of the Bill in respect of maximum price. The licence may have a condition attached prescribing the maximum price to be charged for any reserved commodity manufactured at a factory established under the licence.  It was pointed out that it was only necessary to fix the maximum price in respect of goods sold in Saorstát Eireann and, consequently, amendment No. 11 is introduced in order to provide for that limitation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the amendment is satisfactory.  First of all, if it is not intended to fix the price for the export trade, this does not entirely prevent fixing the price for the export trade.  Most likely the commodities sold for export would be sold to an exporter who would be carrying on business in Saorstát Eireann.  Therefore, the amendment does not meet the point I raise.  I simply said, when we <Col N="1647" /> were going through the Committee Stage, that I did not see why the Minister should take power to protect purchasers of a reserved commodity in foreign countries.  The amendment does not meet that point.  Further, it prevents the Minister from protecting the particular people in Saorstát Eireann whom he desires to protect. It is only going to fix the maximum price for such of the commodity as may be sold to any person carrying on business in Saorstát Eireann. Supposing the manufacturer sells direct to the consumer, as very many manufacturers do.  In that case the maximum price will not be fixed.  There has been comment about tyres in the newspapers lately.  Tyre companies send quite a lot to the consumers direct.  Take another case.  Suppose the refining of oil became a business here under this Bill.  The oil distributing companies send a great deal of their commodity direct to the consumer.  I think, from the point of view of both, that the Minister is still empowered to fix the price for the export trade and, further, that he is not taking any power, as a matter of fact, that he is depriving himself of the power of fixing the price for such of the commodity as is sold direct to the consumer.  I think from that point of view the amendment is quite defective and I cannot understand why it is drafted as it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not very enthusiastic about the amendment.  In fact, I think the Bill would be better without it.  I merely indicated a willingness to meet a point raised concerning which I had no very strong feeling one way or the other.  It is almost impossible to get a form of words which would cover the idea which the Deputy has expressed, because any sale that takes place in Saorstát Eireann may be a sale to a person who proposes to export the article purchased. You cannot designate the ultimate consumer by Act of Parliament. You can only indicate that the price to be regulated is the price at which articles are sold to persons in the Saorstát.  Even a person coming in from another country to buy an <Col N="1648" /> article here would be conducting a sale here and would be subject to any form of words such as you may design in order to regulate the conduct of sales of such commodities here.  If the Deputy thinks that the amendment is unsatisfactory I am prepared to withdraw it and try my hand again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly think that the Bill would be better without the amendment.  So long as the Minister shows that he has no intention or desire to fix the price of such of the commodity as may be exported, I am satisfied.  The further part of it is his business, not mine.  I got that opinion from him and for those who may read the debate the information will be there.  This amendment certainly would not be useful.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Does Deputy Moore suggest that it would be possible to have developments under which we will be manufacturing articles here under a reserved commodity licence which will be sold at, say, 1/4, like a pound of butter, to people at home, but will be sold to people with whom we are carrying on an economic war, say, at 9d. or 10d?</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 12:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 16, at the end of Section 22, to add a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Not later than one month after the granting of a reserved commodity manufacture licence, the Minister shall place on the table of each House of the Oireachtas a copy of such licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a most important amendment. Again, the Minister has told us that the fact of issuing licences under these orders will be to enter into such a contract with the persons to whom the licences are issued that it would require an Act of the Oireachtas to break the contract.  That being so, every detail of the licence given to the person who is being put into the position of becoming a monopolist should be made public.  The licence should be a public document, and, therefore, be placed <Col N="1649" /> where it is most available and most fully made public, at any rate to the members of the Oireachtas who have such a close connection with it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is desirable that this automatic publication of the terms of a licence should be required by statute.  I think the procedure of Parliamentary questions is sufficient to enable Deputies to get any information they may desire concerning any licence that may be granted. I see no objection to the publication of the name of the person to whom a licence is granted and to the general conditions of the licence, but it may be undesirable that all the terms of the licence should be published, as cases may arise where misunderstanding as to the significance of these terms would be created, a misunderstanding which would be obviated if the publication was made in the form of a Parliamentary reply or on some other occasion when an explanatory statement could be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I press very strongly that the Minister should accept this amendment.  The Minister is very well aware that a good deal of public discontent arose in connection with licences to import free of duty.  Far more public discontent has arisen in connection with licences to export cattle under the quota.  The Minister assured us here on one occasion in relation to the licences with which he was concerned that the full facts were laid before the public, that there was nothing to explain and everything was simply according to routine.  It occurred to me how much better it would have been if, in fact, a full schedule of all licences issued had been published.  If a full schedule had been published all along the line and an occasional question raised in respect of isolated licences appearing in that schedule, there might well have been no misunderstanding and no public discontent. I heard the explanation of the Minister for Agriculture of the apparent lack of equity in the distribution of cattle licences, and it occurred to me that if he published a schedule of licences on the lines suggested in this amendment probably it would have <Col N="1650" /> been the easiest way of resolving public anxiety as to the equity with which these licences were being distributed.</P>
      <P>Now you are going to have licences of a far graver character issued, because they are licences on which, the Minister tells us, will be founded contracts of the utmost possible solemnity, contracts so grave that he would prefer not to have power to terminate them without <i>ad hoc</i> legislation.  He is going to enter into these contracts for and on behalf of Saorstát Eireann.  Surely Saorstát Eireann ought to know the terms of the contract to which the agent of Saorstát Eireann is going to set his name.  Surely it is carrying executive responsibility far beyond even what the Minister for Industry and Commerce will claim&mdash;the suggestion that he should be entitled to enter into a contract on behalf of the State without communicating to the Parliament or the public the terms of the contract?  The Minister said it may be inconvenient, but it goes without saying that there will be no condition in any of these licences which the Minister would not be quite prepared to stand over in public.  If there were such a condition in such a licence it ought not to be there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister did not say what?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That there was any condition of the licence likely to be inserted that I would not be prepared to stand over in public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that.  I said it goes without saying that there will be no condition in the licence which the Minister will not be prepared to stand over in public.  If such a condition were there it ought not to be there and it ought to be within the power of Dáil Eireann to draw attention to it and get it deleted. Therefore, what inconvenience or objection can there be in communicating to the world at large the terms of the contract?  The Minister may say the other party to the contract might have a sense of delicacy. He had no sense of delicacy when he <Col N="1651" /> was asking to have that term inserted. Surely, if a man is going to enter into a contract out of which he expects to derive very material advantage, he ought to be prepared to stand over the terms of the contract.  If he is not prepared to stand over them he ought not to enter a contract.</P>
      <P>I feel bound to warn the Minister that if he does not accept an amendment along those lines, misunderstanding is going to arise.  There will be an air of mystery about these licences.  Rumours will start flying around as to their being good, as to the difference between one licence and another, and there will be a lot of unnecessary public anxiety created. The Minister said any information that could be got from the laying of these licences on the Table can be got by way of Parliamentary question.  That is not correct, because I often addressed questions to the Minister for Industry and Commerce and he has replied that &ldquo;it is not in the public interest to furnish the information required by the Deputy.&rdquo;  You may raise it if you like on the adjournment, but you can put no obligation on the Minister to answer it.  What this amendment sets out to do is to put a statutory obligation on the Minister to publish all information contained in the licence within a month of his granting it.  Every person who initiates negotiations with the Minister with a view to getting a licence knows what he can expect&mdash;full publicity with regard to the entire transaction&mdash;and the Minister in making the contract and in granting the licence knows that every detail will be published and that he will have to stand over it.  That is as great a security as you can get into Part III, and from every point of view it is a precaution which I submit should commend itself to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not anticipate there will, at any time, be any occasion on which it will not be, in effect, an automatic procedure that the conditions attaching to any licence will be made public shortly after the licence is granted.  The conditions which would have any bearing upon the value of <Col N="1652" /> shares in an undertaking to which a licence was issued will probably have to be made public because there would be an issue of these shares to the public in order to get the necessary capital.  It is obvious in certain cases that full publication of all the conditions of the licence may mean that information will be provided to possible competitors of the concern outside the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is possible in relation to some industries that an export trade will be established.  Do not discredit that altogether at once.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is also the possibility of the terminology of the licence being misunderstood.  I have a case in mind where certain conditions were imposed which might give rise to a complete misunderstanding by anybody who did not fully appreciate what was involved.  If the terms and conditions were published at the same time as an explanatory memorandum, the effect might be different.  I think we could devise some system by which it would be possible to enable persons to inspect the licence on payment of a fee and subject to certain safeguards, if the Deputy would consider that procedure sufficient to secure effective publication from his point of view.  Subject to that, however, I think that this automatic tabling of the licence within one month is undesirable in view of the fact that Deputies can get a considerable amount of information concerning any such industry by Parliamentary question, by examination of official reports, and so forth, and information would only be withheld where it was obvious, in the public interests, that it should be withheld.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Mind you, I may probably have to go further to meet the Minister in this than the proposal in the amendment itself, but would the Minister be prepared to say that the terms of any licence issued by him would be <Col N="1653" /> available to any member of the Oireachtas for inspection on request?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I am merely thinking of the necessity for having some safeguard which would prohibit publication&mdash;widespread publication&mdash; of a particular set of conditions where it was obvious, in the public interests, that there should not be publication. That circumstance might never arise and, in the ordinary course, it would not arise.  Usually the only conditions would be what we call the statutory requirements at the present time, such as that nationals should be employed, and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There would be no objection to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but circumstances might arise that we do not contemplate at the moment.  When I talk about the granting of information to competitors, Deputies must remember that there may be more than one licence in a particular industry.  In certain industries it may be necessary to get an order to regulate the output of individual concerns and generally to organise the industry to prevent damage being done by unorganised or uneconomic development, in which case it might be unfair to one firm to give information to its respective competitors as to the total output it is permitted to undertake in any one year <Col N="1654" /> or as to the minimum output in any one year, or such other things which may be mentioned in the licence granted to it.  I should like to have an opportunity of considering the matter further with a view to seeing whether it would be possible to devise some system of publishing ordinarily and merely withholding information when a case for it could obviously be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the Minister's only opportunity of considering the matter will be between the time the Bill leaves this House and goes to the Seanad, and in order to emphasise how absurd it is that contracts of these particular kinds should be entered into on behalf of this State with any party running an industry here without giving the Parliament the full details of what the licence is, I certainly intend to press this amendment&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <P>In page 16 to delete Section 25 (2).</P>
      <P>I put the amendment down for the purpose of extracting from the Minister the information which we have already got from him, and that is that the only way in which an order under this Bill can be withdrawn is by an Act of the Oireachtas.  I would like to hear from the Minister the position he will be in now with regard to the power to withdraw licences.  It seems to me that the Minister has power to revoke licences on the application of the owner, or, when the holder of the licence has been convicted of an offence under Part III of the Act; but under no other circumstances has he the power to revoke licences.  Is that so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so.  Licences issued can only be revoked&mdash;firstly, when the holder applies for revocation, and, secondly, where he has been convicted of an offence under Part III of the Act.  If the Deputy's amendment were carried the punishment of the cancellation of the licence because of a refusal to comply with the conditions would not be possible, and the person concerned would only be fined for that offence.  I think it is desirable that if the licensee violates the conditions of his licence the power of cancellation of the licence should be there.  The Deputy will remember that a similar power was taken in relation to the Cement Act, the original Control of Manufactures Act, the Cereals Act, and so forth.  In respect of some of these Acts the word &ldquo;serious&rdquo; was put in before &ldquo;offence.&rdquo;  But that did not make any substantial difference at all, because no Government would take the responsibility of cancelling a licence because the holder was guilty of a trifling offence.  Nor do I think that the court would convict for a trifling offence.  That is only a matter of phraseology.  There is very little difference in the section as it would stand with or without the word &ldquo;serious.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The position we are then in is that once a resolution has been passed and the order confirmed, in order to revoke that order legislation would have to be passed. In addition, if, say, three licences are issued in the case of one reserved commodity, any order to revoke one of these licences, if it were desired to do it for any other reason than that the licence-holder wished it revoked or that he had committed an offence, the position would be that it would be necessary <Col N="1657" /> to pass legislation through both Houses of the Oireachtas in order to cancel such licence.</P>

      <P>Surely the Minister will see that some provision ought to be made to ensure that through the instrumentality of this Bill we will not be depriving people of their means of livelihood. A situation might arise in which a man was manufacturing in a small way.  Supposing it were said: &ldquo;What you are doing is a mere byproduct, and is not substantial manufacture for the purposes of the Act. We want to set up one big unit to handle the whole output of this particular commodity.&rdquo;  That man ought to be entitled either to a first claim for a licence or to compensation.  I think it is unjust, and something which the House would not be entitled to do, to wipe a man out of business simply because it is expedient to do so in order to facilitate one industrial unit in carrying on the production of that particular commodity.  You have got to keep your eye on justice, particularly when you are dealing with measures of this kind.  You can overcome that by saying that he will either have first claim on the licence, or, if the Minister decides to withhold the licence and give it to somebody else, that he will have a claim for compensation for so much of his business as has been put an end to.</P>

The Minister can see that a situation might arise in which a man would be quite incapable of satisfying the court that he was substantially engaged, and at the same time could satisfy the court that he was making a revenue from it, and that he was entitled to compensation.  It is a question of justice.  I think the Minister will agree with me that if he could satisfy the court that he had been making an income out of the manufacture of that commodity, and was going to be prevented from making it, he would in justice be entitled to compensation. I am not asking the Minister to create occasions of compensation. All I am asking him to do is to provide machinery whereby that man could go to the courts, or any other independent arbitrator whom the Minister might name in the statute, and get the compensation to which he is entitled as a result of his loss.  If there is no loss there will be no compensation. If there is a loss, the Minister and I both want to see him compensated.</P>

My business is to draw the Minister's attention to the defects, and it is his business to ask his experts to remedy them.

      <P>I beg to move amendment No. 15:</P>
      <P>In page 16, at the end of Section 25, to add a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Whenever the Minister revokes a reserved commodity manufacture licence he shall within one month of this revocation place upon the Table of each House of the Oireachtas notice of such revocation indicating the reasons for such revocation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has just now explained that if, through economic or other reasons, a question arose that it was desirable to revoke a licence given to a person in respect of a reserved commodity, first of all an Act would be required to enable the licence to be revoked, and secondly, that compensation might be necessary.  Section 25 gives the Minister power at any time on his own motion to revoke a licence if the holder of such licence has been convicted of an offence under any section contained in Part III of the Act. The amendment which I think in the circumstances should be inserted is that when the Minister revokes such a licence then within one month after the <Col N="1662" /> revocation he shall place upon the Table of each House of the Oireachtas notice of such revocation, indicating the reasons for it.  The revocation of such a licence is a very serious matter, and I think the Oireachtas should be informed of the revocation and of the reasons for it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think much would be gained by the adoption of this amendment.  There are only two reasons for which a licence can be revoked.  One is that an applicant decides to go out of business and to apply for a revocation and the other, that he has been convicted already in a court of an offence under the Act. The only information that could be given would be that the licence had been revoked, either because the applicant applied for its revocation or because he had been convicted of an offence.  That is all the information that would be available and it is information which, I think, would be public knowledge in any case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister must see how foolish that is, because there might arise a situation in which it would be eminently desirable, if you accept the principle of this Bill at all, that it should operate.  Some fellow who could prove he was making 15/- a week, or, may be, 10/- a week, in some little back room, by the manufacture <Col N="1663" /> of one little commodity, could hold up a whole big scheme, whereas, if the Minister had power to wipe him out and give him compensation, £50 would give him all he was entitled to.  That is the sensible thing to do if you believe in the principle of this Bill at all. There is no objection to putting a man out of business if you are prepared to compensate him, and no rational Executive Council would put an enterprising man out of industry if they were satisfied that he had made a success of it without any protection.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be read a Second Time.&rdquo;  This is a Bill to make provision for the execution of certain works by the Electricity Supply Board for the purpose of improving the storage of water in connection with the Shannon hydro-electric works and in certain other matters, to amend and extend the provisions of existing legislation. The works which it is proposed to undertake under the terms of this Bill are set out in the First Schedule thereto&mdash;the raising of the level of the water in Lough Derg from 110 to 112 feet O.D. and for that purpose to do certain things; the lowering of the level of Lough Ree to a minimum of 121 and making provision for controlling the level of the water in Lough Allen and for that purpose to do certain things; and the altering or removing and reconstructing divers quays, harbours, landing stages, boathouses, roads, bridges and other existing works.  The first question that arises in relation to this measure is the necessity for providing this additional storage.  At the present time, the Board are obliged to develop a considerable amount of energy at its fuel stations.  Last year they developed approximately 82,000,000 units at such stations.  That number of units represented about 1,600,000 cubic metres of water.  That is the quantity of water that would have been utilised in the generation of a similar number of units at the hydro-electric works, and that water would have been utilised if it had been available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1665" /> The proposals for storage covered by the Bill before the Dáil will give, approximately, 260,000,000 cubic metres of water during the year and thereby reduce the amount of energy which it will be necessary to develop by steam. The present storage capacity of the Board's works is approximately 210,000,000 cubic metres.  The execution of the additional works will increase that to 470,000,000 cubic metres and the experts contemplated storage up to 827,000,000 cubic metres at the full development of the scheme.  It is proposed to enable the Board to carry out these works by making certain advances to it.  The provisions of the Bill in that respect are, in the main, similar to the provisions of certain other Electricity Supply Acts that came before the Oireachtas.  Some comment appears to have arisen from the fact that in this case the whole of the amount required by the Board is not taking the form of repayable advances, but some portion of it is being provided in the way of grants.  Some misunderstanding appears to have been created on that account.  The difference between the amount to be advanced to the Board and the total cost of the works, as estimated, is being provided for by way of grants, but the amount to be advanced represents the present economic value of these works to the Board.  By the present economic value I mean the value of the additional storage to the Board, taking into account what it would cost annually to generate by steam the energy which could be produced at Ardnacrusha by additional water which will be made available in consequence of the execution of these works.</P>
    <P>In arriving at that estimate of the present economic value of the works, however, the material item in the basis of calculation is that of interest.  The Board have made their estimates upon the basis of the existing interest charge of 5½ per cent.  At the present time discussions are proceeding between the representatives of the Board and representatives of the Department of Finance as to the rate of interest which will be charged upon future advances and it is, I think, to be anticipated that a lower rate than 5½ per <Col N="1666" /> cent. will operate.  It is clear that, as the rate of interest reduces the present economic value of the works to the Board increases.  It is not improbable that a rate of interest will be agreed upon which will in fact bring the actual cost and the present economic value of the works into relation, so that no grant will fall to be made.  It is very desirable, however, that provision for advances should be made because it might be difficult for the Minister for Finance to give an undertaking over a period of years as to the rate of interest which would be charged. Deputies will note that the wording of the section provides for the making of grants to an amount not exceeding the £93,000 therein mentioned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The estimated cost is the sum of the two figures mentioned in the Bill.  I shall deal with them a little more fully now.  The giving to the Electricity Supply Board power to construct these works and to the Minister for Finance power to make these advances and grants is, of course, the main purpose of the Bill. There are certain other matters with which the Bill deals that I shall explain; but these are the main purposes of it and the reason for its introduction at this stage.  We are desirous that these works should be undertaken as early as possible, not merely because of the need for them but also because of the fact that they will involve a considerable amount of employment in the areas concerned. In fact, the justification for undertaking these works at present, and under circumstances which may make it necessary to supplement the economic value by grants, is the fact that the amount of employment which will be afforded in consequence of the expenditure of that money will be very considerable and bear a very satisfactory relationship to the total amount of the grant compared with other schemes that could be financed out of unemployment relief funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sections 4 and 8 are the sections <Col N="1667" /> which authorise the Board to construct the works described in the first schedule and to acquire compulsorily or interfere with lands, premises and other rights mentioned in sub-section (1) of Section 5, subject in all cases to the payment of compensation for such acquisition or such interference.  The provisions relating to compensation are similar to those in the Shannon Electricity Act, 1925, which authorised the Minister for Industry and Commerce to construct the Shannon works. It will be observed that Section 5 (1) (<i>e</i>) and Section 7 correspond with the addition to the Shannon Act of 1925 made respectively by the Amendment Act of 1933, and by Section 3 of the Amendment Act, 1930.  It was not until the Act of 1933 was passed that compensation became payable for the mere flooding of lands.  It will also be observed that Section 5 (3) enables the acquisition of lands in lieu of payment of compensation, which appears to be a useful addition to the Shannon Act.  Under Section 6 (2) the amount of compensation will be determined by arbitrators selected in the usual way from the general panel appointed by the Reference Committee. That is a simpler procedure than that under the Shannon Act in which case the arbitrators had to be specially appointed for that Act by the Reference Committee.  From certain discussions which have proceeded it appears that it may be necessary in some respects to provide for amendments of the Bill in Committee; but it is not necessary to detail these to the House now, as they are of no special importance in relation to its general principle.</P>
    <P>The cost of the works which Deputy Dillon inquired about, is as follows:&mdash; For Lough Allen the total estimated cost is £150,000, of which £107,000 is regarded as the economic value, involving a grant of £43,000.  For Lough Derg the total cost is £452,000 of which £402,000 is regarded as the economic value, involving a grant of £50,000. For Lough Ree the works proposed will cost £10,000 and £4,000 respectively, all of which is regarded as economic.  It is desirable that the position in respect of the difference <Col N="1668" /> between the advances to be made to the board and the grants to be made to the board for the purposes of these works should be clearly understood, so that no question will arise that we are in any form subsidising the Electricity Supply Board at the present stage. It is considered desirable, on the ground of national policy, that the water storage on the Shannon should be developed so as to reduce the quantity of electricity to be generated by steam.  The board is in a position to provide the energy by steam at the present time at a certain cost, and that gives a basis for calculating what we call the economic value of the works to be undertaken.  Anything that the provision of water storage may involve over and above that cost is being made good by a grant, on the ground that the very large additional employment to be involved has for this country a value far in excess of the amount to be granted&mdash;a value in employment far greater than any other works which might possibly be financed from unemployment funds.</P>
    <P>It is further to be noted that the difference between the cost of providing for that increased water storage and the economic value of the work to the board is entirely a matter of the rate of interest to be charged upon the advances and, assuming the reduction of the rate of interest to an extent which might reasonably be anticipated, no grant will arise to be made at all, as the full cost of the works will be economically justifiable.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill introduces amendments to the 1927 Act in various respects.  The object of Section 14 is to enable the Board to get earlier occupation of land or premises, in particular for transformer stations, than is possible at the moment.  Under Section 45 of the 1927 Act the Board is enabled to go into occupation as soon as it has made the special order authorising the compulsory acquisition of the land or premises without waiting for the payment of the compensation, but in the meantime the Board shall pay to the occupier or owner interest on the amount of such price or compensation at the rate of 4 per cent.  Under Section 13 of the Electricity (Amendment) <Col N="1669" /> Act of 1930 the Board is required to pay compensation to certain employees in generating stations who have ceased to be employed in consequence of the acquisition of the stations by the Board.  Such compensation depends on the period of such employment.  Paragraph 8 of the First Schedule of the 1927 Act enables such employees to reckon temporary absence on military service as part of the period of employment, and the object of Section 15 is to extend such service in the manner already provided in various other Acts.</P>
    <P>Section 16 makes provision to prohibit buildings in close proximity to the Board's transmission lines.  It is considered undesirable that buildings should be erected close to the Board's transmission lines, and, therefore, power is taken by the Minister to enable him on the application of the Board to make an order prohibiting such buildings in any place specified in the order.  It may be necessary to amend that section on the Committee Stage to provide for the giving of notice to the Board of the intention to erect buildings within a specified distance of the wires.  As the section stands, the Board may not be aware that a building is about to be erected. An order made under the section shall not operate to prevent the completion of a building commenced before the date of the order.</P>
    <P>Section 17 empowers the Board to pay the wages, etc., which the local authority might have paid under the Act of 1933 to certain employees entitled to payment under that Act. These local authorities declined to make this payment on the ground that where the employees were engaged on electrical undertakings afterwards acquired by the Board the assets represented by such undertakings should bear such payments.  Certain persons were, therefore, debarred from receiving the payments to which the Act entitled them, and Section 17 is designed to rectify that position.</P>
    <P>I do not know that there is any other matter upon which the Dáil might desire information at this stage, but, if so, I shall endeavour to supply it. The main purpose of the Bill is to authorise the construction of the works <Col N="1670" /> set out in the First Schedule and the financing of these works, and the other sections are really being brought forward because the introduction of this Bill afforded an opportunity of effecting a number of amendments in the other Acts which were noted from time to time and deemed to be desirable.</P>

      <P>I understood the Minister to say in reply to Deputy Dillon that the sum to be expended or estimated as proper for expenditure was the addition of sums set out in two sections; that is, Section 9 (2) and Section 13 (2).  The £530,000 plus £93,000 totals £623,000.  The sums that have been given do not amount to that but they are very near it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few points to which I would like to refer.  The first matter in which the House will probably be interested has relation to beet sugar.  Perhaps Deputies will cast their minds back to the Bill introduced here to authorise the Government to erect beet sugar factories.  When that Bill came in the House bethought itself of the only reference the Minister for Finance had ever made to the financial records of Cumann na nGaedheal.  He said that Cumann na nGaedheal had bequeathed to the existing Administration two white elephants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1671" />
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Were there three?  I remember only two.  One was the Carlow Beet Sugar Factory.  The Minister then tied an apron around his middle, the forceps disappeared in the lying-in process and emerged, to the horror of everybody, with three offspring. Now, the second white elephant is being led out for a grooming. Having acted as midwife to the first, the Minister is going to act as coiffeur to the second and he provides the second with a new trunk and a pair of tusks at a cost of approximately £750,000.  That is what it will come to before the job is done.  This is something that Deputy Dowdall, who differentiates so carefully between promises and realities, should take a note of.  So far as the Bill is concerned, I would like to ask the Minister, in connection with the grants that are going to be made, where is the money to come from?  Are we going to have a supplementary estimate or is the money going to come out of the sum voted for the relief of unemployment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Wherever extension is required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that is a very sensible way in which to spend money for the relief of unemployment.  I understand the scheme will be to discover how much in excess of what is called the economic figure these works are going to cost and to make a contribution of the difference.  In fact the Unemployment Fund will be used to provide free labour in the extension of this scheme.  I think that is a good plan.  I think I made a suggestion here once that where there was a proposal to extend the Shannon Scheme and it was found uneconomic to do so, the Board of Works, who were administering the Unemployment Fund at the time, should make their offer.  Possibly the seed I planted in the mind of Deputy Hugo Flinn on that occasion is flowering now under the benignant influence of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Section 14 there is an amendment of Section 45 of the Principal Act, and now the Board can go into possession of the lands without waiting for the decision of the Arbitration Board as to <Col N="1672" /> value.  Will the Minister say whether provision was made under the Principal Act for building value in land compulsorily acquired by the Electricity Supply Board?  I believe, in fact, you could plead special building value and have that taken into consideration by the arbitrator.  If that be so the objection to the immediate cession of title is largely removed.</P>
    <P>Section 16 introduces a most astonishing provision, because under that section the Electricity Supply Board can prohibit the erection of buildings within a given distance of their transmission lines.  The Minister, surely, has overlooked the fact that the line of the Electricity Supply Board is spread far over the country and passes over the land of many people whose only compensation was 10/- a pole.  I think that the amount of compensation they were entitled to was 10/- a pole. In any case, we will say that it worked out in round figures at about that amount.  Perhaps that was equitable, and perhaps it was not, but whatever it may have been for the space occupied by a pole, it is certainly nothing like adequate compensation if it is now to involve a prohibition of building in the vicinity of the line.</P>
    <P>Once you have entered into a contract of compensation with the proprietor of property there seems to be no kind of equity in altering the terms upon which you acquired the land or upon which you acquired the right of way over the land, or the easement over the land, long after the easement has been granted.  The Minister waxed eloquent to-day, on a Bill which we were discussing at an earlier stage, about the sacredness of contracts, and how he could not dream of breaking a contract with a monopolist without providing compensation; but under Section 16 he intends to break a contract with every farmer in the country.  Of course, I do not expect a farmer to receive the same consideration at the hands of the Minister for Industry and Commerce as a monopolist would receive.  There is something peculiarly sacred about a monopolist so far as the Minister is concerned, and the poor farmer, marching down the hill to bankruptcy, <Col N="1673" /> is not going to pull as much weight. Still, I think that he is entitled to some consideration&mdash;that he is entitled to bare justice.  You took by statute the right to acquire an easement, for a given compensation, under the Principal Act.  You are now proposing, under this amending Bill, to alter the terms of the easement which you originally took without providing any additional compensation.  That is not justice.  I submit to the Minister that wherever the Electricity Supply Board makes an order under Section 16 the question of compensation will arise and allowance must be made to the proprietor of the land for the injury done to its value by prohibiting the erection of buildings upon it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy mean by that that everybody in the country, over whose land the transmission wires pass at the present time, should get compensation in respect of the prospective building value of that land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but I say&mdash;yes, I do, because for a moment I thought&mdash;well, wait a moment! Let us get the meaning of the section first.  Does it not mean that the board is allowed to prohibit the erection of any building, whatsoever, or any building of a specified class or classes under or within a specified distance of the transmission wires?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is empowered to apply to the Minister for orders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>So that my suggestion would not automatically apply to every field over which the line passed, but to every field where the Minister made an order on account of the proximity of the line.  If the Minister will consider it, he will realise that he is bound to do it.  Otherwise, it amounts to confiscation. Of course, if a man has a field in a remote part of the country and chooses to go to arbitration to get an assessment made of the building value, he will spend more in legal costs than he will get from the arbitrator, and it would be quite legitimate to give him a fixed time wherein to initiate proceedings&mdash;three months or  months&mdash;and if proceedings were not initiated within that time, then his <Col N="1674" /> right to claim compensation would lapse.  I think, however, that if the Minister considers that for a while, he will realise that there is an absolute obligation in justice to provide that.</P>
      <P>Section 17, sub-section (2), paragraph (b) says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Every doubt, question, or dispute which shall arise in the carrying of this section into effect shall be determined by the Minister, whose determination thereof shall be final.</P>
      <P>I strongly object to putting the courts of the country aside in that way.  Here is a matter about which there is going to be no fuss or hurry.  There is no question of any important enterprise being held up by prolonged litigation. It is only a question of fixing liability for certain payments on the local authority or the Board.  It is a question which is pre-eminently suitable for submission to a court of law.  It is the very kind of question for which the courts of law exist.  It is a conflict between a local authority and an enterprise of the character of the Electricity Supply Board to fix liability, and I object very strongly to that function being withdrawn from the courts and put into the hands of the Minister.</P>
      <P>I remember that, in a previous Bill, a similar clause was inserted and it has not worked out satisfactorily, for a variety of reasons.  I am not going into that to-day, but it did not work altogether satisfactorily.  This is going to put additional work on the Minister's shoulders, and no useful purpose is going to be served, because whatever verdict he presents is not going to satisfy people, whereas if the matter is allowed to go to the courts, and the courts decide the meaning of the statute which is in dispute between these two bodies, both sides will be quite content.  It is a bad principle, and one which ought not to be adopted wherever it can be avoided.  In my opinion, it can always be avoided if the Government wants to avoid it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the general question of developing the electricity supply of this country, there was a time when I took the view that the public money might have been spent to a greater advantage.  Everything <Col N="1675" /> in this world is comparative and I remember that I used to think that to spend £7,000,000&mdash;the figure was somewhat less&mdash;on developing the Shannon scheme was a wild extravagance; but, by the Lord Harry, after I had seen a couple of Fianna Fáil Budgets, £7,000,000 is to Fianna Fáil what seven million farthings was to Cumann na nGaedheal.  There is a saying in the country to the effect that it is like putting it into a child's hand. They have no more regard for £7,000,000 or £10,000,000, or £2,000,000 for the matter of that, than the veriest child has for a half-penny toy.  At least there is this much about this expenditure, that we will have something for it, unlike a lot more that has been spent.  If it is not spent on this, it will be spent up and down the country blandishing the voters of recalcitrant constituencies and we will have nothing to show for it.  Here, at least, we will have so many more units of electricity available which will be sold by the Electricity Supply Board to the consumers of the country at a very stiff price.  I think that, in that connection, the Minister might have given us some exposition to-day of the charges which the Electricity Supply Board are making for power and light throughout the country with a view to justifying the expenditure of £750,000 to increase the amount of electricity they have.  My experience is that in the town where I lived we had a local undertaking which was under the control of the county council, the board of health and the local committee.</P>
    <P>We were able to make £800,000 a year on the sale of electricity at 6d. a unit for light and 3d. a unit for power. The Electricity Supply Board has arrived now and they are going to charge 7½d. per unit.  Incidentally they inform us that wiring of the houses of a good many of us is not suitable for the Shannon current.  They are demanding that we should have the work redone for a very substantial figure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>For a very reasonable figure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not saying that it is unreasonable.  I am not going to be told that I am playing England's game or sabotaging Ireland's industries.  I have just said that it is a substantial figure.  I have no doubt the work will be well done.  Everything they do is well done.  I think the Minister should discourse to us on the relative charges of the Electricity Supply Board and such independent suppliers as are in the country.  I do not pretend to be able to discuss the technicalities of the Bill.  There is only one man who is competent to discuss the technicalities of the Bill&mdash;possibly there is in addition the Minister who may have learned in the course of the last few years something about the highly technical questions which arise with the Electricity Supply Board.  It is one of the consequences of running undertakings of this kind&mdash;even partially&mdash;by the State.  When the Minister comes to reply, I hope he will find time to deal with the questions I have raised and not least of all to tell us what he thinks of Mr. MacEntee in his new role of coiffeur, having shown himself so apt a midwife in a particular service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>There is just one point on which I would like to get elucidation from the Minister in connection with this Bill.  The Electricity Supply Board has been entrusted with large and wide powers to make it possible to get a development for the extension of electricity from water power at Ardnacrusha, and it should make compensation for all the interests that are disturbed.  Judging from the previous Act&mdash;and this Bill appears to be a facsimile of that Act so far as the compensation clauses are concerned&mdash; there is just one interest which did not get compensation.  The canal company had an amendment introduced into the Seanad in the previous Act that compensation should be paid in respect of their transport services on the Shannon.  Through the development works of the Shannon hydraulic scheme a number of men were put out of employment on the Shannon and they got no compensation.  I know some of those men.  They had worked there for years and a number of them between Killaloe and Limerick <Col N="1677" /> were put out of employment, and during the two years they were out of employment while the works were under construction they never received a penny from anybody.</P>
      <P>It is lop-sided justice to provide compensation for the canal company but to leave out the men who are part and parcel of the company.  These men have been thrown out of their employment without any compensation whatsoever.  I can see the possibility of increasing the water storage for the purpose of getting an increased supply of electricity.  It is possible because of this to have interference with the navigation and it is possible that that interference may be productive of throwing a good number of people out of employment in that district. I want an assurance that in any compensation that may be given, the interests of the men will be included, that is the interests of the men who may lose their employment because of this development in the Shannon scheme.</P>
      <P>I notice in Section 16 that there is an extension being made in this matter.  It was a rather cruel irony that one of the men for whom I speak when applying for compensation for his loss through being disemployed was asked for his national record. He was simply an ordinary worker and he got no compensation whatever. I suggest that the men who are going to lose their employment because of the incidence of this development should be compensated.  Of the total staff of 500 about 23 to 25 of the permanent staff will lose their employment. If compensation is to be given to any of the interests concerned it should not be impossible to determine that those men should be entitled to compensation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I notice that the compensation is based on the Acquisition of Land (Compensation) Act, 1919.  That does not seem capable of any thought being given to the point to which I am referring. I do not see how on the basis of the Acquisition of Land (Compensation) Act, 1919, these men can secure compensation.  I would ask the Minister to give this matter his consideration and to give us an assurance that <Col N="1678" /> any of those employees who lose their employment will not be treated as they were treated under the previous Act, but that they will get the compensation to which they are entitled.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are only about three points which arise for discussion at this stage of this measure. One of them is an involved matter.  It can be made simple but that has not been done.  We are told that there is about £616,000 to be spent under this Bill, that is, one big item for £450,000; another £150,000 on Lough Allen, and the third, £14,000, on Lough Ree.  Of this £616,000 something like £530,000 represents what is called the economic value of the works.  How that has been arrived at I have not been told.  One phrase used by the Minister set me astray, I hope for a bit only, because there was some relation to what is called the present units generated in the fuel stations.  I am assuming that there are so many units produced in the fuel stations that it is desirable to keep them in order.  It does not arise from any comparison with the steam-generated units, but probably it arises in this way: that on the price which the Board are at present charging for units sold, or that they would get in so much money from so many units, that therefore they could spend so much money on generating those units.  If there were £450,000 and £150,000, independent of present prices which the Board are charging, they could only recoup themselves of a certain amount of the expenditure of this money if they continued to charge the same prices.  I assume that that is the way in which the calculation of the economic value has been arrived at.  That leads us to the second point as to the interest rates.  The interest rate has always been equitably associated with the interest rates which the State has to pay for the money it has borrowed. When loans were procurable at 5 per cent and 5½ per cent., when the E.S.B. got advances from those loans they got them at a very small additional expenditure, an expenditure which was a fraction relatively per cent.  Sometimes it was 2/6 per £100, and that was suggested as an equitable charge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1679" /> The Minister now says that it is difficult for a Minister for Finance to estimate over a period of years what is the interest to be charged.  Where is the difficulty?  If this £500,000, or whatever portion of this £616,000 has to come out of borrowed moneys, has been borrowed at a particular rate, surely it is quite easy to estimate as far as that amount of the money is concerned what is the proper rate to charge the Electricity Supply Board, because the repayment date and the interest and the sinking fund all correspond to the repayment date, the interest and the sinking fund of the moneys that have been borrowed from the people.  It may be difficult to estimate a sum over the whole borrowing or the whole of the money lent to the board, because some of that will have been borrowed at one rate and will be subject to certain charges, while some more of it will be subject to something different, but, as far as this sum of between £500,000 and £750,000 is concerned, it is surely one of the easiest matters in the world to say: &ldquo;That cost so much.  It has to be repaid in such and such a time. Interest is being charged at such and such a rate, and sinking fund is being paid on such an amount.  We will charge that to the board, plus whatever is the agreed&mdash;or it would seem to be the disagreed&mdash;sum for the proper promotion expenses.&rdquo;  It is surely simple enough to get that amount.  It is not a matter of extreme difficulty to get it. After it is got, as money is cheaper to-day, it means that that £500,000 can be lent to the board at a cheaper rate than any of the previous moneys. Consequently, this ought to be a very easily perfected job.  That is one side of it&mdash;the amount to be charged to the board, which has to bear some relationship to the amount which the State has to pay to the people who lent the money.</P>
    <P>The other side of it is the prices charged.  Deputy Dillon has referred to that.  It was very often referred to before.  The Minister was strangely silent about that side of the matter to-day.  Has there not to be some consideration given&mdash;it was always <Col N="1680" /> promised&mdash;to the question of re-adjusting electricity charges to the new conditions?  The old scheme was put up on a most conservative basis.  The charges were supposed to be sufficient to bring in a certain revenue.  That revenue was estimated as being the correct amount to meet certain expenses&mdash;to meet certain commitments viewed as reasonable ones. What did they include?  They included this, that if we take, say, 35, 40 or 50 years as the period during which the Shannon scheme has its life, at the end of that 30, 40 or 50 years the Shannon scheme would have been completely freed from debt, and there would have been a reserve fund piled up equal to the building of a new Shannon scheme. In other words, the original scheme contemplated doing what no other business ever contemplated doing&mdash; meeting replacements and running repairs, and piling up a reserve equal to the original cost of paying off the entire debt.  I was often asked to remit some of the charges, because it was thought possible by some people&mdash; probable and certain by others&mdash;that some of those charges, which were being put upon the board, and through them upon the people, were not fair to the people of this generation.  Why should the people of this generation pay in their electricity charges the debts which their credit had allowed the board to accumulate, and at the same time give them a reserve fund of relatively a very big amount indeed.  I found myself justified on previous charges in holding fast to the old scheme, because in those days it could not easily be foreseen what emergency charges might suddenly arise.</P>
    <P>Right at the end of my period I was faced with a demand of a most excessive type from the contractors of the scheme&mdash;over £1,000,000, being moneys which they said they had lost in the building of the scheme.  Just before I left I got that claim settled for £150,000.  The Minister has no charges of that kind to meet.  There are none of those sudden emergencies that might arise against him.  In those circumstances, when we are now considering what is the economic value of certain works, is this not the proper <Col N="1681" /> time to have full consideration given to the whole scheme?  After all, it was always stated that it was a bad thing to begin to readjust the Shannon finances until the revenue side of their account had assumed something like normal figures, and until we got into an ordinary year, until a period where certain things that arose in the early promotion years had been met and discharged.  One development scheme has now been completed.  In fact, there has been an encroachment upon a second development scheme.  This is getting very near to the second of the three stages that were at one time thought of, and it is probable that, being the second of those three stages, it is the last stage of the Shannon development proper.  That being so&mdash;if it is so&mdash;is not this the time at which there should be consideration given to whether or not it is fair to present-day consumers of electricity to ask them to pay such sums in their two monthly accounts as will pay off the debt in whatever is the time for repayment, and will at the same time allow a big reserve fund to be piled up?  I may be told, in answer to that, that this is not the situation yet.  I am not saying that it is the situation actually arrived at, but is it not a situation that can quite easily be foreseen, and towards which we are likely to make progress even within 12 months; in other words, the first repayment by way of sinking fund will have been made?  At any rate the charges have now become known to the people.  It is known what the number of consumers per annum is over five or six years past, and it is easy to calculate what is the increase each year over the previous year.  It could easily enough be calculated as to whether, considering the areas that have still to be developed, there is any likelihood at all of having reached the saturation point in the development of electricity, through the attraction of new consumers to the use of this medium of heat and light.</P>
    <P>If there was any such view taken of the scheme at the moment, and if there was any such decision arrived at, as I think is at any rate possible&mdash; it would require detailed knowledge <Col N="1682" /> of how revenue is running at the moment to say whether it is probable &mdash;the nearer one approaches that examination or that problem the more will those works become economic, because if this £500,000 worth of works is thrown in against the whole of the Shannon works built to-day, and the whole of the moneys to be recouped, it is a very small portion indeed of the amount the consumers are paying; the moneys which in the end will go to provide not merely interest but sinking fund.  The question as to what is the economic value of those works, on which the Minister's whole speech and this Bill seem to turn, is somewhat vague at the moment; it is badly defined.  I should imagine that it is not merely probable but an absolute certainty that no part of this money which is described as granted money will, in fact, ever be made as such; in other words, if and when the interest rates for this £500,000 or £750,000 are struck at what is the appropriate figure, bearing in mind the rate at which money can be borrowed to-day, the whole of this £500,000 job will become economic.  If, then, there is a better consideration given to the other matter it is quite probable that not merely would that be regarded as economic but that the charges for electricity arriving at the expenditure of this amount of money as well as the charges now being met out of the expenditure of the previous sums could all be lowered, and lowered advantageously.  The other side of this point is that if there is any proposal to charge the Electricity Supply Board, and through them the consumers throughout the country, anything more than what it costs the State to borrow at the moment, the State are, in fact, making a profit out of lending borrowed moneys to the Electricity Supply Board.  I am presuming that the figure, whenever it is fixed finally, will bear a relationship to the price at which they have been able to borrow, plus some sum, whatever it may be, for the expenditure necessary to collect that loan and the administration of the loans as between the State and the Electricity Supply Board.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1683" /> The second point that arises is the development itself.  The Minister said that the board's final scheme of the Shannon in its last development looked forward to the harnessing of 800,000,000 cubic metres of water and I think he said that when this storage is effected it will put the board in possession of about half that, or 400,000,000 cubic metres.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Somewhat more than half.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>At any rate, it is certainly somewhat more than half way progress to the final stage of the Shannon.  Again, I am assuming that that 800,000,000 cubic metres refers to what was in Siemens Schukerts' first proposal, their second stage, and what was in the experts' report as their third stage.  I think that most of the engineering opinion brought to bear upon that scheme since it was first inaugurated has tended against the final development of the Shannon and that, in fact, there are many more suitable ways of developing even water power in the country than by going on to the final stage of the Shannon. There is, for instance, the development of the Liffey scheme and even of schemes nearer the Northern boundary, more profitable, both from the point of view of the time at which the water runs and can be stored and from the point of view of necessary expenditure, than the final stage of the Shannon, so that this, in fact, does mean something approaching the final stage of the Shannon development as orginally passed by the experts because they drew attention to what they thought was likely to be the uneconomic nature of what they described as the third stage of development as they viewed it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, I relate all this back to the question of price and having a fairly clear view of what the Shannon development as such is going to cost, what the moneys to be collected in order to meet the expenditure are and, therefore, what the price ought to be. We are very near the end of the Shannon development as such, so far as the harnessing of water power and the storage in these three lakes are concerned. <Col N="1684" /> There are two things, then, that emerge on the works side.  The level of Lough Derg is to be raised from 110 to 112 feet O.D.&mdash;two feet of an increase.  When the scheme was first spoken of, 110 feet O.D. was the point at which the waters of Lough Derg stood for about three or four months in the year and the first scheme necessitated the holding of these waters at that level, not merely through these three or four months in which they ordinarily ran to that point, but for three extra months in each year. In so far as the natural level of that lake and the natural run of the waters down from the catchment area brought it to the 110 feet point for some months in the year, there was flooding and that flooding was increased by the holding of the waters at that level for the two or three extra months, and that was understood to be one of the most expensive parts of the original scheme.</P>
    <P>It is to be noted that of the moneys to be spent here, £450,000 is to be on Lough Derg.  I am again assuming that that means that there is a definite recognition that by raising the level of the lake by two feet, and, probably, holding it there throughout the year, there is going to be considerable damage done to the callow lands around the lake and these will, in the main, be bought out rather than that compensation will be paid for disturbance and submerging.  If compensation is paid at the old rate, the people who have those lands will not have much cause to complain if they are bought out, but it certainly was unsatisfactory to have these claims for temporary damage arising year after year simply because the allegations were things that could never really be disproved or very accurately fixed&mdash;they varied from year to year&mdash;as to what was the extra damage done to lands ordinarily wet or flooded or submerged for two or three months when that flooding or submerging was continued for double the period.  I am assuming, when I see that heavy item, that it means that these lands will, in fact, be purchased and will be regarded no longer as land of the country but as something underneath the waters of the lake and, of course, there will be compensation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1685" /> The other point is that referred to by Deputy Keyes.  If on the upper lakes, Allen and Ree, the level of Lough Allen is controlled between the limits of 168 and 154 feet and the level of Lough Ree is to be lowered to a minimum of 121 feet O.D., it is to be noticed that, in the Schedule, the lowering of the level of Lough Ree to this level drags with it, as a consequence, the execution of divers works, whereas the controlling of the level of Lough Allen between 168 and 154 feet O.D. involves the dredging of new channels and the deepening of existing channels, removing and reconstructing the weir at the outlet of the lough, reconstructing certain bridges and divers other works.  Again, I am assuming that this, to all intents and purposes, means that navigation above Carrick-on-Shannon will not merely be very seriously interfered with but will probably have to disappear.  Inland navigation, in so far as it goes near these lakes, will, to all intents and purposes, disappear.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was wondering why the sum of only £14,000 is the amount of money appropriated by way of expenditure to Lough Ree works. I was going to ask if that included compensation. I am told that there is going to be no compensation payable. That will be satisfactory if it is possible, but there may be doubts on the point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>When I say there is compensation payable, I should say that there may be some items of compensation for water supply and that sort of thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>With £14,000, there could not be much.  Might I put my point in another way?  Lough Derg has related with it in the Schedule for <Col N="1686" /> works to be carried out the other two lakes, which include £14,000 in respect of Lough Ree.  I am assuming that the amount includes not merely expenses, say, to workmen for digging certain trenches and removing certain earth embankments, etc., but certain compensation money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Very good.  I was wondering what was going to happen to navigation because I thought that if the level of the water was going to be lowered to the lower of the two limits set out in the Schedule there would be very serious interference with navigation.  The word &ldquo;control&rdquo; is put in and it may be possible to use the waters in the different seasons of the year in such a way as to allow navigation to go on unhindered but it will not be so argued, naturally.  There will be, however, two views on that, too.</P>
      <P>The other point that the Minister spoke of is the third point to which I want to draw attention.  The Minister said that last year the Board had generated a certain number of units&mdash; I think it was about 80,000,000 units&mdash; through the Pigeon House, and that it was desirable to amend that situation. The amendment is to have that substituted by electricity produced by water power.  It was not so much the absence of this storage last year as the fact that there was not a lot of water to be stored that rendered such an amount as 80,000,000 necessary of generation in steam stations and probably the same thing is at the moment occurring.  The Minister might say, by way of testing this, if the works now set out in the schedule had been perfected two years ago, and we had the two dry periods we have had this year and last year, how many of those 80,000,000 units would still have had to be generated from fuel stations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>A substantial part.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>More than half?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That gets us back again to the point that, even with this <Col N="1687" /> storage, if there were a succession of dry seasons like the last two we had, we would still have to have a very substantial stand-by in the way of a steam station.  I think that ought to be faced up to frankly, because it is going to raise a considerable amount of the usual confusion and inconsiderate talk in relation to the Shannon scheme.</P>
      <P>The Shannon scheme, as estimated, never provided for two seasons such as have passed.  They were drier than the driest season for the last sixty years, I understand.  The estimate was for a catchment area, and the water running down that area to the sea in dry periods taken over a period of sixty years.  Until we get better meteorological advice and a better impression of the weather in this country as having changed for the better permanently, I still deem the engineering calculations to be that it would not be worth while to spend money in so enlarging the storage capacity in those lakes as to try and avoid the consequences of two seasons such as we have had.  It would have to be done at an extraordinarily heavy charge, and, even if you had all the storage capacity in the world, it is doubtful if you could get sufficient from the catchment area of the Shannon to pass enough water through the turbines to generate all the electricity required in seasons such as we have had.  I mention that because I want the Minister's assent to that.  It might as well be known immediately that this, even when accomplished, will not prevent a very considerable lien on the Pigeon House, or some such station, in dry seasons of the type we have just experienced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sorry the Minister was not able to give the expenditure to date on the whole Shannon works.  It is somewhat hard to calculate, because there will be money contracted for and not yet spent, but it should be possible to say that, generating so many units of electricity, the works for that purpose cost so much, and the cost of the works for that purpose can be divided in certain proportions between water power works and fuel plants.  Even a third calculation might be given as between the <Col N="1688" /> generating items proper, divided into fuel and water, and, secondly, everything else; that is to say, long distance transmission and distribution, so that we can see what are the various stages, with the appropriate expenditure to each stage on generation and the other two things, taking these two together. There is a purpose to be served even by giving the figure for distribution because, after all, it is through the increase in the local distribution mains that one gets the best idea of the new areas that are being opened up and of the new consumers.  I welcome this as a very definite extension of the original scheme, because it is shown now that it was very well thought out and has been completed very much according to the original plans, everything still being on a very conservative estimate and a good basis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasKelly" hpid="Mr. T. Kelly Mr. T. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last occasion on which the Minister introduced a Bill in connection with the Shannon Scheme I adopted the role of the candid friend. I shall have to resume that role again this evening.  One newspaper referred to me as the lone Deputy on that occasion, as I was the only one who voted against the Bill.  I presume I shall be the lone Deputy again this evening.  I tried to explain on that occasion my authority for interfering at all.  I am not an expert in any sense of the word, but I had a very long education in connection with the Dublin electrical supply, as I was in it from the beginning. Through the various committees which dealt with that scheme from start to finish I got a fair layman's experience. Therefore, I speak in the sense that I know something about what I am going to say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We were told in the beginning that the Shannon scheme would cost in its first stage £5,000,000.  As a matter of fact, it has cost nearly double that. The balance sheet discloses a capital expenditure of nearly £9,500,000 for the first stage.  I tried to find out some information about it, but it is very difficult to get.  It is a matter of light, but I am very much in the dark.  I tried hard to get information from various people in connection with the working of the Shannon scheme, and I failed. <Col N="1689" /> I discovered, however, a pamphlet issued by Dr. MacLaughlin&mdash;&ldquo;The Shannon Scheme Considered in its National Economic Aspect.&rdquo;  It was issued at 6d. and published by the Sackville Press.  I had never heard of it until recently, when it came into my hands.  I presume everybody will give Dr. MacLaughlin credit for knowing what he is writing about.  In his introduction he says:-</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Shannon scheme as prepared by Messrs.  Siemens-Schuckert and modified by the experts appointed by the Government is visualised as taking place in three stages: (1) the partial development; (2) the further development; and (3) the final development.  These three stages differed on both the hydraulic and electrical sides.  On the hydraulic side, in storage, in the first stage only Lough Derg is to be used, in the second Lough Ree in addition, and in the third Lough Allen is to be added.  On the electrical side the three stages correspond to stages of increased electrical supply and consumption. The development, which at the moment comes in question, is what is termed the &ldquo;partial development.&rdquo;  When the &ldquo;further development&rdquo; will occur will depend on the growth of consumption, the experts reckon in, roughly, ten years' time.  In this article it is proposed only to deal with what now arises, viz., the &ldquo;partial development.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He then goes on to explain that the scheme provides for the diversion of part of the Shannon and says that in a very dry year, such as 1905, these turbines will generate 153,000,000 units. He says that partial development, apart from providing for what is described, incidentally includes an improvement in the drainage and navigation of the Shannon.  Its total cost is estimated at £5,200,000.</P>
    <P>These are portions of his introduction to the pamphlet.  The pamphlet goes on to explain how Ireland will benefit by this great scheme and how, particularly, the farming industry will benefit by it&mdash;that the farmers cannot possibly get along now without using electricity, and that the only means <Col N="1690" /> whereby electricity could be supplied to them was through the Shannon scheme.  He compares the development of electricity in other countries and speaks of the great saving in coal. Here is an extract from what he says on coal:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Coal Conservation Committee reported some years back that in Great Britain on an average 5 lbs. of coal were required to produce one horse-power hour of energy.  We may take this as a fair average for Irish conditions to-day. The Shannon, under the partial development, will produce 288,000,000 units in a year of average rainfall. On the above basis this is equivalent in energy to 860,000 tons of coal. Reckoning coal at an average of 30/- a ton throughout the Free State, this is equivalent in money value to £1,290,000.  In this first stage of the Shannon scheme, therefore, we have the possibility of producing at home the equivalent of £1,290,000 worth of present-day imports.  If we capitalise this sum at 5 per cent. we arrive at £25,800,000.  The Shannon scheme, in its partial development, will cost £5,200,000.  Surely it is good business to invest a capital of £5,000,000 to get the equivalent of a capital investment of £26,000,000!&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He goes on to describe the consumption of electricity in the Irish Free State.  He tells us:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In the Irish Free State there exists to-day 91 electric power stations for public supply purposes. Of these, 15 use water power to some extent, but in every case combined with a steam or oil plant.  The rest are steam, suction gas, or oil driven. Of these 91 only four are alternating current stations.  The others are direct current and their possible area of economic supply is thus necessarily limited to about one and a half miles from the power station.  Such power stations can only supply those living in the towns or villages and their immediate neighbourhood.  They can never supply farmers living in the country.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>At the time this pamphlet was written there were 91 electric power stations <Col N="1691" /> throughout the country, and we may take it they were giving satisfaction to all concerned.  From all I have knowledge of, the city electric power station was giving great satisfaction to the citizens of Dublin.  He proceeds to speak of what will happen when the Shannon scheme has been developed:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The ordinary man, rightly or wrongly, has the idea that the cost of installation is so great that he would not think of installing it without a good deal of persuasion.  In the Dublin supply, for instance, of whose merits we hear so much and whose demerits, as pointed out by the European experts, were so carefully suppressed by the Dublin newspapers, there is no separate commercial management.  A technical engineer is in charge, but where is the commercial man?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He meant where was the commercial traveller to persuade men to take in electricity and tell them that the cost of installation would be small and that the price of electricity would also be small.  Their commercial man has not been a success.  We have the balance sheet only up to the 31st March, 1933. How the Electricity Supply Board stood on the 31st March this year we will not know until next January or February.</P>
    <P>Here is an extract from the annual report and accounts of the Electricity Supply Board relating to installations and merchandise sales:-</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The credit taken for contracts completed and invoiced for installation work amounted to £49,794 12s. 10d., on which the rate of gross profit was 26.4 per cent.  Having debited to the installation trading account a proper proportion of general overhead expenses, there is a net profit of £652 14s. 7d.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The sales of appliances and apparatus for which credit has been taken amounted to £35,603 16s. 8d., on which the rate of gross profit was 18.6 per cent.  Having charged a proper proportion of general overhead expenses, the merchandise trading account shows a net profit of £484 15s. 11d.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On their own showing the figures <Col N="1692" /> relating to installation work and sales indicate scarcely £1,000 profit on a capital of over £9,000,000.  I have an example of their charges.  A man told me that he asked them for a price for installing an electric water heater in a flat.  They quoted him the price of £17 10s.  He agreed to it, and had the heater installed.  Afterwards he was fortunate enough to get a house, and he asked for an estimate to remove the heater from the flat to the house.  The estimate was £6 10s.  He demurred and said it was too high, and he refused to pay it.  He got an ordinary electrical contractor to remove it for 35/-.  He can produce the invoices, the estimates, etc.  The actual number of units generated up to 31st March, 1933, was 166,076,000.  Dr. MacLaughlin, in his introduction to the pamphlet, said the total cost for generating 153,000,000 units would be £5,200,000, so that for the additional 16,000,000 the price is raised to £9,600,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I have the greatest possible sympathy with the Minister in this matter.  I suppose of all the members of the Executive Council the greatest responsibility rests on his shoulders.  He has taken charge of the arduous work of helping on industrial development in this country. Anybody with a head on his shoulders knows that electricity can be made a very potential asset in a Minister's hands, but it is in the Minister's hands it ought to be.  Here we have a body with almost omnipotent powers. They can do what they like.  In fact I do not think the Dáil has any control over them.  I am almost sure the last time the Minister was introducing a Bill to give money for this enterprise he stated that he did not know anything about it and he was simply acting, so to speak, as the mouthpiece of the Board.  I presume that it is the same position now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No doubt the Minister's anxiety is to give employment.  This would undoubtedly be helpful in that respect, but where is the use in throwing millions every year into an enterprise <Col N="1693" /> such as this unless we have some belief that is is going to be a success?  Is it going to be a success?  On a former occasion I was told that the scheme was only in its infancy.  Apparently it is still very much a weakling.  It has to get a lot of cod liver oil rubbed into it in the shape of millions of money.  How long is it going to be a weakling?  We must remember there were large numbers of electrical enterprises all over the country working and giving satisfaction and this board took possession of the whole of them. In Dublin they took possession of a really valuable plant.  Here is the official statement of the Dublin Corporation undertaking on the 31st March, 1929.  The valuation of the assets then was £1,826,000.  In addition there were revenue assets amounting to £142,263, good debts due.  There was net cash in bank of £57,980.  The liabilities against those only amounted to £68,000.  So there was a net balance of £1,959,000, less a loan debt of £514,000 still due, which meant a net capital handed over to the Electricity Supply Board of £1,445,670. That was what they received from the Dublin Corporation.  Naturally, a man like me, who was associated with the municipal undertaking and the municipal body for so long, must take an interest and a keen interest in the working of this body that took possession of such a successful enterprise. But what do we find now?  They closed down the Pigeon House at the time.  As a matter of fact, they were going to scrap it.  For some years, as I was told by a man who lived down there close to it, there was only a caretaker&mdash;one man.  They found, however, that the Shannon scheme was not doing as well as it was thought it would do and they had to turn to the Pigeon House again and use it as an extra source of supply, and the coal is again coming into the harbour to-day as it did before.  I suppose that the same kind of coal is being used there now as was used before. Unfortunately, also, in this dry season, as the members learned to their cost quite recently, 500,000 gallons of water a day are being used down there.  I think that is the figure.  I <Col N="1694" /> am almost sure that that was the figure that the city borough surveyor announced a few weeks ago.  So that, really, only for the Pigeon House the Shannon Electricity Supply Board would not be worth a £5 note.  That may seem a hard thing to say but that is my belief.</P>
    <P>I think it is full time now for the Minister to say that he is going to take charge of this Shannon scheme; that he is going to work it as a national concern; that it is going to be looked after in the proper way; and that people are not going to be charged outrageous prices for installations. How are people going to get installations otherwise? If they employ an outside contractor to put these installations into their houses, they are still at the mercy of the board because the board may not pass them. I think that at least this board should be compelled to give up its commercial activities.  Let them be suppliers of electricity in bulk and not be competing with men in the trade in Dublin and other cities and places throughout the Free State.  Let them be satisfied to do what the corporation did&mdash;generate the electricity and then supply it in bulk.  There is a great deal of dissatisfaction in connection with the Shannon scheme.  I have heard it from all classes of citizens but I could hear from none that could give me any definite information concerning it.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go into other matters that I might go into to-day.  I am dealing here with the statements made by Dr. MacLaughlin.  They are there in that pamphlet and they have not been borne out.  More than £500,000 is being put into the enterprise now through this Bill.  I must protest, although I am sure I am going to be the only protestant here, against any further money being spent until, at least, the Government have established a commission of inquiry to go into the whole question with regard to future development.  I should be glad, and very glad, to hear of the scheme being a success, because I admit, as every man of commonsense must admit, that it would afford a great opportunity to our young people <Col N="1695" /> here to find employment directly through it or, indirectly, through the various enterprises and manufactures that would be fed by the current from the scheme.  Emigration has ceased, and everybody is faced with the serious responsibility of what is going to become of our young people in this country in the future.  As I say, I should be very glad if the scheme were a success, and I should be very glad to be able to announce to-day that I thought it was going to be a success.  On the facts and figures that I have given, however, how can a man say that it will be a success?  If the Minister would take my advice, he would establish a commission of inquiry, or better still, he would get his Executive Council to say that they are going to take control of this electricity supply in the future and just simply dispense with the board and appoint men of their own.  In my view, it would be more suitable to do so from the point of view of conducting this enterprise in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>(Clare): The Minister, in introducing this measure, told us that advantage was taken of the introduction of this amending Bill to redress certain impedimenta in the Principal Act, and I am very sorry to see that he did not take advantage of this Bill to redress certain grievances that still exist, notwithstanding all the several Bills that have been introduced since the original Bill was passed. First, I should like to ask what is the argument that can be put forward or the case that can be made for subsection (3) of Section 7?  When Deputy McGilligan was Minister for Industry and Commerce he exempted the buildings, grounds, and such things in connection with the Shannon scheme from poor law assessment or valuation. He certainly did not make a case that could convince me, and, at the time, it did not convince my colleagues from Clare, as to the justice of taking from the county what they should receive in rates from those constructions in the county.  I do not know what the case is.  I cannot see that any case can be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1696" /> If anybody takes the trouble to look up the Book of Estimates that is presented here every year since the Dáil was established, he will find that for every Government office or any national undertaking of this kind, there is a sum paid in rates.  Yet we find, in the county that is getting no special advantage whatever from the establishment on its grounds of the buildings of the Shannon electricity scheme, that it is exempt from assessment from rates, and the Minister here again endeavours to continue that and intends to continue it.  He says that the Minister for Local Government may declare that any particular works shall be exempt, either permanently or for a limited time.  I do not know what case there is for that.  I see that most of the works are going to be around Lough Derg.  Most of that work will be in the County Clare.  I should like to know what case the Minister can make for that.  No case was made on the previous occasion and the Minister did not make a case in introducing the Bill.  I hope that he will make a case now. The county did suffer a good deal of loss during the construction of the scheme, in the matter of public health service and in the matter of roads and such things.  Now it is not getting one unit one farthing cheaper than any other place in the State, and yet if any other national institution was erected anywhere else, that institution would be subject to assessments for rates in the county in which is was situated or else an equivalent amount of money would be paid in.  We cannot but say straight that we did not get much in Clare from the Shannon scheme, not much at all.  We got in Killaloe the unemployment of 20 or 30 men and there is not one word in this scheme about it.</P>
    <P>I want to say one word about compensation for them.  They were employed constantly during the season, that is to say each season consecutively. But the Shannon hydraulic scheme has destroyed the source of their employment.  That is one of the things they got because of the Shannon scheme.  They got the closing down of a grinding mill because there was no water power.  The power they hitherto <Col N="1697" /> used became a purely placid lake with no power to drive a mill.  Now on top of that we get the fact that the Minister proposes to continue that.  The Minister will have power to relieve from rates where the holding has been damaged.  Instead of doing that the Minister might have repealed the section in the Act which previously did make buildings responsible for rate assessments.</P>
    <P>I will have something to say on the Fisheries Bill regarding the compensation to people who were disemployed because of the operation of the Shannon scheme.  I want to get it in here too because this is the origin of the disemployment for the last five years.  On the top of that we have it that the local authority is deprived of that to which they are entitled in the matter of assessment for poor rates.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The matters that were raised on this debate are somewhat varied.  I will try to deal with them in order and as briefly as possible.  It should be made clear that the construction of these additional works for the purpose of providing storage is not in any way in consequence of the comparative drought which was experienced this year, last year, and the previous year.  The years 1932 and 1933 were dry years.  The year 1933 was a very dry year, and up to date 1934 has been an exceptionally dry year.  But the decision to proceed with these works has no connection whatever with that abnormal feature.  These works would be required and would be economically justifiable if the ordinary normal rainfall had occurred during this dry period. Even if we had the works constructed and if last year there had been a normal rainfall there would still have been the necessity to have generated at the Pigeon House and at other stations a fairly large percentage of the units which were in fact developed by steam in that year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These works for water storage are required to provide for the normal increase in the growth of the demand for electric current.  The question of the economic cost is one which, I think, is easily understood.  Last year 82,000,000 units were generated at the Pigeon House.  The question arose <Col N="1698" /> was there any other way in which these units could have been obtained?  When the question of obtaining these units by the erection of new works on the Shannon for increased storage arose, the calculation as to what the economical cost of these works would be had relation to the actual cost of generation through steam at the fuel stations.  A certain figure was arrived at which represented the cost of generation from steam.  An estimate was made which was checked by certain experts.  Having regard to that figure and the amount of the capital sum which the board could afford to expend upon increased storage, the figure which was arrived at was roughly £520,000.  The next step to be taken was to find what the actual works would cost.  Certain contracting firms were asked to submit tenders for the execution of these works. These tenders were received and on them, plus the assumption that interest would be payable upon the advances by the Department of Finance at 5½ per cent., the actual cost was determined and shown to be a figure £93,000 above that of the present economic value of the works.</P>
    <P>But if the rate of interest which the Department of Finance will require in respect of these advances is reduced from 5½ per cent., which the board has heretofore been paying, to a lower figure, then the gap between the actual cost and the economic value narrows and if the rate of interest comes as low as 4¾ per cent., the gap is closed completely, and the works to be carried out under this Bill will be an economic undertaking for the Electricity Supply Board without any grant.</P>
    <P>Even when these works are constructed it will be necessary to generate a very substantial number of units at the Pigeon House and at other stations and to consider various other means by which additional energy can be secured by the utilisation of water power.  The next stage in that connection will obviously be consideration of the possibility of the utilisation of the Liffey for that purpose.  I do not know that any purpose is to be served by discussing the points raised by Deputy <Col N="1699" /> McGilligan as to whether it is fair and reasonable to ask the electricity consumers of this generation to provide in the price they pay for their current not merely for the repayment of the advances already made and to be made to the board but also to provide a Reserve Fund capable of securing the replacement of the existing works when the question arises.  That is, of course, at the present time largely an academic question.  The electricity consumers are not doing that, as Deputy McGilligan pointed out.  They are not as yet doing more than paying the working cost of the scheme and of the working expenses of the board.</P>
    <P>The question of the repayment of the advances is one under consideration now.  It was at one stage hoped that the first repayment would be made in the present year.  That is not possible and the question of the fixation of the date upon which payment commences is under consideration. But it will not be for some time to come.  It is of much more importance that we should get the finances of the board upon a sound basis than that we should have an undue regard to academic points.  I for one would be satisfied if I saw the Electricity Supply Board paying its working costs, and included in the working costs there are the depreciation charges and the interest upon the advances made and the repayment of the advances.  I would not ask in addition to repaying the advances to accumulate a Reserve Fund, although certain reserve funds are required in order to provide against fresh advances having to be made to replace assets which were damaged by various accidents of one kind or another.  There was a storm of last year which did a certain amount of damage.  The repair of that damage, the replacements of the assets which were destroyed, and which had themselves been provided out of advances not yet repaid, should have been financed out of a Reserve Fund and not out of fresh advances. Certain reserves to meet contingencies of that kind are necessary.  Subject to the accumulation of these reserves; to the payment of working costs, <Col N="1700" /> including depreciation; the payment of interest and the repayment of the advances, I think we can be very satisfied with the position of the Electricity Supply Board without looking for more.  One point which I made during my opening remarks caused some misunderstanding, I think, because of the form of words I used.  I spoke of the Minister for Finance being unable to guarantee for a number of years that funds would be available at a certain rate of interest. The advances which are to be made under this Bill will not actually fall to be made for some time to come, and it would be difficult to say now that two years ahead the State would be able to provide funds for the Electricity Supply Board at any particular rate of interest substantially below the rate which has been charged heretofore.</P>
    <P>Deputy T. Kelly raised a number of points, all of which have been the subject of discussion here from time to time.  The position, as I have explained before, is that there is in existence the Shannon works, on which £5,500,000, or a substantially larger sum now, have been invested.  There is the position created in which the Electricity Supply Board has got effective control over the business of generating and distributing electric current here.  It is not going to get us anywhere to debate now whether in 1924 or 1925 a different policy from that adopted should have been adopted, or whether things would have been better for the electricity consumer if nothing had been done, but the development of the electricity industry had been left to private enterprise. I think most people, who have given consideration to the matter, will agree that it is much better that we should have a national electricity scheme than that we should have a very large number of privately owned generating stations and distributing systems, with the consequent inability to adapt the supply to industrial requirements in any area, or to secure uniformity of rates or services in different parts of the country.  In other countries where the electricity industry developed in that haphazard way through private enterprise, they have <Col N="1701" /> found it necessary to take more and more powers of regulation and control, with the ultimate result of getting a position in which they would have a nationally regulated system as we have here.  The main consideration for us, therefore, is what we must do in order to make the best of the present situation. Whatever objection Deputy Kelly might have had to provision of the funds asked for the Electricity Supply Board at the beginning of this year presumably he would have no real objection to the funds being asked for in this Bill, which are designed to secure that more of the current which is at present being consumed, and which will be required by our people, will be generated by the use of water than by the use of coal.  It is a particular source of satisfaction that, in carrying out the works which will enable that to be done, a very large number of people are going to get employment for a period.</P>
    <P>It is not anticipated that the execution of those works will in any way interfere with navigation.  There is a canal with connects Lough Allen with the river further down, but which has not been used for some time and which, I think, the Canals Commission estimated could not be put into working order by an expenditure of less than £50,000 or £55,000.  I gave consideration to the question of navigation above Carrick-on-Shannon, because, as Deputies are aware, we are at present carrying out in that area certain investigations into mineral resources.  If it should happen that those investigations will reveal the existence of mineral resources capable of commercial development, it might be necessary to have means of transportation by water.  It appeared however, from the investigation which I caused to have made that the additional expenses which would be involved in constructing navigation works at a later date, over and above the expense which would be involved in constructing them now, was so small that it was obviously quite practicable to postpone a decision on the matter until the result of the investigations into the mineral resources was known.  If it should <Col N="1702" /> appear that the execution of the works to permit transportation by water is desirable, that could be done at a cost very little, if at all, in excess of what would have to be expended on the existing canal in order to get it into a condition in which it could be navigated.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to charges for electric current.  I have no function in relation to that matter.  The Act of 1927 puts on the Electricity Supply Board the responsibility of fixing charges which will yield it a revenue capable of meeting all its expenses, without making a profit.  Deputy Kelly made some reference to the fact that the board made no profit.  The board is, in fact, deterred by law from making a profit.  It is required to fix its scales of charges so as to produce sufficient to meet its expenses, including in its expenses the necessity for making those provisions for reserves and other similar purposes.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hogan asked why Clare did not get the benefit of the existence of the Shannon works in the County Clare in the form of a contribution in lieu of rates, such as is made in respect of certain other State property.  One does not like to answer a question of that kind by asking another question, but the question: &ldquo;Why should it?&rdquo; is an obvious one, and appears to require an answer.  Those works were undertaken as a national scheme.  They were located in a certain part of the country.  It was purely by chance that the County Clare was chosen; at least it was not due to anything associated with the local government of that county that such a site was chosen. Why the benefit of rates which would have to be paid by electricity consumers all over the country should be granted to the Clare County Council, because of the accidental fact that the works were situated there, is a point which is not easy to follow.  I think, in fact, it is a good principle that where national works of that kind are established the country as a whole should benefit evenly by them rather than one particular county.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">

      <P>That is leading me further afield than I intended to go. County Clare may have lost a little in the form of the unemployment of certain part-time fishermen and the closing down of certain mills which would probably have closed down in any case, but it certainly gained considerably also by the fact that there was a considerable influx of workers into the county, during the period of the construction of the scheme, which must have meant a large expenditure amongst the traders there of the money earned by them.  I do not know if there was any other point raised that requires to be dealt with at this stage. I will endeavour to get, before the conclusion of the discussion on the Bill, the various figures and information that Deputy McGilligan asked for.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be read a second time.&rdquo;  This is a Bill to make provision for the management of the fisheries of the River Shannon by the Electricity Supply Board and for that purpose to provide for the payment of compensation in respect of such fisheries by the Electricity Supply Board and the acquisition or transfer of fisheries by or to the board and to make provision for other matters relating to the management of the fisheries.  The <Col N="1704" /> problems created in respect of Shannon fisheries by the construction and operation of the Electricity Supply Works have been under consideration for a long time and, as Deputies are aware, a considerable agitation was caused from time to time amongst persons interested in these fisheries by the position which has existed.  It was not easy to decide what was the best course to take.  Under the Shannon Act of 1925, power was taken to compensate owners of fisheries where these fisheries had been damaged by the construction of the Shannon works and certain sums were due to various fishing owners on that account. Further, it appears that continuing claims for compensation were likely to arise, due to injuries caused by the operation of the Shannon works, and that provision would have to be made for the payment of compensation under that head and the payments would in time amount to considerable sums from which very little benefit would be secured.  In addition, there was the fact that certain fisheries upon the Shannon had become the property of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and others were the property of the Commissioners of Public Works. In any event, there was a problem in relation to fisheries on the Shannon which had to be dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was, I think, necessary to make a decision at an early date as to whether the interests of the electrical works were to predominate over the interests of the fishery owners or <i>vice versa.</i>  The matter was, I think, considered by the previous Government and a Bill somewhat similar to the one now before the Dáil was prepared and introduced, although it never was finally enacted.  When I became Minister for Industry and Commerce this Bill which had been drafted was one of the matters that came up for attention and I felt that I could not accept the measure as it stood without having the whole problem examined afresh and I arranged for the establishment of an interdepartmental committee, on which the Department of Industry and Commerce, the Office of Public Works and fishery and other interests were <Col N="1705" /> represented.  The Bill now before the Dáil is very largely the product of that committee.  In certain respects, the recommendations of the committee have been departed from, but these are only minor respects.  In brief, their recommendation was that the control and management of the fisheries on the Shannon should be handed over to the Electricity Supply Board and that the Electricity Supply Board should be charged, in addition, but subject and without prejudice to the primary function of maintaining, working and developing the Shannon hydro-electric works in accordance with the Act of 1927, with the duty of managing, conducting and preserving the Shannon fisheries under and in accordance with the present Bill.</P>
    <P>It is proposed further that where compensation is payable in respect of damage done to a fishery in lieu of paying that compensation, the board may acquire the fishery, and it is further provided that the fisheries which are owned by the Minister shall be transferred to the board, as also fisheries now in the custody of the Commissioners of Public Works.  Thus, the Electricity Supply Board will be authorised to acquire the control of all the fisheries on the Shannon and will be charged with the responsibility of conducting and preserving those fisheries.  The powers of the board in relation to the Shannon fisheries are set out in Section 9, and it is provided that the income of the board derived from the performance of its duties in relation to the Shannon fisheries, after the discharge of expenses incurred by the board in the performance of these duties, will be applied, firstly, to the payment of interest payable to the Minister for Finance on advances made under this Bill; secondly, setting aside such sums as the board, with the approval of the Minister for Industry and Commerce shall think proper for reserve fund, extensions and other purposes relating to the said duties; thirdly, to the payment of all moneys payable in the current year or owing in respect of a previous year to the Minister for Finance on account of the repayment of advances made to the board under this Act; and fourthly, for any <Col N="1706" /> other purpose the board may think proper.</P>
    <P>There are certain provisions concerning the appointment of members of boards of conservators and so forth which can, I think, be more appropriately discussed on the Committee Stage.  Section 13, in Part IV of the Bill, provides for the making of advances to the board by the Minister for Finance similar to the corresponding section in the Bill we have just dealt with and other Bills relating to the Electricity Supply Board.  Section 14 provides for the assessment of compensation where compensation is payable, and Sections 15, 16 and 17 are necessary sections in a Bill of this kind. Section 18 provides that the board shall not, without the previous consent of the Minister, permit the rate of discharge of water through the weir at Parteen Villa to be less at any time than ten cubic metres per second, which is the minimum amount considered necessary for the preservation of the fisheries below the weir.  There are certain powers proposed to be conferred on the board in respect of the alteration of the weekly close season.</P>
    <P>Then comes Section 21, the effect of which is to limit the number of persons who may engage in fishing with drift nets in the tidal waters of the River Shannon to 70 and provides that the number of licences for fishing with draft nets or seines in the said water which shall be issued in any such year shall not exceed 28.  These were the numbers of licences actually issued for the year 1932.  The intention is to ensure that those who got licences in that year will get preference for licences&mdash;that is, that those who are engaged in that business will continue to engage in it, but that no new licences will issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a misprint there.  It should be &ldquo;draft.&rdquo;  The <Col N="1707" /> principle of the Bill is to effect this transfer of the Shannon fisheries to the Electricity Supply Board.  That may, at first sight, appear to be rather a peculiar thing to do, but it represents the position that the preservation of the Shannon fisheries has got to be secondary to the utilisation of that river for the purpose of the generation of electricity.  I am glad to be able to say that the pessimistic forecasts made at one time as to the probable effect of the operation of that scheme upon the fisheries do not appear to be borne out.  In fact, this year I understand the run of fish has been remarkably good.  That is an indication that the fears expressed two or three years ago may not be realised.  Of course, one cannot jump at conclusions from the short experience which has been had up to the present.  In any event, it is considered that the function of preserving and developing the fisheries can be performed by the board better than anybody else.  In view of the situation that arises, it is much better that there should be unified control of the fisheries.  If we were to have a second body, it is almost inevitable that there would be a conflict of interests between that body and the Electricity Supply Board at some stage&mdash;a conflict which it would be hard to resolve.  The board will be able to secure the services of persons competent in every way to look after these fisheries.  No doubt, they will be able to regulate them in such a manner as to secure the best economic return from them.</P>
      <P>In the main, the advances which will be made under this Bill to the board will be for the purpose of paying compensation to the owners of fisheries which may be acquired.  It is not possible at this stage to make any estimate as to what the total amount of such compensation will be, but it will be determined in the manner provided in the Bill, which I recommend to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am specially glad to hear the Minister say, because it is so unexpected, that the pessimistic forecasts made nine or ten years <Col N="1708" /> ago as to the effect of the Shannon scheme upon the fisheries have not been borne out.  I had thought from reading the newspapers that the situation was worse than anybody ever imagined, and I am glad to hear that these were exaggerations.  At any rate, the fears expressed were obviously fanned to a certain point of terror&mdash;it was a natural enough thing to do&mdash;in order to have those who are in touch with the Shannon vigilant on the matter of the fish.  I suppose it was a fear excited by the very definite statement made, followed now by the statement to-day, that if fish clash with electricity, electricity is going to prevail. It is natural, in these circumstances, for people who are keen on the fishery as such to raise alarms and excursions of all types in order to get some attention paid to their grievances.</P>
      <P>Further, it was recognised at the time of the consideration of the Shannon scheme that, although compensation if it fell due for payment at all in relation to anything except fisheries, should fall due inside a very limited period, in relation to fisheries that period was naturally extended, and I think it was supposed to be a period of about ten years.  We are very nearly ten years from the time when these things first came upon the country, and it is to be noticed that Part II, which deals with compensation, refers to injuries which may happen, if happening after the passing of this, within a three-year period. So that time definitely goes well outside the ten-year period at first envisaged as that in which injury might accrue.  To that extent, therefore, this measure entirely keeps within any statements that were made in relation to injuries likely to be done to, or to come upon, the fisheries by reason of the Shannon scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to that, and keeping in line with this statement, there is a second feature about the Bill; and this I say by way of answer to some things said by Deputy Kelly on the last Bill, that I am delighted to see, if the Shannon fishery is to be taken over by somebody, it is not being taken over by the Minister.  He is not going <Col N="1709" /> to answer for it in the House.  It is going to be taken over under powers granted by him to the Electricity Supply Board and he is going to have the same relation to that board in respect of fisheries as the Shannon Electricity Act gave the Minister for Industry and Commerce in relation to the board in respect of electricity.  The same scheme is being carried through here with absolute attention to the old details.  The scheme of the original Shannon Scheme in relation to electricity was that a board was being set up, given tremendous powers and privileges, told its duty was to develop the use of electricity throughout the country, and that, in consideration for the powers and privileges which it got, it had to reveal its secrets once a year through accounts.  These accounts were to be investigated by auditors appointed by the Government, but paid for by the board.  The Government, on receipt of the auditor's report, might call for a further report and that report, plus any explanatory details&mdash;there was discretion as to the explanatory details&mdash;had to be put before the Dáil once a year and people would be able to debate it.  That is the scheme that is being followed in the main with regard to this.  The handling of the moneys given to them and the reports are all dragged inside the framework of the old scheme.</P>
    <P>So that, much to Deputy Kelly's annoyance, I suppose, not merely is the Minister accepting the old scheme in relation to electricity, but he is now taking over the same board and giving that board control over fisheries: and he is doing it to the exclusion of the ordinary Parliamentary right here day by day to harry and persecute the Minister who has charge of a particular matter as one of his Departmental duties.  I think it is all to the good that it is a board.  There may be some comment as to whether the Electricity Supply Board is the proper board; but it is to the good that it is a board and not the Minister who is to have charge and answer for the working of the fisheries; always remembering that one of the board's duties, laid upon it by Act of Parliament, is to produce a financial account <Col N="1710" /> and, if the need arises, to have an auditor's statement upon that account. The Dáil will be given an opportunity once a year of discussing what is happening and saying whether they think what is happening is good, bad or indifferent.</P>
    <P>The Minister says that this Bill definitely, at any rate, marks as a second important feature that the Electricity Supply Board are to have as their important function the working and developing of the Shannon hydro-electric works; that their second job is fisheries, but that the fish are definitely subject to the electricity.  That is not entirely so, because there is a clause which insists that the amount of water passing down by the weir at Parteen Villa cannot be less at any time than 10 cubic metres per second.  Against that we have the right of the Minister to allow the board to draw off water for electricity purposes so as to preclude the passage of 10 cubic metres per second down at Parteen Villa. That is where two things may be in conflict from time to time.  They must let down so much water through the old river for fishery purposes and, on the other hand, they may not prevent water going through the weir at Parteen Villa except in peculiar circumstances when the Minister may give them power.  A certain amount of water will be required in certain circumstances to enable the fish to get up the river for spawning purposes.  If other circumstances arise the Minister may have to exercise his authority and warrant some other treatment and the point is whether more attention will be paid to electricity and more indifference as to what happens the fish.</P>
    <P>I think that the Minister might have stated more definitely the underlying purposes of this Bill.  He did emphasise overmuch that the overriding consideration was electricity and fish were to take a secondary place.  I understood the real argument for this Bill was that in any event there would be a certain amount of money paid for damage to fisheries and very nearly the same amount of money would actually acquire the fisheries and it is a question as to <Col N="1711" /> whether the Government would be prepared to pay the price for doing damage to fisheries or whether they should not take control of the whole property.  The idea underlying that is that there would be a better chance of the river being developed for fishery purposes if it were put under the control of one central authority, one body that would have control over the whole river.  So many pounds will have to be spent compensating people for damage done to fisheries and very nearly the same amount would purchase all the fishery rights on the river.  The position is that you had a river there and you had a definite run of fish in certain circumstances.  Those fish had acquired a reputation both in respect of their value and the sport they afforded. The whole original scheme of things in that river was to change.  Who is going to restore the former conditions on that river, who will get a newer or even a better system along the river, it is hard to say.  Who is likely to remake it?  Certainly not the scattered owners, who will be concerned largely with getting money for damage done to their property.  The constructive side of it will have to be attended to by somebody, and the question is would it be desirable to have that somebody in control over the whole river?</P>
    <P>The river has been taken away from its old system; the fish have been disturbed in their old-time habits. The only thing is to get someone who will have control over the river.  The important point is to bring some constructive minds into play and get attention paid to the big problem arising from the change in the river bed.  The Minister has been optimistic enough with regard to the condition of the fisheries.  Admittedly nothing could be worse than the conditions on the Shannon within the last year or two, conditions in which the drought has played an important part.  If, despite these adverse conditions, the Minister is in a position to say that the pessimism and the alarums have really been falsified and that things are really satisfactory at the moment, <Col N="1712" /> then there is a good prospect ahead for this national asset under the unified control that the board is likely to bring about.  There is the point that there might be confused thought on a body whose main function is the provision of electricity and upon whom is imposed a second task somewhat contrary to the first&mdash;that of looking after the fish.  The mere fact that they are already in control of the river in one respect makes it rather desirable for this board to take charge rather than to have another board appointed.  It is better to have one than to have two boards with constructive views.</P>
    <P>I hope that the new function of the board will be adverted to in relation to the personnel and that appointments will be made to the fishery side. When accounts and reports are presented here it is to be hoped that there will be a segregation of the fisheries account.  It is to be hoped that the fisheries account will not be included in the general electricity account&mdash;that we will have a separate account dealing with the fishery side, so that people will be able to see how far the fishery side is advancing. Expert criticism could then be brought to bear on that aspect by people who might not have so much interest in electricity as in fish.  That statement of the Minister ought to lessen any fear people may have, particularly if they are inclined to be so critical as Deputy Kelly is of the board as an electricity supplier.  He probably would argue that if they fail in the matter of electricity they will make a complete hash, if the word is appropriate, of fish.  If the accounts are separated in the manner I suggest we could occasionally investigate them in order to see what sort of a kettle they are giving us in relation to fish.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>One feels rather in a maze as to what is the purport of this Bill.  In a previous measure we have given extensive powers to the Electricity Supply Board for the purpose of generating an electricity supply for the country.  We have had some complaints that they have not been giving abundant satisfaction in <Col N="1713" /> their own special job.  It would now appear that not alone are they going to be the manufacturers and purveyors of electricity, but they are going to take over the control of the destinies of the Shannon fish.  Whatever special qualifications they may have in that respect, they are not clearly set out.  The Minister mentioned, in the course of his remarks, that frequent complaints were being made by the existing fishery interests that had been interfered with by the Shannon works and that compensation claims were being lodged, and were likely to continue being lodged, and he asked what was the best course to take.  Evidently, it was decided that the best course to take was to wipe out the lot and to make the Electricity Supply Board supreme over the fishery interests.  If that is to be the case, we in this House would want to be very careful to see that justice should be done to all those with fishing interests&mdash;some of them existing for centuries&mdash;on the River Shannon, that are now being handed over to the Electricity Supply Board for the purposes of sweeping them out of existence and making the board supreme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as the tidal waters are concerned, I fail to see why any interference should take place with them. They do not interfere with the Shannon works in any shape or form.  Up as far as Limerick they are being taken in and the line is an imaginary point and extends for 60 miles below Ardnacrusha. All this must be handed over to the Electricity Supply Board, for what reason we would be anxious to know.  What is the reason for it or what is the necessity for it?  The Minister gave a pretty clear explanation in connection with Section 21 and pointed out that under Section 21 all existing licensees on the lower Shannon would continue to get their licences, but the seven Deputies from Limerick were very anxious to hear the Minister on Section 22.  I can assure the Minister that at the moment there is a host of debating societies springing up in the City of Limerick who have been discussing Section 22 of the Shannon Fisheries Bill and discussing it from an angle never dreamed of here <Col N="1714" /> in the Dáil, because it affects 50 families, comprising 250 persons, in the shape of the Abbey fishermen who have been carrying on fishing on that portion of the river, known as the first fishery from the tide wave, for four miles below Limerick and four miles above it, for centuries.  For three or four centuries back they operated for four miles below and four miles above Limerick but in recent years they have been confined to the first fishery from the tide wave which extends, as I say, four miles above and six miles below to Parteen Villa.  So, I cannot see what interference they would make with the Shannon scheme.  They are above the old spot in the river which has been denuded of water but they can still continue to make a living of it.  They are the actual owners, having bought out the riparian interests of the landowners on each side of the river, and they have continued to enjoy these fishing rights for at least three centuries.</P>
    <P>Section 22, about which we are anxious to have an explanation, says that</P>
    <P>&ldquo;it shall not be lawful for any person to fish for, catch or take, or attempt to catch or take, salmon with a net of any kind in the fresh waters of the River Shannon within the meaning of the Fisheries Act, 1842 to 1925.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Abbey fishermen, however, were there before the Act of 1842 and their existing rights and privileges were preserved in the Act of 1842.  We are anxious to see that, in common with the men who will be allowed to get a licence to fish on the tidal water above Limerick, those Abbey fishermen be allowed to do what they have done for centuries.  We should like to know whether or not that is the interpretation to be put on this section with reference to the Acts, 1842 to 1925.  I suggest that anything in way of compensation would not meet the case of those men.  They are actually a clan in themselves and they have clung to their heritage in these fisheries for centuries.  Anything in the way of compensation would be regarded by them as an insult.  They want to be allowed to fish on the <Col N="1715" /> waters which are their own by tradition and by purchase, and to be allowed to provide for the existence of their families, which contain roughly 250 persons, in that way.</P>
    <P>There are other interests concerned. Higher up we find at Castleconnell there are seven or eight private fisheries and some of them have got compensation already for the destruction of fisheries higher up.  One gentleman, I understand, got compensation to the extent of £15,000 or £16,000.  From enquiries I have made, I am given to understand that another £15,000 is contemplated to be paid to certain private owners at Castleconnell. I have not heard one word, however, about compensation for the 20 odd fishermen who are as much part and parcel of those fisheries as the boats or the rods engaged in them. These men are as essential to the fishing as the boat or the rod, and are we to think that those 20 men, who drew a regular wage for nine months of the year in the particular season, are going to be completely forgotten and the compensation handed over to the man who happened to own a fishery? As I say, these workmen are part and parcel of the fishery just as much as the boat or the rod itself.  They cannot fish themselves, and now their employment is gone, but, so far, there is no word of compensation for them.</P>
    <P>There is a clause in this Bill also which makes it possible for the Minister to extend the close weekly season period.  As long as he does not make it less than 48 hours he may extend it. I suggest that it is fatuous to be talking or thinking of extending the close season while the present scandal of the Shannon scheme tail race is allowed to continue.  The Minister says that the reports he has now would seem to put away the suggestions of pessimism which obtained in previous years in this connection.  The existence of the tail race, as it is at present, is a scandal.  It is scandalous that thousands and thousands of fish are getting into it without any attempt being made to prevent them getting into it and without any means for them to get out of it.  They are <Col N="1716" /> not allowed to be poached.  They have to spawn and they come up and get caught in the tail race and are lying dead in thousands and being drifted out by the current.  As a result, the place is putrid from the smell of the decaying fish.  I am not capable of estimating what the money loss of this would be but the number of salmon themselves is estimated in thousands in the mile and a half of tail race of the Shannon scheme at the present time which are lost to the Shannon fisheries.  One would think that, if the Electricity Supply Board were doing their job and doing justice to the fisheries&mdash;which, I admit, they had to interfere with to some extent&mdash;they would be able to devise, through some kind of engineering ingenuity, some way of preventing the fish from getting into the tail race and allowing them to continue up the old river past Parteen up to Castleconnell and up to their old spawning beds.  There was a grid up there once and the results were disastrous.  More fish were killed as a result of it than had been the case earlier.  The fish going up find themselves with a rush of water against them.  They are locked in.  Once they get in they are held there and kept inside.  They have sometimes been taken, I have reason to believe, by people who have very little right to the fish.  They take them out of the tail race and make sale of them illegally in the City of Limerick.</P>
    <P>I would say that apart from the compensation to the 20 odd fishermen at Castleconnell, if the tail race was to be attended to as has been suggested already by the engineers, and if it were defended by putting a grid across it to prevent them coming in and to allow the boats to go out where there would be no such rough flow of water it would obviate the big rush of salmon into the tail race. If these things were done the fish would be given an opportunity of going up the river and spawning. I see the owners are to be compensated very generously.  There is £2,500 for one man; £4,000 for another; £1,700 for another; £2,500 for another; then there are £3,000, £1,000 and £700 for others.  Those gentry are being compensated <Col N="1717" /> generously and it would be only decent to have the fishermen who have been fishing on this river for generations given the right to net the river on the payment of a reasonable fine and so provide them with a reasonable livelihood.</P>
    <P>Whatever compensation will be given will be only of a small and transitory nature and will not be a suitable return for the loss the men have suffered by the loss of their fisheries. These are a few points which are arousing very considerable interest in and around Limerick.  All the Deputies representing that area will agree with me as to the anxiety that has been caused amongst the Abbey fishermen, the oldest body of fishermen in this country and likewise the Castleconnell fishermen.  We are particularly interested in the interpretation of Section 22.  If the Minister will assure us that the fishermen will be allowed to continue their business in these fisheries it will cause a great deal of satisfaction there and will allow the men to concentrate on their work.  I do not think the board has any right to come along without any previous or mutual agreement to take over these interests as it is proposed apparently to do by this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. Fionan Lynch Mr. Fionan Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fionan Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose the safe line to take would be to split the difference between the optimism of the Minister and the pessimism of Deputy Keyes with regard to the state of the Shannon fisheries.  I do not at all agree with the outlook of Deputy Keyes on this whole matter.  It was obvious that some such Bill had to be introduced to deal with the fisheries in the Shannon as a whole.  In dealing with a big area like that it is obvious that some corns are bound to be trodden on.  As to why the board should be given any control over the tidal waters, the reason is that the whole basis of this Bill, as at first contemplated, was that since compensation was to be paid it was just as well to acquire the rights and to protect all the fisheries as a unit for the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Undoubtedly there will be compensation claims along the tidal waters as <Col N="1718" /> a result of the hydraulic scheme.  I do not know with what success these claims will be prosecuted but such claims will be made.  Undoubtedly there has been considerable damage done to the tidal fisheries as a result of the Shannon scheme.  If you have to pay compensation to some of those people I agree with the project in the Bill for buying them out.  What I do not understand in the Bill is that there is to be any segregation between compensation and purchase.  I do not understand why we should not go the whole hog for the purchase and that the board should take over the fisheries in the Shannon as defined here rather than compensate in some cases and acquire in the others.  The Bill would seem in one direction to be doing so but then it makes provision for compensation as against acquisition that would lead one to the belief that it is not as Deputy Keyes stated.</P>
    <P>The Deputy made one passing reference to the number of salmon that are being killed in the tail race and that are being sold by certain persons.  I do not know whether that is so.  It seems extraordinary if it is so considering the provisions of the 1925 Act which insists that licensed dealers of salmon and trout should keep records as to where they bought their fish and from whom.  If persons were illegally taking fish in the Shannon I think it could be very easily traced.  These are by the way in reply to some of the things that Deputy Keyes stated.  I think that Deputy Keyes was right in his interpretation of Section 22.  That was one of the sections to which the Minister did not refer.  Presumably that means that any several fisheries which may exist in the fresh waters of the Shannon will be wiped out and that fresh water fishing in the Shannon will be stopped.  That means of course that any several fishery in the fresh waters as well as any public fishery such as that exercised by the Abbey net men will cease.  In the ordinary reading of that section that is the only meaning one can draw from it.</P>
    <P>I do not at all accept Deputy Keyes' point of view, but I know that he is expressing a point of view that has been expressed to me by the Abbey <Col N="1719" /> men&mdash;that compensation was no use. I think that is an absurd line to take. There must be some value set on their right to fish in a particular area.  If it is for the benefit of the fisheries of the Shannon as a whole that net fishing should cease, I do not see why it should not and why some basis of compensation should not be arrived at.  If it has been decided&mdash;and I believe it was entirely necessary that the Abbey net men should be stopped from fishing&mdash; therefore it was desirable that that should be done and there must, of course, be some compensation.  But I am wondering why this section is brought in there and not in the compensation section.  I presume they are not excluded from consideration, and so long as they are excluded from consideration for compensation I think they have no grievances.</P>
    <P>It is ridiculous to adopt the attitude that no basis of compensation can be found for any loss they may incur through being prevented from fishing there.  As to the limiting of the period for claims for injuries before the passing of the Act to the year before and three years after, we know that in a matter like fishing it is very hard to draw a line of that kind because the injury to the fishing will be progressive. Some injury will possibly be done before the passing of the Act and some after.  The difficulty is that the cost of the Shannon fishery works does not finish on a certain day.  We have put before this Bill another Electrical Bill dealing with the waters of the Shannon.  That may have some effect also on the fisheries.  I refer to the Bill that has got its Second Reading to-day&mdash;the Bill making provision for storage of water in the Shannon.  I do not know whether it will or not affect the salmon fisheries on the Shannon, but at any rate I think it is foolish to draw a hard and fast line at the moment fixing dates before which and after which the injury will have been committed, because if there is a further development there will have to be provision for further works.  Deputy McGilligan said that we should have reached a stage at which it would have been possible <Col N="1720" /> to calculate the exact amount of injury done to the fisheries.  He said the period fixed at the time was ten years and that it had now nearly run out.  It was ten years since the 1925 Act, but I think the Shannon works, if I remember rightly, did not start until September, 1927.  I am not quite clear on that.  At any rate I would certainly fix ten years from the date of completion of the Shannon scheme as a moderate period of calculation, that is, if the scheme were then complete and there were no further works being undertaken.  While there are further works being undertaken, I think you will always have to prolong that period to see what the effect of those works will be over three or four years.</P>
    <P>My attitude to this Bill is that something like it was necessary.  With Deputy McGilligan I think it is just as well to have the Electricity Supply Board as to have another board. Having another board would only mean a continual friction between that board and the Electricity Supply Board. They would have absolutely conflicting interests.  One would have its mind concentrated on the good of the fisheries, and the other on what was necessary for the hydraulic scheme. Since so much of the national money has been invested in the hydraulic scheme, I suppose it is natural to assume that the benefit of the scheme for electricity supply would have to be predominant.  It is, therefore, as well, since that provision is there, that the one board should have the administration of both.  Like Deputy McGilligan, I should like if the accounts were kept separate&mdash;as they presumably will be&mdash;so that one would know what is happening to fisheries as distinct from electricity supply.</P>
    <P>I was glad to see provision there for extension of the weekly close season. It is probable that something will have to be done generally and over a far wider area than the Shannon.  It is a question which has long been under consideration.  Certainly, the extension of the weekly close season as far as the Shannon is concerned was under consideration a good number of years ago, as desirable owing to the possible <Col N="1721" /> effects of the hydraulic scheme.  I think it will make an extremely interesting experiment if the Board takes charge of the whole river practically from its source to the sea.  It will be very interesting, from the point of view of the contemplation of acquisition of several fisheries throughout the country as a whole.  There is a considerable demand for that, as Deputies know.  There is a considerable amount of attack upon fishery rights at the moment, and claims by members of the public to invade rights which have been exercised over a number of years.  I do not think it will be possible to check those invasions, and I think we may get a fairly good headline from the operations of the Board in relation to Shannon fisheries as to what line we might take with regard to a general scheme for dealing with all other rivers in somewhat the same way&mdash;that is, a general scheme for fishery acquisition. I have felt for a considerable time that the only solution of that problem will be something in the nature of fishery purchase, on the same lines as we had land purchase to deal with the land problems.  This, I hope, will educate us, or at least will give us something to go on when we see the operations of this Board.  It does not matter what the Board is, or what previous experience there was.  There is no point in that.  They can easily employ men who will have sufficient knowledge to deal with the fishery business, and so long as they have administrative capacity in any line they can administer the fisheries the same as any other business.  It will be extremely useful, from the point of view of experience, to see how fisheries can be controlled by a unified control, and may give us a very useful line for a future Fishery Acquisition Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. P. Hogan Mr. P. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>(Clare): I want at the outset to assure the Minister that I am very serious in the few remarks I am going to make about the effect which the Shannon scheme had upon the lives and fortunes of some people in Killaloe.  There is no use in trying to dismiss it lightly by saying that some few people got disemployed.  The fact remains that at least 20 families were <Col N="1722" /> disemployed.  There is no use in dismissing it lightly.  They are still disemployed, and have been disemployed all the years since the scheme came into active operation.  They are still trying to exist.  They kept themselves all their lives since boyhood on this scheme of employment.  They endeavoured to rear their families on this scheme of employment.  Their fathers before them reared their families on it.  Now we are told they have no rights whatever.  We were told by a previous Minister that they had no more right than a man carting coal along the road.  Was there ever anything so absurd?  The present Minister, although he does not state that, has by implication accepted that proposition, because there is not one provision in this measure to give them any compensation whatever.  Some £20,000 or £30,000 will, I am sure, be given to people who had other vested interests which were destroyed or injured or affected in some way or other by the operation of the Shannon scheme.  That, possibly, is right.  The equity of that probably cannot be questioned.  What about the equity in regard to those 20 families?  There is no use in saying that no demand was made that they should be considered. I can quote for the Minister resolutions passed at meetings in the town, at which prominent and important people attended, and at which demands were made that those people should get consideration and compensation.  We were told by Deputy McGilligan during the debate on the Bill which has just been read a Second Time, the Electricity Supply (No. 2) Bill, that it was intended that a reserve fund should be set up which would at the end of a period possibly finance a second Shannon scheme&mdash;finance it at the expense of those people who have been deprived of their right to live because of the operation of the Shannon scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister set up a committee to inquire into this matter.  I never heard what they reported, or whether they reported at all.  I never heard how they made investigations.  I never heard whether they went to the spot to make investigations, or whom they <Col N="1723" /> asked for information on the spot if they did go.  It would be very interesting to see the report of that committee. It would be very interesting to see on what evidence they based that report, and from whom they got that evidence. I have never heard a word about the committee since it was set up.  I do not know whether or not the Minister has their report.  I have already stressed this matter in the Dáil.  I have spoken on this matter in the Dáil on several occasions and do not want to labour it now.  I do not want to tear open the old wounds of those people who have been practically denied the right to live.  I want to assure the Minister that I am as sincere in my protests on this matter as I was on anything I ever undertook.  Those people have been severely dealt with. Their right to live has been, to a great extent, taken away from them.  I would suggest to the Minister that he should give them further and more sympathetic consideration.  I find in Section 15 that control is given to the Electricity Supply Board in the appointment of its servants.  Why not introduce a clause to ensure that such people as are capable of being employed in whatever work is going on there will be employed and materially reduce the number of people who would be entitled to and seeking compensation but who could never take work at the present time because five or six years makes a big change in a man when he has reached a certain age?  Such a man would probably not be able to take up new employment, but why not give those men who are capable of taking the employment that is to be offered now a chance of working, by inserting a clause that will not alone enable, but, possibly, enforce, the employment of these people under the Electricity Supply Board?  I want the Minister to consider that and to consider it seriously.  I want to say definitely that up to the present, neither by the previous Government nor by the present Government, has this matter got the consideration it deserves, and I want the Minister to change all that now and to give these people the sympathetic and just consideration which they deserve and to <Col N="1724" /> restore to them their right to live which has been taken from them by the operation of the Shannon scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose it will be generally accepted that some such Bill as this was necessary if the fishing on the Shannon was to be preserved and developed properly, but I do not think there will be any unanimity on the selection of the Electricity Supply Board as the body to control the fisheries.  The first question that will jump to the minds of those who are interested in fishing generally&mdash;I am not one of them, unfortunately&mdash;is in what particular manner has the Electricity Supply Board manifested its sympathy with fishing generally or its desire to improve fishing on the Shannon?  Deputy Keyes and other speakers made a reference to the number of fish in the tail race.  These fish&mdash;and there are thousands and, I might say, millions of fish in the tail race&mdash;have been there, as I think, Deputy Lynch said, for seven or eight years.  It is seven or eight years since the Shannon scheme was completed and since then the fish have been accumulating and dying and they are useless so far as general fishing in the Shannon is concerned.  The Electricity Supply Board has not at all concerned itself with any definite method of getting rid of this scandal.  A letter appeared in the Press lately from a very eminent citizen of another country who came on a visit to this country, describing this particular scandal and pointing out the injury it did to fishing generally.  He is probably more expert than I am, but even if the ordinary man or woman who knows nothing whatever about fishing will take a walk, as Deputy Keyes said, to the banks of the Electricity Supply Board works and sees this particular scandal, it will at once prove that this body would not jump to one's mind as the ideal controlling body in this particular respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said that the Bill might be necessary but to me it appears to be a rather confusing document.  I believe the object is to acquire all the fisheries but whether that is to be done compulsorily or not I do not know.  So far as I can read the Bill, there is to <Col N="1725" /> be no compulsory acquisition of any fishery rights but there is to be compensation for holders of fisheries who may think they have been injured and apply for compensation.  If the Bill is going to be a success, which I hope its originators expect it to be and the fisheries on the Shannon are improved and developed, there is going to be a profit, if you like, from those fisheries to this body.  What particular desire will any owner of a fishery have to apply for compensation if he knows that the river is going to be improved out of all recognition?  If the fisheries are going to be made more valuable, is he not going to stick on to what he has?  I do not see how the Bill is going to provide for the transfer of fishery rights because there is no compulsory acquisition clause in the Bill.  There is a clause setting out that where a person applies for compensation, it will be obligatory on the Minister or the Electricity Supply Board to acquire the fishery instead of giving compensation.  That can only be done when application for compensation is made.</P>
    <P>That brings me to another point. There is one set of owners who differ from the rest of the fishermen.  They are not individual owners.  They are the Abbey fishermen Deputy Keyes spoke about and they are peculiarly situated.  They are more, perhaps, what one might call a corporate body than anything else.  They are a group of fishermen, who, for a century, or two centuries, have had certain net fishing rights on the Shannon.  Some years ago they acquired, permanently and legally, the fishing rights of individual owners on one side of the river. I am not sure if they did not acquire the rights on both sides, but they are now the actual owners in law of parts of that river.  Their particular fishery is in a part of the river where it cannot interfere with any of the electricity works.  It is above the power scheme and below the intake&mdash;a part of the river which will not interfere with the further development of electricity supply work.  Their position under this Bill is rather peculiar. As I said, I do not believe they can <Col N="1726" /> be acquired.  I do not think there is any power in this Bill compulsorily to acquire them, but they are in a position in which the Minister, in effect, says: &ldquo;We cannot acquire you, but we will make it impossible for you to fish.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I apologise to the Minister.  There does appear to be a power to acquire them, but why that section was not set out in its proper place before the compensation sections, and why it should have been put in a small sub-section where it escaped my attention, I do not know.  These fishermen differ altogether from the ordinary owners of fishery rights who may be taken over by the Electricity Supply Board inasmuch as they are not rod fishermen.  They are possibly the only body, although there may be others, with the distinct right of net fishing in the non-tidal waters of the Shannon and they have had these rights for a couple of hundred years. I do not know how many men are involved, but I am told that there are at least 250 to 300 people dependent on them.  I do not know how far compensation would help in the matter.  I do not believe it would be any great help because one cannot provide much assistance in a matter of this kind.  That brings me to another point which Deputy Hogan rather developed&mdash;the absence of any provision in this Bill for the under-dog, and by the under-dog I mean the man, apart from the owner of a fishery, who has existed by fishing on the Shannon and who exists primarily as a labouring man or working fisherman.  If there is going to be any injury done to any rights on the Shannon it is proper that compensation should be payable, but if the injury extends to the mere working fishermen who have made it the business of their lives to earn their living by this kind of work, it seems to me only fair that, just as <Col N="1727" /> the bigger individuals in the social sphere, if you like, should be compensated, these men also deserve some mention in a Bill like this.</P>
      <P>They are men who, for years, have been engaged in no other occupation. In fact, they are unfitted for any other occupation. Most of them could not turn their hands to any alternative means of earning a living.  I should like to see some provision made either for a continuity of their employment, as Deputy Hogan suggested, or some compensation in lieu of employment. I should like to see that provision made directly in the Bill, making it obligatory on the people who are being compensated for the fishing rights themselves to compensate the men whom they employed. Otherwise, the lot of a certain number of these men will be a very hard one.  The main difficulty, I think, will be about the particular case that I mentioned of the Abbey fishermen.  I do not see how that is going to be settled under this Bill. From my information, compensation will not be any real solution as far as benefiting these men is concerned. Their situation is much the same, except that they are joint owners, as that of the working fishermen to whom I have referred.  These are owners in name, but in reality as far as their particular case is concerned they are mainly working fishermen.  They pool their resources, and what they make as a composite body is divided between them.  No compensation will adequately provide for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to see, if possible, some clause exempting them from the operation of this Bill.  When the 1842 Act was going through the Parliament of another country these particular people were expressly exempted from its provisions.  Their right to net-fishing in the non-tidal waters of the River Shannon was preserved to them under that particular Act, and has continued ever since. Under this Bill, for the first time, if my reading of Section 22 is correct, that particular right is being taken from them.  Deputy Keyes said that <Col N="1728" /> there was a great difference of opinion locally in Limerick and elsewhere as to the meaning of Section 22.  Like Deputy Fionán Lynch I take it that it means that the right of net-fishing in tidal waters is to be discontinued for everybody.  There is, however, a difference of opinion on that particular point.  No two people that you meet in the City of Limerick at the moment will express the same opinion as to its meaning.  I have met 15 or 20 people and discussed it with them, and no two of them hold the same opinion with regard to its meaning.  I think it would be only fair if the Minister would enlighten the House as to what its true interpretation is.  As far as I can see it means that the right of net-fishing will not be given to anybody hereafter, so that the position of the Abbey fishermen will be that they will possibly have to fall back on another section of the Bill and be compelled to seek compensation which they do not wish.  What they ask is that the right given to them in other Acts, a right that has been preserved to them during centuries, should be continued: that a body of men situated as they are, practical working fishermen sustaining a body of 250 or 300 people, should be allowed to follow their present method of making a livelihood and to fish as they have hitherto fished without doing any damage to the Electricity Supply Board works.</P>
    <P>I conclude as I began.  While personally I think that a unified control of the whole fisheries of the river Shannon is desirable, it appears to me that some body other than the Electricity Supply Board, some body interested in fishing, with a knowledge of fishing, some body that had proved its desire to help the fisheries generally might have been appointed as the controlling body.  The Electricity Supply Board is thoroughly competent in another way. Its primary interest must be the huge electric scheme and works on the Shannon. That body has proved during the last seven or eight years that its interest in fishing, if it has any interest, is very little, and that it has stood by and allowed a scandal, such as we have <Col N="1729" /> had referred to appear in a particular lock in Limerick.</P>

      <P>It appears that there is general agreement on the main principles of this Bill.  Most people appear to recognise that it is necessary to take some steps to obtain unification of the control of the fisheries on the Shannon, in order to secure their preservation and development.  Doubts have been raised as to whether the Electricity Supply Board is the best possible body to which to give that control, and as to the necessity for including the whole of the river within the scope of these activities.  I think that these doubts, when expressed, merely indicate that the Deputies concerned have not given the matter the full consideration it might have received.  There is no alternative to the Electricity Supply Board.  It is the body which has got very intimate associations with the Shannon, associations of such a nature <Col N="1730" /> as would be bound to bring it into conflict with any other body given control of fisheries.  On the other hand it can secure competent people to look after these fisheries.  It has amongst its membership at the present time at least one person who has had very intimate associations with the Shannon fisheries for a long time.  Its whole administrative machinery is available to ensure that it will be able to undertake its new task, in relation to the River Shannon, in such a manner as to enable it to get the best possible results from the development of the fisheries, without allowing the development of its plans to be of such a nature as to interfere with the primary function of the Board in generating electricity.  It will be necessary, of course, for the Board to expend substantial sums of money on the development of the fisheries and on their protection. In fact the whole case for taking over these fisheries, and handing them over to any Board, is to enable that expenditure to be undertaken. It is quite obvious that expenditure cannot be undertaken unless the whole of the fisheries are in the control of the body embarking upon the expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If, as Deputy Keyes suggests, we were to allow the fishermen in the estuary to remain as they are, not subject to acquisition, it would be quite possible that they would get, and not the Board, the whole of the benefit coming from the Board's expenditure.  The same applies with regard to the Abbey fishermen. The position is that it is almost impossible to contemplate the adoption of any scheme in relation to the Shannon that does not include acquisition of the various fishing rights of the Abbey fishermen.  What is the alternative?  Are we to abandon the whole idea of trying to organise and to develop the resources of the Shannon fisheries because of the trouble of acquiring the interests of that group?  Are we to throw away what may be proved to be a very valuable national asset because it happens to be politically inconvenient or is in some other way not a task to be undertaken?  What can we do?  In so <Col N="1731" /> far as they have fishing rights on the Shannon we propose to give them full and adequate compensation up to 100 per cent.  We are told that compensation is no remedy.  What is the remedy?  If anything apart from compensation, can be done, we are prepared to do it.  It is quite possible that the Electricity Supply Board, will require to recruit men in order to carry out its functions in relation to the Shannon fisheries.  I think I can promise for them, without any qualification, that they will give preference to suitable men who are being deprived of regular occupation in consequence of the operation of this measure.</P>
    <P>In that connection I want to make some reference to the statement made by Deputy Hogan concerning the Killaloe fishermen, who have been under discussion for many years.  I would like to assure him first that I take this matter just as seriously as he does.  I arranged to have a very full investigation carried out into the circumstances of persons in respect of whom claims were made. The whole matter was considered carefully by an Inter-Departmental Committee, and their report was that no basis of compensation could be devised that would be of such a nature as to include the Killaloe fishermen and to exclude anybody else.  In fact, in order to provide a statutory right of compensation for these people you would have to include a very large number of other persons. In any case we contest the statement that these people are being deprived of a livelihood in consequence of the operation of the Shannon scheme.  The investigation of circumstances which I carried out showed that in respect of some of those on whose behalf claims were made&mdash;I suppose the total claims came to 20 or 22&mdash;we could get no real evidence that they ever earned anything out of or had been employed on the Killaloe waters.  Three or four were pensioners of one kind or another, one was an ex-member of the R.I.C., another had a British Army pension, and some had other pensions or were in comfortable circumstances. We were unable to trace others, and <Col N="1732" /> some had emigrated.  One was the owner of a farm and certain of the others were employed.  Some had only been employed temporarily in the dapping season, and others temporarily during rush periods.  In fact, the number of <i>bona fide</i> claims that could be sustained were reduced to two, one of whom is at present employed, and the other was receiving some allowance from a former employer who had been compensated for destruction of fisheries.</P>
    <P>In connection with these men I feel that if we could make provision for them, now that the Electricity Supply Board will be requiring certain staffs to look after the fisheries, by securing their employment, it will be much more satisfactory than trying to devise some basis of compensation. The only difficulty which might arise is the age of these people.  Deputy Bennett and others raised a question as to whether there was any doubt about compensating owners for damage done to fisheries or of acquiring these fisheries.  It is necessary to take power to compensate in certain cases that may arise&mdash;for instance, the rod fisheries, but in the majority of cases the policy will be one of acquisition, and not one of compensating. I do not want to go into a discussion about the tail-race at Ardnacrusha, or whether it is true or not that salmon are going there and dying.  I cannot claim to have expert knowledge of the subject.  I am solely dependent on the information supplied by experts, and that seems to indicate that the information Deputies have got cannot or may not be correct.  In fact, it has been contended that the existence of the tail-race has saved the salmon fisheries, that if the fish did not get in they would get into deep pools where the Abbey fishermen are netting and that none would get beyond that.  These are points upon which I can offer no conclusive opinion, but the position is being investigated.  I am quite satisfied we will get no satisfactory measures taken in order to protect the salmon unless and until we have had the control of the fisheries handed over to the Electricity Supply Board. <Col N="1733" /> Under the Bill it may be necessary to expend substantial sums for stocking, and it is quite possible that that expenditure would be nullified if the netting of the fish in the portion of the Abbey River was allowed to continue.</P>
    <P>I think these are the principal matters that have been raised.  Any other details that were mentioned can be discussed more satisfactorily on the Committee Stage.  The principle of the Bill is to take over the fisheries of the Shannon, hand them over to the control of the Electricity Supply Board and charge that body with their preservation and development in future as the best method of dealing with a situation that is not altogether satisfactory. I do not want to be misunderstood in my remarks concerning the effect of the Shannon scheme on the fisheries.  Deputy Lynch and Deputy McGilligan interpreted me as saying that the position in respect to the fisheries was good.  My information is that the number of fish entering the river showed no diminution but, on the contrary, showed an increase over previous years and that that was to be regarded as satisfactory having regard to the fears expressed as to the effect of the construction and operation of the works and the shortage of water upon the future of the fisheries.  In fact, various people, speaking with authority, said that the salmon fisheries on the Shannon would almost inevitably be destroyed.  There has been no indication that that is so yet and, although as I have said, it is much too early to come to any conclusion on that matter, the reports for this year from the purely technical point of view appear to be quite satisfactory. It does not follow that the situation has proved a profit to the local fishermen or anything of that kind.  There may be a situation in respect to the tail-race or for some other reason which is preventing that. That is something which has got to be rectified by some device which only experts can devise.</P>

      <P>The Department of Agriculture have been experimenting with travelling creameries.  The Department believe that for the future it will be very useful to have a travelling creamery to cover districts which they want to test for milk supplies.  Hitherto if the Department wanted to test out the supply of milk which was really available in any particular district, they had to build a creamery and if after the erection of the creamery and the expenditure of a lot of money on it, it was found that there was a shortage of supply, the creamery failed, with great loss to the guarantors, the shareholders and everybody concerned.  This Bill will enable the Department of Agriculture to put these travelling creameries on the road in scattered districts in which the people claim that they have a sufficient supply of milk to maintain an ordinary creamery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Dairy Produce Act of 1924, no provision was made for the licensing of a travelling creamery. Everything in that Act, the licences and the different regulations, related to premises.  It was held by legal people that &ldquo;premises&rdquo; does not include a creamery travelling on wheels.  It is, therefore, necessary to amend the Act of 1924 so that the Minister may, in future, be able to license a travelling creamery.  The first seven sections of this Bill deal with the Act of 1924 so that the travelling creameries may be established and they extend the provisions as to licences and inspection of creameries and also the revocation of licences where the travelling creamery is found to be kept in a bad way and is producing bad stuff.  Section 8 deals with a different matter altogether.  In the 1924 Act and in two amending Acts since&mdash;those of 1928 and 1931&mdash; power was taken by the Minister for Agriculture to allow Ballycanew Creamery, in County Wexford, to deal with cream which was separated in the farmers' own homes.  It is the only creamery in the Saorstát to which this provision applies.  It was found <Col N="1735" /> necessary to make that exception in 1924 and again in 1928 and 1931.  This Bill also proposes to give a further licence to this creamery to take cream separated in the farmers' homes until March, 1937.</P>

      <P>Of course we take it that this Bill is necessary to meet developments in the creamery business. It would be interesting to know from the Minister if the Department is satisfied with the success of the travelling creamery.  The country generally would be interested to know if this development of the creamery business will lessen the cost of transport and the cost of production, especially in districts where there is not a large supply of milk.  I should like to hear from the Minister what is the capacity of the travelling creamery, how many gallons of milk it will be able to deal with on its rounds, and if a plan is contemplated to have sub-centres or small centres on the route of the travelling creamery at cross-roads or at suitable intervals in its passage at which it will meet certain suppliers, or whether it will go from yard to yard.  I think it would be information to the House if we had a little more explanation of the manner in which it deals with the milk.  Otherwise, there is nothing in the Bill which calls for comment.  The Bill is absolutely necessary to meet this new development, and as the Minister has stated, a travelling creamery was not, in the opinion of lawyers, a creamery premises within the meaning of the original Act.</P>

What is their capacity for dealing with the work?  Do they operate in more than one centre and if so, how many centres do they operate in each morning?  I would like to know what generally are their functions?  I know, of course, one of their functions is to travel around and separate milk. But I would like to know how much they do; whether they cover a certain distance, and to get some information <Col N="1736" /> as to their work generally.  I understand this Bill is only necessary in order to give legal sanction to these creameries to operate at all.  I would like to get more details in connection with their capacity.  I do not believe they can ever take the place of creameries generally, realising as I do the amount of work any of these auxiliary creameries get through.</P>

If the individual is allowed to carry on for a while is it contemplated that the co-operative creameries should be compelled to establish these travelling creameries?</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>No; but we will get the information on the Committee Stage.  I am informed by the Department that a travelling creamery is not an economic proposition.  It will be operated to discover whether there is a supply of milk forthcoming in certain districts. The only way to find that out is to send a travelling creamery round. Before a creamery is established there are all sorts of wild promises that farmers will supply 3,000 or 4,000 gallons a day.  A creamery is then established and they find they cannot get 500 gallons.  We want to see if the market is there so that a permanent creamery can be erected in the district. The answer to Deputy Belton is, therefore, that a travelling creamery is not contemplated as an economic proposition, as against a stationery creamery, or that it can compete in cheapness of production.  Deputy Goulding need not fear that anyone is going to jump into <Col N="1737" /> starting these creameries because they will not pay as well as stationary creameries.  A travelling creamery could not possibly separate every man's milk in his yard.  One has been operating, I understand, for some time in Kerry.  They haul off for two or three months; the farmers bring their milk, it is separated and the travelling creamery takes the cream to its destination.  I do not know what range a travelling creamery has, or how many gallons it is able to operate in the day. All these details will be supplied in Committee.</P>

      <P>I think from the Minister's concluding statement that these creameries are to be used in a kind of prospecting operation to see if a steady supply of milk would be found in a particular district.  It is never contemplated that they would act instead of regular creameries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardCurran" hpid="Mr. Curran Mr. Curran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand these travelling creameries are not economic, and cannot compete with the ordinary creameries.  If that is so some steps should be taken to see that the suppliers do not bear the whole cost of manufacture, so to speak, because if they did, it would not be a fair test as to whether a creamery would be advisable in a certain district or not. It is well known that the cost of production is fairly considerable in connection with creameries.  If there is a travelling creamery it is much more expensive than an ordinary creamery, and it would not be a fair test as to whether a creamery would be suitable and would get the supplies necessary for its establishment unless the State would bear some cost of the production while the experiment is being carried out.</P>

      <P>This is a Bill to amend, and extend, the Creamery Act, 1928.  That was an Act which reorganised the whole of the creamery industry, and prevented people from operating new creameries except under licence.  Section 2 gives power to the Minister to license a travelling creamery.  That is necessary in consequence of the last Bill. Section 3 enables the Minister to prohibit the supply of milk to illegal creameries.  As the law stands, even though the Department knows that milk is being supplied to an illegal creamery, they cannot take steps to deal with the offenders.  In some cases they cannot discover who is the owner of the premises.  No one will take responsibility for the premises.  This Bill will enable the Minister to take action against a person who supplies milk to an illegal creamery, or a person who operated it.  Under Section 4, if the owner is discovered, notice, in the form of a summons, can be nailed upon the door.  If anyone turns up, in any court, in answer to that summons, the judge can make an order involving the forfeiture and seizure of the plant and utensils on the premises.  If anybody turns up in court in answer to the summons which has been issued to the unknown person who owns the creamery, the court can amend the order, substituting the name of the person who admits ownership. Section 5 deals with the control and use of milk products and by-products. Under the original Act, nobody could operate a creamery for the manufacture of butter unless he got a licence from the Minister.  It is proposed under this section to provide that any person who wants to operate a factory which uses products or by-products of milk will also have to get a licence. If he has not such a licence, the Minister may close the factory down. That is necessary for several reasons. <Col N="1739" /> Milk is being used in modern times not only for the manufacture of butter but for a lot of other things.  It has always been used for the manufacture of cheese, and the Minister wants to control the production of cheese in the same way as the production of butter is controlled.  Casein can also be made out of milk, and the Minister wants to control the production of casein. At the moment, he has power to control the production of butter.</P>

      <P>Under Section 3, I understood the Minister to say that illegal creameries were operating.  I should like to know how many of these creameries there are and where they are situate.  I thought that, under previous legislation, there was ample power to deal with the whole creamery situation.  In part of my constituency there has been a great deal of dissatisfaction with the legislation passed by the last Government with regard to the creameries.  I hope that this Bill is not intended to intensify the hardships then caused.  Under Section 5, I take it that it is the intention to grant only licences for the making of by-products such as cheese.  We all know one creamery which has developed that line to a considerable extent.  Is it the intention of this Bill to limit the power of any other creamery which might care to develop along those lines?  Is the section intended to prevent anybody else from developing a product which might already be developed by another creamery?  We know that there are other by-products, such as dried milk, manufactured by creameries.  I should like the Minister to say if it is the intention of this section to prevent development on these lines by any other creamery.</P>

This section is brought forward at the instance of those interested in the welfare of the existing creameries.  After a creamery has been established at a great deal of expense to the local farmers and to the State, it is necessary that the supplies of milk in that district should go into that creamery in order to keep it alive.  The Deputy knows that if a creamery into which a fair supply of milk is going is deserted by a number of farmers, it is threatened with collapse if it was on the border-line previously.  A strong, prosperous creamery is very much weakened if people on the outskirts go out&mdash;&mdash;</P>

This is going on on a sufficiently large scale to cause uneasiness to those interested in the permanence of the existing creameries and in their prosperity.  The question was also raised on Section 5 whether this applies to cheese as a product which people cannot engage in the manufacture of without a licence.  The section reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The Minister may by order declare that this section shall apply to any specified description of business which consists wholly or substantially of the working, finishing, or otherwise making available for sale of any specified milk product or by-product....</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That includes the process of making cheese.  It would also include casein and dry milk.  It is the Minister's <Col N="1742" /> intention, if there is a sufficient supply of a certain article made from milk or from a milk by-product, that he is not going to allow people who have the initiative to start that to be burst up by undue competition.</P>

I know the dissatisfaction which exists even to this day in my constituency owing to legislation passed by the previous Government and I am not prepared to subscribe to legislation now which seems to me to tend somewhat in the same direction.  As to the so-called illegal creameries, I would want to know their supplies, the distance they are from another creamery, and such information as that, because it is inconceivable to me that it is anything like what Deputy Belton said, that a few farmers come together and separate their milk and make butter.  I am of the opinion that these are fairly large creameries. I may be wrong in that, but I have that idea.  Probably at some future time I may be able to get the information for which I am looking.  I was certainly very slow to subscribe to the legislation passed by the Cumann na nGaedheal Government, under which farmers were made to suffer desperate hardships, such as £3 a cow and so on, and to this day they are grumbling about it.  I am not prepared to put that hardship again on the farmers without having more information than has been made available by the Minister in connection with Section 3.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;  Co-operative societies registered under the Industrial and Provident Societies Act of 1893 are debarred from issuing debentures unless such debentures are registered as bills of sale.  The issue of debentures under the Bills of Sale Acts is generally looked upon as tantamount to insolvency or to approaching liquidation, and the credit of the co-operative societies is immediately affected whenever they attempt to issue debentures under the Bills of Sale Acts.  Consequently, societies whose share capital is insufficient are obliged to borrow mainly from joint stock banks such additional capital as they may require. Where the additional funds are borrowed from the society's bankers the banks almost invariably require a joint and several letter of guarantee to be entered into by certain of the society's members.  From the point of view of the co-operative society the joint and several form of guarantee is open to serious objection.  It deters more or less wealthy individuals from becoming members lest they should be asked to become guarantors, and it places upon the shoulders of a comparatively small number of public-spirited men a burden which should be borne by the entire body of members.  Generally speaking, the guarantors are members of the society's committee of management and remain in office for an indefinite time whether well or ill-qualified for the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When a society is compelled to borrow capital for objects which are designed to benefit its members as a whole, it is quite unreasonable that a few individuals should be called upon to guarantee its repayment. The additional funds are needed by the community forming the society, and the responsibility should be borne equitably by the whole community and spread over them in just proportion. As the law stands, there is no such power inherent in any society. <Col N="1744" /> That power is urgently needed and can be granted by means of this very brief and, it is believed, non-controversial measure.  It will give to co-operative societies the power to create, by debentures, a security charging all their assets &mdash; their premises and plant, their book-debts, their stocks in trade and their uncalled share capital.  As the law stands, such a debenture would have to be registered as a bill of sale, and such a step would result in a collapse of whatever credit that society might have hitherto enjoyed.  The effect of such a contingency need not be stressed, for everybody knows that the bill of sale places an immovable estoppel on the credit of the concern which is obliged to give it.</P>
    <P>It is not proposed that power to issue debentures should be granted to all societies, but only to those which may be approved by the Minister for Agriculture.  It is anticipated that the provisions of the Bill will very much facilitate the trading and business of agricultural co-operative societies, and will be welcomed by bodies such as the Agricultural Credit Corporation and banks.</P>
    <P>The object of Section 6 of the Bill is to give co-operative agricultural societies legal power to obtain advances from the Agricultural Credit Corporation and other bodies on the security of the society's uncalled share capital.  It is necessary, as is done in Section 7, to make this provision retrospective, as certain loans have been already given by the Agricultural Credit Corporation to some co-operative agricultural societies on the understanding that the uncalled capital would be regarded as security for the repayment of these loans.</P>
    <P>The law relating to co-operative societies requires radical revision in several respects and it is intended, as soon as practicable, to introduce a comprehensive measure dealing with the situation as a whole.  The present measure is intended simply as a means of meeting, in the meantime, a particular requirement for which there is urgent need.  Most members who are interested in co-operation know that for a number of years a <Col N="1745" /> Bill has been drafted in the Department of Agriculture dealing with the whole question of co-operation.  This Bill, however, is merely introduced to deal with an immediate problem and it is hoped that it will get an easy passage.  It is necessary, in order that a number of societies may raise funds, to give them the means of doing so by giving as a guarantee for repayment the uncalled share capital, instead of having to give debentures under the Bills of Sale Acts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not going to oppose this Bill.  The Minister, at the conclusion of his remarks, said the Bill is necessary to solve an immediate problem.  He did not say what that immediate problem is.  He said that as the law now stands co-operative societies only raise money by a bill of sale and, of course, that damages credit.  The Minister has in the Bill the bodies to whom those debentures would be offered.  Of course it is a case of offering debentures in all cases to Government institutions or departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will be an abler man than the ordinary man if he can camouflage this S.O.S. on behalf of co-operative societies and pull wool across the eyes of the banks.  If a co-operative society is in difficulties and the shares are not fully subscribed, to issue debentures while the share capital is not all called in, to issue them on the strength of the share capital, is very suspicious.  It would suggest to a banker that the people who originally joined in the co-operative society were either not able or else unwilling to pay up the full share capital and, in order not to disclose that fact, they go to the banks.  According to the Bill the following persons shall be authorised lenders for the purposes of the measure &mdash;Any Minister, head of a Department of State, the Commissioners of Public Works, the Agricultural Credit Corporation, the Industrial Credit Corporation, the Dairy Disposals Company, any corporate body lawfully carrying on banking business and any <Col N="1746" /> other corporate body approved of by the Minister, either generally or in respect of a particular transaction. I do not see how that will improve the position.  I have no association with co-operative societies; I do not know the position and, therefore, I cannot say whether there is or there is not a problem in connection with getting money.  The Minister said there is a problem and I accept his statement, but I do not know that this will relieve whatever problem exists.</P>
      <P>I quite agree with the observation of the Minister that this practice of certain members of co-operative societies having to go security for a society led in the past to a lot of public-spirited people suffering great loss, which did irreparable damage to the co-operative movement.  I wonder has the Agricultural Credit Corporation made advances to such societies that cannot be recovered now?  My reading of this Bill is that those debentures can be issued; Departments of State can buy them up and any money due to the Agricultural Credit Corporation on the security of the unsubscribed capital can be collared.  Those debentures or the money buying them can be collared by the Agricultural Credit Corporation or any other body to which the society may owe money.  It might be a way of recovering a bad debt at, perhaps, the expense of the State&mdash;in other words, saving the faces of people who were entrusted with money and did not exercise ordinary prudence in advancing that money; saving their faces in a roundabout way by now bringing in the State and the taxpayer to recoup the losses that have accrued to those societies through the inefficiency of those in whose charge the moneys were placed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At this stage of the Bill we cannot get to close quarters, but I have no doubt all these matters will come up on the Committee Stage.  We are not going to oppose the Bill.  We merely offer criticisms founded on suspicion. The law is that a co-operative society has nothing with which to raise the wind except a bill of sale and that is a bad financial test.  There is a suspicion attaching to it and there is a loss of <Col N="1747" /> credit.  I do not think that bad test will be altered by calling it a debenture instead of a bill of sale.  It is, however, a sign that the society is not financially sound and what would happen in the case of a bill of sale, namely, loss of credit, will happen equally when debentures are issued. I offer those criticisms merely on suspicion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another aspect of this Bill to which I would like to call the Minister's attention. I am not at all sure that the Government may not find that they are taking away with one hand what they are giving with the other.  I see, according to Section 4, that an Agricultural Co-operative Society, which is authorised by its rules to borrow money, may at any time, with such consent of the Minister as is mentioned in the Act, and whether the issue of debentures is or is not authorised, or is not forbidden by the rules of the society, issue debentures to any authorised lender for the purpose of securing the repayment, with or without interest of any capital sum of money lent to such society, and so on.  That would be looked upon as an extraordinary procedure for any company.  I would like to ask the Minister what would be the effect on ordinary creditors of all credit corporations to find that debentures may at any moment be put in ahead of them and their assets seized, because that is what it amounts to.  It is confiscation of the ordinary creditor's goods.  Does the Minister think that is not going to have an effect on the credit of all agricultural co-operative societies?  The position is that, at one fell swoop, an agricultural credit co-operative society may find its entire assets taken over by one of the bodies mentioned here in the Bill.  I should like to suggest to the Minister that that is not doing as you would be done by in relation to the ordinary trade creditors and is not going to improve the position of co-operative societies as a whole.  I should like to ask the Minister what portion of an agricultural co-operative <Col N="1748" /> society's debts is due to ordinary trade creditors and what effect this Bill is going to have on their outlook in giving present credit to those societies or giving them credit in the future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCurran" hpid="Mr. Curran Mr. Curran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
      <P>The object of this Bill is simply to give authority to co-operative societies to issue debentures. As one who has been associated with a co-operative society for not so very long, I think that the worst thing that could happen co-operative societies is to issue debentures.  With regard to the society with which I am concerned, if the money which they owed, or borrowed, rather, was in the nature of debentures, that society would not exist to-day because debentures can press for their money and sell out a society.  Now, is not that a bad way? To my mind it is.  I understand the position.  I am sure that the principle of the Bill is to give capital to co-operative societies.  It would be much better if the Agricultural Credit Corporation or some State institution took on the responsibility for that rather than issue debentures; that is, if co-operative societies need capital; and, as I say, the co-operative society that has a big overhead charge to be paid for money advanced is in a very precarious position and is not able to turn around and give to its customers the benefit that it ordinarily should.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was connected with a society which owed a considerable amount of money to the bank and the bank would not advance any more.  In my opinion, if the money they owed to the bank was in the shape of debentures they would probably close down the concern, but a new set of guarantors came into the breach, got some more capital advanced by the bank on Government representation, with the result that it is in a pretty fair and sound financial position at the present time.  I take the view that unless the co-operative society is able to turn around and put its finances on a fair and reasonable standing and not be driven to the extremity of issuing debentures, it is <Col N="1749" /> not in the position in which it ought to be, and the fact that a society has to issue debentures means that it can only do that when it is in a very precarious position.  For the life of me I cannot see how there would be any great response made to an appeal of that kind so far as co-operative societies are concerned, and I think that the functions which this Bill is supposed to perform could be performed in some better way than this, because I think it would be the duty of some Government institution, if co-operative societies need capital, to supply it to them rather than issue debentures.</P>
    <P>There is one section here which gives power to issue debentures against uncalled capital.  I simply cannot follow the principle at all that is underlying some sections of this Bill I think that, before a co-operative society issues debentures, they certainly would be much more entitled to call in the uncalled capital and if the society is driven to such a financial extremity as to be forced to issue debentures, then, as one who knows something about co-operative societies and their management even for the last couple of years, that society is in a very precarious position and the issue of debentures is not going to help them.  If you want to help co-operative or creamery societies the principal thing is to have the State step in if money is not available from the joint stock banks or somewhere else.  These debentures are not going to help them even in a small way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>I also wish to query the finance of this Bill.  I do not understand its meaning at all.  Is it in order to liquidate bad debts incurred by somebody that it is sought to raise debentures on the uncalled capital of an agricultural co-operative society?  Some of those societies are 30 and 40 years old and some of the names of the original subscribers are those of men who are dead long ago. Numbers of them are worthless.  The Minister, of course, by one remark he made, let the whole cat out of the bag&mdash;that these liabilities should be borne by the whole community.  That <Col N="1750" /> is the meaning of the Bill.  That is what is behind this Bill.  Let us not go out of this House to-night with gas-masks over our heads.  We are here undertaking a liability.  Bad debts have been incurred as a result of the bad management, incompetence and blundering of societies, and it is sought to impose that liability on the community.  I object to that.</P>

      <P>I know more about the farmers than the Deputy does.  We had enough about that last week.  The idea of issuing debentures on the uncalled capital of an agricultural co-operative society and calling it finance and that this House is asked to give its imprimatur to it is an outrage.  If the agricultural society is in a bad way there are different ways of coming to its aid, but not by imposing on the taxpayers&mdash; industrious men and competent men&mdash; the obligation to pay off bad debts incurred by men in a local area by issuing debentures on the uncalled capital of an agricultural society. This uncalled capital in many cases, we know, is not only worthless.  Is there going to be any enquiry as to the worth of this uncalled capital, whether the capital can be realised or not?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>Why not call it up, that is the test.  If the Agricultural Credit Corporation is going to advance public money to these people will they examine as to the genuineness of the uncalled capital, whether it is worth anything, and give that security to the general taxpayer that might be expected?  Will they have that power, or will they splash out the money on the security of the uncalled capital, perhaps in the case of a person who is dead for over 20 years and from whom the money cannot be recovered? To my mind, this is the greatest piece of hogwash that has ever been introduced here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do hope to impress upon the Minister the highly dangerous <Col N="1751" /> principle involved in Section 4 of this Bill, and for this reason that the committees of management of rural co-operative societies of the kind referred to here are not familiar at all with the principle underlying debenture issue. If the manager of a co-operative society approaches the committee and tells them that the financial position of the society is such that the uncalled capital must be called up, the average committee of farmers immediately gets a pretty fair idea of what the situation is.  They are on the <i>qui vive</i> and they will press for enquiries.  They will probably turn to the Department of Agriculture for assistance to help them to examine the financial standing of their own society and to help them, if possible, to revive it.  Such a suggestion on the part of the management of a creamery would immediately bring out all the keener sense of responsibility and a fuller realisation of the financial position in which they find themselves.  But if you make it possible to issue debentures and to charge them on the uncalled capital of the society, you may involve the unfortunate shareholders in a liability they never anticipated and one they never intended to undertake.  They have only subscribed 5/- in the £.  It is perfectly clear that they do remain liable for the remaining 15/- in the £, but if they are informed by their manager that a situation has arisen where they have to wind up, they will see clearly the position and pay up this 15/- and wind up the society and not go on throwing good money after bad.  But if the other scheme is possible they may transfer their right to call up the balance of the capital to &ldquo;the Agricultural Credit Corporation or to the Commissioners of Public Works or the Industrial Credit Company or the Dairy Disposals Company, Ltd., or any corporate body lawfully carrying on banking business or any other corporate body approved of by the Minister either generally or in respect of a particular transaction.&rdquo; While they are doing that they will be doing it without a realisation of the full significance of what they are doing. Perhaps in five, seven or ten years <Col N="1752" /> after they have done that, to their amazement, proceedings will be started against them to call up the uncalled capital, a thing which they really believed was not possible for anyone to do without their consent.</P>
      <P>I consider that this is a very dangerous thing to do.  The argument will be made that there is no obligation on them to issue debentures and that people should not embark upon issuing debentures without a realisation of what they were doing.  If we were dealing with companies or enterprises conducted by men who were in the habit of handling complicated transactions, that argument would not hold water.  But when dealing with men whose knowledge of finance is largely bounded by their own experience and their knowledge of business as transacted in shops, it is not reasonable to expect the same financial sagacity from them as one would expect from people who are in the habit of dealing with financial matters and to whom discussing and dealing with financial corporations is an everyday routine.  So much for the principle enshrined in Section 4 and the adjacent section.</P>
      <P>I urge strongly on the members of the Minister's Party that they are putting into the hands of agricultural co-operative societies in the country a weapon whereby far more injury than benefits will be done to the societies in these circumstances.  Section 7 is a section of the Bill, the significance of which I find it difficult to appreciate.</P>
      <P>Whenever the Minister is satisfied, on the application of the Agricultural Credit Corporation, Limited,&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  that money is owing to the said corporation by a society registered under the Industrial and Provident Societies Act, 1893, in respect of a loan made by the said corporation to such society before the passing of this Act, and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  that when such loan was so made there was an arrangement or understanding between the said corporation and such society that the amount of such loan and the interest thereon would be secured (in addition to any other security <Col N="1753" /> which may have been given) by a charge on the uncalled capital of such society, if and when such charge could lawfully be made, and</P>
    <P>(c)  that when such loan was made the rules of such society authorised the charging (whether generally or in favour of the said corporation) of the uncalled capital of such society.</P>
    <P>I do not understand why that section is introduced into this Bill at all. Because when an agricultural society got their loan from the Agricultural Credit Corporation they made their bargain.  They gave the Agricultural Credit Corporation certain rights as against them.  In consideration of that, they took the loan, and as far as I can see, if an agricultural co-operative society has borrowed some money from the Agricultural Credit Corporation and is unable to meet it, the ordinary process of debt recovery would entitle the Agricultural Credit Corporation to sue the society and get judgment, and if needs be to apply to the courts in the ordinary way for a winding-up order to wind up the company or society, to realise its assets and to apply those assets for the reduction of the debt.  They would then be entitled to go for the uncalled capital for whatever may be due.</P>
    <P>Mark the difference between that section and Section 4.  When a society borrows money in the circumstances <Col N="1754" /> obtaining under Section 7 they know what they are doing.  They borrow in the ordinary course of business and they know that if the sum borrowed is not available for repayment the place is liable to be wound up, that the society will be liable to liquidation and that the guarantors and the shareholders will be liable for any uncalled capital.  Under Section 4, they will be saddled with these debentures, a matter which is going to mislead them into entering into business with a responsibility far different to that which they would have if they had been really advised about their position. The Minister will tell us why Section 7 (1) is put in there at all. Why is it necessary by statute to give the Agricultural Credit Corporation or to give the Minister power to charge the balance of the debt against the uncalled capital?  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>
