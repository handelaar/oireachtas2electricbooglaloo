      <P>(1)  The proposal and selection for nomination for so much of the panel as shall be nominated by Dáil Eireann for the purpose of the next election of members to Seanad Eireann shall be conducted in accordance with the Seanad election resolution, 1931, passed by Dáil Eireann on the 21st October, 1931, modified as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a)  The time for selection shall be the period commencing at the time <Col N="2195" /> of the passing of this resolution and ending on the 1st day of October, 1934, and the expression &ldquo;time for selection&rdquo; shall be construed accordingly;</P>
    <P>(b)  Rules 11 to 15, inclusive, of the said resolution shall not apply, and in lieu thereof the following rule shall have effect, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>As soon as may be after the time for selection the returning officer shall cause to be sent to each Deputy, at the ordinary address, or to such other address as may be furnished by him, one voting paper and declaration of identity, and the rules in the Fourth Schedule to the Electoral Act, 1923, relating to postal voting and the forms prescribed therefor shall apply with the necessary modifications, and in particular the modification that the word &ldquo;agent&rdquo; where it occurs in the said Fourth Schedule shall mean a Deputy who may desire to be present and was either the proposer, seconder, or assentor to the nomination of a candidate.</P>

    <Title>Military Service Pensions Bill, 1934&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. Aiken) Minister for Defence (Mr. Aiken)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Aiken)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that this Bill be now read a Second Time.  The principle of this Bill is to provide service pensions for Volunteers who had active service in Easter Week or the Black and Tan war and who fought in the I.R.A. during the civil war.  The scale of pensions is the same as that granted to the officers and men who obtained pensions under the Military Service Pensions Act, 1924.  For a number of years the policy of Fianna Fáil was to abolish the Military Service Pensions Act, 1924.  Some time ago, however, representations were made to the Government pointing out that it would be unfair to withdraw the 1924 pensions.  Many arguments were put forward, which the Executive Council felt were just, and after careful consideration they decided that as all the other contracts made by the previous Government with the various <Col N="2197" /> sections of the community were being kept, the pensions awarded under the 1924 Act should be continued and at the same time immediate steps should be taken to secure that those who fought with the I.R.A. in the civil war should in future be given equal treatment.</P>
      <P>The terms and conditions both as regard the grant and the amount of pensions under this Bill to the members of the I.R.A. are the same as those provided for under the Military Service Pensions Act, 1924.  To qualify for a pension an applicant must show that he had military service subsequent to the 1st July, 1922, as well as service in Easter Week or throughout either of the periods 1st April, 1920, to the 31st March, 1921, or from the 1st April, 1921, to 11th July, 1921.  Applicants who secure a service certificate will be awarded a pension on the basis of their rank on the 11th July, 1921, or on the 1st July, 1922, whichever is the higher.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A difficulty arises in grading the ranks in the I.R.A. so as to make them comparable with the ranks of the standing army.  The I.R.A. was organised on a territorial basis, each parish or village had its company of Volunteers and each district its Battalion. These units were called companies or battalions in many parts of the country even though there were not sufficient men in a company to make a section or a half section in a standing army.  In the case of my old division there were a few companies which had only from 12 to 20 men each, while in other companies there were as many as 150 men.  In order to arrive at a grading which will make the ranks of the various units of the I.R.A. comparable one with another and with those of a standing army, it has been found necessary to incorporate the rules for the grading of ranks which will be found in the First Schedule to the Bill.  These rules ensure that a company officer will not be graded as captain unless there were 60 men or more in his company and that a battalion o/c will not be graded as commandant unless there were 300 men or more in his battalion.  It will be <Col N="2198" /> noted that the ranks are designated A, B, C, D, and E:</P>
    <P>Rank A.  corresponds to a rank higher than that of Major-General in the 1924 Act.</P>
    <P>Rank B. to Colonel or Major-General.</P>
    <P>Rank C. to Commandant or Major.</P>
    <P>Rank D. to Lieutenant or Captain.</P>
    <P>Rank E. to Private or Non-commissioned Officer.</P>
    <P>The rate of pension corresponds to the equivalent ranks under the 1924 Act.</P>
    <P>The duties performed under the 1924 Act by the Board of Assessors in the finding of rank and service will be performed under this Bill by a Referee, who will be assisted by a committee of four persons as set out in Clause 6 of the Bill and provision is made that the Referee will have power to compel attendance of witnesses and the production of documents.  The provision in the Military Service Pensions Act, 1925, as to the power of the Executive Council to revoke a military service pension granted under the 1924 Act has been incorporated in the Bill as regards pensions to be granted under the Bill (Clause 12).</P>
    <P>Clause 13, following a similar provision in the 1924 Act (Section 3 (6)), enables the Minister, both as regards pensions under the 1924 Act and under this Bill, to request the Reference to review a report on which the certificate and pension were based on the ground that evidence not available prior to the making of such report has since become available, and in accordance with the report of the Referee to withdraw or reduce any such pension that may be granted.  It may be taken that such request to the Referee to review cases of pensions already granted will not be made unless there is fairly strong evidence that there was fraud or misrepresentation.  It is estimated that the number of men who become entitled to pensions under this Bill is roughly twice the number who have already been awarded pensions under the 1924 Act.  The annual cost of the Bill will amount to £360,000.  It is impossible to give a close estimate of the probable cost, but I believe that <Col N="2199" /> £360,000 is an outside figure, and that the annual cost will be well under that amount.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>It is rather difficult to read this Bill, having regard to the way in which it is presented.  Whether that is part of the scheme or not it is hard to say just at the moment.  Some words are blurred over, and it is not as easy to make out the Bill as when the Bills were being printed.  One point which struck me in connection with the introduction of the measure was whether, in those few cases where people were late in making application for pensions under the 1924 Act, any provision has been made for including them within the scope of this Bill.  The Minister has referred to cases which had been heard or dealt with before, and to the fact that they may not be reopened, but these cases to which I refer, and there are not many of them, were not previously heard because the applications were late.  The Minister's estimate of the cost of this pension scheme is pretty extensive.  I do not know if I followed him very clearly, but I think he stated that service prior to July, 1921, and subsequent to June, 1922, was a condition precedent to securing a pension in these cases.  There must be continuous service, or, at any rate, service in both periods.  In that connection there were applications made by some of those who gave service in 1916, and who are in bad circumstances. Representations were made on their behalf, and I understood that an opportunity would be afforded by the introduction of this measure to deal with cases of that sort.  It would appear from some recent correspondence which I have seen in regard to the matter, that these people are in bad financial circumstances.  Their case has not been presented to me in anything like detailed form, but if a letter which I saw from them be true, some of those people are in an almost destitute state.  I should like to know if the Minister has received any representations on behalf of those people, and if any inquiries have been made into the circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I say, the sum of £360,000 appears <Col N="2200" /> to be a rather big figure.  On one occasion after 1916 it was freely rumoured in certain quarters that the numbers of those engaged in 1916 would by the end of 20 years have reached 100,000.  Some figures like that must have been in the Minister's mind when he estimated on expenditure of £360,000 per annum for these pensions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>No representations were made to me in regard to applicants who were late under the 1924 Act.  It may be that Deputy Cosgrave heard something about those.  If there were any late, surely they made representations to him during his eight years in office subsequent to the passing of the 1924 Act.  As regards the 1916 men, the principle of the 1924 Act was that an applicant was required to prove that he had had active service either in 1916 or in the Black and Tan war, plus service from the 1st July, 1922.  This Bill deals with the problem in a similar way.  It provides only for men who had active service in 1916 or in the Black and Tan war plus service after the 1st July, 1922.  Under the 1924 Act, a man might have had active service in 1916 but if that service were not carried on after 1st July, 1922, he got no pension. Neither will he get a pension under this Bill.  I think that the principle upon which the last Government went was that the man must have had continuous service, so that his ordinary mode of life was upset &mdash; that he must have devoted his time to military service for a long number of years before becoming entitled to a pension.  This Bill deals with the problem in the same way as the 1924 Act did.  We have tried in every way to follow the last Act and simply to extend the provision made for the 1924 pensioners to those who fought for the I.R.A. in 1922.</P>

      <P>The Minister attempts to define in this section his new flour. He ought to explain the difference between the new brand of flour and the <Col N="2202" /> old.  Could he tell the House how much below the ordinary standard of first-class flour this new flour will be even without the introduction of any foreign material such as oats, or dried milk? The milling process will not go so hard on wheat.  Therefore, there will be less expenditure on the manufacture of the flour.  More will be got out of the grain.  This matter of flour milling is technical, and I think that the House and the country should be in a position to understand the difference between the contemplated flour and the flour we have at present.  The flour we have at present is the best product milling science can get out of wheat.  What can be extracted from wheat to make first-class flour is evidently, not going to be extracted in the future, and, presumably, we are to be forced to eat more pollard and to be told that it is good for us, although progressive flour milling has gone beyond that stage long since.  Would the Minister tell us what exactly is the difference between the flour defined in the section and the flour that we have been accustomed to and that the world has been accustomed to?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister examined the full implications of that? Suppose that a man orders flour, and is supplied with an article that is not flour, a nice question, I suggest, will arise for decision as to whether this order will stand in a case where a prosecution is taken.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The point that the Deputy <Col N="2203" /> is raising does not appear to me to be of any substance.  An order will come into force, and from the date of that order nobody in this country will get anything but composite flour, so that I do not think it is necessary to put a label on it as the Deputy has suggested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Does not the Minister realise that an article may be sold which does not fulfil that particular description?  For instance, some flour will be in stock before the order comes in force.  That will require to be sold, and it will be sold under the description of &ldquo;flour&rdquo; as far as I can gather from my reading of Section 56. I admit that I read the section hastily. It is not easy to read Bills now in the form in which they are produced, but so far as I have read the Bill it does not appear that any description of composite flour will be attached to any wrapper or container, and there is nothing to indicate that it will be sold under that description.  The only terminology employed is &ldquo;flour.&rdquo;  The Minister's description of that is fulfilled so far as the virgin article is concerned, but as regards the admixture there is no corresponding description and no definition of it in the Bill.  Perhaps the Minister will consider that point before the Report Stage is taken.</P>

      <P>That point can be considered. I cannot understand the point Deputy Belton is raising.  In this Bill we are defining flour as &ldquo;the finely-reduced product of wheat obtained by sifting the ground endosperm of the wheat berry through a standard bolting cloth, not coarser than a No. 9 standard bolting cloth, the bran and pollard of the wheat having been removed by suitable milling process,&rdquo; so that we are actually compelling flour millers, for the first time, to remove bran and pollard if they are going to call it flour. Deputy Belton appears to think that the world has been enjoying the best possible product by getting flour from which the bran and pollard have been removed.  Therefore, from his point of view, we are going to give the people of this country, by law, the most perfect flour in the world.  As far as <Col N="2204" /> the definition goes there is no question whatever of reducing the standard of flour.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Presumably the Minister has read the application that was made to the Tariff Commission for a tariff on flour.  From the Report of the Tariff Commission it appeared that the article sold here was far superior to that sold in Great Britain; in fact, superior to the article sold in any other country.  I would like to know whether there has been any departure from that high standard of quality.  I have heard complaints recently of numerous people suffering from attacks of indigestion. I am anxious to know if these might be due to an alteration in the diet of the people.  Personally I do not think there could be so many complaints unless there had been some big change of the kind.  I would like to know if anything of the kind has happened. The complaints that I have heard may be due to the admixture scheme carried out under the Principal Act.  Prior to the passing of that Act it was admitted that the quality of the flour sold here was superior to that sold elsewhere.  I would like to know if there has been any departure from that standard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  There was nothing laid down in it about the amount of flour that must be got from the wheat. Until Deputy Cosgrave mentioned the matter I was not aware of any complaints about increased numbers of people suffering from indigestion.  If the number of such complaints has increased, then I think that must be due to overfeeding.  With regard to Deputy Belton's point, &ldquo;fineness&rdquo; is the only difference in the definition section as between the original one and this Bill.</P>

      <P>I would like to know from the Minister if the millers are satisfied with the quotas they have been allotted.  I am anxious to get information on this because it is provided <Col N="2205" /> in later sections that wherever the quota allotted is exceeded the penalties laid down are fairly severe. What I am anxious to know is if there has been agreement between the millers as to the quotas which they have received, and if there is general satisfaction with regard to the distribution of the quota?</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not think so.  I am not directly responsible for this part of the Act, but from what I know the preliminary quota allotted by the Minister for Industry and Commerce was not always to the satisfaction of the millers.  It was allotted on the basis of the capacity of the mill: so many sacks per hour.  Some of the millers certainly say that they could increase their output, and that they are not being allowed to do so.  The Minister had no power to vary the quota during the preliminary period, but feels that he should have that power.  Even if a miller was willing to have his quota varied there was no power to do that under the Principal Act.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister give the House a short description of the reason for this, because the sums in question reach a very high figure.  In one case there is 1,540 lbs., and a sum calculated at the rate of 30/- for every 400 lbs. of wheat.  That appears to be a very heavy tax.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a graded fine &mdash; not a tax.  Where the output of the mill is less than 3,000 barrels per annum, the fine is 3/- for every 400 pounds in excess of the output.  Then it is graded upwards.  Where it is more than 3,000 barrels and less than 4,000 barrels, it is 5/-.  Where it is more than 4,000 and less than 5,000, it is 10/-.  Where it is more than 5,000 and less than 6,000, it is 20/-.  Where it is more than 6,000, it is 30/-.  The bigger mills found it, I believe, to their advantage to over mill at certain periods, in order, first of all, to hold on to certain customers whom they wished to hold on to and, secondly, in order to compete in a rather unfair way against the smaller mills.  If a mill is turning out 16 sacks an hour, and they mill an extra sack, it makes a very big difference over a period, but the 3/- spread over the whole 17 sacks does not fall very heavily on a big mill, especially as a bigger mill may be able to work more economically than a smaller mill. Their economic advantage would be much more than that fine spread over their total output, so it was found necessary to make the levy much <Col N="2207" /> heavier on the bigger mills than on the smaller ones.</P>

There is no information in the section, as far as I could run through it, as to what the actual allotment of the quota would be in a case where a fine of that sort would operate. I take it that it is unlikely that a small mill would mill such an excessive amount that they would be liable for the fine.

It says &ldquo;there has, in the opinion of the appropriate Minister, been any contravention (whether by omission or commission) of this Act or any regulations made thereunder by persons registered in such register.&rdquo;  The Minister's work should be administrative.  If people are to be tried for commission or omission then that enters into the realm of judicial work, and even though it may have happened up to this, it is not a good thing to happen in legislation.  I suggest that the Minister should reconsider this part of the section.  He sees my point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>A person who may be brought up in the normal course can appear before the court and make representations.  Here it simply says, &ldquo;in the opinion of the Minister.&rdquo; Although I do not suggest that would be the intention of the administration in the section as drawn, no such opportunity may be afforded a person concerned. It would simply be said it had been reported that such and such had happened and in consequence registration is disallowed.  It is unwise to put it in that form.  Registration in these cases is a serious proposition.  There is a certain vested interest in registration. Certain departments might look upon an act of omission or commission of that sort very severely, when the fact is that in most cases the omission would be accidental.  There are commissions of offences perpetrated by employers, and in certain cases the employers are held responsible.  It would certainly appear to me, on reading the section, that it was rather a mistake to have a responsibility of that kind put upon the Minister.  To operate the procedure the Minister has in mind, he has to consider the opportunities to be given to persons of whom complaints have been made of omission or commission.  A man should not lose what is a vested interest except by the order of a judicial tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The object of amending the section in the Principal Act arose exactly on the point on which Deputy Cosgrave has been speaking when we had in sub-section (4) to deal with causes for which the Minister could remove a name from the register, usually misrepresentation, fraud, bankruptcy, or if the person registered had been committing an offence.  We found from experience in working the Act that some small millers absolutely defied the Department and the Minister.  They told us to go ahead and to take action, and that they were prepared to carry on pending such action.  Action is slow. It takes three, four or six months to carry out the necessary formalities, while there is also the possibility of appeal.  In the meantime these mills, even though in a small way, in certain <Col N="2211" /> circumstances, may make very big profits.  They go ahead and defy the Minister.  That was the position in two or three cases.  It was the mill owners approached my Department asking to have something like this done.  The mill owners' representatives have agreed upon this form.  If Deputies read sub-section (2) (a), (b) they will see there what can be regarded as sufficient safeguards, and that if a person asks for an inquiry the Minister must grant it and it must be public.</P>
      <P>(b)  the said Minister shall give to the person in relation to whom such inquiry is to be held notice of the time and place of the holding of such inquiry, and such person shall be entitled to appear at such inquiry by counsel or solicitor and to adduce evidence.</P>
      <P>As the section is drafted, the mill cannot be closed until the inquiry is held. Within seven days an enquiry can be asked for and a notice of appeal lodged. If notice of appeal is not lodged we may close the mill after a month, but we cannot cancel registration until the result of the inquiry is known.  I think there are sufficient safeguards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should consider the other matter, the power of withdrawing registration being exercised after the inquiry.  The Minister says that he can give notice that he is going to withdraw registration, and if there is objection from the miller he holds an inquiry.  If the report is favourable to the miller, then the cancellation is withdrawn.  I suggest that he should begin by holding the inquiry when he has received complaints of omission or commission.  If, as a result of the inquiry, after evidence being taken on oath, a recommendation is made to him to withdraw registration, there would not be very much objection.  There is always trouble about notices, and, out of three or four hundred cases, there might be one case of hardship, a man being away from home, or sick, or a combination of circumstances by which he just failed to keep within the period.  There may be a case of a mill owner not being in his right mind and being elsewhere at <Col N="2212" /> the time, so that if an inquiry were first held there would not be so much objection to the operation of the first part of the section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say that the Minister did not convince me on the last day when dealing with this matter that a man who grows wheat himself and gets it manufactured into flour for his own use is not entitled to the bounty.  He is in the same position as any ordinary citizen.  He can buy wheat or flour belonging to the man next door to him, and the man next door can buy his wheat or flour, as the case may be. The Minister's original policy was to give a bounty for wheat.  The fact that a person grows it for his own use should not, in my view, disqualify him from getting the advantage which his neighbour gets.  In the ordinary course of events, I take it the value of wheat grown by anybody in this country is about 17/- or 17/6; that would be a fair average price.  A man grows that for home use.  It is worth 25/-; otherwise there would not be a bounty of 7/6 given with it.  It appears strange that because he is going to use it in his own household he is disqualified from getting the miller to mill it for him.  There can be an exchange between neighbours, but some people would prefer to be able to say that all on their table <Col N="2214" /> was grown on the farm.  Take the case of three farmers.  One grows wheat for his own use, and does not get the 7/6. Another one sells his wheat to the miller on the understanding that the miller will sell it to his neighbour. The third man also sells it to the miller on the understanding that the miller will sell it to his neighbour. The result is that two of these farmers get the 7/6, while the third is denied it because he uses it in his own household. In essence, if farmers were to grow all the wheat they would require, then all the farmers would deprive themselves of the bounty which they would get in the normal course if they were to buy their neighbour's product.  I think the Minister ought to reconsider the section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>This has particular application to many cases in my constituency. There are farmers there who have always grown wheat for their own household, and who cannot afford to grow any substantial area of wheat. They are going to lose the bounty. They are small farmers who cannot afford to grow any wheat for sale. This section penalises them in the way stated by Deputy Cosgrave and I think it is highly unjust.  They have always grown wheat, and they will continue to do so.  They will be doing it under a penalty in comparison with their neighbours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears to me that there can be no logical case made for this section.  If, as Deputy Cosgrave said, certain benefits are to be given to growers of wheat it appears to me to be illogical that there should be a differentiation made between different growers.  It appears unfair that one particular citizen should be compelled to pay more for his food than another if he has a prejudice, if you like, in favour of home-grown food.  That is what the section amounts to.  If you refuse the bounty to a man because he grows the wheat he requires, and gets it milled by a miller, you are in fact making him use dearer flour than his neighbour because his neighbour can get that man's flour from the miller at a certain price, and also get the advantage of the bounty.  If you offer me a <Col N="2215" /> bounty for selling my own product, and that is used for general purposes in which I can share, I am getting the benefit of that bounty.  It comes off the cost of the article I consume.  So that the refusal of a bounty to a particular grower is adding to the cost of what he consumes at home.  There can be, as I say, no logical case made for this section.  Perhaps Deputy Cosgrave's way of putting it would be the more concise and clear.  If my neighbour is to be entitled to use my wheat and flour, and I get the bounty, why should I not be allowed to utilise it myself and get the bounty, or <i>vice versa?</i>  If my neighbour is debarred from using his own flour, and I use it, he can get the bounty.  Can any logical case be made for refusing the bounty to one of us?  I think the section ought to be withdrawn by the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we should look at this from the point of view of the consumers. I do not see why a farmer who produces wheat for his own use should get any benefit that a person in a town would not get.  If the farmer comes in and sells his wheat and gets the bounty and takes it back again, he really has his wheat back much cheaper than the person in the town who is consuming it would have it.  If the farmers are to get the benefit of the bounty for selling the wheat, there is no reason why they should get an advantage also over the ordinary consumer. We should look at it from that point of view.  They should be all treated equally.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Supposing I send 20 barrels of wheat and Deputy Bennett sends the same quantity, and I say that I do not want my own wheat because I would get no bounty.  I take two barrels of wheat Deputy Bennett has sent and he takes two barrels of mine. In that case the bounty is paid in full. I have no faith in this wheat business. I need not make any speech about that. The Minister knows that I have no <Col N="2216" /> faith in it.  I think it is a mistake, that it is not good business.  In a case of this kind, however, I think it is only fair that we should be just to all the persons concerned.  May I put it from the Minister's point of view?  He is interested in the growing of wheat and the turning of wheat into flour.  There is no better case for the sale of Irish wheat than from the grower back to the grower again, because he uses the whole lot.  If the desire is to grow more wheat, I take it the Minister's policy is to import as little as possible.  I take the other view.  I think it is wasting our time producing an article which can be produced for us at a much lower price and at less cost to us, and that we should employ our land and our time in growing and marketing an article that will bring us a greater profit.  However, we can leave that aside, as that is not the point in dispute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's policy is to grow all the wheat possible.  If all the farmers who grow wheat buy their own wheat they are in no different position from anybody else; in fact they are in a stronger position, because they are consuming more of the product that the Minister says ought to be produced in this country.  If there is a swop between neighbours, the bounty is paid without demur.  It so happens, however, that certain people would prefer that what they grow on their own farm should be consumed in the household. I take it that the sum involved would not be considerable in any case.  It is quite possible that in any one case 15/- would be about as much as would be involved.  Quite possibly there would not be more than 2,000 people involved; so that about £1,500 would be about the total.  On the bare justice of the matter, it is on the product itself that the bounty is to be paid.  It is for the production of it that the Minister is giving the bounty.  The bounty is not given to individuals unless they produce the article.  When the article is produced it ought to bear whatever bounty is given, no matter what its destination.  I take it that the Minister would be prepared to pay the bounty even on the export of wheat, because his desire is to get more <Col N="2217" /> wheat grown in the country.  If the desire be output, then there should be no limitation in respect to the uses or the destination of the article itself.</P>

A man will get it in respect of 19 barrels, but in the case of the barrel that goes back to himself he will not get it because the wheat is for his own use.  It costs him more to produce the wheat than he will sell it for; if not, then the 7/6 is absolute profit.  I take it the desire on the Minister's part would be to see the wheat of this country turned into flour and consumed in every farmer's household?</P>

      <P>Apparently it would be the popular thing for all Deputies to support the case made by the Opposition. If you examine the scheme we have here for regulating and controlling butter prices, the very same case could be made as that made by Deputy Cosgrave in connection with the wheat subsidy.  If you take the farmer who is producing milk and butter for his own use, he is getting no benefits from the scheme that was introduced here to help the producer of milk and butter. If you take the wheat producers to whom reference has been made, many of them are being subsidised by the local county committees.  They have been given subsidies indirectly in the way of seed supplies, and they have been asked to supply themselves and their families with food.  It surely cannot be contended that the owners and occupiers of land are only being asked to supply themselves and their families with food?  In the other case, you are asking farmers and producers to supply people who have not land and cannot have land.  I think in all fairness, while it may be a most popular thing to do, the Opposition cannot insist upon their line of argument. It is unfair to attempt to put both types of producers on the same footing.</P>

      <P>I am afraid Deputy Smith's comparison is not quite correct. The producers of butter get no benefits under the Act, but I do not like to go into that question at the moment.  In this case the Minister is attempting to popularise the growth and consumption of Irish wheat.  There could be no better advertisement for the Minister's campaign than this&mdash;that the farmers are so proud of their own wheat and flour that there is a demand <Col N="2219" /> from them to get back their own produce. If there were demands made on the millers by farmers to get back their own wheat in the form of flour, that <Col N="2220" /> would be the greatest proof the Minister could have of the success of the wheat-growing campaign.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To insert at the end of the section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(3)  Section 71 of the Principal Act is hereby amended in the following respects and shall be construed and have effect accordingly, that is to say&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is intended to give power to the Minister for Agriculture, in future, to fix by regulation the last date on which growers of wheat may register.  In the Principal Act passed in 1932 the date is fixed as the 30th April.  We found last year that growers applied for registration after the 30th April.  The result was that in the amending Act of last year we extended <Col N="2221" /> the period to the 30th September. Yet we had 400 or 500 growers applying later again.  We are now making a permanent change in the Act so that the Minister will be able to fix, by regulations, the latest date he chooses under the Act.  I think it should not be as late as last year, namely, December.  It would be very difficult to make a calculation as regards national percentage in such circumstances as these.  At the latest I would say about the 30th of September should be the date.  At any rate it gives us the power by legislation.</P>

      <P>Should the newspaper strike last for three months and people in certain districts are getting no papers, how would that affect the question?  In some places people get a weekly paper and they certainly do not read the advertisements.  September would be a very early date.  Last year the people were penalised with regard to getting their sales docket within the period.  Quite a number of people were penalised.  It was very unjust simply in order to make people toe the line and to make them come in at what is regarded as the wheat sale season.  Here we are fixing the date now in September, a time when the crop will be only harvested.  In many districts perhaps there are no papers at all to be had and in many cases the people do not read papers. I suggest that some other steps should be taken by the Minister to notify the people if he is fixing the date so early. At the moment it would be hard to say what would be a practical suggestion. In many of those Acts with regard to schemes carried out by the county councils it has been the practice that announcements were made in the churches in connection with matters like this.  In so serious a matter as this, practical steps should be taken to convey the change in date to every farmer in the country.  I do not think <Col N="2222" /> the matter should be allowed to be fixed on a short notice like this.</P>

Where the maize miller mixes oat kernels with maize meal he is only asked to put in about 70 per cent. of what he would put in it were it all whole oats.  He therefore gets an advantage of 30 per cent. reduction.  It is estimated that 30 per cent. of the oats is removed in the hulls.  Unless we define the &ldquo;oat kernels&rdquo; it might be possible that a person might come along and say that in the oat kernels only five per cent. or <Col N="2224" /> ten per cent. of the bulk was removed and the rest ground down.  It is very necessary to have a definition to show what the &ldquo;oat kernels&rdquo; are and it is more particularly necessary to have it if oat kernels are to be mixed with flour for human consumption.</P>

      <P>On this section the question of licences arises.  I want to know from the Minister for Agriculture if it is his intention in connection with the licensing provisions contained in Section 32 to provide a register which will be accessible to the public or to a limited section of the public for examination with a view to informing them of the terms and conditions under which licences have been issued?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, Sir, attention has been drawn in this House not once but many times to the very grave dissatisfaction that has prevailed in the country in connection with the administration of such licensing powers mentioned already in these circumstances. Under Section 32 the Minister &ldquo;may grant to such importer a licence expressed to authorise such importer, subject to compliance with such conditions as he thinks fit to impose.&rdquo;  I draw the attention of the House specially to the paragraph, &ldquo;subject to compliance with such conditions as he thinks fit to impose, to sell imported wheaten flour to a specified person without limit as to time or quantity or either of them or within a specified time or in a specified quantity.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Similar powers have been afforded to the Minister under a variety of other statutes.  As the House is aware, the Minister has, under some of the Finance Acts, power to advise the Revenue Commissioners to admit free of duty, by way of licence, certain commodities which are subject to a customs tax.  It was clearly the impression of the House, when that licensing power was given, that it would be operated for the purpose of making it free to any citizen of the State to import a tariffed commodity if supplies of that commodity were not forthcoming from some Saorstát source.  It is common <Col N="2226" /> knowledge to every merchant in the country that what is happening in certain cases is that protected manufacturers, who are supposed to be producing all of the commodities concerned that the Saorstát requires, find themselves unable to fill the vacuum and they are being allowed to import the particular commodities free of duty.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That refers to licences to import flour.  Now, there is one simple way out of this difficulty; and that is to make these licences open for perusal to every citizen of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2227" /> Provided that there is nothing in connection with these licences that would be a matter for public scandal, there can be no conceivable objection to making them open for perusal to everybody in the country.  Possibly, an objection would be that to open commercial licences of this character to the public, generally, might give rise to misunderstanding by the mass of people who would not be familiar with conditions under which the particular trade is carried on.  If that objection is sustainable, then let the register be open only to people engaged in competition with the licensee in the same trade.  I think that there can be no justification for this method of secret licensing and the granting of licences under secret conditions and secret circumstances.  I should like to impress most strongly on the Minister that it is giving rise all through the country to a feeling that the general administration in connection with those licences is not above board.  If that be the impression through the country, the sooner it is cleared away the better for everybody, and the only effective way of doing so is to keep registers which will be open for perusal to such persons as are entitled to persue them.</P>

      <P>If the Minister were more in contact with the mercantile community at large, and not with the particular section of it to which he is doling out tariffs, he would hear from all sides what I am saying here.  I am not asking him to do anything extraordinary or anything revolutionary, but simply to communicate to the country the information that is wanted, and that is the circumstances under which certain people are entitled to import certain commodities free of duty in certain cases or the licensing conditions generally.</P>

      <P>The Deputy has made what, in my opinion, is a charge of corruption against three members of the Government, <Col N="2228" /> among whose duties is the responsibility for the issue of licences. He has also made, in my opinion, a charge of corruption against the Revenue Commissioners.  No licence can be issued, so far as I am aware, for the importation of goods under any section of the Finance Acts, except by the Revenue Commissioners with the consent of the Minister for Finance after consultation with the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce has stated what I know to be a fact: that if a licence is granted to any person for a commodity, any other person in the same circumstances can get a licence for the same article.  There is no favouritism as between one individual in the community and another.</P>
      <P>The Deputy has raised here in the House an isolated case, an instance which took place very many months ago.  In every debate on every Bill in which there is a licensing provision, that case has been cited by the Deputy, and on it an expanding mountain of misrepresentation has been built up by the Deputy.  Three months ago, the Deputy promised, having made a statement more or less in the same terms as the statement he made to-night, to furnish to the Minister for Industry and Commerce the facts upon which he based his allegations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Three weeks ago.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, even if it were three weeks ago, surely, before the Deputy made so grave a statement as he made here in the House to-night, he would have had the facts upon which he based that statement at his finger tips.  Surely it would not take him three weeks to put those facts down in a letter.  They must be few.  They must be simple.  They must stand against controversion.  If there was any substance in the allegation; if he felt that he had a public duty to discharge in this matter, it was incumbent upon him to set those facts before the Minister and to give him an opportunity of dealing with them.  So far as <Col N="2229" /> I am aware, the Deputy has not placed the facts in connection with this single, isolated instance before the Minister yet.</P>

      <P>The single instance which the Deputy says he raised three weeks ago, and which the Minister for Industry and Commerce says the Deputy raised three months ago.  The Deputy has stated that there were not one or two instances, but many instances. These licensing provisions have been in operation for 18 months now&mdash;almost two years.  In the whole of that time&mdash;and I am the Minister mentioned in the Acts as being responsible for the general licensing provisions &mdash;I have not had from the Deputy one authentic instance, one instance whether authentic or not.  I have not had one complaint from him, with the exception of that Templecrone case, which the Minister for Industry and Commerce has dealt with time after time in the House to the general satisfaction of the House&mdash;although not, I admit, to the satisfaction of the Deputy, who behaves in this case, like Uncle Dick in David Copperfield.  Like the gentleman who was obsessed with King Charles's head, he has to drag it in or every occasion and into every discussion in this House.  In regard to the general matters covered by the licensing provisions, I repeat neither I nor the Revenue Commissioners have received from the Deputy any complaint about the manner in which the licensing provisions have been operated. I may say that I have never received a complaint from the Deputy nor have I received any complaint from any member of the public.  So far from there being dissatisfaction on the part of the public with the manner in which the licensing provisions are being operated, I am in a position to say that there is general satisfaction, because that satisfaction has been many times expressed to me by Deputies here and by numbers who are engaged in general business in this country.  We are just as closely in <Col N="2230" /> touch with the whole of the commercial community as Deputy Dillon is.  We make it our business to be so in touch with them and I am perfectly certain if there had been a scintilla of evidence to support the general allegation which the Deputy has made in this House, in regard to the way in which the licensing provisions are being operated, that would have been brought to our particular attention.</P>

      <P>The Minister said triumphantly just now: &ldquo;If we issue a licence for the free importation of any commodity, any person can get a licence for the same article if he be situated in similar circumstances.&rdquo; That is all I am asking for.  Publish the conditions and terms of the licence, make it possible for every citizen to go up to the Minister and say: &ldquo;These are my conditions and circumstances; I want a licence, too.&rdquo;  That is all I want.  Let that be incorporated in statute.  Let that be incorporated in the Bill before us and I am perfectly satisfied&mdash;that every citizen similarly circumstanced to the licensee shall, by right of law, be entitled to claim a similar licence.  Put that in the Bill and I shall raise no further objections. Will the Minister for Industry and Commerce put that in the Bill?  Stony silence! Will the Minister for Finance whisper in the ear of the Minister for Industry and Commerce and see can he pull him round to his point of view, because there is a big divergence between them?  The Minister for Industry and Commerce has not the slightest intention to give every citizen the same statutory rights.  Everybody must go hat in hand to him and beg, of his favour, to provide the licence.  I have got information here but I do not want to read it out across the House.</P>

      <P>Deputy Smith leaps into the breach.  I have never read out the name of any single individual in this House who was not here to defend himself.  What did happen was that I set out certain circumstances, circumstances of a very flagrant character, so flagrant that the Minister for Industry and Commerce recognised the case and he wriggled and twisted and he sought to defend himself for six weeks, and eventually in despair he read out the name of this case without my ever mentioning it, showing clearly to the House that the whole scandal was before him and that he well recognised the licensee in question.  The Minister for Finance says they must be few.  They are few, as many as I have been able to get.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I took a note of the statement of the Minister for Finance. He said: &ldquo;They must be few, they must be simple, they must be easy to cover.&rdquo;  I do not think they are few, though such as I have been able to find out are few.  I do not think they are simple.  They are extremely complex, because if a man gets a licence to import baker's flour and he imports any other flour, he is told that under Section 7 and Section 42 of the Act of 1914 as amended by the Finance Act of 1917 and complicated by the further Acts of the Fianna Fáil Government, certain things shall happen.  The facts <Col N="2232" /> are extremely complex.  &ldquo;They must,&rdquo; finally says the Minister, &ldquo;be easy to come at.&rdquo;  How on earth are they easy to come at?  They are extremely difficult to come at.  It takes a long time to get the information.</P>
      <P>The Minister says there is general satisfaction with the administration of the licensing provisions, and he also says that I have charged corruption against the Revenue Commissioners I have never charged corruption against the Revenue Commissioners and I have never charged gross corruption against Ministers, but I did charge, and I repeat the charge now, political corruption, and I mean no more than that.  I would be glad to crush political corruption just as any corruption.  What I have said here was that a £5 note would not buy a Minister of State, but there was a possibility that a consideration of 25 votes would buy him, and I reiterate that.  I say that where you have a strong supporter of the Government, an influential man in his own area, when he comes to ask concessions from a Minister, he is much more likely to get them than a strong Fine Gael supporter in the same area.  I have no hesitation in saying that and I stand over it.  I repeat again that the Minister for Finance has laid it down that any person can get a licence on the same conditions and the same terms as any other person similarly circumstanced.  Will the Minister for Industry and Commerce put that in the Bill?  If he does that, the objection which I have raised to the section is largely disposed of.</P>

Deputy Dillon has made a general charge here.  He says that there is the greatest perturbation throughout the country as to the manner in which the licensing powers possessed by the Minister were being exercised.  I ask him again to produce any evidence whatever to support his assertion, particularly evidence in the form of a resolution passed by any responsible commercial organisation in this State. Can he do it?  We do not take Deputy <Col N="2233" /> Dillon's word for it that there is grave perturbation.  I go further and I invite Deputy Dillon to get any member of his own Party who is in business and who is in contact with the Department of Industry and Commerce, to stand up here to support him.  If Deputy Dillon is even speaking the view of his own Party, much less the view of the commercial community of the State, surely he should be able to get some other member of his Party to agree with him and to indicate his agreement by speech here.  Deputy Dillon will not accept that challenge just as he failed to meet the challenge I issued to him the last time he made his general wild assertions.

If it were possible to set down in precise terms the circumstances under which goods could be <Col N="2237" /> imported, it would be done.  It is because it is not possible to do that in certain cases that it is necessary to allow an element of discretion to enter into the matter.  If it were possible to indicate the exact circumstances under which importation could take place, there would be no necessity for licensing powers.  That is why we have this licensing power&mdash;so that the peculiarities of each case can be dealt with separately.  A discretion is allowed to the officers of the Department of Industry and Commerce as to how each case is to be dealt with.  If the Deputy wants any information as to how these officers are doing their work; he should consult the business members of his own Party before coming in here to make wild charges.  He should not come here to make charges which he is not in a position to prove.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 33 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The following provisions of the Principal Act are hereby repealed, that is to say, sub-section (4) of Section 98, and Sections 102, 103 and 104.</P>
      <P>This amendment is connected with an amendment that follows.  It provides that where a business is carried on by the Minister that instead of being accounted for in the ordinary commercial way it shall be accounted for in the ordinary Government financial way.  All moneys received will go into the Exchequer and be accounted for to the Comptroller and Auditor-General, and all moneys paid out will be paid over by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I really do not quite follow the Minister.  He says that in future enterprises carried on under this Bill by the Minister shall be carried on not in a business way but in accordance with Department of Finance practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is to say that the only accounts that will be kept will be accounts of outgoing and incomings. Surely it would be better for the Minister to have some obligation upon himself which would reveal to him whether he was operating at a profit or at a loss.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be a full statement made of the outgoings and the incomings and that will be laid before the Oireachtas.  This is where a business is carried on by the Minister, and the purpose of the amendment is to prevent moneys coming in being used as they would be in an ordinary business house.  All moneys coming in must be paid into the Exchequer, and all moneys going out must be paid out by the Minister for Finance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister really think that that will be an advantageous arrangement?  Surely the application of Department of Finance regulations to a business undertaking of this kind is not calculated to promote the cause of economy?  We have had a good deal of discussion in another place about the propriety of running the Gaeltacht services on those lines.  The Department of Finance has taken the view that the accounts of the Gaeltacht trading department should be kept along certain lines laid down by the Department of Finance.  Others have taken the view that it would be very much more helpful if commercial accounts were kept which would enable the Public Accounts Committee and the Dáil to see whether, in fact, the Gaeltacht services were being carried on at a profit or at a loss, and in the event of their being carried on at a loss what the amount of that loss was at the end of each financial year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The difference, I think, is roughly that the Comptroller and Auditor-General is the auditor instead of a commercial firm.  The moneys audited by the Comptroller and Auditor-General all go into the Exchequer, and whatever money is used for the financing of those undertakings will have to be voted by the Dáil.  As the Principal Act stood, the Dáil would only have to vote the loss in the year, or receive the profit, as the case may be.  Now the Dáil will have to vote the whole lot.  Accounts, as if it were a commercial concern, will be laid before both Houses at the end of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I suspect the hidden hand of the Minister for Finance. There is a very comfortable old statute of about 1908, called the Treasury and <Col N="2241" /> Finance Accounts Act, or something like that, which authorises the Department of Finance to require any other Department of State to return accounts to them in a form which shall be prescribed by them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance will remember that convenient statute. Are we satisfied that this amendment is not a <i>réchauffé</i> operation by the Treasury officials to bring the Minister under that statute, and to compel him to draw his accounts in whatever form they prescribe, and not in the form which he may think will be most informative to Dáil Eireann and the public?  That is what has happened in connection with the Gaeltacht services. The Department of Finance have power under the old statute to compel them to draw their accounts in a particular form, and they are accordingly insisting on that right.  I want to ensure that the Dáil will have the right to see a commercial account at the end of a year's trading by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is provided that a commercial account will be laid on the Table.  The main reason for those amendments which are coming on is that the Comptroller and Auditor-General may have full control over and access to all expenditure.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, I think, will be aware that, under the Slaughter of Animals Act, where the Minister goes into any of the various commercial activities which the Bill provides that he may go into, there is a provision that he will keep accounts on commercial lines.  I personally feel that the Minister was providing for something under that Bill which when <Col N="2242" /> compared with what the Minister for Industry and Commerce proposes to do under the Industrial Alcohol Bill was something that gave the public and gave the House some chance of seeing how in fact the businesses entered into were carried on from the point of view of the profit and loss of an ordinary commercial concern.  I think it would be very wrong that, where he is taking power to set up a business, he should depart in any way from the ordinary method of presenting his accounts in a businesslike way.  As Deputy Dillon says, it does suggest a desire to hide over something in the carrying on of those businesses when the proposal which the Minister has in the measure is now being withdrawn.  I should like to ask the Minister in connection with this amendment whether he proposes to introduce a similar amendment to strike out the provisions in the Slaughter of Animals Bill, which, as far as I can recollect, arrange that accounts in connection with any activities which he may enter on in a commercial way under that Bill will be made out in a commercial way, too, as distinct from the way in which the Industrial Alcohol Bill proposes that the accounts of that concern will be presented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are similar amendments to the Slaughter of Animals Bill as there are to this.  If Deputies will look at amendment 5 they will see that &ldquo;the Minister for Industry and Commerce shall as soon as may be after the end of every financial year, during which Part VIII of the Principal Act is in force, prepare and lay before each House of the Oireachtas a report of his proceedings under the said Part VIII. during such financial year.&rdquo; The same thing is being done as far as the Minister for Agriculture is concerned, so that the procedure is being changed from the ordinary commercial account, where, as I say, money comes in and is paid out again without necessarily being banked.  Under this arrangement the money must be passed into the Exchequer.  All money paid out comes from the Treasury, and has to be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor-General.  All money has to be <Col N="2243" /> voted by the Dáil.  In addition there is a provision for laying a balance sheet, as it were, before the House at the end of the financial year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I can smell well where this is all coming from.  This is a little <i>démarche</i> of the Department of Finance.  The manacles are going on somewhere else.  You will always find the Department of Finance up to this sort of a game: &ldquo;You must not let anybody stir hand or foot without getting our approval.  No farthing must be disbursed or moved from one place to another without getting the approval of the Minister for Finance.&rdquo;  Now all that looks lovely; if you could go in at 12 o'clock in the morning, see the Minister, get his approval, get out at five past 12 and get on with your job, it would not matter very much whether you had to get his approval or not. What is in fact the case?  You write a minute, and you start a file in the Department of Finance.  There is a nice piece of tape tied round the middle.  That file goes upstairs and downstairs, down to the cellar, across the street and back again.  You next meet it three weeks later, and it has grown to a monster.  It goes on growing and growing.  At the end of about six months, perhaps, you will be informed that the Minister has decided to sanction that item of expenditure. Now, to tell you the truth, I think all this business of the Minister engaging in trade of one kind or another is foredoomed to failure.  The insertion of this proposal makes the failure all the more certain and all the more rapid. <Col N="2244" /> Our duty is to point out to the Minister such pitfalls as we see, during Committee, whether we approve of the principle of the Bill or not.  I warn the Minister that if he sells himself into the servitude of the Department of Finance in respect of this matter he is done for.  They will tie a tape around his neck and strangle him during the first three months of the operation of the Act.</P>

      <P>I would suggest that the Minister should tell us what particular commercial activities he foresees he may have to embark on under the Cereals Bill.  We know that under the Slaughter of Animals Bill he may embark on an infinite number. It has been pointed out here that he may be a cattle dealer, or a grazier, or a butcher, or a slaughterer.  Let us take, for example, one case under the Slaughter of Animals Bill.  If the Minister has to become a slaughterer in, say, ten different localities, is he going to run himself as one big slaughtering concern with, say, ten slaughtering centres?</P>

      <P>I am taking that as a sample, and asking the Minister to give us some examples of the kind of commercial undertakings he may have to enter into under the Cereals Bill?  We have been told that this is the adoption of a general line of policy, and that what he proposes by the amendment to apply to the Cereals Bill is to apply perhaps to the Slaughter of Animals Bill.  It would help us if we had some clear idea of what the Minister's activities are going to be.  Under the Slaughter of Animals Bill he may have quite a number of butchers' shops in different parts of the country.  Is he going to be a multiple shop merchant?  If he is to branch into the butcher's shop business would each shop be regarded as a separate business under the Bill? There is more than the difficulty and the danger that Deputy Dillon pointed out.  The Department of Finance may have their own particular policy, and the Minister and his colleagues may have another type of policy for hiding <Col N="2245" /> the futility of their commercial activities. I suggest to the Minister that the amendment before the House now is more an amendment to cover up the wants of the purely Ministerial mind rather than the wants of the Departmental mind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We can deal with the butchers and the knackers when we come to them.  As far as this Bill is concerned, the only power I have to deal in business is to become a corn merchant, in other words to take over corn stores and kilns, and either to work them, by buying and selling oats and barley, or to lease or to sell these corn stores.  It is not contemplated that we should have to use any of these powers in the near future, because before using them, whether by running them as commercial concerns or otherwise, there would be accounting, as in commercial firms, to the Comptroller and Auditor-General.  We would first have to come to the House for a Supplementary Estimate.  It is not contemplated taking a Supplementary Estimate before we adjourn, so it is not likely that any of these businesses will be engaged in for some time to come under this Bill.</P>

      <P>I suggest that in view of the general policy proposed to be pursued here, the information we have got from the Minister is most unsatisfactory. We should be satisfied more on this point before we agree to the amendment, which allows the Minister to deal with the accounts in this particular way, to prevent the House and the public generally knowing how each of his individual commercial activities is getting on, from the point of view of profit or loss.  The Minister is taking very elaborate powers to go into commercial enterprises, and at a time when that is so the law should be such as to let the people know how such commercial <Col N="2246" /> enterprises are getting on, and we should have ordinary commercial accounts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what the Deputy has to complain of.  I gave all the information that he could reasonably expect to get.  I told him it is not considered by my Department or by the Department of Finance to be proper to carry on those commercial enterprises unless we brought in a special Bill, such as the Electricity Supply Act, where a Board was set up, where we were going to engage in business through civil servants, and that it should account in this way to the Comptroller and Auditor-General.  I am surprised that the Opposition should take up such an attitude.  Surely they want to know how the money is being spent.  It is very difficult to understand them unless Deputy Dillon and Deputy Mulcahy wanted a discussion on this matter.  I have said that so far, under this Bill, I have not contemplated any business.  If I did, I would have to bring in a Supplementary Estimate.  Under the Cattle Bill I will bring in a Supplementary Estimate which shows that we contemplate going into business, but not under this Bill.</P>

      <P>The section provides that&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Minister may by order make regulations in relation to any matter or thing referred to in this Part of this Act as prescribed.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;This Part of this Act&rdquo; is Part IV, and the heading under which Part IV is submitted to the House is, &ldquo;Provisions in relation to the sale and purchase of oats and barley, and the milling of oatmeal.&rdquo;  The Minister already has power to control dealings in wheat; he now takes power to control dealings in oats and barley.  So this section completes his right to control all dealings in all cereals in this country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The moment the Minister takes power to make orders and regulations it simply means that the whole business of the country in the matter of cereals is going to be taken <Col N="2251" /> over by the Minister.  He is going to take over, under another Act, the whole business of raising, selling and slaughtering cattle.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>And sheep&mdash;quite right. The Minister for Industry and Commerce has power under other Acts to take over a variety of other kinds of enterprises in this country.  We are rapidly arriving at the stage when every business activity in this country, agricultural and industrial, will be taken over either by Mr. Lemass, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, or Dr. Ryan, the Minister for Agriculture. That simply means that every commercial activity is going to be run in this country by the civil servants whom we shall have to employ for the purpose.  Remember this, that the existing staff in the Civil Service is at present working at top pressure and for much longer hours than people employed in almost any other calling in the country.  By the time these two Minister have control of all the industries they ambition to control, the personnel of the Civil Service will have to be doubled and the cost of the Civil Service will be doubled.  You are paying bounties on everything.  You are going to double the personnel of the Civil Service and you trust the country can stand it all.  It is very nice while it lasts, but some day there will be a most infernal reckoning for us all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the man who deals not only in oats for the purpose of resale to the miller, but also in oats which he purposes kiln-drying and selling to seed merchants?  It says here:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Any person who carries on or proposes to carry on the business of purchasing home-grown oats or barley or both for resale to holders of milling licences, registered maize millers, or registered oatmeal millers may, in accordance with this section, apply to the Minister to be registered in the register of dealers in oats and <Col N="2252" /> barley in respect of any premises at which he carries on or proposes to carry on such business.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Sub-section (2) provides:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The Minister may refuse to register an applicant for registration in the register of dealers in oats and barley if, in his opinion, the registration of such applicant is, having <Col N="2253" /> regard to the number of persons already registered in such register, not desirable in the public interest.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That means that the Minister may consider that there are too many dealers in oats and barley.  On what grounds does he claim the right to set up a monopoly in dealing with this commodity? What conceivable harm can accrue either to grower or miller to have a multiplication of channels through which grain can flow from the producer to the miller?  We have had examples of monopolies.  We have the Control of Manufacturers Bill which was recently passed, and which confers upon the Minister for Industry and Commerce the right to create monopolies in manufacture.  Whatever can be said to defend the pernicious principle enshrined in that Bill, nothing whatever can be said to deny any man the right to set himself up as a dealer in grain provided he is prepared to submit to the regulation which the Minister prescribes for his competitors in the same trade.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy is becoming sensible.  This is a provision that is in all those Bills with regard to registration, such Bills as those dealing with fresh meat, creameries, cereals, maize mills, and flour mills. It must be said that in all those cases there was an obligation within certain limits to allow existing people to go on.  There is something to be said for the case made by a Deputy to allow all people in the trade to be automatically registered.  There is something to be said for striking this provision out.  I shall be glad if the Deputy will bring such an amendment forward on the next stage.</P>
      <P>Question agreed to.</P>
      <P>Sections 42 to 49, inclusive, agreed to.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 50 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Paragraph (c) of sub-section (3) says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;the person registered in such register, if an individual, has died, or, if a body corporate, has been dissolved and no other person has, <Col N="2254" /> within three months after such death or dissolution, been registered in the place of the registered person so dead or dissolved; or&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Does the period of three months give sufficient time?</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We had a month down and we extended it to three months, and I think that is adequate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I have in mind where you have a country mill.  I recognise that the vast majority of country mills will not come under the operation of this Act because they will be mills milling on commission.  But you have mills milling in a small way and, as we know, there are some country people who are sometimes very dilatory in taking out administration and, until they do, of course, they have no personal representative.  Is there any advantage to be got from making it three months instead of six months?  There does not seem to be any very good reason why haste, in this matter, should be necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would suggest to the Deputy that if the amendment I have indicated was accepted on Report Stage there would be no necessity for three months at all, because there would be no difficulty in registration. The person complying would be automatically registered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared to accept that.  In paragraph (d) the Minister will see that a notice of the Minister's intention to cancel may be served if the person is adjudicated a bankrupt. Why is that desirable?  It does not seem to make a man any less fit to be a retailer in corn than in boots or shoes if he was adjudicated a bankrupt. Many a man went into bankruptcy and by carrying on his trade, under whatever restriction the court laid down, was able to rehabilitate himself again and to pay 20/- in the £.  If you had a man wiped out of his particular calling it might keep him down for ever.  I suggest to the Minister to ask himself the question: is a bankrupt any less fit to deal with cereals than he is to deal in boots and shoes?  The Bankruptcy <Col N="2255" /> Court never laid upon the bankrupt the obligation of not trading in these commodities. I suggest that a restriction of this kind should not be imposed by statute in this case unless there is very good reason for it.</P>

      <P>This provision has been put into all similar Acts protecting the people trading.  Registration in the Department of Agriculture might be looked upon by the farmer as if it were a certain amount of proof of the Department's approval of a person, engaged in the buying of oats and barley, who had become bankrupt. Farmers must exercise care in selling to buyers who make purchases from them.  The farmer might not exercise the same care if the buyer was on a register.  He might say it was up to the officials of the Minister to protect him.  There is something in keeping that in mind.  There is also something in what the Deputy says.  It is hardly fair if a trader becomes a bankrupt to give him no chance of revival.</P>

      <P>A bankrupt is under a statutory obligation, under the Bankruptcy Act, not to ask for credit, or take goods on credit, without disclosing to his customer that he is a bankrupt. There is a very heavy statutory obligation on the part of the bankrupt, if he is an undischarged bankrupt, to disclose that fact.</P>

      <P>I think the Minister should consider the question whether a bankrupt should not be entitled to carry on dealing in cereals if he complies with certain conditions as if he were dealing with boots and shoes.

      <P>The Deputy will recognise that there is a big difference between a retail boot trader or grocer selling to the public and a person selling to a registered buyer.  The wholesalers know their business fairly well and will not sell to traders who became bankrupt <Col N="2256" /> unless they have a guarantee.  If traders become bankrupt the wholesalers very quickly get to know it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, in all those other Acts.  The ordinary farmer does not know that a person has become a bankrupt. He does not want to be looking up <i>Stubb's Gazette</i>, and we want to protect him.  He will get the idea that if a man is on our register it is our business and not his business to see that he is an honest trader.</P>

      <P>The real answer to Deputy Dillon's question is that at some future date when the Minister for Industry and Commerce takes over the trade in boots and shoes and drapery, etc., and works those trades through existing traders, under licence, if one of those traders becomes a bankrupt his licence will be revoked.  That is the position.  We are on the direct road to Socialism.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>This provision is no protection to the farmers.  If a man goes bankrupt this licence is no protection to the public.  The harm is done the moment he becomes a bankrupt and the management of his estate passes into the hands of the official receiver.  His creditors would be those that existed at the moment of his bankruptcy.  On the other hand, it might be said that this licence would give the transfer to someone else.  But it would be a long time before it could be transferred.  The official receiver will hold the estate until he is able to clear matters up.  The harm is done because he has this particular protection, if there is any protection at all, up to the moment of his bankruptcy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister consider an amendment, later on, saying &ldquo;if the person is an undischarged bankrupt&rdquo;?  If that was taken in conjunction with the concession the Minister made at an earlier stage such a person could not be registered.  The Minister said he was prepared to consider a proposal that any person undertaking to conform to the regulations would be entitled to be registered.  But <Col N="2257" /> paragraph (d) operating as at present makes it possible to have the licence of a person who was ever adjudicated a bankrupt withdrawn.  The amendment which I suggest would provide that an undischarged bankrupt would be ineligible.  If he gets his discharge he can apply again and be reinstated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter we should not go into.  The Bankruptcy Court will not discharge a man unless they believe he has done substantial justice to his creditors.  If the court believes that he has not paid all that is justly due they will not discharge him.  There are men who are undischarged bankrupts for years because they will not do justice to their creditors. But it is hardly right, having given the courts power to discharge a man, to inquire as to whether the courts would discharge him unless he has paid his debts in full.  All I wish to have inserted is that he will not be eligible for a licence if he is an undischarged bankrupt.</P>

      <Col N="2258" />&ldquo;On and after the appointed day it shall not be lawful for any holder of a milling licence, any registered maize miller, or any registered oatmeal miller who is not also a registered dealer in oats and barley, to purchase any oats or barley unless such person is a registered dealer in oats or barley.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Is the Minister satisfied that that is a good provision, or would it not be better to allow any person who proposes to mill cereals to buy direct from the producer, or is it the Minister's intention to make all persons registered dealers as well as registered millers?</P>

The practice is that the miller retains a small portion of the oats as compensation for the work he has done.  He has no means of disposing of that except by sale.  Is the Minister satisfied there that he will not be caught by this Bill if he has got to dispose of the surplus? Take a farmer&mdash;a small farmer&mdash;who sends 14 barrels of his own growing to the mill.  That was his own growing for the season.  He does not pay the miller in cash, just because he has not got the cash.  What the miller does is to retain a certain amount of the milled stuff as compensation for his labour.  That is the general practice.  What is to happen to the miller in that case?  Will that be just &ldquo;dead meat&rdquo;?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked if this Bill would not debar a farmer from selling direct to a miller, and the Minister said it would not.  I said that, taking that section in conjunction with this section that we are dealing with now, it did not appear to be so to me.  Perhaps it means, as was implied by the Minister, that <Col N="2262" /> I have no intelligence, but as I read it, once this section passes, it will not be possible for the ordinary farmer to sell direct to the miller, and that he must go to a middleman.  As I have said already, it may be, as the Minister implied, that I have no capacity for reading anything correctly, but as far as my literary capacity goes, I am interpreting this section to mean that there is no power given to a farmer to sell any oats or barley to a miller unless he is a registered dealer in oats and barley.  The section reads as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;On and after the Appointed Day it shall not be lawful for any holder of a milling licence, any registered maize miller, or any registered oatmeal miller who is not also a registered dealer in oats and barley, to purchase any oats or barley from any person unless such person is a registered dealer in oats and barley.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>So that, in fact, unless it became possible for every individual farmer in this country to register himself as a dealer in oats and barley he could not become an oats miller.  That is the manner in which I interpret this particular section. If the Minister interprets it in any other way I will be satisfied.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it is a negotiable instrument.  This is a serious business because you may establish chaos quite unwillingly; through the instrumentality of this Bill the courts may find that the miller is giving value for the margin of oats which he keeps as payment for the work he does in converting the farmer's oats into meal.  The moment the courts find that, the miller is convicted of an offence under this Bill, inasmuch as he bought oats direct from the farmer, he being a registered miller.  That matter wants clearing up. I think the Minister will find that the circumstances governing all these small millers in the West of Ireland to whom Deputy McMenamin refers require closer investigation than they have received by the Minister.  Is the normal life of the people going to be upset unknowingly by this tomfoolery?</P>
      <P>Is this to be a further aggravation? At least, let us be sure that such tomfoolery as the Minister is putting across will be put across consciously. Let us be sure that the tomfoolery is conscious tomfoolery.  Let us at least know the measure of our folly and let us commit no more folly than we want to commit.</P>

      <P>I am still not satisfied on the question of the freedom of the individual farmer to sell his oats to the miller.  The Minister, replying to me, said that I was wrong in my contention, and that no miller who was a registered dealer under this Bill could buy direct from the farmer.  How many millers will be registered dealers, and if they be registered dealers it appears to me that they will purchase their oats from the farmers?  What is the necessity for having these regulations, which we have been discussing this evening, and tieing up the individual oat dealers in their negotiations with the millers?  If the dealers are to buy up the bulk of the oats, then the farmers cannot do their business freely, because they will be debarred under this section.  The miller who is not a dealer in oats cannot purchase oats.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course it is.  The miller has got to register if he is to dispose of the goods that he will take in payment of doing work.  Is that not the position?  If he mills for a couple of parishes he will have an accumulation of either oats or oatmeal.  What will he do with it?  He will have to turn it into money to keep his mill going, and in turning it into money he breaks the law unless he is a registered miller or a registered dealer in oats. He cannot take the oats from the farmer.  It is a very fine point whether taking oats in lieu of money is not in fact buying oats.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking in order that the trade will not be dislocated in the greater part of the country. You will find that the small miller is also generally a farmer and he hopes to save himself from the ruin that has overtaken the farmers generally since <Col N="2267" /> the Minister and his Government came to office.  He hopes to recoup himself by his little mill, and I want to point out the difficulty of that mill functioning as a result of the Bill the Minister has introduced.  I say without fear of contradiction that when a man takes oats instead of money for services performed, he is buying oats; therefore an illegal act is being committed by the farmer who pays in oats for work done instead of paying in money.  That mill will have to be registered.  That farmer cannot sell to the mill owner. That mill owner cannot buy, so that the net effect is that it will be impossible to carry on the practice which Deputy McMenamin has stated obtains in Donegal and along the western seaboard. I have known it to obtain elsewhere, but it was the exception rather than the rule in the mills which I knew. Deputy McMenamin, however, says that it is the practice in the parts of the country which he knows.  This Bill means that that practice must cease.  That is really the effect of it. I do not think it matters very much as the whole country will soon see when this Bill and the Slaughter Bill are in operation.</P>

Then in the other case where an oatmeal miller takes in oats, to mill for farmers in the area and instead of being paid in cash gets part of the oats by way of payment, he has to sell oats probably some time or other and if he sells oats he must be registered as a seller but he need not be registered as a purchaser because he does not buy it.</P>

      <P>It is expected that the Minister will give some idea, within limits, of the standard he proposes for the oats and of the price, within points, which he will fix for the different grades of oats.  He is expected to give the costings by which he arrives at these standards.  The Minister said, in summing up on Second Reading, that the real object of the Bill was to fix a price for oats and barley.  That is the essence of the Bill.  We are at the essence now, and, before coming to the actual price of the oats, there is reference in sub-section (1) paragraph (a) <Col N="2271" /> to bushel weights.  The Minister proposes to make an order regarding oats, stating the bushel weights required in each grade.  Coming down a paragraph or two, we should like to know the price of the different grades, and we should like the Minister to relate this to the costings and the margin of profit. He promised this House that that would be his basis for grading and pricing these oats.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will see by this section that the Minister may &ldquo;by Order&rdquo; do certain things.  What is the meaning of the words &ldquo;by Order&rdquo;? When a Bill like this is being drafted and we do not think it possible to mention the price that we are going to fix, we postpone that operation, giving the Minister power to fix the price later. We could have omitted the words &ldquo;by Order&rdquo; and the Minister would then have power to fix the price, and nobody could find any fault with him.  When that phrase is used, the Minister must immediately lay that Order on the table and any Senator or Deputy is at liberty to raise the matter and have it discussed.  If the majority in either House so desire, the Order can be nullified.  That is the object in putting in the phrase &ldquo;by Order.&rdquo;  Obviously, other considerations might arise at a later period that are not present now. The Deputy may say that if we are to go entirely on the cost of production, plus a margin of profit, the price could be fixed as easily now as in September or October, when the market is on. Taking as a basis the cost of production, there are other relevant circumstances to be taken into account&mdash;the state of the market at that time, the price, perhaps, at which maize is being imported, the price at which offals are being sold, and the price at which feeding stuffs generally are being sold. Last, but by no means least, we should have to apply the test the Deputy wants us to apply&mdash;the value of these feeding stuffs to the particular animals we are going to feed.  All these things have to be taken into account.</P>

      <P>He would, if he saw what is being done here.  We should be able during the long vacation, if this were a court, to come in and get redress, but the Minister probably hopes to go on the Continent by the end of this week.  He signs an Order fixing the price of cereals and the greater portion of these cereals may have changed hands before there is an opportunity to raise the question of the price. There is, therefore, no remedy.  Before that power is given, we should have some idea of how it will be used and the formula which the Minister will adopt.  As I said, the Minister cannot estimate to the last penny in the case of any unit of cereals the price which he will fix, but he can give us a formula.  He can give the bushel weights and the standards of the grades that he wants but he is averse to doing that now.  Into how many grades is he going to put corn; what bushel weights will he require in the different grades, and what formula is he going to use in fixing the standard price?</P>

      <P>This is one of the most extraordinary sections ever put in a Bill.  Under this, apparently, the Minister can, by order, create a contract between two parties for the sale and purchase of flour, and in this case breach of the contract is not amenable by an action for damages but by penalties under the Bill.  This section is the first one in which reference to a compulsory sale order is made.  It is qualified by Section 78, which sets out the effect of the service of that order on the parties to it.  Section 78 provides:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the vendor and the purchaser shall be deemed to have entered into a contract in terms of the requirements of such order,</P>
      <P>(b)  if the requirements of such order are not complied with&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>that is if the terms of the contract are <Col N="2276" /> not kept, then under paragraph (b) (1) of Section 78</P>
    <P>the vendor shall, unless he proves to the satisfaction of the court that such non-compliance was due to the acts or default of the said purchaser, be guilty of an offence under this section.</P>
    <P>And the purchaser, similarly, if he fails to carry out the terms of this statutory contract, will also be found guilty of an offence.  Every person found guilty of an offence under this section shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to the penalties mentioned in Part I of the Schedule to this Act. These are the penalties:&mdash;</P>
    <P>In the case of a first offence under the relevant section, a fine not exceeding £100, or, in the case of a second or any subsequent such offence, a fine not exceeding £250 or, at the discretion of the court, imprisonment for any term not exceeding six months.</P>
    <P>Is there any precedent in the history of this or any other country which secures the performance of a contract by the imposition of six months in jail?</P>

      <P>Under sub-section (1) (b) of this section the Minister is taking powers to serve a copy by registered letter.  I submit that between this and Report Stage it should be provided that there shall be personal service, and that where that has failed there can be service by registered letter.  I think the procedure of having personal service should not be departed from except for grave reasons, because this may be a very important thing.  Some employee may take a registered letter and keep it to himself.  He may try to keep it from his employer and so wreck the whole machine.  Paragraph (b) should not be resorted to until there has been failure to serve notices personally, or a reasonable effort to do so made.  I think that paragraph should be amended on the Report Stage.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Deputy that it is a matter of importance that every attempt should be made to have the notices served.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a section which creates the preposterous situation where a contract is enforceable by six months in jail.  I am not personally interested in trying to correct the lacuna in this Bill but, for the reputation of this House it would be better if sub-section (2) was made to read that a person guilty of an offence shall be liable to a small fine under Part III instead of under Part I.  Then you would have the situation created where any person guilty of a breach of contract <Col N="2279" /> created under the Act would be mulcted in something analogous to liquidated damages, and you would not have the absurd position of a person creating a breach of contract being liable to a term of imprisonment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a section where a very heavy penalty should be inflicted, because if stocks of flour are not distributed evenly amongst flour millers or merchants, they would not be used up all over the country before the other part of the Bill, concerning the mixing of oats, came into operation. The Minister should have power to inflict a very heavy penalty in case any owner of flour refused to carry out his part of the contract in selling part of the stocks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I recognise that the Minister does not mean that literally, but it gives an indication of the mentality we are developing.  We are all becoming the bond slaves of one Minister or another, and if we do not do absolutely what the Ministers say a heavy penalty will be inflicted, because we do not do instantly and precisely what they tell us.  In fact, this Government is running bureaucratic mad, and none of us will be allowed to draw a breath shortly without a licence from the Government.  If we draw two breaths without having got a licence from one Minister, another Minister will inflict a heavy penalty because some of us determined to draw two breaths when there was only enough air to go round for one. No one would think that a term of six months' imprisonment under a Bill of this character would receive consideration from this House.  I want to raise another question with regard to the compulsory sale order.  Suppose a merchant, by the exercise of legitimate commercial foresight, buys a quantity of flour and that the world <Col N="2280" /> wheat market rises rapidly after the purchase is made, if the flour appreciates in value, will that position be taken into consideration when the compulsory sale order is made?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The current price of flour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is not taken into consideration has that merchant any means whereby he can make the Minister take it into consideration? Suppose the merchant considers the price fixed an unfair one, has he any means of bringing the Minister to arbitration? Let us take a common instance in business.  I find on Monday morning that I have fifty tons of flour, and can demonstrate to anyone familiar with the wheat market that by the following Monday week that flour will be worth 20 to 30 per cent. more than it is worth to-day.  That is to say, that in a fortnight from the relevant date my flour will be worth 30 per cent. more than it was, but on Tuesday I get a compulsory order to sell to a competitor at the current price.  I say to the Minister: &ldquo;Look at the wheat market.  That flour is going to be worth £4 a ton more than it was worth a fortnight ago, yet I have received an order from you with which I have to comply within seven days, according to Section 79.&rdquo;  Have I any rights against the Minister by way of compensation, or have I any means to compel the Minister to fix a price which will bear some relation to the intrinsic worth of the flour?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not! There must be some persons particularly on the Fianna Fáil Benches, who are familiar with trade in this House and who realise that I am out against virtual confiscation.  This situation could arise: If I have flour which I bought to advantage, and if someone wanted to do me an injury, he could make a case under this Bill for transferring portion of the flour to a competitor, so that my foresight and my business acumen in buying could be made to operate gravely to my detriment, instead of to my advantage.  How on earth could such a proposition be <Col N="2281" /> defended on any grounds of equity? It would be a gross outrage on justice to give such powers, and I submit that unless the Minister indicates his readiness to insert a section on the Report Stage which will give recipients of any sale order a right to bring him to arbitration and to fix a price, we are giving powers which could operate as a grave tyranny and a grave injustice in such cases, if used. Not only will it create a grave injustice for the vendors, but let us reverse the position.  Suppose I have large parcels of flour in my warehouse, and I foresee a break in the market, as we do from time to time, I could go to the authority issuing the order and say: &ldquo;Look at So-and-So down the street, who is rolling in money.  It does not matter to him whether he makes or loses money.  Give me a compulsory sale order and let us share the loss.&rdquo;  A man down the street on some Tuesday morning receives an order from the Minister for Industry and Commerce compelling him to take over, perhaps, 250 tons of badly-bought flour at an exorbitant price, when he knows that if he was allowed to operate in the open market, or if allowed to postpone buying, he would suffer no loss at all. These are powers which it is manifestly absurd to give to any Minister or to any body of civil servants.  They are powers which, in operation, can result in barefaced confiscation, and as such will operate against natural justice.  I do not think they are powers this House should give to a Minister or to anyone else.  We have no right to take away his property from a man without compensation, and that is what this compulsory sale order may, and probably will, do from time to time.</P>

      <P>The Minister might make an order for this oat flour which would obtain for six months and then revert back and drop the oats business after the particular surplus of oats had passed.  Then there would be a period of wheaten flour and then he might have to make another oats mixture order. On every occasion he made such an order he might find himself handing my property to that man and that man's property to me.  As often as he did that I say that is an offence against natural justice and can be justified by no legislation passed by this House. There is one thing this House has no right and no power to do and that is to take my property from me and give it to somebody else.</P>

      <P>Of course the Deputy must realise that the Minister must do this every time by order.  If on the first occasion he does any of the things the Deputy is afraid of the House may take up the order on the second occasion and have it rejected.</P>

      <P>The Minister knows that that is no answer to the argument put up to him&mdash;that he might find himself in the position that he is taking men's property from them arbitrarily and refusing them the right to go before an impartial tribunal in order to get justice and nothing but justice.  It is no defence to say: &ldquo;If I err in my first order you can withdraw my authority to make a second order.&rdquo;  We are now giving him power to make all the orders.  All I am asking is that no such order should be made under the authority of this House without this House first having made absolutely sure that justice will be done both to the vendor and the purchaser.  I am making the submission that this House has no authority and could not have authority to take one man's property from him arbitrarily and give it to another.</P>
