      <P>The searches were made following the receipt by the police of information that firearms were being kept in the club or carried by individual members without the necessary licences. The statutory authority for such searches will be found in Act No. 17 of 1925 and Act No. 37 of 1931.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister whether it is not necessary before searches of this nature can be made that the Guards making the search should have reasonable grounds <Col N="981" /> for believing that an offence of this nature had been committed?

      <P>I should like further to ask the Minister concerning his statement that arms have been found with other members of that organisation if we are to conclude from that that all members of this organisation are to be searched for arms and is he going to apply that same reasoning to other organisations, members of which have been found with arms?</P>

And will the Minister say if he is aware whether these attacks, had been made on the League of Youth with a view to having subsequent searches made on them by the Guards to see if they were carrying arms?  Will the Minister also say if the searches were made for arms <Col N="982" /> why was it that documents in Mr. Power's pocket were also examined?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>

      <P>As was clear from my Budget statement the figure of £770,000 is made up of two items mentioned therein, namely, £470,000 for further relief of rates on agricultural land and £300,000 for payment to local authorities on foot of arrears of land purchase annuities funded under the Land Act, 1933.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the point. The point to which I would like to direct attention is that approximately £650,000 has been deducted over a series of years from agricultural grants or other payments to local authorities. On the occasion of the introduction of the recent Land Act it was stated that compensation in respect of that sum would be made in the Budget speech of the Minister.  Is that the full settlement of the claim amounting to £650,000?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Lands if he is aware that there is a large number of farmers in County Longford who are anxious to undertake the planting of timber on suitable plots of land and if he will consider giving a grant of, say, five pounds per acre to assist them in fencing, etc., the said land; and if he is aware that such grants would greatly assist the energetic farmers and labourers who are unemployed in the districts where such work is proposed, and if he is further aware that the amount of land involved in each case is from five to 20 acres.</P>

      <P>Grants are available from the Forestry Division of the Department of Lands towards the cost of establishing new plantations with a minimum of five acres at the rate of £4 per acre payable as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>£2 per acre as soon as the plantation has been laid down and properly fenced.</P>
      <P>£1 per acre in five years' time provided the plantation has been properly looked after.</P>
      <P>The balance (£1) to be paid at the end of another five years on the same condition.</P>
      <P>Any person, therefore, who wishes to avail himself of such grant should make application to the Department of Lands (Forestry Division).</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary refers to five acres as the minimum.  The Minister actually maintains that five acres would hardly be an economic proposition, but that anything from ten to 20 acres is economic.  Will the Parliamentary Secretary not consider extending the grant so as to facilitate the planting <Col N="985" /> of areas from ten to 25 acres in extent?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>1.  New section.  Before Section 9 a new section inserted as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>9.  Section 9 of the Principal Act is hereby amended in the following respects and shall be construed and have effect accordingly, that is to say&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  by the substitution in sub-section (2) of the said section of the word &ldquo;merchandise&rdquo; for the words &ldquo;on a merchandise road transport business&rdquo; now contained therein;</P>
      <P>(b)  by the insertion after sub-section (3) of the said section of the following additional sub-section, that is to say&mdash;</P>
      <P>(4)  Where a person is proved to have carried merchandise by way of merchandise road transport, such person shall for the purposes of this section be deemed to have so carried such merchandise in the course of a merchandise road transport business carried on by him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is really designed to <Col N="986" /> effect a drafting alteration in the Road Transport Act of 1933.  Sub-section (1)  of Section 9 of that Act made it an offence to carry merchandise in the course of a merchandise road transport business except under licence or in an area exempted under the Act.  The words &ldquo;in the course of a merchandise road transport business&rdquo; were necessary to bring in the various definitions given in Section 2, because there would be no offence in carrying merchandise definitely excluded by the two definitions, such as merchandise carried in an omnibus under a licence granted under the 1932 Act.  The penalty provided in Section 9 (2) applies to the carrying on of a merchandise road transport business in contravention of the section and it is necessary to alter that phrase to read &ldquo;carrying merchandise in contravention of the section&rdquo; and to deem any merchandise to have been carried in the course of a merchandise road transport business which is proved to have been carried by way of merchandise road transport.  That is within the definitions in Section 2. The amendment is really designed to repair what appears to have been a drafting error, as a result of which doubts arose as to the efficacy of the section.</P>
    <P>Question agreed to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>2.  New section.  Before Section 13 a new section inserted as follows:</P>
      <P>13.&mdash;No application may be sent to the Minister under sub-section (1)  of Section 51 of the Principal Act during the period of two years commencing at the expiration of one year after the day appointed by order made after the passing of this Act under sub-section (1) of Section 5 of the Principal Act to be the appointed day for the purposes of that Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is designed to effect in respect of merchandise road transport the same provisions which have been enacted in respect of passenger road transport under the Road Transport Act of 1933.  Although a <Col N="987" /> passenger licence could be compulsorily acquired by an authorised company, there was a close period commencing one year after the date on which the Act came into operation and terminating three years after the Act came into operation; that is a period of two years during which the compulsory clauses of the Act would not operate.  It was represented that similar provisions should be made in respect of merchandise road transport operators and the purpose of this amendment is to effect the same provision on their behalf, namely, to provide a period of two years commencing one year after the appointed day, during which the compulsory acquisition clauses will not operate.</P>
    <P>Question agreed to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 4 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>For the purposes of this Act, Northern Ireland shall be a country which the Executive Council may appoint to be a country to which a preferential rate shall apply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of this amendment is to make it possible for the Executive Council, in any case which they may think proper, to give special preference or special privilege to Irish goods produced or manufactured in Ireland, over and above goods produced and manufactured in any other country, when they are imported into Saorstát Eireann.  The Bill, as it is drafted, is not a perfect example of clarity in legislation.  This amendment or a similar amendment might have been inserted in different clauses of the Bill and I was advised that the best form of making this point clear would be to introduce this amendment in this particular form.  I could have introduced an amendment in the first section with <Col N="988" /> reference to the definition of what is or what is not a country for the purpose of this Act.  It may be contended by the Minister that the Act, as it stands, gives permission to the Government to carry out the purpose of my amendment, but I am advised to the contrary.</P>
    <P>There is nothing against the Government giving special preference to any particular section of any customs unit. Great Britain and Northern Ireland form a customs unit just as Belgium and Luxemburg form a customs unit, and commercial treaties are made not with Belgium or Luxemburg separately, but with the customs unit of Belgium and Luxemburg.  So also customs agreements with this country are made with the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  At the same time I think that the Government, if they should see fit, should have the right and should be clearly enabled by law to differentiate between goods manufactured and produced in Northern Ireland and goods produced and manufactured in England, Scotland or Wales.  I do not believe that the Minister will be unwilling to accept this amendment.  There is no compulsion on the Government to give any special preference to Irish goods in any particular case, but it is well, I think, that the Government should have that statutory authority to use it as they see fit.</P>

      <P>Subject to the consent of the Oireachtas and the enactment of the necessary legislation, there is nothing to prevent special preferential customs treatment being given to goods originating in Northern Ireland.  The purpose of the amendment is really to enable that preferential treatment to be given by order of the Executive Council. A decision to extend such special preferential treatment to Northern Ireland goods would be a decision of major importance and should not be given effect to, I think, without prior discussion with and the consent of the Oireachtas.  Consequently, I think that the Deputy's amendment should not be pressed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OsmondGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a new attitude adopted by the Government&mdash;that they <Col N="989" /> wish to divest themselves of dictatorial powers and that they hesitate to assume the right of giving such preference to Irish goods in their admission to this country.  I think that the Minister's plea is not very sincere.  I think that it is designed to hide the fact that his Government is in complete and total agreement with the Government of Northern Ireland in endeavouring to put obstacles in the way of the development of trade between the two sections of our country.  The Government of this section of Ireland, both by word and deed, has shown its anxiety to prevent the development of commercial intercourse between Northern Ireland and the Free State.  In fact, they are engaged at the present moment in an economic war with our fellow-countrymen in Northern Ireland.  They try to escape now from assuming the responsibility of being willing to give special preferential national treatment to Irish goods in the Irish market&mdash;as I say, by hiding behind the skirts of the Oireachtas.  That is to say, they are trying to hide the economic war behind the statue of Queen Victoria.</P>
      <P>There will come a time when we will have persons both in Northern Ireland and the Free State who are anxious to develop trade between the two sections of the country and who are anxious to preserve the economic interdependence of the two sections.  It was for that reason that I put down this amendment, so that, when the time comes, it will be possible for friendly persons in both sections of Ireland to advance special preference to goods of the other section of Ireland, over and above any preference that may be given to other countries across the seas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It might be argued that at the present time the Government of Northern Ireland could not reciprocate to any satisfactory degree with regard to any concessions we might make.  That is not strictly accurate. They have not control over customs, but there are one hundred and one other methods whereby they could assist the Free State imports into Northern Ireland in return for our assistance of Northern Ireland products in the Free State.  I can see no reason whatever why the Minister <Col N="990" /> should not accept this amendment. He is claiming that he is too humble, that he is afraid to face the responsibility of taking such a grave decision as that without the authority of the Oireachtas.  The purpose of this amendment is in order that the Oireachtas may give him that permission&mdash;may enable him to give that decision.  I do not see any derogation of the authority of the Oireachtas, seeing that it is the Oireachtas which enacts this Bill and thereby gives discretionary powers to the Minister.  I hope that other members of the House will support me in advocating that the House will have the right at least to give preferential treatment to Irish goods produced in Ireland and manufactured in Ireland by Irish people, when they are imported into the Irish Free State.</P>

      <P>Only a few days ago, I think, we had Ministers saying that they were so determined to have the Border wiped out of existence that, if it were necessary, they would even fall back on the gun.  Here we have the Minister for Industry and Commerce refusing even to accept the possibility of powers being put in his hand that might rub away the Border in respect of, say, one or two small items of manufacture or of commerce about which an agreement might be made between Northern Ireland and ourselves.  Do I understand his attitude to be that there is one place in the world with which he is not going to have any kind of agreement, whereby he might utilise this Bill by Order, for the purpose of giving special preference&mdash;that there is only one country or one territory in the world, and that that is the Six Counties?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Do we understand that the Minister is quite satisfied to make agreements by Order and to make arrangements, such as are contemplated in this Bill, by Order, with places, like Spain, Mexico and Russia without coming near the Oireachtas, but that Northern Ireland is entirely taboo and that he could not risk entering into conversations on trade matters with the Northern Government or make any kind of agreement on trade matters <Col N="991" /> with them without coming to the Oireachtas and practically running away from coming to agreements, until he has laid the blame for these agreements on the Oireachtas itself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that there is rather a bigger question behind this amendment of Deputy Esmonde's than the Minister recognises and I do not think the Minister can completely brush it aside in the very cavalier fashion in which he endeavoured to brush it aside a few moments ago.  This amendment is an amendment which, indeed, binds the House to nothing, but it is an amendment which, if carried, would be a friendly gesture towards the people of the Six Counties.  It is, I think, a matter on which all Deputies are agreed that the unity of this country is a consummation most devoutly to be wished and, perhaps, in the political world, the consummation of all consummations most devoutly to be wished, and anything which even in a slight degree may help on that unity is something which I think we should do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are ways in which the unity of this country may be established.  It need not be established in the one way only.  It need not be that the whole Six Counties will join with us in the Irish Free State together as one.  It may be that the final solution of our Irish problem may be achieved by policy of attrition, that we may work them off bit by bit and detach, one by one, counties from the Six Counties to join with us.  That may happen and that may come about because certain counties in Northern Ireland may discover that their trade interests are so bound up with our trade interests that it is highly desirable for them to join with us and may agitate themselves until they get, in the British House of Commons, an amendment of the Act setting up the Constitution of Northern Ireland.  That is an aspect of the Irish question which may ultimately turn out to be the solution, and anything which would help on a solution of that nature should not, I think, be lightly brushed aside by the Minister.  It is true, as I said a moment ago, that this may lead at <Col N="992" /> the present moment to nothing, but it is there.  There is the possibility of it and if any section of the community in Northern Ireland becomes anxious to enter into closer business dealings with the people of the Twenty-Six Counties power will be in the Executive Council, or in any future Executive Council, immediately to enter into negotiations, if you like, with a trading body in Northern Ireland, and to let that trading body or association of individuals see that they have more to gain from being on friendly terms with the Government of this State than they would have if they remained completely and entirely tied to the Six Counties.</P>
    <P>I do not see what harm this can do. The Minister says it is a very big question, and I grant the Minister that it is a very big question, and possibly the occasion may never arise for an Executive Council to exercise the powers which Deputy Esmonde's amendment will give them, but the very fact that the powers are there, and known to be there by members of the community of Northern Ireland, may very well have the effect of arousing in them a feeling very friendly indeed to this State.  Since it really ties the Executive Council down to nothing&mdash;it does not tie them to take action&mdash;I would suggest to the Minister that he should reconsider his decision and accept this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It was reasonable to assume that this amendment, introduced by the notoriously irresponsible back bench member of the Fine Gael Party, was not seriously intended. Now, however, that it has been endorsed by two of the front bench members of that Party, we must accept it as the considered policy of the Opposition for the solution of the Partition problem.  It was appropriate that the announcement of that policy should be made through Deputy Esmonde.  I do not think that Deputies quite understand what the amendment is about.  There is no reason why any such policy, if it were considered worth while, should not be operated. It is not necessary that an amendment should be made in this Bill in order to do so.  Deputies may take it that the Government are quite prepared to <Col N="993" /> make trade agreements with any country or any portion of a country where such agreements are likely to have beneficial effects on trade.  We, however, as a rule, make agreements with people who have power to make agreements with us.  Deputies perhaps have not quite realised that in order to make trade agreements affecting goods from Northern Ireland negotiations would have to take place with the British Government and not with the Government of Northern Ireland. The Government of Northern Ireland have no power to make agreements affecting trade matters, or to enter into negotiations on matters affecting rates of Customs duties.  If Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney is to be taken seriously, however, the amendment does not go far enough, because the operation of the policy of attrition, to which he has just referred, would seem to suggest that instead of taking power to give preferential treatment to goods originating in the Six Counties, we should take power to give preferential treatment to goods originating in any one of the Six Counties and to proceed to confer the benefit of that on one county after another until we had detached them from Northern Ireland and attached them to the Saorstát.  It is a good policy for Fine Gael and about as sensible as any other policy they have enunciated on any other subject. Deputy Mulcahy made a reference to some Minister having said that the Border was going to be removed by the gun.  No Minister made any such statement.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to refer to the vulgarities of the Minister but he suggested that the Northern Government have no power to negotiate with us to any useful purpose on such matters as are suggested in this amendment.  The Minister is evidently unaware of the text of the agreement with Great Britain whereby his Government have a right to negotiate with the Government of Northern Ireland on matters of common concern, without any reference whatever to the British Government. He probably has never bothered to read that agreement, or never bothered to read the Acts of the Oireachtas embodying that agreement.  As a matter of fact although the Northern Ireland Government has not got power over Customs they have got, in many other ways, methods whereby they can reciprocate in promoting trade between the two sections of our country.</P>

It is felt that there is not a lot of difference from the point of view of urgency in the matter and that we might as well have a period expressed in this Bill which will provide against the necessity of holding a special meeting of the Dáil in order to confirm an order made under the Bill. For the same reason, the period of three months in the original draft of the Control of Imports Bill was extended to six months.</P>

      <P>The more one considers a measure of this kind the stronger one's objection to it becomes, if we are to have any regard for representative institutions.  As the matter stands in respect of ordinary taxation, an Order of the Executive Council can impose taxation now.  It need not come before the Dáil for a certain time, assuming it is a Customs duty, or something of that sort, under the Imposition of Duties Act.  I think the Minister will admit that that is not a very advisable procedure.  This is the 16th May and the sugar duty imposed on 9th February last has not yet come before the Dáil.  A matter of that sort ought to be discussed in the Dáil at the earliest opportunity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Then it must have been hidden along with some of the others.  There were 19 of them.  The Minister will admit that that matter must come again before the Dáil for discussion.  First of all, there is a sort of preliminary canter.  I presume the Minister occasionally wastes time at a race meeting and he knows that before the horses go to the starting place there is a sort of preliminary canter.  If you are a good judge of a horse you can make your choice during that period.  We are in much the same position with regard to these duties. If the Minister ever reads any works on government and so on I should advise him to look up Lord Hewart's book on this matter, in which he points out how much Parliaments are being relieved of their duties by industrious and, perhaps he might have added, designing and conspiring Ministers who take certain decisions and then put them before their Party and say, &ldquo;Are you going to let us down?&rdquo;  That is perhaps the best description that one could give of the manner in which the sugar duty was imposed.  Now we are invited to postpone our decision on any alteration of a preference that the Executive Council may decide upon until six months after the decision has been taken.  On the face of it, even the conformity suggestion of the Minister is not, to my mind, a sufficient justification for altering the period from three to six months.  To come to the next reason given, we find that it is that the Dáil may adjourn for a longer period than three months, let us say, four months. I do not think this Executive Council could survive without coming to the Dáil with some proposition in the course of three months.  The Executive Council is a sort of uneasy assembly and it must get an occasional airing in Parliament.  Therefore, that is unlikely to happen in this case.  In <Col N="1000" /> one case which the Minister has not put up yet it might arise.  That is the Dáil adjourns for say three months. At the end of two weeks following the Executive Council decides to go to the country, approaches its doom in other words.  In that case where it would not reassemble for three and a half months I admit there is something in it, but in the other cases it is different.</P>

      <P>The amendment is not really important.  Its introduction is really due to a desire in the minds of people who were responsible for framing this legislation for a similar period in similar enactments.  The main argument for it is that it may be necessary on occasion to summon a special meeting of the Dáil.  I agree that, with a little foresight, it might be avoided. It is possible that agreements may be made which would have to be implemented within a limited period and when such foresight cannot be exercised.  I want to tell the Deputy that I read the book on &ldquo;The New Despotism&rdquo; published in 1928.  The Deputy did not read it that time.

      <P>The Bill provides that where an order made by the Executive Council has been approved by Dáil Eireann and revoked by an order similarly made it shall not be lawful for the Executive Council to make under this Act an order having the same effect.  Such an order cannot be made in future and if it was desired to make a similar order new legislation would be required.  The amendment provides that in such circumstances any order being so made and revoked, a new order could not be made until the prior consent of the Oireachtas had been given.  A similar provision was inserted in the previous Customs Duties Bill.</P>

      <P>May I intervene for a moment?  Yesterday evening Deputy Donnelly addressed the House and is reported in this morning's paper to have said:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;When they were discussing the land annuities he suggested to the Deputies opposite that they should read the report of the Commission set up by the Second Dáil in 1920 to determine the relations between the <Col N="1002" /> public boards and the English Local Government Board.  That report was passed unanimously by the Second Dáil, and one clause of the report stated that the deficits in the accounts of the local bodies, after making allowances for certain economies, shall be met by diverting the land annuities and the income tax from the British Government to the Exchequer of the Dáil.  The adoption of the report containing that recommendation was moved by Deputy Cosgrave.  What was patriotism then was embezzlement now.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Donnelly has been corrected on that already.  I have here the report of Dáil Eireann, the Minutes of Proceedings, from 1919 to 1921, and on page 218 of that report, in the second column, under the heading of the Department of Local Government, there are five recommendations.  These recommendations were considered in the Dáil separately and on page 223 under the heading &ldquo;Revenue Suggestions&rdquo; we have this:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;At the suggestion of the Secretary for Local Government (I held that office at the time) the proposals in clause 5 for the collection of revenue were referred to the Finance Department for consideration.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>They were not adopted unanimously, as Deputy Donnelly has stated.</P>

      <P>Yesterday I was dealing with the argument of Deputy Corry that it was only the grazier who was hit by the Budget. I was dealing in some detail with the results in the County Mayo of the breaking up of various large farms.  I gave some figures as to the area in that county which was under tillage in 1891 and I made a comparison with the year 1932.  The figures relating to the year 1891 are the last figures we have before the Congested Districts Board was established.  I made the comparison with the area of Mayo which was under tillage in 1932, the last year for which we have any statistical information.  I gave these figures from memory last night.  I now will give them a little bit more in detail.  In 1891 the total area which was being tilled in County Mayo was 105,652 acres, of which 50,352 acres were under corn and 55,250 under roots, principally potatoes.  In the year 1932 there were 36,145 acres under corn and 38,535 <Col N="1006" /> under roots, the total area tilled being 74,795 acres.  In other words, since the policy of breaking up grass farms was adopted, the total area in Mayo under tillage has shrunk by 31,000 acres, very close on one-third of the amount which was being tilled in 1891.</P>
      <P>As regards cattle, in 1891 the total head of cattle in the county numbered 174,983 and in the year 1932 the total number was 208,914, an increase of approximately 34,000.  In case there might be any mistake about it, I will give Deputy Corry one other figure. The total number of cows in Mayo in 1891 was 52,710 and the total number in 1932 was 64,732, an increase of 12,000 cows.  That leaves an increase of 28,000 head of cattle other than milch cows.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy can look up those figures for himself. I am taking the figures which I consider to be of importance and which show what the result up to the present has been of the breaking up of grass farms in Mayo.  When the statistics were taken for 1932 there were 208,914 head of cattle in the county and that shows that the enormous improvement which has taken place in the conditions of the tenant farmers of Mayo by making their uneconomic holdings economic was due to the fact, not that they were in a position to till more than they were tilling beforehand, but that they were in a position to rear more cattle than they had reared up to then. In fact, they are tilling obviously a <Col N="1007" /> smaller amount than was being tilled before.  It is rather hard to find a complete explanation of that.  I think it is largely, though not entirely, due to three causes.  One cause would be that not all the large holdings that were broken up were purely grass lands.  A great number of them were residential holdings, the owners of which did a considerable amount of stall-feeding and, in consequence, had a considerable amount of tillage. Another cause would be that in the year 1891 artificial manure was at a very prohibitive price and consequently there was very little artificial manure being sold and crops were lighter than at the present moment. The third cause would be that when persons have a very restricted area to till, they have to till it again and again and crops naturally deteriorate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand, where you increase a man's area to a reasonable size, he can till fresher land and, in consequence, he will have a larger yield from the fresher land.  It was not necessary to have the same area under tillage, therefore, and I think probably you will find a great deal of the decrease in tillage is due to the fact that the crops are yielding at a very much higher rate now than in 1891. That is the way&mdash;and I think I know that county very well; I do not think anyone can know it better&mdash;in which I account very largely, at any rate, for the decrease in the area under crops. What I want to stress is that the land which has been given as additional is now being used, and has always been used, for the purpose of raising livestock. At the present moment there are more cattle in Mayo than there were before the policy of breaking up the grass lands was adopted.  And yet the position of the people has been enormously improved.  The position of the people, within that period of 40 years or thereabouts, had been enormously improved.  Until this Government came into office that policy had proved itself a magnificent success, and the reason it had proved itself a magnificent success was that people were able, profitably and very profitably, to <Col N="1008" /> rear cattle and sell them at a, to them, very remunerative price.  That has all gone.  At the present moment, they are told, in effect, by the policy of the Government, that they should not rear cattle, that it is highly advisable that calves should be slaughtered.  They are told that they should not have the same amount of stock as they had.  The Minister for Agriculture is going around the country weeping and wailing because he cannot see enough calves' blood shed.  I know that the advice I have given to my constituents and which I will continue to give to my constituents is not to let their land lie derelict, but to see that their land is properly and fully stocked in a remunerative fashion.  That is the advice I am giving to my constituents, and it is the advice I have always given and will continue to give to them because, some time or other, there will be available to them again a market for which they can rear their cattle in the most profitable manner to them.  If the Government policy is carried out, however, it means that all this land which has been given in order to turn uneconomic holdings into economic holdings is now to lie waste and derelict, and the holdings which, by the policy carried out through a very long series of years, were turned from uneconomic holdings into economic holdings are now, by the policy of this Government, to be turned back again from economic holdings to uneconomic holdings.</P>
    <P>That is the result of their policy. They are making every single economic small holding in County Mayo and, I believe, in the rest of Ireland, too, into an uneconomic holding.  It is a complete reversal of the policy carried out through so many years.  It is obvious what happened.  It was not by the break-up of grass lands that tillage was increased.  What happened was this, that by the break-up of grass lands the profits made by grazing were no longer the property of a comparatively small number of persons.  They were spread over a very much larger number of persons.  Let me take the example of an ordinary farm.  One man was making a profit of that farm. That farm was broken up and the profit that one man was making has <Col N="1009" /> been spread over ten people.  That had&mdash;or at least it had until this Government came into office&mdash;a tremendous effect on the social life of the people, and brought about, as I say, an enormous improvement in the economic condition of the people. That improvement, however, was brought about simply because they were enabled to rear cattle where they were unable to rear cattle before.</P>
    <P>I am afraid that Deputy Corry's knowledge of agriculture is not quite so wide as Deputy Corry would have this House believe.  I am afraid that Deputy Corry's agricultural vision is completely circumscribed by his own broad acres.  When you get outside Deputy Corry's broad acres and the proper way of tilling or grazing Deputy Corry's broad acres, I think that Deputy Corry knows nothing at all about agriculture.  That, certainly, is the impression he has left on my mind.  No doubt he is regarded as a great financial expert in Fianna Fáil. Why not?  In the realm of the blind, the one-eyed man is king, and when you have got a front bench, like that opposite, of blind men, it is no wonder that Deputy Corry, with his one agricultural eye, is mistaken for a king. It is an unfortunate thing that the Government Front Bench, including even the Minister for Agriculture, seems to know nothing at all about ordinary rural conditions in rural Ireland. There are 208,000 head of cattle, I said, in the County Mayo.  I think I would be making a very conservative estimate indeed if I said that the net loss in the last two years on those 208,000 head of cattle was at least £5 a head.  In other words, the capital of the small working farmer in that county, by the policy of the Government, has been depleted by at least £1,000,000.  And yet this is a poor man's Government!  A poor man's Government!  It takes £1,000,000 from the small working farmers of the County Mayo&mdash;and it is a poor man's Government!  No doubt, Deputy Norton would think so.  No doubt, Deputy Norton highly approves of that.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton seems to be moved mainly by a very strong feeling of dislike <Col N="1010" /> towards the agricultural community, and Deputy Norton seems to think, as the President thinks, that farmers are not persons to be considered at all, be they large farmers or small farmers.  No doubt Deputy Norton, in dealing with these small farmers with their poor law valuations of £7 or £8 each in the County Mayo, heavily as they have suffered in their main source of income, would agree probably with what President de Valera said last Sunday&mdash;that farmers that used to live on the fat of the land are not now in the happy position they used to be in.  That is the only defect, he says, that we can find in the Fianna Fáil system&mdash;that farmers that used to live on the fat of the land are not now in the happy position they used to be in.  I suppose that Deputy Norton, with that due obedience and with that reverence for Fianna Fáil and for its President and its policy which is such a marked feature in Deputy Norton's character, would also re-echo that these small Mayo farmers and these small farmers all over the country, who are living on £6, £7, £8 and £9 holdings, are not to live on the fat of the land in the future.  They are not to be in the happy position they used to be in.  That is Fianna Fáil's agricultural policy.</P>
    <P>Let me pass away from that question of Fianna Fáil's agricultural policy, because that has done more to impoverish this country within two years than I, at any rate, thought possible for a Government to do.  We are told by the Minister for Finance that everything is perfect in this country, that the country is rolling in money. There is a beautiful paragraph in his Budget statement&mdash;I am quoting from column 619 in the current number of the Official Debates.  It runs as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If, as we are told, the country is in the trough of an economic depression, if there is truth in the statement that conditions here are the worst in Europe, is it not strange that so many more people should be spending so much more money on motor cars, on petrol, tea, beer, betting, and amusements generally&mdash;<Col N="1011" /> so very strange, indeed, as to require no other comment.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>May I ask the Minister for Finance, if he assumes with me for a moment that the country is in the trough of an economic depression and if it be perfectly true that conditions here are the worst in Europe, what would you expect to find except wild and reckless spending?</P>
    <P>Surely to goodness the time when a person has been driven to give up hope is the time when he squanders any few pence he has left.  If a man owes £10 and he has £12, he will be very careful to keep his expenditure down so far as the odd £2 is concerned and to keep his £10 safe to pay his debt.  But if, on the other hand, a man with £5 owes £10 and knows that his debt will not be taken in instalments and knows that his goods and chattels are going to be seized the next day, of course, he will go out and spend that £5.  He will go for the short life and the merry one.  Do you think that the hour before a man is declared bankrupt is the hour in which he is going in for a policy of thrift and saving when he knows that thrift and saving can do him no good?  Is that not the hour in which he goes in for reckless expenditure?</P>
    <P>The Minister says that the drink bill has gone up.  Has the Minister never read in the papers what we frequently see, that such and such a person was driven to drink by financial trouble.  Is that not the most ordinary thing that we see?  What I charge the Minister and the policy of the Government with is that, by their policy they are reducing the inhabitants of this country to despair and the very worst thing which Fianna Fáil is doing is demoralising the people of this State and making it impossible, or nearly impossible, for the people of this State, looking to the future, to see any chance of their emerging from the trough of this economic depression to which the Minister has alluded and which his Party has brought about in this State.</P>

      <Col N="1012" /> There is just one other part of the Minister's speech to which I wish briefly to refer because I think the Minister&mdash;and he will pardon me for saying that he does not always show himself very astute&mdash;showed himself very astute in relation to it.  In one part of his speech the Minister saw where it was very likely indeed that there would be an attack and, in consequence, he proceeded to strengthen what he considered to be the weakest part of his argument. He admits that it is very bad to spend money on payments to unemployed persons when money should be spent on relief work and then there comes his magnificent defence.  He says: &ldquo;I have got a very magnificent Parliamentary Secretary; he is a really top-hole person and a wonderful genius.  He is getting everything ready so that some time we will be able to spend in relief more than we are able to spend at present.&rdquo;  I think that was very ingenious on the part of the Minister because I do not think that in all the Fianna Fáil Party there has been a more colossal failure than the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance.  It is sometimes pathetic in this House to hear that Parliamentary Secretary, when he gets away from mad rhetoric and gets occasionally down to facts, saying: &ldquo;I do not know how to spend this money.  Please, will somebody in the Opposition tell me what to do.  I would be so much obliged if only they would tell me what to do, because I, poor man, do not know what to do,&rdquo; and we discover that the amount of money to be spent on relief works is to be circumscribed, bound in and pressed down by the fact that the Parliamentary Secretary is unable to devise schemes by which relief works can be carried out.  The whole thing is absolutely and hopelessly absurd.</P>
    <P>I am not surprised that the poor Parliamentary Secretary is not able to perform the obvious duties of his post. With these enormous sums of money to be expended, and the enormous amount of work staring in the face anybody who goes over any single part of this country, it is really astonishing <Col N="1013" /> that some large scheme of the hundreds of large schemes that could be put in force has not been put in force by this, and that you are bound down by the fact that the Parliamentary Secretary, the poor Parliamentary Secretary who gave all the best and fruitful years of his life to the service of the Liverpool Corporation, and, in consequence, knows very little about Ireland or Irish affairs, is unable to devise schemes.  That being so obvious and so patent to everybody who has listened to him in this House, I think it was extremely wise of the Minister for Finance to come to his assistance and see where this very obvious, even to the Minister obvious, flaw in the structure of the present Administration was and to try to forestall the attacks which he knew inevitably must be made.</P>
    <P>This is a bad Budget, a very bad Budget.  It is a Budget which, at a time when they are more impoverished than they have been in living memory, at a time when there are more persons unemployed than there have been unemployed in living memory, at a time when there is a huge number of persons upon outdoor relief, a number far in excess of the number last year, at a time when the staple industry of our country is depressed lower than it has been depressed in living memory, is extracting by taxation from a harassed people, an impoverished people like our people, the enormous sum which he is demanding in taxation this year.  Not alone satisfied with taking from the taxpayer of the present day money which the taxpayer can ill afford, he is also, by a policy of raising seven million pounds, making the recovery of this State, when once again it gets into the hands of competent men, more difficult than need be.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I consider that the Minister for Finance is deserving of the most severe censure for introducing a Budget of this kind.  He ought, I think, to have remembered that he was not only Minister for Finance, but a member of the Dáil, and that if there is to be a proper debate, he should <Col N="1014" /> have left some loopholes, some openings, for his critics so that there would not be the excuse for such morbid and pathetic speeches as we have heard during the past two days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is such a thing as being too good at your job and it looks as if the present Minister for Finance had almost erred in that direction.  The speaker who has just sat down has repeated several times that this is too big a sum to take from the unfortunate taxpayers of this country.  He told us that the country cannot afford it, and that the country is being impoverished.  Was that not said, I wonder, of every Budget that was ever introduced since Budgets were first initiated?  I wonder was it ever said in any Parliament of the world that the demand of the Minister for Finance was too small, and that he should have gone in for raising more money?  Is it not a platitude of all Parliaments that every Budget that is introduced is far too great for the resources of the country?  When you have platitudes of that kind filling up speeches, and doing duty for criticism, it is obvious to the most inexperienced person that there is very little to be said in depreciation of this Budget.  When you have a very learned Deputy labouring the point as was done yesterday, and labouring it again and again, that the tariffs which the farmers are subject to in the English market are impoverishing them, and that the tariffs they are paying on the goods that are coming into this country are likewise impoverishing them, you have an idea of the bankruptcy of argument that prevails in regard to the present economic position.  As I say, the learned Deputy who made those two statements laboured them at great length, but he gave us no theoretical explanation of the curious anomaly that they imply: the contradiction by which we pay both the tariffs on the produce going into the British market and the tariffs on the goods coming into this country. Surely the explanation is not so obvious but that the Deputy might very well have helped us to understand it.  It is perfectly obvious, I think, <Col N="1015" /> that if we are paying one tariff we cannot be paying the other, unless some extraordinary circumstances are cutting across economic law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>It is all very well for Deputy O'Leary to interrupt on a matter where economic theory does not come in, but I am criticising now a statement of practically the only trained economist in this Assembly. He advances those two curious facts and asks us to believe them without explanation.  If he had an explanation to offer I think he would have advanced it.  The fact is, of course, that Deputy O'Sullivan had no explanation whatever to offer, and is merely trying to make a case in which he himself does not believe.  If we are paying tariffs on our cattle going into England it is hardly conceivable that we are also paying tariffs on, say, the machinery that is coming into this country, or on the fertilisers or any of those things. You cannot have it both ways, and Deputy O'Sullivan quite obviously wants to have it both ways.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You had Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney making yet another plea for the grass farmer in this country.  Whatever merit there may be in that plea it is absolutely idle at this time.  The whole sense of the country has turned against the idea of this country being a country of grass farmers.  I admit that he makes out a good case for the rearing of cattle as a means of making money, regardless of the distribution of that money, or regardless of the number of people benefited by it.  He makes out a good case for the rearing of cattle as against other forms of agriculture. If there were a prospect that we could again have a free market for an unlimited number of cattle, undoubtedly his appeal would have a great attraction, but very few even in his own Party believe&mdash;I doubt if even he himself believes&mdash;that we will ever again see a free market for an unlimited number of cattle within our time.  It is very strange indeed that a Party which stands for co-operation with England, which stands for closer <Col N="1016" /> and closer understanding with England, or at least claims that it has a prescriptive title in that respect, refuses to take account of the change in English policy, and makes speech after speech regardless of what is going on in England, of the very great transformation of economic policy that there is in England, and of the repeated definite statements that that policy is going to be persevered in, regardless of any effect it may have on the relations existing between themselves and their Dominions, or between themselves and other countries.</P>
    <P>Surely if there is to be any reality in politics at all it is time that Deputies tried to argue by taking into account that phenomenon that has appeared within the last two or three years, the phenomenon of protection in England instead of free trade; not merely a protected England, but an England with a plan of economy which has its basis in quotas and the strictest possible arrangements as to markets.  If Deputies want to carry any conviction with their speeches I suggest to them that they should at least relate their arguments to those very big facts.  They should tell us how they are going to arrange to upset that policy; how, when they come into power, if they ever do, they are going to commence to persuade the Minister for Agriculture and the other British Ministers that that policy will have to be changed and that it is wise for them to change it; and how they will be able to so change it that this country will have practically the same market as she had before the economic dispute started.</P>
    <P>In connection with the figures of the Budget, I confess that there are a number of things which I do not understand and to my mind it would be more profitable if we spent some hours in putting questions to the Minister rather than in listening to speeches all of which resemble each other more or less, and most of which, up to the present at all events, are profitless. So far as my knowledge goes there is one matter on which I must express my disagreement with the Minister for Finance, and that is with regard to meeting the cost of bounties and subsidies <Col N="1017" /> by borrowing.  I cannot see how that can be justified by ordinary financial principles.  Surely it looks inevitable that bounties and subsidies will be an annual item in our Budgets for a great many years.  Is it not the case that for ordinary recurring expenditure it is not considered good finance to borrow, but that it should be met completely out of revenue?  Further, with regard to making the Deferred Annuities Fund the basis for such borrowing I should like to know whether that is mere rhetoric, or whether the sum borrowed is in some way attached to that particular fund.  If it is not, I would suggest to the Minister that when he says he is borrowing against that Deferred Annuities Fund it would be more accurate to say that because the assets of this country have so increased he is justified in borrowing a bigger sum than would otherwise be the case.  I can hardly think that the description given to that particular item is technically correct, that is, that the bankers or whoever are advancing the money are actually being told that the security for their money is the Deferred Annuities Fund. That is the sort of question I should like the Minister to answer.</P>
    <P>I am also a little vague with regard to a number of other items.  There is one question, for instance, that I could not answer if it were asked: why was the last National Loan floated at such a time as it was, or why was it floated at all up to the present?  It seems that practically the full sum is at present lying on deposit in the bank earning some 2 per cent., while the service of the debt probably amounts to about £3 15s. per cent.  Was it merely a miscalculation?  It certainly does not seem profitable to the State that we should be spending unnecessarily £1 15s. per cent. on nearly £6,000,000 of money.  Similarly with regard to the big sum that he provides for the equalisation of interest on savings certificates.  I think it is nearly £2,000,000.  I should like to know where that money is invested.  Is it also on deposit in the bank?  Is it good finance to borrow money at a comparatively high rate while you have money of your own on deposit in the <Col N="1018" /> bank?  We all know of instances of farmers who, rather than touch their deposits, which are earning about 1½ per cent., will go to the bank to borrow money at 5 per cent. or even 6 per cent. in order to buy seeds and manures.</P>

      <P>It is not debatable at all. It is a commonplace in banking experience. The farmers are constantly doing it.  At the same time, one would consider that it would hardly recommend itself to a Finance Minister.  I am rather curious to know how it profits the State to have a big sum of money like the amount for the equalisation of interest on Savings Certificates and the National Loan Sinking Fund unapplied.  These two sums amount to £2,500,000.  I am at a loss to see how it profits the State to borrow money&mdash; because that is what it amounts to&mdash;at, say, £3 12s. 6d., in order to have it lie by at some 2 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Further, it occurs to me in connection with the borrowing that the Minister is about to do for the present year that he could have made the Budget look a great deal better than he has done.  I am quite sure that he is not satisfied that he will want to borrow anything like the £7,000,000 which he mentioned in his speech.  I think he has over £3,000,000 in the Local Loans Fund.  Yet he is arranging to borrow something like £4,000,000 more.  Surely the Local Loans Fund will not use up £7,000,000 in the year. Will it even use up the £3,000,000 which he has in it already and which <Col N="1019" /> is apparently earmarked for particular purposes for which it has not yet been called upon?  If the bulk of the £4,000,000 which he mentioned as required for this year is to be used for housing, I think it is hardly conceivable that there will be anything like such an amount of housing done in one year that such a vast sum will be required.</P>
    <P>Similarly, with regard to the repayment of the Dáil Eireann External Loan, I hardly think that he expects to pay off the full £1,000,000 in one year.  Will he even pay one half of it? It looks to me as if the Minister unnecessarily exaggerated the amount that he will require to borrow.</P>
    <P>It was alleged by Deputy MacDermot yesterday that there was a propaganda to increase the national debt. I have not heard of that propaganda. I do not think there has been any mention of it in any paper up to the present.  I think it is a sign of the poverty of argument against the Budget that Deputy MacDermot had to introduce a matter of that kind into his speech.  He also referred to the agitation for a change of currency.  I hardly think that Deputy MacDermot is much alarmed by the propaganda that is being used in that direction. If he is so alarmed he has this to satisfy him&mdash;that the people who are so vocal on that subject are not taken seriously by the rest of the community. At all events they have not shown an ability up to the present to transfer their message to anybody else beyond themselves.  It is doubtful if in some cases they understand it themselves. It is the least worrying of our problems that there is any danger of interference with currency.</P>
    <P>We were told in several speeches that the wealth of the country is being spent in a spendthrift fashion, that a reckless policy of taxation is being carried on and that the Government are actually trying their best to make the position unsound.  All that is very general.  I suggest that if there is money being spent in a spendthrift fashion, the Budget debate is hardly the time to emphasise that.  That must <Col N="1020" /> be brought down to the particular.  In that way it will arise, of course, on the successive Estimates.  The Estimates considered up to the present have not brought forth any strong statement that in these particular Estimates, at all events, the money is being spent in a spendthrift way.  We will wait and see whether, on the Estimates that are to come on, that case will be made.  I hardly think it will.  I doubt if the effort will be made.  I doubt if there will be many Estimates, for instance, on which a division will be called simply on account of an excessive demand.  That these general statements should be made by successive speakers, to my mind, demeans a big debate of this kind.  After all, it is a cross-roads type of argument that the Government are spending money in a reckless way, that they are piling up taxation, that they are a spendthrift Government.  In order to have any conviction here, at all events, the speakers will have to particularise a little.  They will want to lay their hands on the unnecessary services. They will want to point out where the extravagance is taking place.  Most of the things introduced that have led to the higher demand of the Minister since the Government came into power are things upon which the Opposition have not even divided.  In most cases they have not even attempted to make a case against them.  The large sum, for instance, required for the Unemployment Assistance Act in this year's Estimates was not opposed by the present Opposition.  I do not think they have ever divided on the bounties question.  When they attempted to divide on the question of the butter bounty their own Party split on the matter.  So far as I can remember they did not oppose the extension of the Old Age Pensions Act, which is responsible, of course, for a considerably increased sum over what the previous Government spent.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied so far as I have examined the Budget that this £28,000,000 of money which is to be collected by the Minister this year is going to be spent wisely and for the benefit of the community generally.  I think there are a great number of <Col N="1021" /> services that represent a very urgent need of the community in the present circumstances. The increase of expenditure on such services as forestry, for instance, must be gratifying to everybody, since it means an increase in employment and increased assets for the country.  Altogether, without going into details, anybody who examines the Estimates for expenditure will be satisfied that on the whole they represent moderate estimates.  They represent good investments for the public.  They represent good services for the community, and particularly for the class of the community that need the services and the help of the State.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, the method of raising the money that the Minister proposed to raise is, I think, as equitable to everybody as could be devised. Notwithstanding that many of us are not personally concerned with income tax, the decrease in the income tax is, on the whole, a very wise decision.  To my mind it would have been better if the Minister had never gone higher than 4/6 with his income tax.  I think he would probably have got as much out of a 4/6 rate as he got out of a 5/- rate, and the main effect on the income tax paying community would have been to his advantage and to the advantage of the community generally.  Similarly, the reduction in the tea duty is a very welcome item of the Budget.  Altogether, I suggest that the Budget is as sound, beneficial and healthy as it could possibly be expected to be in this country, considering the present circumstances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The use of a word or phrase has an enormous effect on people.  When the Minister introduced his Budget, people said he had been remarkably clever.  I did not realise how clever he was until I listened to Deputy Moore.  I am sure Deputy Moore is representative of a vast number of people in the country.  I am now satisfied that the Minister was clever in putting his Budget statement in the form he did, seeing that Deputy Moore misunderstands the effects so easily.  I do not pretend to give a very elaborate examination of the Budget. <Col N="1022" /> To begin with, I do not think that the Budget statement, at this moment, is as important as it used to be in former years.  The great importance attached to the Budget was always due to the fact that it was in the Budget that the position of taxation for the full year was indicated.  Now we have a Government with extraordinary powers who can by order impose new taxation. We know that the tax on sugar at the moment is so much.  Next month it may be more or less.  The same applies to the tax on tea; so that the Budget has not the same peculiar significance it used to have.  Secondly, we come to the phrase &ldquo;balancing the Budget.&rdquo; That was always used as indicating something that was desirable.  But people used to think that the desirability consisted entirely in balancing the Budget.</P>
      <P>With the powers the Executive Council have they could spend twice as much as they are spending and they could balance their Budget.  What they are doing at the moment has brought down the capital resources of the country.  The capital resources of the country, as the President said last week, are very enormous.  Possibly they are bigger than a great many people thought.  It seems to me clear that the ordinary taxation of a country should be put in relationship with the income of the country.  I have no doubt that there is a capital value in this country to the extent of hundreds of millions of pounds and that the Government could, with its tyrannical powers, bring in a budget for £100,000,000, and could collect it because the only people who could escape are those people who, as the President boasted last Sunday, are the people who are drawing £12,000,000 in dividends from outside the country. Those people could, by leaving the country, escape paying any income tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The President last Sunday made a formal declaration of war upon the Kulaks.  He said that they were to be deprived of their rights.  He indicated a policy of expropriation with regard to them.  They are the people who are peculiarly tied here.  At the time Deputy Flinn and Deputy Dowdall <Col N="1023" /> were on his platform, and he did not say that he was going to advocate expropriation against people of wealth. Deputies Flinn and Dowdall would be nervous about that.  But he said there were men in this country who possessed wealth, which wealth is not mobile, and he indicated that we have power to seize it.  Those farmers living upon the fat of the land are the people he indicated and for that crime they are to suffer.</P>
    <P>We could have the Minister for Finance coming in here smiling and balancing a Budget of £100,000,000. The Minister thinks that the mere balancing of a Budget is a feat deserving of all praise.  He thinks to bring in an enormous Budget is a great feat. But to bring in an enormous Budget by overburdening taxation is not a good thing.  Overburdening the country with taxation is not only undesirable but it is a definitely criminal and unlawful act for the Government to do.  When we were in power the present Government Party announced that they had made a very careful and minute examination of Government expenditure and were satisfied that the figure could be reduced by £2,000,000 a year.  We did not believe that they meant that honestly.  Neither would I cry out too much about it.  The Minister for Education got up here and admitted frankly that that was their way of fooling the people and trying to get the votes of the people by those promises.</P>
    <P>If the country had improved in those last few years in production I would have said that the Government would be quite justified in increasing taxation.  But they promised a £2,000,000 reduction.  They brought in their first Budget and there was no £2,000,000 reduction in it.  There was one part of that Budget called an Emergency Budget.  We were told that this additional taxation had to be put up because the Government had inherited from the Cosgrave Administration a bad position but that when they got over that they could give a decrease of £2,000,000 a year. The increase that year was about £4,000,000.  When the Government <Col N="1024" /> promised a reduction of taxation by £2,000,000 a year they were to be elected for a period presumably of five years.  That would mean that the people would be taxed actually to a sum of £10,000,000 less than was the case under us in a period of five years. In the first year they put £4,000,000 extra on, which meant that in the remaining four years they would have to reduce taxation to a sum £14,000,000 less.  They did actually give themselves another year of life by having an election a year afterwards. They have now some three and three-quarter years to run.  There are three more Budgets to come during the potential lifetime of this Parliament.  They increased taxation in the first year by £3,950,000.  I will be fair to them and I will say that £350,000 of that was in relation to arrears of income tax which, presumably, would not repeat itself from year to year.  Therefore, the ordinary Budget of that year was about £3,600,000 more than it had been under the decried Cosgrave Government.</P>
    <P>The next year there were more increases. There was no reduction on the £3,600,000.  There was an additional £140,000 of customs and again an additional £13,000 of customs, bringing the sum up to about £3,700,000.  This year, anybody would have thought&mdash;and poor Deputy Moore probably thought it when the Minister was speaking&mdash;that he was budgeting for a lesser sum than the Budget of last year.  As Deputy Cosgrave pointed out, he is actually budgeting for a larger sum because the additional sugar taxation put on in February is calculated to bring in about £400,000.  Then there are other items which, if it were not for the deductions that have been made, would have brought the Budget up. It has been increased over what it was in our time by £4,300,000, but the Minister is making remissions to the extent of £560,000, so that actually the Budget this year is only for a small sum over what it was last year. In these three Budgets the Government has increased taxation over what it was in our time by nearly <Col N="1025" /> £4,000,000 each year, so that in the three years running they would presumably have to reduce taxation, in order to fulfil their promises, by £10,000,000 plus the best part of another £12,000,000.  They would have in the three years to come to reduce taxation to about £7,000,000 less than it was in our time in order to fulfil their promise; but, of course, they have no intention of fulfilling their promise.</P>
    <P>The President, last Sunday, said they were doing splendidly, and that there was enormous wealth in the country. He takes credit for the fact that there are about £12,000,000 coming into the country by way of dividends.  He takes credit for all forms of wealth in the country, as though he had inherited in 1932 a country denuded of all wealth, and he assumes that in two years he had created the enormous wealth that exists.  I could easily say he inherited all that from our ten years of office. The fact, however, is that neither did we inherit a country completely denuded of wealth.  There was a great deal of wealth in it in our time.  Is the country as wealthy now as it was two years ago?  If it is, you might say that if the Cumann na nGaedheal régime were justified in imposing taxation as they did, this Government would be doing no greater harm, if any harm at all, by imposing the same taxation.  If the production of wealth in the country had increased you might say that the present Government would be justified in increasing taxation.  But here already the Government have taken out of the pockets of the people an excess of £12,000,000.  Is that coming out of more wealthy pockets?  Is the country more wealthy than it has been?</P>
    <P>The Minister seems to speak as though there were two separate entities, Government wealth and the country's wealth.  He said that he had even a surplus at the end of the year and he was balancing his Budget.  He could have made a much larger surplus. Last year it seemed to me that the Government imposed enormous extra taxation, had carefully estimated the amount of yield of the various taxes, and it seemed quite natural to expect that actually the yield of the taxation <Col N="1026" /> would be much higher than the Government anticipated.  Last year I doubted very much if the Finance officials were really responsible for the estimate of the yield of the various taxes imposed, because it seemed to me that they were ridiculously under-estimated.  There is, it is true, a reduction in income tax. It is true the I.R.A., the people who waged war upon the country, have reason to congratulate themselves because they are going to get pensions. It is true there have been certain reductions, but there have been certain increases, too.  The biggest was made in February.  There was an increase of £4,000,000 a year in taxation.  The Government increased some items and decreased others, and they consider they are entitled to be patted on the back.  They say that they should be congratulated because they balanced the Budget.</P>
    <P>As the President said last Sunday, there are tons of wealth in this country.  They are going to run their full term of office and they are going, according to the President, to pay their way all the time.  Of course, he can do it because he has supreme power.  Any person who may feel unhappy, any person like Deputy Flinn for instance, can take a boat and go at once to England.  These people cannot be touched.  I think the Minister was quite right in reducing income tax because there are in this country, rather more so than in other countries, a great many people whose source of wealth is outside the country. They live here because they like to, but they are not bound, such as are people who earn their living here, to live here.  We have all sorts of retired civil servants and others who are dependent on dividends, and in practically every case where the person is dependent on dividends the money comes from outside.  Consequently, if there is too great a disparity between the income tax here and in England a point can be reached at which they would say: &ldquo;We can prefer to do without the amenities in Ireland and we will go to live elsewhere.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I should say about £180,000,000, but I do not know exactly. The people who have an income in that way are in a much safer position than are the farmers, many of whom, according to the President, are living on the fat of the land, and who are held up by the President as an example when he appeals to the lust of his followers. If they were living on the fat of the land they would soon be in the grip of the Minister for Finance who would say: &ldquo;As long as they have a penny left for me to grab I will be able to balance my Budget and then I can call upon everybody to say what a clever fellow I am.&rdquo;  Is the country richer? The Minister talks about the people buying motor cars.  Has the average purchase of motor cars equalled the purchase in the two years previous to this Government coming in?  I doubt it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Apparently, from what the Minister says, when this Government came into power the people made up their minds that they would, economise for a time and would postpone buying.  Mind you, motor cars are not luxuries.  People have to utilise lorries and other vehicles of that sort.  If you postpone buying one year you may have to buy more the next year.  For instance, you might say that last year you spent nothing on clothes, but if you bought none last year, the probability is that you will have to buy more this year.  But taking the two years and, say, a year ahead, I should like to know then if the motor cars bought&mdash;and, as I said, motor cars are not necessarily luxuries; very often a man has to buy a motor car or a lorry for use in his business and to pay an excessive tax on it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is not taking into account the fact that last year we <Col N="1028" /> must have been nearer to the saturation point than in 1931.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>What does the Deputy mean by saturation point? According to the President the saturation point of taxation in this country is the amount of wealth in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously there is a saturation point in regard to motor cars.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously.  I quite agree.  The Deputy is indicating that you cannot deduce, from the number of motor cars bought in a given year in relation to the numbers bought in another year, that that represents an exact ratio of respective wealth between one year and another.  I quite agree with the Deputy.  That is what I was saying.  Deputy Moore said that Deputy O'Sullivan, I think it was, had said that the farmers here are paying the tax collected in England on what we produce, and that at the same time they and the rest of us are paying here the tariffs imposed here.  The Deputy seems to think that that represents some sort of thing that cannot happen. It can happen.  In England the farmer produces beasts and brings them into the market and sells them in the market.  He pays no tax.  Our farmer here produces beasts and goes over and has to sell them at the same price as the English farmer.  That means to say that the farmer, here, if he pays £6 tax, has to get £6 less than he would get if the tax were not there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy referred to machinery. If we in this country were manufacturing machinery, but still required to import some machinery, and if England was producing machinery and had no other market for it but our market here, and we had no tariff on our own goods at all, but had a tax on imported machinery, we would be manufacturing machinery here with the same overhead charges as in England&mdash;the same labour costs, the same costs for raw material and everything else&mdash;and the machinery would be made for £X.  The English would be manufacturing machinery also for £X, but coming over here to sell, and <Col N="1029" /> having to sell here because they had no other market, what would happen? The Irish manufactured article, identical in every way, and subject to the same overhead expenses, would be sold for £X&mdash;£X plus £Y for profit.  In England it costs £X to make that machinery.  Would it mean that as it costs them £X to make them, if they come over here they would get £X plus £Y?  Not at all, because they would have to deduct any tariff we would put on.  As far as our imports from England are concerned, remember that practically everything that is being made in this country now is protected by an enormous tariff, so that our prices do not represent what you might call ordinary competitive prices.  Our manufacturers, when they make a thing, if there is a tariff of 70 per cent. on it, can make the same thing as is made in England and charge the people here 70 per cent. more than is charged in England.  When goods are coming from England the tariffs collected by the Minister are paid by the people here.</P>
    <P>If Deputy Moore would like to go over to England, as I did last year, and to wander around places&mdash;towns much like Irish towns, depending to a large extent on a hinterland of agricultural life&mdash;he would notice that although the English farmer gets&mdash;let us take a beast as an example&mdash;£6 more for every beast he produces, everything that he has to buy for the production of that beast is cheaper than what the Irish farmer has to pay for the production of his beast.  The Irish farmer has to pay more because of the tariffs, and he gets less for his beast because the British Government deduct a certain amount.  When the Minister for Finance was playing about with his figures it transpired that the money accumulated in the Reserve Fund&mdash;£4,600,000 or something like that&mdash;was poured into the Exchequer.  I do not want to misrepresent the Minister, and he can correct me if I am wrong.  Then, he says: &ldquo;What a splendid financial position we are in!&rdquo;  That money was collected in the way of land annuities and poured into the Exchequer.  Personally and morally I object to that action, because <Col N="1030" /> what he did was, in effect, to make State ownership of land in this country. The farmers in this country last year paid in tariffs to England £4,552,000. As far as the people in this country are concerned, they have not only paid the taxation imposed by the Minister, but an additional £4,552,000 to the British Government.  That was additional taxation which came out of the pockets of the farmers here.</P>
    <P>There are other forms of additional taxation, however, that do not appear here.  The Minister has imposed multitudinous tariffs on things coming in here.  He has collected a lot of money, and presumably a great many of these tariffs were for the purpose of protecting industry here.  If he puts a tariff of, say, 70 per cent. on some article, a certain amount of which is made here and a certain amount is imported from England, as far as the amount imported from England is concerned the tariff that is paid goes into the Exchequer, and the Minister comes here and says that so much is collected. We say that the people of this country, in such a case, are paying out another farmed-out tax.  If I start a factory here and make a thing on which there is a tariff of 70 per cent. and put it up to the full value to make it equal to anything that is imported, I am imposing a tax on the people of the country of 70 per cent. of the value of those goods because, if the Government did not interfere, these people would be able to buy the thing for 70 per cent. less than I am charging.  What happens is that the Government farms out the taxing power to other people, and any manufacturer who is benefiting from that tax by being able to charge more is actually a tax gatherer.  All this is being applied to this country at a period when the whole world crisis has affected everybody, and the result is that we, at this moment, are one of the countries which are not benefiting by the return of prosperity.</P>
    <P>A little while ago we had Ministers going around telling people that they need not bother about the British market, that the British were in a bad way themselves, that they had to tighten their belts, and that in any case they were not able to buy our <Col N="1031" /> goods.  Things have changed in England now, however.  Deputy Moore cannot understand how it is that we can suggest that it is possible for the Irish farmer to get back into the British markets.  He says that the British now have tariffs also protecting their own industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I said, on the same terms as before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite agree&mdash;not on the same terms.  The Deputy may not know that at the time of the Imperial Conference in 1926 the British Government, at that time, intended to embark on a tariff policy which would include the putting on of tariffs on imported agricultural produce.  When they were dealing with that&mdash;again I am speaking from memory&mdash;they did not say to us: &ldquo;We are sorry that this is our policy; we realise that it is going to injure you.&rdquo;  Not at all.  The whole line was that so long as they had had free trade in agricultural produce, they had not been in a position to give any specially favoured position to the Dominions.  A change of Government took place in England, and the new Government that came in did not intend to go ahead with the tariff policy of the previous Government. They did not turn to us and say: &ldquo;We are not going to tariff imported agricultural goods.&rdquo;  What did they do? In order to make amends for that change of policy, with the resultant evil effect on us, in that we would still have to compete on equal terms with all foreign countries in the British market, they imposed taxation on the British people to the extent of millions of pounds to promote the Empire Marketing Board, which put on posters all around England pictures advertising our goods, Canadian goods, New Zealand goods and so on.  They taxed the English people to do that, and the purpose of it was to get the English people to give us and other Dominions a voluntary preference, because the Government was not imposing a preference by law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They imposed that taxation on the people in England because they realised that the previous agreement, <Col N="1032" /> by which they were going to tax imported agricultural produce, had justified us in looking forward to being in a specially privileged position which would have benefited our trade considerably.  Now, Deputy Moore says that the British have gone ahead with the policy they proposed in 1926 and, therefore, we have no hope whatever of being in that market. Yet the British themselves, after 1926, felt that because they were not then pursuing the policy they are pursuing now, they had injured our position in their market and the possibility of our making profits in their market and that it was necessary for them to impose taxation on their people to start the Empire Marketing Board as a very inadequate substitute for what they would have done otherwise. In the negotiations with England, not only was it abundantly clear, during the whole time I had anything to do with them, that we could expect terms as good as those given to other Dominions, but I make this statement, that it was abundantly clear that we were in a specially favoured position and that we could expect either to get better terms than the other Dominions get, as we do at this moment in relation to double income tax, or that having regard to our special position, the privileges given to all the Dominions would be increased in order to make it something that would be appropriate for us.  That is our experience.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moore thinks that because the British are now tariffing agricultural produce, we can never get into that market again.  On the contrary. I do not care to prophesy but I can prophesy with just as much basis as the Minister for Finance has when he prophesies that more motor cars are going to be purchased this year, that, if the present Government or their successors negotiate with the British, they will be able to get into a better position than they were in before, because before we were merely competing on equal terms with everybody else when the British were charging nobody for the privilege of marketing their goods in their market.  They could not charge less than nothing <Col N="1033" /> and, therefore, all were on equal terms.  Now, when they have embarked on this policy, a tariff policy is necessary if you are going to have a system of preferences and the British are now in a position to give preferences as they were not prior to a couple of years ago.  Why should we, after ten years' experience of the British, who were always anxious to go far to give us good conditions, expect that that is now completely changed?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Deputy say what does he think was their motive in being so eager to give preference to this country?  Was it good will or good business?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Largely good will. This was one of the elements in it. Another thing is that we were geographically very near to them and another is the long identity in Government between the two countries which put us in a special position.  A further item is that we are very large buyers from England.  The Deputy may remember that at the 1930 Imperial Conference, at the first plenary session which was open to the Press, each country got up and said that in respect of such and such an item they did more business than any other Dominion except the Irish Free State. Everyone of them had to except the Irish Free State because we did more business with them than any other country and on that purely business account, it was certainly to the interests of the English to take special steps to see that the trade relations existing between the two countries continued, and improved, if possible, and that in no case would the British Government do anything which would react against those trade relations.  There were both business and sentiment in it and I assert that so far as my judgment went, sentiment itself was the element.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Just write it down, pass it over and we will do our best. Deputy Moore says that this is not quite the time to discuss certain things and that the Estimates would be the proper occasion and then he says that the Opposition cannot have much objection because most of the Estimates go through without a division. He said that the Opposition do not vote against the bounties or against unemployment assistance.  If the Government creates a certain evil in the country, necessarily, we must support anything which will tend to remedy that evil.  The Government, having destroyed agriculture in this country, is trying to support certain aspects of it by giving bounties.  I personally object very strongly to bounties but if the Government creates a situation in which people or a class have been definitely injured by the Government, to the extent of not being able to earn a living and in which they are definitely losing their capital, I do think that, although I object to the principle of bounties, I would have to support bounties.  Does that mean that we agree with the Government?  Not at all.  I object to the Government having created a situation in which bounties are necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same applies to unemployment. The Government, by its policy, has increased the incidence of unemployment in this country enormously.  With that enormous increase of unemployment you have an evil.  The Government refuses to depart from its policy, and we have not got the power to force them to depart from their policy, and when they are continuing in this course, which means increasing unemployment, we cannot stand by and say that we will vote against any measure of relief for the people in this position. We would in that case, presumably, <Col N="1035" /> be forced to support Votes in relief of unemployment, but we maintain, and it is, to my mind, quite demonstrable, that it is the Government's own policy that is making the increased unemployment benefit necessary, as it is, the Government's own policy that is making the bounties necessary.  To my mind, there is a great deal of dubious finance in the Minister's Budget.  I do not intend to go into it all, but 5 per cent. is the amount he has allowed for overestimation in connection with Supply Services, and not 4 per cent. as he suggested.  It is really 5 per cent., while in our time we allowed 2½ per cent.  As our experience with estimating went on, the margin of excess tended, as far as my memory goes, to be less.  The Minister now says that he calculates that the Departments this year have overestimated to the extent of 5 per cent. Did they over-estimate to the extent of 5 per cent. last year or the year before? I think that is very dubious finance, but I am not going to fight about it.</P>
    <P>On the question of bounties, two-thirds of the bounties are to be raised by loan.  Presumably, that means that either it is regarded as a capital expenditure, which will be remunerative&mdash;that is, obviously, not intended, because the poor wretches who get the bounties probably have to spend them before they get them&mdash;or it is not regarded as a normal annual expenditure, but as a terminable expenditure occurring only in one or two or three years.  What does that mean?  Deputy Moore, I think, was quite right there. We are told we are going to embark on a policy of wheat production.  You have people going around talking about the amount of wheat grown here in 1841, when you could get a poor serf in this country to work for 3/- a week, before Canada was developed, and when economic conditions both here and in that country were different.  We are going to get back to the happy position when there will be thousands and thousands of fields of waving wheat all over the country.  What is the idea with regard to bounties?  I understand from the Minister's statement <Col N="1036" /> that the bounties are only for a short period.  What is going to be done with regard to wheat?  Is the farmer going to be called upon in a year or two to grow wheat, and market it at a profit without any Government assistance?  Is it intended then that the farmer shall produce wheat at the price at which it can now be bought without a tariff from Canada, Australia or the Argentine, or are the unfortunate bread-eaters of this country going to have to pay more for wheat, and its products, so that the farmer will get an economic price for the production of wheat?  What is going to happen?  I do not want to go over the whole lot of the bounties, but just take wheat.  Is the bounty on wheat going to continue or not?  If it is going to continue indefinitely, and the wheat policy is going to grow year by year, then I would presume that the bounty on wheat is going to increase, and multiply, as I might say, and is not going to be terminable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Deputy is not under the misapprehension that the bounty on wheat is provided out of export bounties and subsidies.  I think if the Deputy will refer to the Cereals Act he will see the source of the bounty for wheat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Then the bounties that are to be borrowed are purely the bounties on goods being exported.  We are then to look forward to a position in which we shall cease to export any agricultural produce to England, or to a time when there will be this long-talked of settlement with England, and the farmers will be able to export their produce without requiring any bounty? What is going to happen?  The President last Sunday, I think, did his usual business, although I remember that for years&mdash;and it is probably still there&mdash;there used to be scrawled on a wall in Dundrum: &ldquo;Peace with England, never; vote MacEntee.&rdquo; President de Valera has departed from that policy so graphically enunciated in Dundrum, and announced that he was quite ready to make peace with England and look for preferential arrangements.  What is the good in pretending that there is any prospect <Col N="1037" /> of a settlement with England so that the farmers will not need bounties on exports, if we are going to continue under the present policy of the Government? One time we are told &ldquo;the English market is gone, thank God.&rdquo; The next minute we are told that the President is ready and anxious to make peace with England on his own terms. If those bounties can be justly put down as temporary expenditure it means, as I say, either that we are going to cease exporting to England, or that we are going to make peace with England.  I think the Minister, in justifying that, should have pointed out to us what the prospects were of either getting an alternative market, or profitably consuming our goods here, or of making peace with England.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What was the last statement we got on this dispute with England?  We have had the Minister himself going around saying that it was only our criticisms which prevented the British from caving in.  I should like to know what is the point of dispute with England. The last we heard was that our Government wanted the question of land annuities to go before an international court, and the British Government would only agree that it should go before a Commonwealth court.  The surrender of the British Government in those circumstances would mean that our Government, either by material sanctions or by moral sanctions, should force them to agree to let this matter go before an international court.  The President himself, in the very early stages, if I remember rightly&mdash;I do not want to misquote him, and I have not the reference here&mdash;said, in effect, that he quite agreed that we would be likely to get a more favourable decision from a Commonwealth court than from an international court.  At one time I asked the Attorney-General would he, as a lawyer, advise that it was likely, probable, or even possible that any conceivable international impartial court would decide otherwise than that we were legally bound to pay those land annuities.  I asked him for a reply to that.  His reply was&mdash;again I do not want to misrepresent him&mdash;that any lawyer would be a fool not to recognise that there could be two interpretations <Col N="1038" /> of anything.  The fight between the two Governments was on the question of a tribunal.  The victory of the Irish Government, as last indicated, would be that the British should be forced to let this matter go before an impartial international tribunal, so, in pouring this money into the Exchequer, this Reserve Fund, we must assume that the Government is convinced that it is certain beyond yea or nay that an international tribunal would decide that we had the right to retain that full amount here, and that the British were bound to pay the bondholders out of British taxation.  That is what is implied.</P>
    <P>I would invite the Attorney-General to get up, and, regarding the Government as his clients, say if he would advise them to take that matter before an international tribunal with a certainty that that international tribunal would decide in our favour.  I should like to hear if, as a lawyer, he would give that advice to the Government. The Government is acting not merely as if they had that advice but as if it were certain beyond yea or nay that any international tribunal must necessarily decide that we have the right to retain that money, and, acting on that assumption, they poured that money into the Exchequer.  Again, talking about additional taxation, the Minister said, if I heard him rightly&mdash; I have not since read that portion of his speech&mdash;that there was a national debt of £92,000,000, a capital sum represented by the annuities and other payments we had to make to England. Now, a national debt, if I may say something that will sound very startling, is a debt that is national.  If a debt is national, presumably every national shares in the liability for that debt.  With regard to those land annuities, if that £92,000,000 was a national debt, how much annually did the Minister for Finance pay when we were paying the interest on the Sinking Fund on it?  How much did I pay? How much did President de Valera pay?  We paid nothing at all, and why were we excepted from the payment of the interest on the Sinking Fund on the national debt when every national had a share in the responsibility for it? <Col N="1039" /> It was not a national debt at all, and the Minister knows that perfectly well, because it was a debt in relation to certain specific assets in this country, and the people who control those assets were paying the debt and the Sinking Fund on it.  I do not want to keep the House on this point, but it seems to me perfectly ridiculous that the Minister and his back benchers should have got up and shouted about this being a splendid Budget.  I should like to know what is splendid about it.  It has balanced. We agree to that, but it could be splendid for a number of reasons; for instance, because it relieves the people of burdens.  This Budget imposes more taxation on the people this coming year than the Budget of last May imposed on the people for that year.  What have we got to shout about?  More taxation this year than last year, as far as I can judge, and the country poorer than it was last year.  We have the pretence that this country is getting richer, and everybody knows that the vast bulk of the farmers are not only poorer, but poorer to the extent of having to live upon capital assets, and not upon the production of capital assets during the year.</P>
    <P>The President, last Sunday, in that scandalous speech, that class-war speech, that war-upon-the-Kulak speech which he delivered, indicated that he looked round at the wealth possessed by the people of the country and he is quite satisfied that as long as the people possess any wealth at all there is no reason why the Budget should not be balanced and why he should attempt to curtail Government expenditure. The Minister and the President both indicate that they have an idea in their minds that as long as the Government controls sufficient money everything that is required is there.  They completely abstract themselves and the Government finances from the national finances.  The Government could tomorrow, by its power, become enormously wealthy and be able to have hundreds of millions to spend and everybody in the country completely impoverished.  That would not be a <Col N="1040" /> good position.  A good position is when the Government takes from the surplus wealth of the people, takes from the annual production the minimum amount necessary to carry on the Government services, and only takes the minimum amount from what the people are actually earning.</P>
    <P>Here in this country, being an agricultural country, we have this peculiar position, that you can have a small farmer whose annual income would work out at only one-half or one-quarter the annual income of an industrial worker, say, in Manchester.  If you take his capital assets, however, they might be 20 times that of the industrial worker in Manchester.  The industrial worker may be getting £5 or £7 per week and his capital assets might be a chair, a table and a bed.  The farmer here may be living on 12/- per week actual income, and at present many of them are living on less, and his capital assets may be a farm, a farmhouse, agricultural implements, stock and crops. The industrial worker in England has the income, the farmer here has the capital.  The taxation in this country should be related to the actual income of the farmer and not to his capital. The Minister, in his Budget statement, and the President, in that scandalous statement he made last Sunday, both indicated clearly that they see only that the people of the country possess a certain amount of wealth and, as long as that wealth is there, there is no reason why the Government itself should collapse.</P>
    <P>I can refer to a document which the Government a year or two ago were very fond of quoting, &ldquo;Quadragesimo Anno,&rdquo; where the Pope says that the prudent Pontiff who was his predecessor had stated that it was unlawful for a Government to impose taxation or tribute which denuded the people of their patrimony.  That is to say, that it was unlawful for a Government to take the people's accumulated wealth, savings, capital, etc., in the way of taxation or tribute.  That is exactly what the Government is doing and although it can balance its Budget next year possibly, as it balanced it this year, its policy is undoubtedly leading the country along <Col N="1041" /> a path where it is only a matter of time until the country comes to bankruptcy. For that reason I think that the Budget, if anyone takes the trouble to examine it in relation to the condition of the country, is a Budget which not only condemns itself but condemns the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowdall</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot help saying that it is a great thing to have the &ldquo;gift of the gab.&rdquo;  Deputy Fitzgerald has entertained the House for about 55 minutes and has proved to his own satisfaction that for this Government to save the £2,000,000 which they stated they could save before they came into office they would have to reduce taxation by £7,000,000.  He said he did not believe they could do it.  Towards the close of his speech he said that a Government in framing its Budget should endeavour to do it in accordance with the ability of the people to bear taxation.  That is exactly the position at the present time.  I am rather in favour myself of prudent and conservative finance, but not at the expense of the health of the great majority of the people. What is necessary to keep them in existence and, if possible, in good health should be raised not alone out of taxation, but even out of the capital of the country.  A prudent father does all he can, even with his capital, to fit his family for the battle with the world.  The Government is at present extracting, perhaps, a very large sum from the people, but what is the object of it?  It is in order that the people in the times to come will be able to avail of the opportunities which this Government is providing for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to have been forgotten by speakers on the opposite side that when they were in office and were able to continue with a comparatively small expenditure for ten years there was an average of 20,000 people per year who had to go out of the country, who were practically jettisoned because the country could not afford to support them.  That is no longer the position.  We have to support them now whether we like it or not.  I am pleased to see that this <Col N="1042" /> Government are spending some £7,000,000 more on social services in one year than was spent by the previous Government.  I am not going to blame the other Government.  The other Government had certain ideas as to what should be done, but they are not the same ideas that we have got, and evidently they are not the same as the ideas that the people have, because they are not the Government any longer.</P>
    <P>There is no question whatever that it is the duty of a Government to see that the people are provided for in times of stress, even if it has to come out of capital assets.  It is not extravagance to spend money if it is spent for the benefit of the people and if the spending of it is necessary.  I am not a great believer in doles, but if doles are absolutely necessary, then they have to be provided.  What necessitated the payment of doles in England?  Lloyd George paid doles because if he did not there would have been a revolution. We are paying doles because if we did not the people would starve.  Let me say that if we do not make some provision for the young people who are growing up it is very probable that there will in time be a revolution or a very unsatisfactory state of affairs in this country.  I do not think that anybody could object to what is necessary to guard against evils of that kind.  I did not hear the whole of Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney's speech.  The Deputy quoted some figures in refutation of some remarks of Deputy Corry.  Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney quoted some Mayo statistics. In 1891 there were 170,000 cattle in Mayo and in 1933 there were 202,000 cattle.  That is something like a difference of 30,000.  When I heard Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney speaking I went down and I looked up the statistics of population of the County Mayo and I took the years 1891 and 1926.  In 1891 the population of Mayo was 219,000; in 1926, the population was 172,000.  That is a decrease of 47,000. We have here an increase of 30,000 in cattle and a decrease of 47,000 in people.  I think it would speak better <Col N="1043" /> for this country if we had people in stead of cattle, if we could support the people.  That is one of the fundamental questions to which people speaking from the Opposition Benches never seem to pay sufficient regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowdall</NameTxt>
      <P>Not in this proportion. At the time of the Famine, or the year before it, the export of cattle from the whole of this country was 200,000 annually.  I think the cattle exports came to about 1,000,000 or a little over 1,000,000 when we were all united.  That was an increase in cattle of something like 800,000 in the way of exports.  In the meantime do not forget, as the President said on Sunday, that at the time of the Famine there was a population in this country of 8,750,000.  That population has decreased from 8,750,000 to 4,250,000 for the whole country, and that has happened in the lifetime of people still living.  Do Deputies on the opposite side imagine that the substitution of a trade of 800,000 cattle and an improvement of the finances of certain people in the community is sufficient compensation for the loss of that 4,500,000 people?  If we go further and follow the travels of those people across the Atlantic and see what happened, I do not think we could clap ourselves on the back and say we have done some good for the country by putting cattle instead of people on the land.  I do not think so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On yesterday, Deputy MacDermot referred to the increased income we have from our investments abroad and he said that that was a tribute from England to us just the same as the land annuities were a tribute from us. I do not agree with that at all.  I only mention it because it gives me an opportunity of referring to another matter on which the country should get a clear view and clear thinking.  If I invest my money in Courtaulds&mdash;the Deputy spoke of a farmer who had 100 shares in Courtaulds&mdash;I pay for what I am receiving.  Therefore, I must get something back.  I facilitate them in carrying on their business and I am <Col N="1044" /> entitled to get something back.  As a matter of fact, that is a secondary consideration in my argument.</P>
    <P>What I want to refer to in that connection is this&mdash;one of the Deputies here, discussing the Estimates, pointed out that we in this country last year had an increased adverse balance.  He said that on a smaller trade the adverse balance was a matter of £16,000,000.  Anybody talking about an adverse balance in that connection would apparently like to give an impression to the country that we were living on our capital, that we were going downhill fast and that it was only a question of a very short time when we would not be able to carry on at all. I do not know whether that Deputy understood the question or whether he intended to convey to the people that we were in a very bad way.</P>
    <P>I happen to have here a review by a firm of fatbrokers issued to their customers.  All the figures that they quote in that review are officially from the Board of Trade.  I should like this to get very definitely into the minds of the people because it is rather important that there should be no misunderstanding as to what an adverse balance really means.  In the 15 years, from 1919 to 1933, the English had an adverse balance of £5,359,000,000.  Having such an enormous adverse balance as that they should not be in existence at all. In the year 1920, 14 years ago, the total English trade was a matter of £3,489,000,000 in imports and exports; and they had an adverse balance of £378,000,000 that year.  In the year 1933, they had on a total trade of just under £1,100,000,000&mdash;that is considerably less than one-third of their trade in 1920&mdash;an adverse balance of £259,000,000.  If you take it in proportion the adverse balance on a trade of less than one-third in 1920 should be something in the neighbourhood of £99,000,000.</P>
    <P>Naturally, on those figures one would say that England is going to the dogs. But that is not exactly correct.  There are the services that England rendered in banking, shipping, carrying, and so on and those things have got to be taken into account as well as her <Col N="1045" /> interest on investments in foreign countries.  Deputy McGilligan referred to that.  That is really the way we are able to pay for our excess of imports over exports.  It is by reason of the revenues that we get from investments in England and abroad.  One thing that struck me as most extraordinary and a thing that is a constant source of amazement to me is the extraordinary value the people on the Opposition Benches, and even on our own, pay to the value of words and how little regard they have to facts.  We have heard here time and again about the markets.  Deputy Fitzgerald brought the matter up again to-day &ldquo;Give us back our markets.&rdquo;  The fact of the matter is that while to a certain extent the markets are still there, they are going.  There is no question about their going.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture in England, or at least his deputy, has stated that the tastes of the people in England are changing; they are eating other classes of meat instead.  There has been a certain reference made by Deputy Fitzgerald to the trade boom in England.  I am very pleased to hear of it, and I hope it continues.  But in their major trades through which they export goods to all parts of the world, they are meeting with severe competition from younger and more vigorous people who are prepared to live on a lower standard, to work harder and for longer periods, and who are able to send goods into all countries of the world at prices that England cannot attempt to touch.  I have heard, though I am not going to vouch for it, that the Japanese are able to sell silk in England cheaper than the English can sell artificial silk.  I do not know if that is actually a fact, but there is never smoke without fire.</P>
    <P>From the time I first came into this House the Opposition have adopted the policy of obstruction, one long continuous policy of frivolous obstruction. They have attempted time and again to prevent the Government from carrying out its policy.  They have endeavoured to make our Government appear ridiculous and they have attempted to misrepresent the Government in everything they have done.  In <Col N="1046" /> the interest of the country at large it is about time that class of thing should stop.  Some effort should be made by the leaders and members of the Opposition Party to examine the situation of this country with relation to the changing conditions in the world and they should endeavour to ascertain whether or not our Government's policy is not a good policy.  For many years the Opposition Party, when in power, carried out a certain line of policy.  They neglected to do the essential things which we are now doing and that possibly is one of the principal causes why they are in their present position.</P>
    <P>I do not want to say anything that might embitter people or that might tend to make more difficult any effort at an <i>entente cordiale</i> between the Opposition and the Government Parties.  I should not like to say anything that would make any effort in that direction more difficult.  I would like all the people of this country. Unionists, ex-Unionists and all the others to come together, endeavouring to put aside their traditions and their prejudices, in order to examine the present position clearly and carefully so as to see whether or not the policy that they think should be in operation can any longer be of use to the country.  I would like to see whether they can get into their heads that the policy they have been advocating so far is no longer possible.  I think it would be very desirable in the interests of the country if all Parties would meet together to consider existing conditions. I do not think that that would be altogether impossible.  This evening, in the House, good feeling was manifested between leading members of the Opposition and the Government Party arising out of business that was under consideration.  If that type of good feeling existed to a greater extent, I do not think the country would suffer as a result.</P>
    <P>I am inclined to think that the members of the Opposition have a tendency to put too great a value on words; they cannot, so to speak, see the wood for the trees.  They are so obfuscated by the apparent brightness of their own oratory that they cannot <Col N="1047" /> see the vital matters which are all-important from the point of view of the country.  I quite agree that if expenditure could be kept within reasonable limits it would be extremely desirable. Any money that is expended should, of course, be expended primarily in order to better the conditions of the people.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Budget, I have received a letter from one of the biggest business-men in England, a man who is a chartered accountant, and he ought to know what he is speaking about.  He is in a position to place a definite value on the figures that were submitted in the Budget.  He is not a man who would give an opinion lightly, and I commend his observations to the careful attention of the House and the country.  The spate of oratory that we have had here against the Budget is of no importance whatever in comparison with the informed opinion of this man in England.  He wrote to me saying that our last Budget was a very fine performance, a very creditable performance indeed, and it was a great indication of the strength of the country in a very difficult year.  There has been a good deal of talk here in the House about the low prices we have to take for our cattle and for our produce generally, and there is no doubt whatever about it, although I remember the price of eggs being lower than they are at the present time, even with the 40 per cent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasPatrickDowdall" hpid="Mr. Dowdall Mr. Dowdall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowdall</NameTxt>
      <P>The net result has been, that, although we entered the year 1933 with a record low level of prices, we finished the year at a still lower level.  I have a list of items here&mdash;oils, fats, and so on&mdash;and the drop in prices averages 27 per cent. on the lot, and if you take the smallest item there is an average of over 30 per cent.  I think it would be just as well if people would bear in mind, when they are discussing these things, that had there been no economic war at all there would be these quotas, restrictions, or other restrictions, such <Col N="1048" /> as tariffs, to prevent the usual interchange of commodities and that prices would be practically as low as they are now.</P>
      <P>There is a duty of 40 per cent. on our butter.  That came to 17/- a cwt. a fortnight ago.  The tariff against Danish butter is 15/- a cwt.  So that, at least, for a short period of time, the penal duties to us as compared with the Danes amounted to 2/- per cwt. That is all I have got to say, except that I do really feel that at this time the people should realise that a considerable change has taken place in this country since the Treaty.  Conditions have been altered very considerably. In England, now, they are going in for what I might call a more national policy than they did.  They are endeavouring to foster the production of their own agricultural produce, and they will have to proceed along those lines and, naturally, will have less and less regard, as they do so, for their friends in this country or for their friends in New Zealand, Australia or anywhere else.  I do think, and I really am earnestly and sincerely desirous, that those people who, perhaps, consider that they belong to the minority in this country, should reconsider their position and see if they cannot fall into line and back up the policy of the Government as indicated in this Budget, and that they will alter their attitude in that regard, and I am sure that they, above all people, would be the principal gainers if they did so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>After the delightful Sunday school homily just delivered by my fellow-citizen and colleague, Deputy Dowdall, it is with some temerity that I rise to address myself to the Budget.  I am not going to challenge you, Sir, or your conduct in the Chair, when I suggest that Deputy Dowdall has been allowed to ramble over every conceivable subject that could be brought into a Budget speech. However, Sir, I want to say this, that I have always compared the position of a Chancellor of the Exchequer or, in this case, the position of a Minister for Finance, to that of the ordinary housekeeper or housewife who has to provide <Col N="1049" /> for her home for one week or two weeks, or for one year or two years. Boiled down, that is what it really means.  Assuming for one moment that that housekeeper has a sum of £200 per year to provide for a family of any number of persons for that period, her wisdom will guide her to this extent at least, that if she finds herself at the end of a year owing £10 she knows full well that she has got to make it up in some way or another. Deputy Dowdall, however, in the course of his speech, talked about the necessity now being greater than ever it was before in the history of the Free State to provide all the social services and other things that are provided for in this Budget.  Did he examine the causes for that?  Did he throw his mind back at all nine, ten or 11 years? Deputy Dowdall is a business man.  I am sorry he is not here.  It is one of the surprises of my life, one of the many surprises by the way, when I have heard successful business men speaking at public meetings&mdash;and when I say that I do not mean cross-roads meetings, but meetings of Chambers of Commerce, and other similar bodies supposed to be responsible&mdash;making the most foolish and silly statements. I often wonder at their success in business.  That has been well exemplified to-day by Deputy Dowdall talking like a child&mdash;a second Alice in Wonderland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dowdall appears to have a very short memory.  Let us recall some of the things which have occurred in the last nine, ten or 11 years in relation to this Budget.  A former Government, namely, the Cumann na nGaedheal Government, led at that time by President Cosgrave, now Deputy Cosgrave, to whom most financiers in Europe and most statesmen in Europe paid the very highest tribute as a man and as the head of that Government, handed on to its successors institutions of State built up in a time of trouble and travail, when President Cosgrave and his Government were attempting to build up a State out of chaos and almost out of ruin, and succeeded what time a movement was active in the country to destroy and to ruin any attempt at <Col N="1050" /> building up institutions of State or Government in this country.  That was an achievement which has never been brought about by any Government or any President in any country in Europe.</P>
    <P>Many tributes have been paid to this country for its wonderful resources and for its wonderful recovery from a state of chaos and from two revolutionary periods.  To whom is that due?  Certainly not to the present Government. Let us examine things in their proper perspective.  Deputy Dowdall must have forgotten all about that when he talked about the necessity now being greater than ever it has been to provide the social services, and all those things which the people require, but surely he must have his head up in the clouds when he does not observe the things that are passing round him?  Does he not know, as I know, that, in the City of Cork to-day there were never so many people unemployed in the history of this country?</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary says that is not true.  I will prove to him that it is true or that the figures of his Department are wrong.  I will bring the Parliamentary Secretary back to that, and we will prove who is right or who is wrong. Deputy Dowdall spoke of the menace that threatened England in the form of Japanese importations.  Does he not know, or is he only half a business man that he should not know, that England has taken certain precautions to prevent this dumping of Japanese goods produced by underpaid labour into Britain?  Surely he must know also that even in our own State&mdash;and I quote from an Irish newspaper&mdash;not so long ago, information had then been received in Dublin &ldquo;that large orders have been placed by a number of firms for clothing of Polish origin which is being distributed by a London firm at the following prices: boys' knickers 11/6 per dozen pairs; overcoats £6 6s. per dozen; velour coats at 13/6 each.&rdquo; These prices include a duty of 60 per cent.  Deputy Dowdall must surely be aware of these facts and of this Government having to take the necessary steps <Col N="1051" /> to prevent the dumping of such goods into this country.  He must know also, unless he is wilfully blind, that Britain has done the same thing in relation to Japanese imports.</P>
      <P>We were told something about prices by Deputy Dowdall, but I want to relate most of my speech on this Budget to national affairs, national events, in so far as the Twenty-Six Counties can be considered a nation.  I should like anything I have got to say now to bear a particular relation to the city I represent, and these figures will speak for themselves.  One of the largest carrying companies in the Free State, if not the largest carrying company, conveyed in the four months ended 30th April, 1931, 27,347 cattle, 860 sheep and 46,202 pigs.  In the corresponding period in 1934 the figures were 15,513 cattle, 39 sheep and 5,342 pigs.  In other words, there were 20,000 beasts carried in the period January 1st to April 30th, 1934, as against 74,000 beasts in the corresponding period in 1931.  One need only give that illustration to prove that the trade of Cork is very seriously declining, and what is true of Cork is true of nearly every other part of the Free State.</P>
      <P>Deputy Flinn challenged me when I said that things were never worse in Cork than they are to-day.  We shall see.  I have returns from three or four organisations, such as the Child Welfare League, of which, by the way, I am a member, and the St. Vincent de Paul Society, all showing that increased numbers of persons had to be relieved during the year 1933-34, and I challenge Deputy Flinn to deny that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">

    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I can quote them for Deputy Flinn on another occasion and give chapter and verse for what I say. Deputy Flinn challenged me on a former occasion with having either overstated the facts or with not having given the facts.  They are almost synonymous terms.  Speaking on the relief of rates on agricultural land, in <Col N="1052" /> column 500, volume 50 of the Official Debates, I said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It was also found that as a result of the facts I have just related the St. Vincent de Paul and other charitable organisations were at the end of their tether and were appealing for still further funds.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Later on in my speech I was interrupted by the Minister for Finance, and I said in column 503:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If the Minister would come with me any day&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
      <P>and then, I said in parenthesis:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;I will not stage it for him&mdash; on a visit to Cork City and look at the numbers of people who come trooping up to my house daily&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
      <P>and I want to emphasise those words for a particular reason&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;whilst I am at home and ask these people who have to line up at the employment exchanges what they think about the statements made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce or ask some of the agriculturists, particularly the agricultural labourers,...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I do not want to quote too extensively. In column 1048 of the same volume, Deputy Flinn said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We are told by Deputy Anthony that he cannot go home without finding a whole queue of people outside his door for employment.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>There is a misquotation for you!  This is the wonderful Deputy Flinn who never makes a mistake.  He is so meticulously careful that not by any chance does he make a mistake.  He will prance up and down like a prize racehorse and never make a mistake, but here he wilfully misconstrues and misinterprets the very words I used&mdash; and I say &ldquo;wilfully misinterprets&rdquo; because were it not for his wilful misquotation of other people's speeches and actions, he would not be sitting where he is to-day.</P>

      <P>Were it not for your wilful misrepresentation and wilful misquotation, not alone of what I said, <Col N="1053" /> but of what responsible ex-Ministers have said, you would not be where you are to-day.  The Deputy went on to say:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We are told that the St. Vincent de Paul Society in Cork is bankrupt and that its bankruptcy is due to this cause and to the distress that exists.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Deputy Flinn proceeds:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;What are the facts?  Let us take Saint Anthony to start with.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Of course, everybody knows that is I.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I shall put another witness in the box&mdash;the Bishop of Cork.  The Bishop of Cork, at a meeting of St. Vincent de Paul Society, said there is no case, in the present conditions, for a special appeal in Cork this year&mdash; that is, compared with last year.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Bishop of Cork never said any such thing.  Within the last few weeks the Bishop of Cork issued a special appeal to the charitably disposed persons, because of the terrible distress&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is all right now, St. Malachy.  Before the rather useful interruption of the Parliamentary Secretary, I was going to say that it is usual, when reviewing the economic affairs of the country in any parliament that I know of or have read of to have some regard to perspective.  It is also usual, or at least it is one of the amenities of decent parliamentary life&mdash;of which, of course, Deputy Flinn has no knowledge, and which he would not even appreciate if he had&mdash;to pay some tribute to the Party or to the persons who have built up the State, or have contributed in any way to the building up of the State.  We heard Deputy Dowdall some few moments ago talking about normal conditions. He said that the tendency here was to belittle the efforts made by the present Government to do certain things.  I should like to ask Deputy Dowdall has he had any regard at all to tradition or to recent history?  Has he even endeavoured to make himself acquainted with recent history?  Does he know that every step which the Cumann na nGaedheal Government took was frustrated by the members who now occupy the Front Bench on the opposite side?  They may talk about giving £250,000 for the widows and orphans, and £180,000 to the people who attempted to break up this State, but if we had back the many millions of money which President de Valera cost this country we could provide not alone for the widows and orphans we have here in our own country to-day, but for the widows and orphans who had to leave the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the kind of thing I should like Deputy Dowdall to study as a business man.  I am speaking to him as a business man, and nothing else.  We do know that the revenue of the country has been, to some extent, swelled by the imposition of tariffs. A kind of artificial stimulus has been given to certain industries.  In relation to that, I would ask the Minister for <Col N="1055" /> Finance, or the Minister for Education who, I presume, is now acting as his deputy, to have some regard to what the leading economists of the world have to say in this matter.  Some time ago a famous economist, who should be well known to the Minister for Education&mdash;I refer to Henry A. Wallace, the famous American economist&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;wrote in <i>Foreign Affairs</i>, January, 1934, under the heading &ldquo;Tariffs, Quotas and Import Duties.&rdquo;  Here is what he said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Those are the weapons of economic warfare which are more deadly than artillery, Those economic weapons have a nasty way of bouncing back on you with redoubled force when you think you are using them against the enemy.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is the way we handled the present economic dispute with Great Britain. We retained the annuities, and Great Britain is collecting them on the double.  Deputy Dowdall says that the market in England is gone.  Then why the devil are we paying to get into it if it is gone?  Deputy Dowdall is a business man.  Proceeding, this writer says: &ldquo;Fundamentally, those weapons are spiritual in nature.&rdquo;  Of course, we are a spiritual nation.  I suppose that is why we so warmly embraced the tariff policy, because this writer says it is spiritual in nature.  We are also spiritual.  We say an act of contrition into a fellow's ear after we shoot him.  The writer goes on: &ldquo;although this is not recognised by business men and by very few statesmen.&rdquo;  That is a thing that I would commend to the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I notice that we had a speech commending the Budget from Deputy Norton here last evening.  He recounted the sins of omission of the last Government, namely the Cumann na nGaedheal Government.  They did not do this, they did not do that, and they did not do the other thing, but he forgot to relate all the things they did do.  He went on to praise and over-emphasise what the present Government was about to do in relation to the social services.  I heartily applaud <Col N="1056" /> any attempt made by any Government to increase the social services of this country.  As one who has given almost a lifetime in the service of the working-class people of this country, by pen, and by speech, and by my money&mdash; I have never yet received any fee or reward for anything I did on behalf of the working-class people of this country&mdash;I do feel that it is not playing the game with the working-class people of this country, having regard to the fact that in any civil disturbance which may take place in this country or in any other country it is the working people will always suffer most although they are in most cases the people who are least able to bear that kind of suffering, that they are to be told by this kind of juggling with figures that this is a magnificent Budget.  I think Deputy Norton is misleading the very people whom he pretends to represent in this Dáil.</P>
    <P>I notice that there is an omission from the Budget of any relief for a certain section of the community who, through the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union, a Union which I do not know much about, but which Deputy Norton knows something about, expressed their surprise that this Government is doing nothing to take the tax off beer.  This is a resolution I have received:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;At the general meeting of the Cork Brewery Workers Section of the Irish Transport Union, held in Connolly Hall, the following resolution was passed:&mdash;&lsquo;That we, the members of the Brewery Workers Section of the Irish Transport and General Workers&rsquo; Union again respectfully request the Minister for Finance to consider the advisability and justice of reducing the abnormally heavy duty on beer and thereby assist this southern industry which is one of the few of a similar nature now functioning in the country and providing employment not only to the direct workers but to many others.  That copies of this resolution be sent to the Cork T.D.'s, to the Irish Labour Party and the Press.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that Deputy Norton <Col N="1057" /> has received this resolution.  I listened very carefully to his speech, but he made no reference to this resolution coming from the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union, which I suppose most Deputies are aware is a fairly powerful, if not very influential organisation.  At least they pretend to be very powerful and the Irish Labour Party, as at present constituted, is composed, I should say, to the extent of 90 per cent. of members of this organisation.  Yet none of them has brought this resolution before the House.  As one who is not attached in any way to it, having no affiliation or affection for the same Union, I should like to bring it forward.</P>
    <P>There is also another omission in this Budget and that is that no allowance has been made for widowers whose children have finished school. These widowers are, in consequence, deprived of the £45 which they should have been allowed in the ordinary way. Some of my constituents who are widowers, who have to rear families and who, in some cases, are in receipt of pensions or allowances of some kind, or superannuation, have complained that they have not had the advantage of this £45 allowance.  That is one of the things which I would ask the Minister to look into because it affects a very large number of people in my constituency.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to delay the House any further except to say that whilst I welcome any gestures from this Government or any other Government that will increase the social services, that will provide for widows and orphans, that will help the poor and the necessitous, I do feel at the same time&mdash;and in expressing this view I feel that I am voicing the sentiments of thousands and thousands of the Irish working classes&mdash;that it would be far better to provide work rather than to be issuing this kind of dole. Work is a thing that is ennobling and the provision of doles, to any great extent at any rate, in lieu of work will have a most demoralising influence. I ask the Minister in conjunction with the Minister for Industry and Commerce to devise some other <Col N="1058" /> means of helping unemployed people here rather than by giving the dole. If the Minister provides them with useful and productive work, then I feel that he will be doing something in the direction of a really good and constructive effort.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>In this voluminous production from the Minister containing very many eloquent paragraphs I was particularly struck with one, and that was his reference to the newspapers. He said: &ldquo;It was difficult for the layman to conceive why an account of a Budget surplus would not make as good a story as any other from the reader's point of view.&rdquo;  I agree with the Minister.  This particular Budget provides very interesting reading.  In fact, one might compare it to a detective story.  I think no detective story would provide a problem more difficult to unravel.  In detective stories of a certain kind you are provided with a map of the scene of the murder. With the Budget statement we were handed a document explanatory of the Budget.  This explanatory document, which in itself is much more concise than the Budget, would to the ordinary reader be rather perplexing.  For instance, on one side of it the Minister, by a series of additions and subtractions, arrived at a figure of £28,232,000, which he says he can extract by revenue.  He hopes to have that income in the coming year.  On the other side, he says that he will have an expenditure of £36,000,000 odd.  I did not read it all, but if I had read this voluminous document I presume it would go something like this: The Minister scratched his head and said: &ldquo;I have £28,000,000 revenue; how the deuce am I going to spend £36,000,000 odd?&rdquo;  Then he says: &ldquo;Oh, I have it; I will borrow £7,250,000 somewhere; I will reduce my expenditure somewhat.  I can borrow one quarter of the amount of my income and then I will only have to find £28,854,000.&rdquo;  Then he says to himself: &ldquo;I forgot altogether when making this calculation that I was going to bring in some new services this year for which I shall have to provide another £600,000, so that my total has gone up again to <Col N="1059" /> nearly £29,500,000.  I am, therefore, nearly £1,200,000 out and what will I do?&rdquo;  Then another thought struck him and he said: &ldquo;I don't want that £36,000,000 at all.  I will take £1,200,000 off my first thought and then I will balance it.&rdquo;  To the ordinary layman reading that document that is what it amounts to.  By a series of borrowings and reductions of his own estimate the Minister has satisfied himself that he can balance his Budget.</P>
      <P>After a cursory run through the Budget itself I was struck by the absence of ameliorative remedies for the principal industry of this country &mdash;agriculture.</P>
      <P>Nowhere in the Budget could I find a reference to the farmers except where there was provision made for bounties. The point that strikes me in regard to these particular bounties is that the Government, in giving bounties to the farmers, to make up to them what they have lost, and are continually losing through the action of the Government, attempt to persuade the farmers that they are helping them. The Minister forgets that the bounty has to be paid by someone, and that the farmers pay most of it.  He is practically getting no relief back.  The Minister has practically admitted that any relief offered by way of bounties to the farmer is not relief at all.  Because when discussing in this House in February last, the relief of rates question, the Minister said that if the local rates were made a charge upon the Central Fund, it would be only taking money out of one pocket and putting it back into the other.  I hope he will admit the same is true in regard to these bounties&mdash;that it is simply a case of taking the money out of one pocket and putting it into the other.  That leaves him as he was and &ldquo;as he was&rdquo; means that his exportable surplus is taxed 40 per cent., that his income is reduced 40 per cent., and that at a time his taxation is increasing more than 40 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce went into the question of the <Col N="1060" /> annuities.  He taunted us with having changed our minds in the last few years with regard to the annuities.  He went into a series of arguments, beginning in 1926 and 1927, trying to prove that every day we changed our minds.  One day, he said, we admitted there was no moral or legal liability for paying the annuities, and another day we went back of that.  Our position in regard to the annuities is the same to-day as it was from the beginning.  I am sure I can speak for all the members of our Party on that matter, and, as to myself, my position has been exactly the same from the very beginning.  At every public meeting for the last five years, at which I spoke about the annuities, I maintained we had a moral right to pay them.  I maintained that the annuities were borrowed moneys by which we purchased our land on an arrangement made with the tenants; that we had a legal liability for them, inasmuch as it was accepted by our Parliament as a legal liability.  Having said so much, we added that the time had come when other Governments&mdash; foreign Governments, if you like&mdash;were making arrangements with the British Government for revision of their debts. While not denying our debt, we contended we could make a good case for revision, and for partial remission of our payments.  We never went back of that.  We stand to-day where we stood always; and we hoped and believed the Minister would have a better case to make for a new agreement in regard to the payments to Britain.  They were not in this House when the original arrangements were made.  They would be in a better position to argue the case than the late Government.  They could argue that they came into office when Governments all over the world were appealing for remission of their debts, and, possibly, the circumstances of the times would be more propitious for them than their predecessors. Instead of doing that they took another course.  They took action from which we foretold consequences would follow, if they attempted to break an agreement without consultation with the other party to the agreement.  We foretold that in such circumstances certain consequences would follow. <Col N="1061" /> They did follow, with the result that everyone now knows.  We had the foresight to contemplate what would happen in certain circumstances and what, eventually, did happen.</P>
    <P>We make no excuse for having told our agricultural people what would happen to them if certain things took place.  I have, myself, spoken as openly as any Deputy, and I make no apology to any Deputy or Minister for having forewarned the agricultural people of what would happen to them. I only regret that our prophecies were fulfilled to the letter.  Indeed, the disaster to the agricultural community was much greater than we could fully conceive.  However, the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Agriculture have tried to persuade this House that agriculture, at the moment, is a thriving industry and that the various men and women engaged in it have no reason to grumble.  Their belief, if they do believe such a thing, that agriculture is prosperous, is upheld in this Budget, because there are reliefs for every section of the community, but no mention of any relief or hope of a relief for the sufferers from the Ministry's action.</P>
    <P>There is further provision for social services, for people unemployed and for widows and orphans.  Nobody grudges these relief.  None of us, on this side of the House, ever argued that provision should not be made for unemployment.  When we spoke on the subject of relief works we regretted the occasions for the need of such relief. We have always maintained that the proper way to help in this particular matter was by the provision of work rather than by doles and other such artificial reliefs.  I personally regret that the action of the Ministry has added thousands to the ranks of the unemployed.  It is a lamentable confession for the Ministry themselves to have to come to this House, time after time, in every Budget, with increasing demands upon the people for the relief of the unemployed.  If the country is one-tenth as prosperous as Deputies opposite would make us believe, there would be no necessity for the provision made in this Budget, and the artificial <Col N="1062" /> dope offered to the unemployed in this country&mdash;I refer to the Minister's own words in his Budget statement&mdash;which amounts to an attempt to persuade the unfortunate unemployed people that they are getting great relief where, in fact, they are getting none, and where they are only being handed back a part of what has been taken from them in the last two years.  By the constant imposition of tariffs, as the Leader of the Labour Party pointed out, the Ministry have added to the cost of practically every article that the unfortunate labourer and his family consume, and they have taken from them many millions in the last couple of years.  They give them back a paltry million or two and say: &ldquo;Here is a present for you,&rdquo; but they never mention the huge sums that they have taken off these unfortunate people by means of the additional price they have to pay for practically every article that their families and themselves consume. In the Minister's Budget statement I find that the extra sum derived from revenue last year would more than pay what the Minister proposes to give back in relief to these unfortunate people.</P>
    <P>The Minister got out of revenue last year £1,500,000 more than he expected.  Deputy Mulcahy asked him a question to-day: to state the particular items that helped to bring in that extra revenue.  The Minister only mentioned a few, and these were articles the cost of which presses most heavily on the working classes.  He mentioned wearing apparel, boots, woven tissues and some others.  The total on these few articles amounted to £650,000.  As the Minister did not mention them, I do not know what the other articles were that helped to swell the revenue by £1,500,000 more than the Minister expected, but this I can say, that the Minister got a good deal more out of the labouring man than he is giving back to him now.  This is the Minister who gets up, and in peculiar language tries to explain to the labourer, to bamboozle him into the belief, that he is getting something for nothing, that he has a generous, good-hearted Ministry at the head of affairs here, and that as long as the <Col N="1063" /> Minister is there, there is no fear of him.  The policy of this Ministry in regard to the labourer is: take all that he has and give him back some.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dowdall, in the course of his speech, rather gave emphasis to my argument: that the Ministry had failed in making provision for the unemployed. He was trying to make excuses for the policy of the Ministry in regard to doles.  He said that he did not believe in doles, but that if they did not give doles the people would starve.  That is the position we find ourselves in in this prosperous month of May, 1934: that after two years of the great Fianna Fáil Ministry, a Ministry that was going to provide everything possible for all possible kinds of people, and particularly for the unemployed, a Deputy on the Government Benches gets up and acknowledges that if it was not for the niggardly doles provided in this Budget the people would starve, and I believe they would.  I believe that even with the addition of this sum of £600,000 odd which the Minister is providing for the unemployed this year, which he more than took from them last year and will take again next year&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="StephenJordan" hpid="Mr. Jordan Mr. Jordan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jordan</NameTxt>
      <P>And the year after, because he will be there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the labouring people will still be starving.  In the explanatory sheet which has been placed in our hands we find this peculiar position set out: that the Minister proposes to borrow this year 25 per cent. of his estimated revenue. I attempted at a cross-roads meeting down the country last week-end to explain this Budget to some people.  One does not like to go into millions when addressing a meeting of labourers and others in an unfortunate position at the present time.  When they asked me what I thought about the Budget.  I said to them: &ldquo;Look at it this way: You have £28 a year now.  For some reason or other you find that you cannot live on it, and you say to yourself, &ldquo;Bedad, I cannot live on less <Col N="1064" /> than £36 a year, and what am I to do? I know.  I will borrow £8 and will then have £36 this year.  I will live well on that.  God is good for next year, and having borrowed a quarter of my income for this year, I will borrow another quarter next year.&rdquo; Perhaps he will if he is lucky, but I suggest that he will find it very difficult to do that the third year.  The Minister, if he proceeds on the lines that he has laid down for himself this year of borrowing to the extent of a quarter of his estimated revenue, will rapidly arrive at the stage when he will be in the same difficulty as that poor man.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that in the Minister's haste to make even this meagre provision for the unemployed he was driven by the Leader of the Labour Party.  Perhaps I should have said &ldquo;maybe the Leader of the Government,&rdquo; because in his speech yesterday Deputy Norton spoke as if he was the man who was doing things, or rather, that it was his Party that was doing things.  In one sentence of his speech he said that &ldquo;this year instead of sitting on our oars&rdquo; we are doing so-and-so. The inference to be drawn from that was that he was compelling the Minister to provide this, that and the other.  Deputy Norton, on the many occasions on which he has spoken in this House, has dealt with the question of tariffs, but he did not once mention them yesterday, or what they mean to the labouring men of the country. He did, however, indulge in some references to Deputies on this side.  He challenged Deputy Cosgrave as to what Deputy Cosgrave would do in certain circumstances.  He made jibes at Deputy Cosgrave, and said that if Deputy Cosgrave was a poor unemployed man he would not speak about doles as we speak about them.  I would like to make this retort to Deputy Norton: that if Deputy Norton were an unemployed man&mdash;I do not believe he ever was&mdash;he would much prefer honest work to doles: he would look for a Ministry that would give him work or leave him with the work that he had rather than a Ministry that attempted to keep him from starving by making such a <Col N="1065" /> niggardly provision as we find here having put him and his brother-workmen out of work.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton ought to be the last man to speak about Deputy Cosgrave's knowledge of the unemployed.  Deputy Cosgrave, and some of us on this side, know just as much about the needs and the sufferings of the unemployed as Deputy Norton does.  I do not know how often Deputy Norton has marched as a real member of the unemployed, or how many welts he has on his hands from honest work.  But some of us on this side&mdash;for instance, myself&mdash;know from experience what it is to be unemployed, to be without the wherewithal to provide the necessaries of life while one was unemployed. Having had that experience, I think I can express in this House the real feeling of a workman when he is unemployed just as well as Deputy Norton can.  I know that if at the moment I was unemployed I would much rather meet a Minister or an individual who would offer me honest work at a fairly honest wage than someone who would propose to provide me with charity or a niggardly dole that would not be sufficient to keep me in fair comfort.</P>
    <P>This Budget is falsely balanced.  I venture to say that if any commercial concern were to present its shareholders with such a budget, a budget that can only be balanced by borrowing to the extent of 25 per cent. of its income, it would not be called a reasonable budget, particularly if it were a budget which took a slice of the carefully prepared Estimates for expenditure amounting to practically £1,200,000.  I regret that the Minister has not made any provision for the needy farmers of this country.  I doubt if any provision the Minister could make out of his borrowings would suffice to help in any way the unfortunate agriculturist. There is, however, a way in which the Minister could help not only agriculturists but people generally engaged in industry.  That is by putting the country back into the position, or a somewhat similar position, as we enjoyed two years ago, when the value of our exports greatly exceeded the amount we had to pay in taxes.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1066" /> Looking at a return of our exports a day or two ago, I found the lamentable position that in fact our taxation at the moment is a good deal more than the value of our exports.  A country whose taxation has mounted and whose taxation, as far as one can judge, is going to continue to mount beyond the sum total of the value of our exports, cannot continue very long in a solvent position.  This country is solvent. Nobody has argued that it is not. Various Deputies on both sides of the House have borne testimony to the solvency of the State.  It was due to the solvency of the State that we managed to exist in fairly tolerable circumstances up to this despite the policy of the present Ministry.  There is a limit, however, to the powers of resistance even of this State, and if we are to go on imposing taxation which exceeds the value of our exports, there must be a breakdown and there will be a breakdown.  Capital is bound to leave the country.  Capitalists will not invest their money in a State where you have taxation to such an amount. Some Deputy, I think it was Deputy Dowdall, referred to the immense income we derive from foreign investments. We do derive a big sum from foreign investments, but I am afraid there is one thing likely to result from the policy of the Ministry here, and that is, that, having lost our agricultural exports, I am afraid we shall have to export another commodity&mdash; export capital from this country. People who have capital will find in other countries a use for it that they cannot find here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnDonnelly" hpid="Mr. Donnelly Mr. Donnelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnelly</NameTxt>
      <P>A good deal of it has gone already.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>And more will go. There will be an outpouring of capital because of these leakages and because of the legislation which the Ministry is passing here if certain remedies are not adopted.  There is only one remedy, and that is to give a chance of restoring prosperity to the farmer and of putting the country into such a position that the value of our exports will at least equal the amount of our taxation.  This is a Budget that, on the Minister's own showing, might be considered to be reasonably well <Col N="1067" /> balanced, a Budget which the average man and woman, reading it at a glance and taking the Minister's exposition of it, might think a good Budget, but on a realisation of the true facts any particular class, from the labourer up, will find, as I said a moment or two ago, that what he is getting painted in glorious colours is only a small part of what has been taken from him.  I do not know that any Deputy in the House is particularly enthusiastic about the Budget.  We certainly on this side are not.  I am sorry that I cannot compliment the Minister by describing this as a very good Budget, a term which Deputy Norton applied to it.  I think Deputy Norton should be the last Deputy in the House so to describe it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGovern" hpid="Mr. McGovern Mr. McGovern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGovern</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to say very much on the Budget.  A lot of figures have already been quoted on this side of the House.  So much the better for me, because I am a bit diffirent in going into figures.  A Deputy on the other side said that he did not understand this Budget.  I think I can make the same confession and not be a bit ashamed of it.  I do not very well understand it, because whatever I learned in figures seems to be out of date now.  For instance, I was taught to believe that you could not take a greater sum from a lesser. I think the Minister for Finance has exploded that old-fashioned idea, because he showed us how we can not only take a greater sum from a lesser, but how we can also have a substantial surplus.  How he has got this surplus it is very difficult to see.  He has borrowed £1,000,000 and some hundreds of thousands of pounds from what he called over-estimation.  He has also decided to borrow, approximately, £7,250,000 from some other source&mdash;I do not know was it from his imagination.  I hope he will get it anyhow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another source of revenue to which he has not referred at all.  I do not know exactly what he has cornered from the farmers.  I think he has an accomplice in that case, because John Bull on the other side is doing his <Col N="1068" /> part.  He is fleecing the farmers to make up for the annuities.  I do not know whether the Minister will enjoy the whole of this or not, but whether he does or not, we do know that the farmers have got to pay on the nail. They have got to pay £4,000,000 or £5,000,000 to Great Britain, and they are paying an equal amount on the produce they sell in the home market. They were paying that before the quota was fixed, but since the quota has been fixed, and since there is only a limited number of cattle exported, the losses are still greater on the unlicensed stock.  All that stock has to be sold in the home market, and is sold subject to this extra loss.  The price of the unlicensed stock must be regarded as the general price of all cattle sold in the home market.  Taking this £7,250,000 from borrowing; £1,250,000 from over-estimation, and £4,000,000 from another source, the total comes to anything between £12,000,000 and £13,000,000.  Out of this sum, he is doing some good things. He is providing £250,000, or 2 per cent., for the relief of widows and orphans. We welcome that as the money is being applied to a good purpose.  Then he has reduced the tax on tea by 4d. in the lb.</P>
    <P>Of course, we do not forget that the Minister himself put on that tax some short time ago, so that he only leaves the position, as regards tea, where he found it.  At the time he put on that tax he told us that tea was a luxury and that sugar was a necessity.  Then he came back and he put a tax on sugar before he took the tax off tea. He put the tax on the necessity and relieved the tax on the luxury.  He did not tell us anything about the hundreds of other necessaries he has taxed in the way of new duties.  When all these items are taken together the little relief he has given is very small indeed.  However, it is acceptable, I know, in the country.  I know that some women down the country give him credit for it.  I know one supporter of Fianna Fáil in particular who had the President's photograph in her room.  After the Minister's Budget came out, she put a photograph of the Minister for Finance on top of the <Col N="1069" /> President's photograph with the inscription underneath: &ldquo;Away with light beer and up MacEntee.&rdquo;  I do not know whether that has been a general rule, but that happened in one case.  I think Deputy Corry would agree with that woman, because he talked a lot about tea yesterday.  I never believed that Deputy Corry was in favour of light beer.</P>
    <P>I notice also that Deputy Corry did not believe in the reduction in income tax.  One of the Ministers also does not believe in the reduction in income tax.  The Minister for Defence, speaking in his constituency a month or two ago, referred to the manner in which taxes were being raised.  He said that taxes were very high.  He admitted that they were too high, in fact, but he added: &ldquo;We are taking it off the man on top and we are giving relief to the other man.&rdquo;  He said: &ldquo;We are going to collect it in income tax, we are going to take it off the people who pay income tax, we are going to make them pay.&rdquo;  It seems to me the Minister for Finance does not agree with him there.  I have no objection to a relief in income tax, but I think there are other people in this State who are more in need of relief than the people who are paying income tax.  I refer to the agricultural community. As Deputy Bennett has remarked, they have got no relief. The last ounce is to be squeezed out of them, and they are then to be thrown overboard.  I remind the Minister that after all they are providing the source of every income in the State.  If agriculture is destroyed you destroy the foundations of the State, the very means by which incomes are made, so that there will be very small relief for anybody, even if 6d. is taken off income tax, if the source of income is dried up. That is what it is coming to.</P>
    <P>If we take the latest statistics available, the figures for 1926 show that out of every 1,000 people employed in this State, 663.1 are employed in productive work, and 514 of these, or 78.5 per cent. are employed in agricultural production.  If 78.5 per cent. of the producers in this State are engaged in agricultural work, is not that a sufficient reason to convince anybody, <Col N="1070" /> that anything that affects the prosperity of agriculture must inevitably react on certain other classes of the community?  I remind the Minister that the other 21½ per cent. are living directly or indirectly on agriculture. Take distributors; are they not living upon the profits they get out of the agricultural community?  The manufacturers have to sell their goods to the agricultural community, and not only that, but they have to be protected by high tariff walls.  As these tariffs, or the equivalent increase in prices, have to be paid by the agricultural community, is it not evident that anything that destroys agriculture must inevitably affect the income of everyone in the State, no matter what business they are engaged in?  That goes without saying.  I think the Minister will not question it.</P>
    <P>We have been told that agriculture is prosperous.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce said last evening, and so did Deputy Corry, that agricultural prices were good.  Figures were quoted.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce advised Deputies to go to the library, where figures would be found to show that Fianna Fáil had made the farmers very prosperous. Deputy Corry is a farmer, and is in touch with farmers, so that he need not go to the library to hear what the conditions in the country are.  I do not wonder so much at the statement of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, because he is not in touch with farmers, and does not know the actual position in the country.  However, if he correctly studied the figures in the library, he would learn an entirely different lesson.  I went to the library, as directed, and I got figures there that give a fair indication of the position of farmers.  I do not believe in comparing present figures or prices with what they were a year ago.  Conditions a year ago were extremely bad, so bad that the country could not continue in that way indefinitely.  We had the economic war on 12 months ago, so that nothing is to be gained by a comparison of present prices with those of 12 months ago.  The prices I would compare are the prices that we are really getting for our produce at <Col N="1071" /> present, compared with the prices we would be receiving if there was no economic war.  Where are we to find the figures?  I live along the Border. and I can compare prices in the Free State with prices in Northern Ireland. That is the way to find out what we would be entitled to get, if we had no economic war, because there was no difference until the economic war started.  I will give some prices from the <i>Farmers' Gazette</i> of May 12th, dealing with the Dublin market. Lambs were one of the items that the Minister for Industry and Commerce quoted the price of, pointing out that they were dearer this year than last year.  They may be.  I am not questioning that statement.  On May 12th lambs were sold in the Dublin market from 25/- to 32/-, and in Belfast from 45/- to 48/-.  That is a difference of 25/- to 45/- in second class lambs, and a difference of 42/- to 48/- in the price of the best lambs.  Yet, the Minister for Industry and Commerce has the hardihood to get up here and tell the people on this side that prices are better here because of the Fianna Fáil Government.  The Minister mentioned hoggets.  The price here was from 30/- to 35/-.  In Belfast the price was from 51/- to 56/-.  Second-class lambs in the Dublin market were from 17/- to 24/-.  Best lambs were from 25/- to 32/-.  Heifers in Belfast made 51/6 a cwt.  According to the same report, they made in Dublin 24/- a cwt.  That was the highest price.  Pork was another agricultural product referred to by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  He told us that the price of bacon was much better here than it was a year ago, that, in fact, we owed to Fianna Fáil the good prices we were getting for our bacon.  I consulted the <i>Anglo Celt</i> for the same day, May 12th, in this regard.  I do not mind the price of bacon.  What I am concerned about is the price the farmer gets for his pig when he sells it. The carcases are sold in the open market in the country, and the price made in Ballyconnell, on May 12th, was 51/- a cwt.  At Ballinagh the price was 51/-, in Cavan town 50/- and in Newtownbutler, just three miles across the <Col N="1072" /> Border and 12 or 14 miles from Cavan, 65/-.  That was the controlled price. That controlled price has been fixed in Northern Ireland, as Deputies are aware, on the calculation of the costings.  It was estimated by the Commission that went into the matter that the cost of producing a cwt. of pork was 65/-.  The price of pork was, accordingly, fixed at that price.  It is evident that even pork and bacon, on which the Minister lays so much stress, are being produced here at a loss of 15/- a cwt.  That is what he claims is making the farmers prosperous.  The same remarks apply to eggs.  Eggs are going as high as 5d. per lb., or 7½d. per dozen in Northern Ireland, and the average price throughout the country is 5½d.  I do not want to delay the House by going into all the other items.  I do not know what the agricultural community can turn to which will enable them to make a decent living.</P>
    <P>Of course, some people will say that the farmers are lazy, indolent people who do not understand their business. I was over at the Show last week and I called to the section run by the Department of Agriculture and got some information there.  Two lots of cattle were fed on different rations. One of them was fed on 7 lbs. of hay, 28 lbs. of silage and 2 lbs. of crushed oats per day.  The daily gain for one lot was three-quarters of a lb.  For the other lot it was 1lb.  For 112 days that would be a gain of 1 cwt. for the lot that did best and, for the others, it would be a gain of three-quarters of a cwt.  The value of the cwt. would be £1.  That would be the value in the case of the lot that did well.  The value in the other case would be 15/-. In the 112 days that they gained 1 cwt., they used each 7 cwt. of hay, 28 cwts. of silage and 2 cwt. of oats. Let us put down attendance at 1d. per day.  That would not be very high wages.  I am sorry that none of the Labour Deputies is present.  I wonder if Deputy Norton would say that 1d. per day would be too much to give these people for attending the cattle. That would mean that 9/4 would have to come out of the price.  I do not know what should be allowed for insurance during these 112 days.  A man <Col N="1073" /> might take the risk himself but he would be the loser if any of the cattle died.  Supposing the rate were 10/- a year, that would be 3/4 for insurance for 112 days.  Add 3/4 to 9/4 and you get 12/8.  That would leave the princely sum of 2/4 for the lot of cattle that would make the 15/- gain. That is to say, 2/4 for 7 cwt. of hay, 28 cwt. of silage and 2 cwt. of crushed oats.  As a matter of fact, it might cost the 2/4 to crush the 2 cwt. of oats, so that the farmer would be simply working for nothing.  It is a great pity that Deputy Norton is not here now to learn the rate of wages which could be paid men engaged in producing oats, silage and hay.  Those people who talk about grazing with such contempt should ask themselves whether the farmer can produce these crops, according to the directions of the Department, at the figures I have mentioned.  Do the Labour Deputies who are, unfortunately, absent now think that if all the people engaged in agriculture are driven out of it by this sort of proceeding, they can be maintained by the State?  Where is the money to come from which is to supply them all with doles?  Even if they are all to get the sums provided under the Unemployment Assistance Act, where will the money be obtained?  The Government may borrow £7,500,000 this year.  Next year, it will not be £7,500,000 it will be necessary to borrow but £10,000,000 or £12,000,000, because there will be an increasing number in need of unemployment assistance.  It is plain that the people cannot carry on.  There is no use in talking about the price of oats.  Oats are only the raw material for cattle, pork and fowl.  It is the price of the finished product that matters in the long run.</P>
    <P>If the Fianna Fáil policy is given effect to in full and if there is much more of the land broken up, what will happen when the people find that they cannot feed this oats profitably to their pigs, cattle or fowl?  Then, of course, they will have to put it on the market.  Where is the market?  There will only be a market for the small quantity that would be used for <Col N="1074" /> human consumption.  The remainder must be used as food for animals.  To what class of animals that will show a profit is this oats going to be fed? To what animals can it be fed that will pay for the cost of production? No man can continue producing at a loss.  That is actually what the farmers are doing at the present moment.</P>
    <P>Then out of this actual loss they are expected to pay overhead charges and to pay rates and land annuities. People will get up on the other side of the House and tell us that there is a conspiracy against the paying of these overhead charges.  How can these overhead charges be paid? There may be a few farmers through the country with some little savings in the bank.  That is all these people have to fall back upon now.  Anyone who has not some savings in the bank is unable now to pay these overhead charges out of the earnings of his farm.  He cannot pay in the future. Farmers can get no credit at the present time.  No farmer can raise money in the bank because the banker knows the position of the farmers in general and he knows very well that there is no hope for the farmer under the conditions brought about by the present Government.  He knows as things are that there is no likelihood of any farmer being able to pay back any money lent him.</P>
    <P>If we are to make any progress in this State the sooner the Minister and the Government get back to bedrock and recognise that agriculture must be given a chance of being put upon its feet, the better it will be for the country. It is hopeless to think that by everybody going along in the present way&mdash;everybody leaning upon somebody else; everybody watching and waiting for the State to give him something and nobody able to pay anything to the State&mdash;that we can get anywhere.  The State will go down if the people go on leaning upon one another and all leaning against the State.  That will bring down the State with a crash sooner or later.</P>
    <P>We must get away from this borrowing. We borrowed £6,000,000 last year to balance the Budget and to provide unemployment assistance.  This year <Col N="1075" /> we are borrowing £7,500,000; next year we will borrow £10,000,000, and the year after £15,000,000.  The increase will be progressive from year to year. This must inevitably bring about the result that the nation and its finances will decay.  I do appeal to the Ministers to consider these matters.  There is no use in boasting about being able to balance the Budget.  That is drawing upon the savings of the past and leaving a liability for the future.  It is by these means that the Minister is balancing his Budget, just keeping the wolf from the door for the time being. I would advise the Minister and I would advise all Deputies in this House who look to the future to consider these matters.  After all, we all have an interest in the future.  There are people on that side, especially Deputies who represent country districts, who know as well as I do that these conditions cannot continue without involving the country in ruin.</P>
    <P>If the British market is gone for ever that is a serious matter.  But I do not agree that it is gone for ever. I think we should recognise the position that it is necessary that the settlement of this economic war should be brought about as soon as possible. Otherwise, the Budget will go on increasing from year to year, while the ability of the nation to meet the increased taxation will be diminishing. If this continues it is only a question of time until the whole nation collapses.  The Minister should take time by the forelock.  I am not making the picture of the present economic conditions any worse than they are. The figures I have quoted show plainly that even if we do carry out the policy of the Fianna Fáil Party, and produce more oats and have more tillage and more hay and all that, it will not pay. The price at which farm commodities are now being sold would not give a man 3d. a day for his labour.  It is obvious that something must be done, and done soon, if there are any Budgets to be balanced in the future. I hope that the Minister will take these matters into consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenMaguire" hpid="Mr. B. Maguire Mr. B. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>This Budget is one that does not require any spokesman or <Col N="1076" /> any eloquence to place it before the public in the right light.  It is a good Budget.  That fact is understood so well that the difficulty now faces the Opposition to make effective criticism. I repeat again that the Budget speaks for itself.  Listening to the speeches of Deputies McGovern and Bennett on the Opposition Benches, I came to the conclusion that some of the points they made were erroneous.  Deputy McGovern, at the commencement of his speech, stated that he knew nothing about this Budget.  Knowing Deputy McGovern as I do, and knowing that he is an honest man, I was glad to hear him, at the start of his criticism, admitting that he knew nothing about what he was going to criticise.  I give the Deputy credit for his honesty.  He said that he did not know anything about the Budget, and his speech showed that he did not.  In the course of his speech he made a statement that received a &ldquo;hear, hear&rdquo; from the Front Bench opposite.  It was that he was not concerned so much with the prices that prevailed as with the prices that would prevail here if there was no economic war.  That statement received a &ldquo;hear, hear&rdquo; from the Opposition. Am I to assume then that the prices to-day, no matter how bad they might be, would be acceptable to the Opposition if they were the best prices to be got in England?  That is the conclusion I drew.  Deputy McGovern is intelligent enough to know that the difficulty raised by the economic war here is only transitory.  It does not represent the difference in prices that the Deputy has led us all to believe that he assumes it does represent.  In this economic war the basis of the foundations is being laid to place this country, and each farmer in the country, in the position of being able to look for a decent return in the form of prices in the future in the home market.  He can look to the economic completeness of this country and the industrial completeness of this country. The farmers complain of the subsidies they are receiving and which they sometimes say they are not receiving. But these subsidies are an effort at the stabilisation of price conditions in the country.  We will be in a position to stabilise prices for the farmers and not <Col N="1077" /> depend upon that other market to which the Opposition are looking.</P>
      <P>Deputy McGovern further commented upon the deplorable conditions of the farmers generally.  One would assume from his speech that all these conditions arose in the last year or two.  The Deputy has a bad memory and a short memory.  I would bring to his mind the speeches he made three or four years ago.  He was then speaking as a public man on a platform.  I would ask him if he does not remember these speeches now.  I would ask him what he stated about the conditions in which the farmers were then?  I would recall to him the abuse he heaped upon the Government that provided for him and the other farmers in the country the best market that England could give him for his produce.</P>

      <P>The Deputy referred to the position of the Border.  He is a Border farmer himself.  I am a Border farmer also and I know the conditions in the Six Counties and I can safely say from experience what the actual condition of the Six-County farmer is.  The condition of the farmer in the Six Counties is only some degrees worse than the condition of the farmer in the Twenty-Six Counties. I will give you an illustration of that. Deputy McGovern has in his county a creamery that is controlled by a Six-County concern and we have in Leitrim another auxiliary controlled by the same concern.  The price offered early last year by those creameries was 2¼d. while a co-operative creamery nine miles further back was giving 4¼d. a gallon.  Deputy McGovern will not deny, I think, that as a result of the discrepancy in price lorries were put on the road and the auxiliary creamery in Cavan has since had to make arrangements with our Leitrim Creamery to take over the supplies of milk, as otherwise it would be obliged to close down.</P>

      <P>The creamery in Deputy McGovern's constituency is the Blacklion Creamery and that creamery has made arrangements with the co-operative creamery at Manorhamilton. They had to make arrangements to have their cream converted into butter, because otherwise they would have to close down.  Deputy McGovern said that nothing has been done for the farmers.  I contend there has been a lot done for them.  What did Deputy McGovern's Party do for the farmers in 1924-25?  The Deputy remembers those years very well.  I recollect speaking to him at Blacklion and Swanlinbar when we both saw whole districts swept by the disease amongst the cattle and the farmers were petitioning their representatives to do something. I remember one very strong appeal being backed up in my county for a moratorium in the land annuities for one year, but that suggestion was scouted out of existence by the then Government.  What did that Government do for the farmers during the years when that terrible disease destroyed all before it?  Deputy McGovern expects this Government to do much more than it is doing.  Let me tell him that this is the first Government that ever gave direct assistance to the farmers or made an effort to put farming on a really sound basis.  We are told there should be no such thing as subsidies or bounties, but at the same time we have an appeal submitted to do something for the farmers.  Not alone is there a moratorium on one year's annuities, but there is a perpetual moratorium on them.</P>

      <P>Deputy Bennett does not display the same amount of honesty and simplicity in his public attitude as does Deputy McGovern.  He said he attended a cross-roads meeting somewhere in the country and explained to simple people how the Budget was wrong.  He said that the simple man might not possibly understand figures such as £28,000,000 and he put it plainly to him that if he had an income of £28 and he required £36 for his upkeep he would have to borrow the difference.  He did not explain to the simple, country-minded people who looked to him for advice that the difference between the £28 and £36 was capital to be invested in non-recurring outlay, or a capital investment in some productive industry.  Had the Deputy explained to these simple-minded people, small farmers or labourers, that if this year they required to enlarge their tillage and rented a field from their neighbour, they must necessarily provide additional money and if they did that with the idea that out of the investment they were going to make profit, then the Deputy would show that he was intelligent and understood what he was talking about.  As it is, the only charitable explanation that I can offer of the Deputy's statement about the Budget at the cross-roads meeting is that he is either ignorant of the Budget question or else, <Col N="1080" /> if he has clear knowledge of it, he was not honest in his explanation.  Deputy Bennett also said he understood all about unemployment and had great experience of unemployment.  He mentioned that Deputy Cosgrave and other members of the Party understood all about it.  With that statement I quite agree.  Deputy Cosgrave and his Party have a better right to know more about unemployment than any other Party in the State.  They certainly proved that they cared less about the condition of the unemployed during their period of office.</P>
      <P>Deputy Anthony talked about juggling with figures.  That word conveys rather a sinister meaning.  I wonder do the farmers who are successfully growing beet, who are making wheat and tobacco growing profitable, and who are cultivating oats under a guaranteed price, think there is any juggling with figures in so far as they are concerned?  For the first time they are guaranteed a price for the product of their labours.  I wonder will the people who receive an income tax demand for 4/6 as against 5/- last year believe there is juggling?  Will the widows and orphans who are going to derive benefit under the Budget come to the conclusion that there is juggling with figures?  They will soon be receiving a weekly allowance that no other Government was in a position to give them.  Similarly with all the other services.  Of course, all this talk about juggling with figures is pure nonsense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Bennett showed great ability in preparing a Budget and showing us how it was done.  According to him, all that is necessary is to take up a piece of paper and look wisely at it. He was illustrating how the Minister for Finance prepared his Budget. According to the Deputy, the Minister prepares it somehow like this&mdash;he looks wisely at a piece of paper, reads out figures, takes off his glasses, lays them down, looks at the paper again, puts on his glasses, scratches his head, and after a certain amount of these operations he prepared a Budget which he considers will be satisfactory.  I sincerely hope that the Minister for Finance will learn from Deputy Bennett's description how easy it is to <Col N="1081" /> arrange a Budget in future and that he will not be wasting his time over the simple operation of preparing Budgets.</P>
    <P>I suggest to Deputies opposite that their real trouble is to find out how to make a case against this Budget.  They are not able to do it.  They would appear far better in the eyes of the people if they stood up honestly and said: &ldquo;This is a good Budget and we are glad of it,&rdquo; and showed by doing so that they had some respect for this country.</P>

      <P>If the Opposition are not prepared, or are not able, to discuss the merits and demerits of this Budget or the merits and demerits of the policy of the Government, then they should give credit where credit is due and admit their failure and that they have no opposition to offer.  My point is that they should not allow themselves to be driven to desperate operations because they have found that this Government is capable of running this country successfully and capable of producing one of the most successful and outstanding Budgets in the history of this State.  With regard to their operations last week in my constituency, I suggest, Sir, that I am entitled to make reference to it because it shows that these people have lost their reason.</P>

      <P>If it is possible for the Party opposite to lend their assistance to a Government which, under conditions <Col N="1083" /> so difficult, has made such a huge and outstanding success of its business within the last few years, if it is possible for them to stand behind that Government and give their assistance to it, there is no question of the success of this country and the speed of that success can be very greatly facilitated.  Let us have from the Opposition the support that we are entitled to as a Government.  Let us have the antics of the Opposition modified, at least, to what might be regarded as boyish pranks in reality, but let us not have the antics of the Opposition running the State into the extraordinary expense of having special forces of Guards and military running around the country to keep the peace wherever the irrational and ill-conditioned followers of the Opposition are gathering.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">

      <P>The absolute avoidance of ordinary facts in the discussion of this Budget, the distance that one finds it removed from reality and from any sort of appreciation of business methods in their application to the finances of the State, make it somewhat difficult to debate.  The last speaker's remarks forced me to remind the Minister that he has been advertised through the Press as the jazz artist of his Party.  I do not think the <Col N="1084" /> term is deserved&mdash;certainly not the artist part of it&mdash;but I am sure that in his various financial perambulations he has often syncopated his steps to a tune known as: &ldquo;Have you ever seen a dream walking?&rdquo;  Some of those sentimental song-dreams have a habit of becoming nightmares after a bit.  I think this dream of the Minister's is likely to become one of them.</P>
      <P>I must confess that reading his speech the other day brought me back to a state of mind which was partly one where my sense of the ridiculous was tickled and partly one of irritation at the unwarranted complacency displayed, that I used to feel when I read Robinson Crusoe.  Robinson Crusoe, it will be remembered, was cast away on a desert island&mdash;the Minister has not come that far yet&mdash;and I think he went about in a hair shirt after a bit. Crusoe, however, only saw in the sands the print of a human foot, whereas the Minister is going to receive the same at the end of next month. However, Robinson Crusoe had a ship, and the salvage from that ship gave him clothing, food, and other supplies, and if he could not reach the ship the seas would bring him in whatever he wanted.  That was where one's sense of the ridiculous was strained.  Even when he got bad with himself, he had a habit of sitting down and casting up an account with himself and beating his breast, and he always managed to draw up a sort of balance sheet in his own favour and to cash in on what he considered the future goodness of the Almighty towards him.  That complacency with himself was irritating and annoying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is what the Minister for Finance had to do this year.  He came to a position in which taxation was not yielding the old revenue.  The Minister did not find it possible to cut down anything, and he was fresh from the most outstanding failure in this country in the last 12 years, that of the Fourth National Loan.  Yet, he decides presently on adopting the tactics of one of his colleagues and saying that certainly the people should be congratulated on its success, and that taxation was giving a better yield than ever before and that revenue was up. <Col N="1085" /> I can imagine his annoyance at being forced to consider a Budgetary situation this year when he knew that he could not balance his Budget this year without extensive borrowing; when he knew that, even with borrowing, he could not reduce taxation to the level at which he found it when he first became Minister; and when he found it still more impossible to give the £2,000,000 decrease in that taxation which he promised and which got him into office.  He knew that he had to refer to the position of the Fourth National Loan in some way.  It was an ugly hurdle for him to get over, and he had to gloss over the failing character of several items of taxation, and he had to give some explanation of the increased purchases from England without letting down his colleague who had been talking so much of industrial development in this country, so he beat his breast and he cast up, and he gives us the tot.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Look at what we have done.&rdquo;  He knows very well that it requires only a glance through the accounts and the reports for the last couple of years to see that there were £7,750,000 extra taxation got in by him&mdash;revenue by reason of increased taxation&mdash;in two years instead of the £2,000,000 reduction which was promised, and that he has spent £500,000 of what he did get in in the fiasco of the Fourth National Loan.  So he proceeds to say: &ldquo;Look at what we did,&rdquo; and we get that long series of benefits conferred on the people which he has given in portion of this oration of his&mdash;the almost unbelievable things that were done.  They are there, but not a word of how they were done, if they were done at all, and not a word relating back what he says nowadays, in his boasting of the results of increased taxation, with what he said previously, as to the necessity for reduction, as to how the people could not bear extra taxation, as to how the taxable capacity of this country in relation to Great Britain showed that we are overtaxed and that we had set out to provide services of a magnitude which the country could not bear.  His only statement about the National Loan is that he says that he has to thank Labour and all the <Col N="1086" /> people who are not politically affiliated with him, for their response, and then a peculiar allusion to the inauspicious circumstances in which the loan was launched.  He chose his own moment, and his President chose to make the moment inauspicious.  He, however, chose the time and he knew that these letters had been sent.</P>
    <P>When he came to the failing revenue he borrows not a leaf but a whole volume from the library of the Minister for Industry and Commerce and says: &ldquo;Not at all; revenue is coming in better than before.  Excise has bucked up&rdquo;&mdash;although it never reached a lower point than it did in the year we have passed, and income tax had got very low, but not as low as the Minister estimates, in the White Paper, it is going to go in the year we are in.  And yet, despite these two big signs, he can say that there is a bumper yield so far as a lot of things were concerned. Then we get the reference to the signs of prosperity&mdash;motorists, which we can test, and clocks.  Everybody is now better off because there are more Ingersoll or other watches being sold in the country than before.  He had a bad hurdle to get over in the fact that he was only saved from a crushing failure in his last Budget by the fact that customs duties brought in £1,600,000 more than he estimated. We are told, quite contrary to what we were told this time last year, that that is a sign of increased prosperity. The less we bought from England last year, the Minister for Industry and Commerce told us, the better sign it was of industrial productivity at home. This year, the more we buy from England, the better sign it is of increased purchasing power.</P>
    <P>Let us take the tale of what the Minister has done in his two years. What are the moneys he had at his disposal?  I suppose I should scarcely bring him back so far as &ldquo;The Plan,&rdquo; but still again, we must have it.  At the time when the Estimates were £22,000,000&mdash;not so much but about that&mdash;the Minister's Party &ldquo;had examined with minute care the Estimates of the Supply Services for the current year and is convinced that a saving of many hundreds of thousands <Col N="1087" /> of pounds can be made, not including such items as R.I.C. pensions and other similar payments.&rdquo;  Then we had the precise figure given by way of a minimum: &ldquo;The burden of taxation can be lightened by not less than £2,000,000 per year.&rdquo;  That was the successful plan, successful so far as electioneering was concerned; but what happened?  The Minister did not give us the £2,000,000 off in his first year, his second year, or this year.  He collected £50,000 short of £4,000,000 extra in his first year; he collected at least £3,800,000 last year&mdash;£7,750,000 extra in the two years.  He not merely did that, but, according to himself, he had an over-receipt last year of £1,300,000.  £9,000,000, and he raided the Suspense Account for £3,200,000 more.  He had an Exchequer balance when he came in of £1,750,000.  That is £14,000,000 he had to play with as between the two years, if we stop there.  Last year, apart from the Suspense Account moneys, there was a sum of £800,000, by way of annuities, squeezed out of the farmers of this country, which he retained, and there were Local Loans moneys which had been collected and which, ordinarily, would have been given to Britain but which he retained.  The farmers were deprived of about £200,000 which they used to get in relief of agricultural rates.  There is the best part of £16,000,000 in that tot, and that from a man who said he was going to reduce taxation when the Estimates were £22,000,000 by £2,000,000!</P>
    <P>Then we get a glowing statement of all that has been done.  If it has been done, who has paid for it?  It is the farming community of this country that bears the brunt of it, and in addition to those sums being piled up, the Minister has revealed our weakness to the British Government and has shown that, going along quietly as they are, they can, in 18 months, extract from us the full amount of the annuities, R.I.C. pensions, and the other moneys that used to be paid to them and which were pretended to be withheld by the present Government.  The Minister talks about all that he has done, but remember, it is not like Robinson <Col N="1088" /> Crusoe going to his boat and Providence just sending him something.  It has been extracted in the most callous fashion from the people of the country, and, in the main, it has been extracted by the sheriff and the bailiff at the moment. The Minister and his colleagues had a view at one time of what the people of this country could bear in the way of taxation.  Speaking in 1928, the present Minister for Industry and Commerce said that it was accepted by everybody that the taxable capacity of this country in relation to Britain was 1.5 per cent.  On the 20th March of that year the Minister, then Deputy Lemass, said that the total revenue of the British Government from all sources in 1926 was £800,000,000.  One and a half per cent. of that is £12,000,000, and that represented, according to the Minister, then Deputy Lemass, the full amount of our taxable capacity.  The British in this year have budgeted for £700,000,000 odd.  I think £705,000,000 is the exact tot.  Let us apply this 1.5 per cent. £10,500,000, according to their own statements, represents the taxable capacity of the people, and anything that was beyond that, according to the Minister, then Deputy Lemass, meant that we were straining the resources of the country and extracting from productive work whatever was above that £10,500,000. Apply that to the present circumstances. Has the relationship changed? Is that ratio of taxable capacity still a fair thing to apply?  If not, is there any confession as to misuse of that argument before?</P>
    <P>There is another test which we got&mdash; a mathematical test, coming from the President.  Speaking on the 18th March, 1931, the President argued that an apparent increase on the face of the Estimates of about £150,000 came, on a proper consideration of the matter, to an increase of either £4,000,000 or £6,000,000.  The way the calculation was worked was this: if the Estimate had remained steady, and if the productive capacity of the country, as measured by the prices that the main producer, the farmer, got for his main article, cattle, had remained steady, then you could say that everything was as before, but if you had an Estimate <Col N="1089" /> which appeared to be the same as before, and if prices had gone down, then to get the actual impost of taxation on the people you had to increase it by an amount which bore a ratio to the decrease in price.  Here is that worked out in detail:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;With reference to all these indices we find that the actual increase is very much greater, and the burden on the community is very much greater than is indicated by that increase.  So that instead of coming down, the fact is that the cost of all these services has gone up, and, with increased cost in other directions, one would have expected that the Minister for Finance would not ignore directions in which substantial savings could be made.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The reference is, column 1652 onwards, 18th March, 1931.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Between January, 1930, and January, 1931, there was a 7.3 per cent. fall in the cost of living.  If we take that into account and make a corresponding reduction in the Estimate as introduced last year the reduction would amount to £1,728,000 or, in other words, this year's Estimate represents an increase of that amount.  There was a 19.6 per cent. fall in wholesale prices between January, 1930, and January, 1931.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Another calculation is made from that, but the interesting comparison was this:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If we take into account the decrease in the price of the produce which the farmer, who is our largest taxpayer,&rdquo;</P>
      <P>&mdash;remember that this is President de Valera, speaking on 18th March, 1931&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;has to dispose of&mdash;take the fall in the price of fat cattle in the Dublin market between March, 1930, and March, 1931&mdash;we find that it represents to him,&rdquo;</P>
      <P>&mdash;and here again is the description of that man&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;the person who has to sell cattle in order to provide for taxation, an increase of £3,362,000 odd.  If we <Col N="1090" /> take fat sheep similarly this year as compared with March, 1930, we find there is a fall of 27.5 per cent., and it would represent a total increase to him of over £6,000,000.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If we had only the same Estimate as before, supposing we had only the old £22,000,000 instead of nearly £28,000,000, according to the President's calculation the impact of that upon the people of the country&mdash;and the farmer is taken as the model of the people in the country&mdash;has to be measured by the price he is getting for his produce now in comparison with what he did get.  It is just an amusing circumstance that, as compared with 1931, the price of fat cattle is just one-half of what it used to be, so that £22,000,000 represents a doubling of the old taxation even if it were kept at £22,000,000.  What does the increase mean?  Let us say that the farmer was able to bear the old £22,000,000 with no trouble.  The increase of £6,000,000, according to the President's calculation, if we are to put it on the basis of the reduced prices, represents £12,000,000 in present circumstances.</P>
    <P>The Minister who thinks that he can keep the amount as before, nominally, thinks that he has got a balanced Budget, and his Party think that everything is pleasant and rosy.  The Minister balances his Budget by borrowing. He gives, according to himself, certain remissions.  He did not tell us in his Budget statement of the increased amount that he is putting on sugar. All we are told is that there is £560,000 remission in this year's Budget.  That is a gross reduction.  There is £209,000 increase in this year.  There is, according to that statement, about £350,000 reduction, and there is £400,000 going to be got from the new sugar tax.  Sugar is a matter that, luckily, the present Government talked a lot about in previous years.  A farthing a pound extra was proposed in 1928.  This year the Minister is putting on a halfpenny, but when a farthing was proposed in 1928 the President, then Deputy de Valera, commented upon it in this way:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We also are opposed to this tax, and our reasons are precisely those indicated by Deputy O'Connell.  We <Col N="1091" /> think that this extra burden of £200,000 by way of taxation ought not to be imposed upon the poorest section of the community.  It is quite obvious that it is going to fall upon the poorest section and will affect particularly the poor people with large families.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then alternatives were offered, which the Minister probably considered and refused this year&mdash;the cutting down of the Army and the cutting down of the police.  The present Minister for Industry and Commerce, then Deputy Lemass, also waxed furious over this increase on the poorer section of the community.  He thought that we could find all that was required by reducing the number of the civil servants.  He has added to them since he went in. Deputy Little, who is now Parliamentary Secretary, was the best of all on sugar.  &ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; said Deputy Little, &ldquo;does the Minister realise the food value of sugar, especially for children. For others besides children it is not merely a food but a stimulant and a substitute for alcohol.&rdquo;  Probably the Minister is taking more sugar nowadays.  &ldquo;In some aspects,&rdquo; continued Deputy Little, &ldquo;it is, in fact, as valuable, if not more valuable, than bread; but what an outcry there would be if there was a tax on bread!&rdquo;  He concluded: &ldquo;If people realised the food value of sugar there would be an outcry against a tax which will hit the poor, especially at a time when there is great unemployment.&rdquo;  There were not 90,000 or 100,000 on the dole at the time.</P>

      <P>They did not. Deputy Corry hated the sugar tax then. What did he suggest?  He made the same suggestion that all that Party were making at that time&mdash;hack salaries.  That has been dropped; the sugar tax is going on.  There are more quotations here about sugar, but they can wait until we come to the sugar <Col N="1092" /> Resolution.  Ministers should look up the volume which deals with the Budget situation in 1928 if they want to be prepared to meet their own arguments.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance had views on tea and sugar on 11th May, 1932. Speaking on his first Budget, as reported in column 1506, the Minister said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In October last my predecessor imposed an additional tax of ½d. per lb. or 4/8 per cwt. on sugar. Sugar has a very high food value, and it is an absolute necessary of life.  A tax on sugar is a &lsquo;hard&rsquo; tax. It cannot be imposed without a corresponding increase in the cost of living.  It, therefore, falls heavily on the very poor.  Tea, on the other hand, has little value as food.  It is not a necessary of life.  A tax upon it is a &lsquo;soft&rsquo; tax; that is to say, a tea tax need not necessarily involve a diminution in consumption or an increase in the amount spent upon the commodity.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So in the year 1932 the Minister for Finance, being very benevolent towards the poor, remitted the &ldquo;hard&rdquo; tax upon sugar and imposed a &ldquo;soft&rdquo; tax upon tea.  This year we find suddenly that the Minister has changed.  The &ldquo;hard&rdquo; tax was re-imposed on 9th February and this &ldquo;soft&rdquo; tax, which is not on a necessary of life, and which if kept on would not mean any diminution in consumption, is suddenly remitted.  Which is now the &ldquo;hard&rdquo; tax?  Which bears more heavily on the poorer section of the community? What is the reason for suddenly deciding that a sugar tax is better in the interests of the people, because Fianna Fáil undoubtedly look after the interests of the people?  What is the reason for deciding at this time that the sugar tax is to be re-imposed and the tea tax, which is not upon a necessary of life and so can easily be borne, is now to be remitted?  Further, what is the special reason for keeping both on for five months?  The sugar tax went on in the early days of February. In February, March and April, we had not even a remission of the tea duty announced.  In May we have, but its <Col N="1093" /> application is dated back until July. So we have again the anomaly that we preferred one to the other in 1932; we put back both in the early part of 1934 and when the month of July comes, we will be free, if all goes well, from this &ldquo;soft&rdquo; tax and we will be subject once more to the &ldquo;hard&rdquo; tax.  Let us not forget one thing about the &ldquo;soft&rdquo; tax.  Empire tea does not bear the same taxation as the other.  We may all be merry again and solve the land annuity problem with hands across the tea-pot.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have at times&mdash;in relation to the Deputy that the British Government did make two mistakes in their life.  They tried to make both an officer and a gentleman of Deputy Flinn and they failed.  It was a terrible task, the Deputy will admit.  The Minister tells us that revenue was buoyant, particularly excise.  Excise in his delightful phrase had bucked up like everything else.  Let us look at two items.  Last year, speaking on 12th May, as reported in column 1013, Volume 47, of the Parliamentary Debates, I referred to the income tax. I pointed out that in 1931-32 the amount collected in income tax was £3,820,000. I commented that last year the Budget estimate was for £4,696,000&mdash;£800,000 of a difference&mdash;and that was £800,000 of a difference on an effective increase in taxation of 1/9 in the £.  In the bad old days when Deputy Cosgrave ruled, 6d. in the income tax brought in £500,000 and 1/9 on that calculation <Col N="1094" /> would bring in £1,750,000, while the Minister budgeted only for £800,000. According to the White Paper of this year, if the remission had not been made, he was only to get in £4,600,000. There is going to be a further drop this year of £100,000.  The Minister was, therefore, estimating that, without any change in the taxation, having 1/9 effectively operating more than there was in 1931-32, the yield from income tax was going to be down £1,000,000.  Yet revenue is buoyant. Why is it buoyant?  The Minister got in £2,000, I think, last year more than he estimated.  Is that buoyancy?  The Minister miscalculated by £2,000.  Does he take credit for that?  Does he forget that, in fact, he calculated right to this extent, that income tax would not yield by £800,000 the amount it used to yield on a corresponding basis?</P>
      <P>We are told that everybody is happy; industry is prospering; businessmen are flourishing; there is every sign of a boom in trade.  Yet, we are going to get in about £850,000 less in the yield from income tax than used to be received.  I said last year that there were three kinds of people who paid income tax.  There is the man who is in a post like the civil servant here and who pays with compulsory regularity.  There is the man who has investments abroad and who pays on the dividends as they come in.  We have a vast amount of money out and, in the main, in so far as that money is located in England, the dividends on that amount are going up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this year in which the dividends are likely to go up we do not find an increase in the amount of tax to be derived.  If so, there is an offset figure of decrease from investments by those people who have invested in the home trade.  Surely it is brazenness, in the face of that, to say that the revenue is buoyant.  Excise has bucked up. There is no necessity to refer to that in detail.  The year we have passed out of has shown the lowest yield in the way of Excise of any since the State was founded.  Again, it exceeded estimates by a sum of a couple of hundred pounds.  But the actual returns <Col N="1095" /> are down from the year before and down from the year before that. But this year we find a peculiar optimism.  The Minister feels the tide&mdash;if that is not an improper word to apply to beer&mdash;has turned, and that the Excise yield, 1933-34, was £5,320,000, while he estimates £5,596,000 is going to be received in 1934-35.  Last year the Minister made as an excuse, when I commented on the decrease in the yield from beer, that there had been a spread of temperance in the country.  Have people recently taken to drinking again and why?</P>

Has it increased?  Everything we are told is as well as it could be.  What must be the feelings of the civil servants in this State?  The Minister told us last year that he had a Budget surplus of £1,300,000 and yet the civil servants, like the calves, were skinned to provide that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>And the local officials are to be skinned this year, in which we have fared so much better than last year.  Is there any relation between the Minister's real surplus and what he called the &ldquo;dire necessity&rdquo; that confronted him two years ago? In column 1502 of the Official Debates of the 11th May, 1932, the Minister in talking about taxation prefaced his statement with this:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;But in the kingdom of the blind the one-eyed man is king, and in our dire necessity, even the only moderately well-to-do must take a very heavy share of the burden which unfortunately must fall upon every section of the community.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now we have passed out of that dire necessity, but have we that reflected in any decreased taxation?  Have even the moderately well-to-do benefited <Col N="1096" /> or have they had to continue to bear a very heavy share of the burden which unfortunately must fall upon everybody?  Cannot the Minister square facts a little better with his assertion?  If the dire necessity is no longer here, why has not taxation gone down?  Why is it that it has moved upward by £50,000 despite the borrowing; and why is it that an even balance can only be achieved by borrowing?  Last year the Minister for Industry and Commerce was aggrieved because people said taxation had been increased.  He was rather sore at some of the criticisms of the old promise of £2,000,000 reduction in taxation, and he faced up to the situation boldly in his usual way. On the 11th May, 1933, he is reported in column 901 of the Official Debates as saying:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We have been told, again and again, that the Government promised to reduce taxation.  It has reduced taxation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Nothing like a good resounding assertion.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Taxation in the coming year will be £1,000,000 less than it was last year.  Deputies do not appreciate that.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was, apparently, received in silence.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;They are concerned only with income tax, and because income tax has not been reduced they say that taxation has not been reduced. They do not appreciate the fact that a reduction of taxation can be achieved by other methods.  There has been a decline in the yield of customs duties.  A reduction of over £1,000,000 has been produced in the best way possible, because it points to the fact that industry is developing here, and that Irish people are being employed in Ireland instead of Englishmen in England supplying our needs.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Let us analyse that.  Last year's taxation showed a decrease.  It was down £1,000,000.  During that year customs duties were yielding £1,000,000 less and that led the Minister for Industry and Commerce, inevitably, to the conclusion that there was a big jump in <Col N="1097" /> the industrial line here and that we were producing to the amount represented by £1,000,000 customs duties, more goods, and, to that extent, that we were replacing English manufactures that had been coming into this country.  And in the year which passed, when there was £1,000,000 less, we actually see as a result £1,600,000 more.  The Minister for Finance, this year, said it shows an increased prosperity.  That may be but according to the argument of the Minister for Industry and Commerce it shows less productivity at home. They cannot have it both ways.  We buy apparently because we have more money to spend, and according to the Minister there was a considerable increase over the year before in our purchases of boots and shoes and clothing of all kinds.  I thought our job was done in regard to boots and clothing, according to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, in 1932.  We had so imposed taxes on boots and shoes and clothing that there was no possibility of importing, and one of the signs of prosperity pointed to in 1932 was the fact that the import of boots and shoes and clothing had gone down so much.  Now they are up again despite the tariffs, despite the magnificent factories erected and the abundant employment given as the money yield of these sets of tariffed articles shows.  &ldquo;Taxation in the coming year will be £1,000,000 less,&rdquo; said the Minister on the 11th May, 1933, but in fact instead of its being that much down it is £1,600,000 up; and this period this year we have evidence that our tariff power is so much greater that we are far better off, and living in prosperity because we buy £1,600,000 worth of dutiable goods more, mainly from England.</P>
    <P>We were given as another test of prosperity the number of motor cars that come into the country.  A good analysis of that was made in the public Press on May 11th.  Motor cars are one of the signs of the new prosperity.  In 1931 the number of motor cars imported was 7,333: in 1933 there came into this country 2,508.  We have got to add to that, to make the comparison proper, the number of chassis that came in <Col N="1098" /> which may have been built upon in this country.  In 1931 there were 839 chassis imported as well as 7,333 cars.  Last year there were 1,834 chassis imported as well as 2,508 cars.  The drop was almost 50 per cent.  The value, if we leave out the duty, of all motor cars, motor bicycles, bicycles and all accessories of what was imported into this country in 1931 was £2,231,000.  In 1933 the value was £1,400,000, and yet we are told that the increased number of motors being bought is a sign of the prosperity that we are in at the moment.</P>
    <P>Amongst other things in this Budget we are going to borrow for an industrial alcohol plant £102,000.  When this was last debated in the House I asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he could give us any idea of comparative costs, what was the likelihood of the commercial success of any industrial alcohol plant, or if the anticipated success was frankly abandoned, and if there was a likelihood of a charge falling on the community because of this industrial alcohol plant.  I said to the Minister when he stated that he could get industrial alcohol produced at 2/- a gallon that he was promising to do what had not yet been achieved in any country in the world, and yet he asserted it could be done.  Since that time, an article has appeared in a quarterly known as &ldquo;Studies,&rdquo; written by a professor of chemistry in this country who, during the Great War, was in charge of the only industrial alcohol plant which Britain erected.  I understand that when the War was over he advised the Government to break it up and, if they could not break it up speedily, to blow it up in order to save money.  He has analysed the plan here for industrial alcohol. He talks about the substances from which you may get the raw material for the production of alcohol.  He comes to the conclusion that the only thing possible in this country is the potato tuber, and says that &ldquo;the average yield of potatoes in Ireland is stated to be five tons per statute acre&rdquo;; that &ldquo;with suitable selection of plant, proper manuring and tillage this figure, <Col N="1099" /> it is claimed, could be raised to eight tons or even more per acre.&rdquo;&ldquo;It could be raised.&rdquo;  We have not got to that point yet.  He says that &ldquo;the Irish potato contains on an average about 14-15 per cent. starch.&rdquo;  In this connection, he says that experts claim that if a proper type of potato were grown here we could get a much higher carbohydrate content.  He winds up this part of the article by saying that under the best conditions we might calculate on eight to ten tons of potatoes to the acre, with an average starch content of 18 per cent., 14 to 15 per cent. being the ordinary that is got here.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;A ton of this material,&rdquo; the professor continues, &ldquo;would give 24 gallons of absolute alcohol under practical conditions.  It is claimed that such potatoes can be found in certain areas in this country at a figure of 45/- per ton.  In any scheme of development we are assuming that the supply will continue at this somewhat low figure.  If such is the case we find that the raw material for one gallon of alcohol would cost a figure approaching 2/-.&rdquo; He then gives the conversion costs at 9d. to 1/- per gallon: to convert starch to concentrated alcohol.  He says that possibly under present day conditions this figure might be lowered.  Let us assume 8d., &ldquo;there is still another charge: capital charges and depreciation, <Col N="1100" /> say, 3d. to 4d. per gallon.&rdquo;  The total cost&mdash;that is, mind you, by getting a bigger yield per acre than is being got by having a new type of potato to give a bigger starch content, and with conversion charges below what they are in any country yet, and adding ordinary capital charges and depreciation&mdash;of a gallon of alcohol at the factory would be at least 3/- per gallon.  Petrol may come into the Port of Dublin free of duty at somewhere between 3d. and 4d. a gallon.  The professor says it is impossible to think of industrial alcohol having any great use in this country.  Let us assume that for every ten gallons of fuel sold in this country one only will be industrial alcohol.  What is the cost of that calculated by this professor, who was on the job in England?  It means an additional charge of 4d. a gallon on all petrol coming into the country.  We are going to put £102,000 into a plant to produce industrial alcohol to sell at 3/- a gallon: I should say not to sell at 3/-, but to have at the factory at 3/- without taking selling costs into account at all.  3/- a gallon will be the production price, and we think that is a good item for which to borrow.  We think it is a good thing to borrow £102,000 to produce fuel at a cost of 3/- a gallon, and to put that into competition with ordinary fuel that sells here or, at any rate, that can come in here to the Port of Dublin at 4d. a gallon and that can be sold at 1/- to 1/4, according to quality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is one of the new developments and one of the good schemes for which we are told we should borrow.  A calculation has been made by another expert in this matter as to what it cost the American Government in its particular experiments with regard to industrial alcohol.  The substance that they use is maize, and the calculation made here and worked out in detail is this: that if the Government of the United States of America bought all the maize at present held for industrial alcohol in the open market and burned it they would save 300,000,000 dollars to the State.  Taking what it costs to pay the farmers for producing the maize that they convert into industrial alcohol and the <Col N="1101" /> 275,000,000 dollars it costs to convert it into industrial alcohol, if they burned it the State would be at a less expense to the extent of 300,000,000 dollars.  There is not a country in the world which has tried this experiment that has not found it a frightfully costly one.  We are going to go into it and deem it to be such a good venture that we consider it a matter proper for borrowing.  If we do borrow for it and if we meet the charges consequent on the carrying out of that policy it will mean an increased cost for petrol, and that means increased taxation for the people of the country.</P>
    <P>I spoke of the Minister's difficulties about the Fourth National Loan.  His remarks are worth repeating.  He had a general preamble about the list being opened on December the 4th and closed on December the 12th, and about the issue terms being so favourable. Then there is this cryptic phrase, the meaning of which I have not yet been able to discover:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It will be recollected that the circumstances attendant upon the opening of the subscription lists were somewhat unpropitious.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Is that a delicate way of the Minister's saying that if President de Valera had not made a fool of himself by writing to Mr. Thomas at this time he would have got the loan?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not hear that remark; it should be worth repeating. The Minister went on to say:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Notwithstanding this, the public response on the opening days was entirely satisfactory.  I should like in that connection to express my special appreciation of the public-spirited way in which the issue was <Col N="1102" /> supported on the one hand by the trade unions and labour organisations generally, and on the other by a number of the larger interests in the country not identified with politics and certainly not associated with the present Government.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am not sure again whether that is not a delicate way in which the Minister for Finance is reacting upon his colleague the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  Look at the people who are picked out for thanks for their attitude towards the Fourth National Loan&mdash;the Labour organisations and those who are not identified with politics or associated with the present Government.  What about the new industrial concerns of the Minister for Industry and Commerce?  Why were not they thanked for what they had done in connection with the loan, or did they not do anything to merit thanks?  At any rate they are left out. The Minister referred to the Labour organisations and to people not identified with the Ministry in politics who &ldquo;gave practical proof of their trust in the future of this country and its people and&rdquo;&mdash;with a blush&mdash;&ldquo;the good faith of the present Government.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There were other comments made on that.  Speaking in the Dáil on the 7th March, 1934, as reported in column 273-4, Vol. 51, the Minister for Industry and Commerce frankly said that the Minister for Finance was somewhat of a fool in going for a loan at that time and on the terms he gave.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce congratulated Deputy Belton because Deputy Belton, he thought, had shown &ldquo;some evidence of having read some elementary text books on economics.&rdquo; Do not laugh too soon, because this is a reflection on the Minister for Finance.  The Minister went on to state&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;because he&rdquo;&mdash;that is Deputy Belton&mdash;&ldquo;said that in time of business activity people do not lock up their money in gilt-edged securities.  They do not.  Nobody invests in gilt-edged securities bearing fixed interest if he can find a more profitable use for his money elsewhere.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He was then interrupted, and he proceeded with the ordinary stuff&mdash;that in <Col N="1103" /> time of business stagnation people who have money to invest try to put their money into safe investments and the price of gilt-edged securities rises. Then he goes on to say&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In times of business activity and development prices of gilt-edged securities fall because people are taking their money out of them and are putting it into industrial investments.  What is happening here&rdquo;&mdash;that is on the 7th March, 1934&mdash;&ldquo;is that new opportunities for investment in industry are offering to owners of capital every day, and I am glad to say they are showing no hesitation in availing of them.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Relate that back again to the effort of the Minister for Finance to get a loan of £6,000,000 in November-December, 1933.  Does not that mean that if he had consulted his colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, he would have told him that he could not get the loan, that there was so much business activity which afforded a greater return to the investor than 3½ per cent., that he was such an utter fool that he must not even have read &ldquo;the elementary text book on economics&rdquo;? He should have consulted the Minister for Industry and Commerce and then he would have known how to avoid this fiasco.  That is rough on the Minister for Finance, but he has an easy way of retorting.  Let him join with us in asking the Minister for Industry and Commerce to produce these fields for investment.  Let us see where they are.  Let him name the industrial concerns.  Let him tell us what return they are giving on the money put into them, and then we shall find out whether the Minister for Industry and Commerce was not just talking as foolishly and as irrelevantly as he ordinarily does on these industrial subjects.</P>
    <P>The Minister did make his bow to the public in regard to the Fourth National Loan&mdash;the only one&mdash;on the 4th December of last year.  He spoke to the Dublin Chamber of Commerce on that date, and announced that the subscription lists would close on or before Tuesday 12th December.  Speaking on December 4th he said he thought <Col N="1104" /> they would have the pleasure of closing before the end of the current week. That was not borne out by facts.  But let it pass.  It was the ordinary statement that a Minister for Finance might be expected to make under the circumstances. He said that it was a great loan, one of the features of the issue being the substantial yield in profits in comparison with other gilt-edged securities.  There was a substantial premium on the return and no deduction of income tax on dividends before distribution.  He quoted tributes from the foreign Press.  I suppose I have to assume that was the British Press, because the tributes were mainly from the British Press, as to the strength of our banking institutions.  On the 4th December, the Minister paraded himself before the Dublin Chamber of Commerce and talked about the Commonwealth. It was all hedged around with the Commonwealth, and comparison was made with other members of the Commonwealth&mdash;what loan had Australia floated; what loan had South Africa floated; what loan had Canada floated, and what was the public debt of Canada compared to this country? South Africa had a public debt in March, 1933, of £280,000,000; Australia had a public debt of £1,203,000,000 and Canada which had applied for a loan earlier had a public debt amounting to $2,649,000,000.  We had nothing like that in the way of debt.  Yet, the amusing thing is that every one of the loans of these people, who are so heavily overburdened with debt, went well, and were all over-subscribed. With regard to the latest Australian loan, I think even the cash applications for a conversion loan of £21,000,000, 3½ per cent.  Commonwealth of Australia Loan were over-subscribed in one and a half hours.  There was not one of these loans but was over-subscribed, even though these countries carried enormous debts, to which the Minister referred at the Chamber of Commerce.  We alone did not succeed in floating it in the time, nor since. Not merely was that so in South Africa, Australia and Canada, but the British Government could float a loan at 3½ per cent. or 3 per cent. and get it over-subscribed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1105" /> I think the last British Conversion Loan ran into nearly £2,000,000,000 and was subscribed in less than a day.  It is quoted at something like 103½ to 104 at the moment, despite the fact that the Minister for Industry and Commerce thinks that no one would put money into a 3½ per cent. loan. Not merely that but I have records of at least 15 counties in England, which made issues at 3 per cent. or something less in municipal funds. Even the Isle of Man got a loan of £530,000 over-subscribed in a couple of hours.  When the Minister was talking so glibly before the Chamber of Commerce about the Commonwealth, was that an attempt to offset the blunder committed by his President? There is not much use going to the Dublin Chamber of Commerce and talking in the Commonwealth strain, comparing this country with other members of the Commonwealth, if you have in the Press of December 6th&mdash; one day later than the Minister's speech&mdash;a letter to Mr. Thomas: &ldquo;Please let us know what you are going to do if we declare a Republic in this country.&rdquo;  That letter is addressed &ldquo;Dear Mr. Thomas&rdquo;, I think, for the first time in any of these dispatches, and it is subscribed: &ldquo;Your most humble and obedient servant.&rdquo;  That is the way politics cut across finance.  The Minister learned a lesson from that, that even the failure of the Fourth National Loan&mdash;&mdash;</P>

What did he say? &ldquo;Thanks to the Labour people, those people affiliated with us in politics, they supported us: they showed their interest in the country and in the good faith of the Government.&rdquo;  The Minister paraded himself as a member of the Commonwealth, while his President was writing about Republican stuff to the British.

      <P>£7,000,000 is necessary unless the Minister is going to tackle the Teachers' Pension Fund, or to make other raids of an unsatisfactory character.  At any rate he paraded himself before the public, and money is required to balance this Budget, which otherwise does not balance.  Right through the debate there has been comment that the farmers, who are certainly not catered for in this Budget, are as well off as ever they were; that they are not paying the British any of the annuities, and are only paying the Government half the annuities; that if their produce has fallen in price, that is due to worldwide depression, and has nothing to do with the economic war.  There is one man who does not believe that. Deputy Davin, who is a strong supporter of the present Government, spoke at Mountrath on April 15th last. <Col N="1107" /> This is the comment that fell from his lips:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;They were being repeatedly reminded by Mr. de Valera and his Ministers that they stood for a policy of self-sufficiency.  Self-sufficiency should mean that they should devise a scheme which would provide our own people with surplus food which we were unable to sell to others.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>According to Mr. Davin:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Mr. de Valera and the Minister for Agriculture would be well advised to give up thinking of and talking politics for a week or two and see whether it was possible to put such a scheme into operation immediately, or if they could devise a better scheme.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>There was this pungent comment on those who believed that the farmers do not pay any of the costs of the tariffs levied by the British:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It was a scandalous state of affairs that they should be asked to tolerate a continuance of the existing position, which enabled cattle dealers from the Six Counties to come into the Free State and smuggle fat cattle over the Border, thereby making profits averaging about £7 per head.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How do the smugglers make £7 a head if the prices in the Northern area are as low as they are here?  Deputy Maguire, who spoke last, said that the farmers in the Six Counties were just a little bit worse off than the farmers here.  Supposing, as far as prices for produce go, they are only getting the same amount as is got here, or get no more or no less, how does it come that smugglers come here, buy our fat cattle and reap £7 of a profit per head? They get no bounty with smuggled cattle.  According to Deputy Davin and everyone else who knows, it is true that a man who can drive cattle across the Border successfully can get on an average a profit of £7 to £8 per head. Does that mean that people in the Six Counties are paying more for them than they pay for other cattle, because they are smuggled?  Where is the sense of proportion gone?  We are told that bounties, at any rate, help, and <Col N="1108" /> are of great assistance.  I say that the bounty does not come into calculation with smuggled cattle.  Men have been known to trade licences for the exportation of cattle, and to pay those who hold licences more than the amount of the bounty.  Having paid more by way of trade for the licence than they get in the way of bounty, they then export, and it is worth their while to export a certain number of fat cattle to the British market and get prices there, even though there is a heavy tariff against them.  The Minister knows well that if there was no quota arrangement, which means that something less than 400 cattle go over where 1,000 use to go, there would still be an outpouring of cattle from this country, because of the advantage that people can still get through selling abroad.  Supposing we were to take the bounties into consideration, who pays these bounties? When the Minister for Finance was speaking on the 14th February of this year on the debate on the Relief of Rates on Agricultural Land, he said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Deputy Dillon knows pretty well that if the local rates were made a charge on the Central Fund the farmer would have to pay them by means of increased taxation.  There is no way out of the dilemma.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That drew &ldquo;Hear, hears&rdquo; from this side of the House.  The Minister went on:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If we make the local rates a charge upon the Central Fund the farmer will only have to take out of one pocket what at the present moment he is taking out of the other.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Apply that to the bounties.  If local rates were put on general taxation, farmers, by reason of the increased taxation, would pay them in the end, according to the Minister for Finance. Supposing bounties are being paid, whatever good they are, and supposing you are getting in all the rates, which is doubtful, who pays for them? If the local rates were transferred to central taxation they would be met in the end by farmers.  The same thing applies to the payment of bounties. The other side of the argument is that <Col N="1109" /> the English market has gone.  The English market is supposed to have gone from us for ever.  We have loose talk here as to what the British Government is doing to protect the farmers there, but we had a new side put on that to-night by Deputy Maguire.  Deputy Maguire said that the Minister for Agriculture in Great Britain had recently lamented that the taste of the people of England was changing.  I always thought our great complaint against the Minister for Agriculture in Great Britain was that he was catering, through the development of British agriculture, for his own people's tastes.  You do not get frozen meat, in the main, from England. Deputy Maguire has a new angle on that.  According to him, it is not the British agriculturist that is our enemy but the Argentinian, the New Zealander, and all those people who send frozen or chilled meat into Great Britain.  We are told that if we do get back to the British market we shall never get back to it with the same volume of exports as we used to have. In a recent debate I pointed out that, in the year 1928, their own statistical information showed that the British consumed £330,000,000 worth of goods in meat of all types, eggs and butter. For that demand in their own country they produced goods at home to the value of £130,000,000 or £140,000,000. They had to supply by importation £200,000,000 worth of goods of the meat, butter and eggs type.  At that time we were supplying about £30,000,000 worth of goods to Great Britain.  That is the 1928 figure.  The 45,000,000 people in Great Britain consumed £330,000,000 worth of stuff, of which they themselves produced about £130,000,000 worth.  Of the £220,000,000 worth that was imported by them, we supplied just about £30,000,000 worth. Is anybody going to tell me that the situation is so changed that there is no room for our £30,000,000 worth of goods?  That is what saying that the British market has gone means&mdash;that there is no room for our £30,000,000 worth of stuff.  If we could get back to that £30,000,000 standard, the situation here would be considerably eased.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moore asked Deputy Fitzgerald why did the British buy from <Col N="1110" /> us: was it on account of good-will or for business reasons?  It was a combination of both.  Somebody else asked why the British should admit us to their market.  There are obvious reasons.  Their taste is not changing, and, so far as the Minister for Agriculture in Great Britain has the force, he is trying to prevent it from changing in a way that would harm this country. He is trying to cater for the taste of the people and to induce them to continue their taste for fresh meat, rather than for chilled or frozen meat.  The taste is there, and it is going to be catered for.  That taste is going to be developed by the present Minister for Agriculture in Great Britain, and, until they get to the point that they do not want our £30,000,000 worth of stuff&mdash; and that is a long way off&mdash;that market is still there for us to acquire&mdash;a good and substantial market.  It is, perhaps, proper to argue that we have got rivals for that market.  We have rivals mainly for the frozen and chilled meat, but surely we have advantages to offer to Great Britain that these countries cannot offer.  Deputy Fitzgerald has referred to the fact that at the Economic Conference of 1929 everyone who spoke there admitted that this country provided a better outlet for British goods than any one of their so-called Colonies.  We have another advantage of which nobody should be ashamed to speak.  We have our geographical position to bargain.  That is not merely an asset, but it was recognised as an asset by the British Government.  It will continue to be recognised as an asset by them so long as they are in the position in which they now are in the event of war.  Would all the meat that Australia, Canada or New Zealand could have sent across the ocean in the days of the Great War have meant anything to Great Britain?  Was it not our proximity that was of value both to us and to them?  We have not lost that value, and they do not feel yet that war is so disappearing as a means of settling differences amongst peoples that they can neglect the advantages they have in good relations with us, even if they were to continue to trade, as they traded for years, by buying more from us than we bought from them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1111" /> When people say that that market is gone, they ought to have some appreciation of facts.  Can anybody tell me that there is a table prepared which shows at this moment that Britain is so saturated with imports we could get our £30,000,000 worth of goods pushed in if we had peace between the two countries?  Does anybody tell me that on a test as between ourselves, New Zealand, Canada or Australia, we have not many things to offer to Britain in the way of good trade relationships that none of these other countries can offer?  Can anybody tell me that these two facts are not appreciated by the British themselves, and that they have not even shown their appreciation of them?  Deputy Corry asked&mdash;it was one of his usual misunderstandings&mdash; what about the reply of the British recently to the New Zealand Government? That is due to a misreading of the newspapers.  This matter has been debated in the British Parliament.  It emerged clearly from that debate that no offer had been made.  A query was put, and it was, apparently, put by the Government of New Zealand in expectation of the answer they got&mdash;almost asking for that answer.  Nobody in the development of trade as between the members of the Commonwealth will get to the point that the so-called New Zealand offer was supposed to ask for &mdash;completely free trade, no barriers anywhere as between the members of the Commonwealth.  We were told that we were in an extremely good position here, that the Minister had collected so much money from the people, and that he has piled up a surplus of £5,000,000.  He had a surplus, we are told, in last year's Budget, and he may have so much in the way of surplus this year that he will not want to borrow. When he says that, he admits that he has extorted from the farmers vast sums whereas, in fact, he promised them remissions of a great part of their taxation.  The British accounts show that the farmer of this country who used pay only his annuity is now paying the annuities lumped together, and he is paying, in addition, the £2,000,000 a year or thereabouts for R.I.C. pensions and other moneys that <Col N="1112" /> used not to be collected immediately from the farmer.  In addition, he is paying half his annuities to this Government.  In addition, he is in the position that what used to be a terminable annuity is now converted into a perpetual payment.  The farmers over whom the present Government used weep about 1928 because of their terribly bad position, are now landed, with all the payments they used make by way of annuities, with £2,000,000 extra per annum which used to come out of the proceeds of general taxation, some of it coming indirectly from the farmers, and in addition, they are paying half the annuities again to this Government while they are not having the sinking fund mounting up as it used for the service of the debt and the wiping out of it in due time.</P>
    <P>The British Government have got to this point with the farmers of the country that they are allowing in as many cattle, sheep and poultry as will pay the annuities, and nothing else. The best the Government can do in the conditions of that particular situation, which they have created themselves, is to inaugurate this campaign of slaughtering the calves of the country.  This House has often heard comments full of irony and sarcasm about the way in which the Government of the United States of America burned their wheat, and how the Government of Brazil burned their coffee.  This was taken as a commentary upon the economic situation in the world which led to this destruction of natural wealth.</P>
    <P>We were saved that here until this year.  There was no deliberate destruction of wealth until the Government this year decided that the only way in which it could save, not the farmers but to an extent the debacle to which they had led the farmers, was to inaugurate this scheme of paying a price for the skins of the calves.  If the Minister could give us any hope, even in this fantastic Budget of his, that there was going to be any better productivity in the future, then it would be easier to bear the continuance of this £4,000,000 increased taxation which he put on the first year, continued the second year and proposes <Col N="1113" /> to continue now.  Where is the productivity?  Is there any better employment in the country than there had been?  The Minister for Industry and Commerce may juggle with figures as much as he likes, but after two years, with larger tariffs, he is not getting as many people into insurable occupations in this country as there were in the last year of the Cosgrave administration when, with lighter tariffs, more people were got into insurable occupations.  His last returns showed that, apart from the number which had gone into insurable occupations, the draw on the fund&mdash;that is, the draw by the number of people who intermittently went out of occupation&mdash;had gone up.  It had gone up by 100,000.  The next year it went down by 20,000, but it is still at 80,000 over the last year of the Cosgrave period of administration.</P>
    <P>We are told about new industries. Are we to have an explanation set against the boast by the Minister of the new industries something that will explain the yield of £1,600,000 in Customs duties last year?  We have got to get the sum total of the new factories, the wages they pay, and to what extent they have increased the purchasing power of the people.  We want some explanation, if there are so many people newly employed, as to how it is that the income tax yield is calculated at nearly £900,000 less than it was in our normal period?  What approach has there been to bringing about these new economies that they promised?</P>
    <P>During the Cumann na nGaedheal administration, out of every 1,000 people in employment there were 530 employed in agriculture and 130 in industry.  Is there any change in that? There is a change to this extent, that there are not 530 out of every 1,000 people now in employment employed in agriculture.  A considerable number of those formerly employed in agriculture are on the dole.  If it were a transition stage one would not mind.  Where is the approach to the new situation in the 60,000 to 80,000 for whom the Minister found it necessary to confess that he could not get employment last winter!  He therefore found it necessary to introduce this system of a dole <Col N="1114" /> for the people who were knocked out of employment on the land&mdash;people who could not find other employment and who were not earning anything.</P>
    <P>Deputy Maguire talked about the way in which the poor and the unemployed have been catered for.  But they are not getting what they were promised.  It was work that was promised and an increase of productivity and industrial activity.  It was not that people were to receive money for doing nothing, not that these people wanted to do nothing, but because the Government had not found anything at which to put them.  Is there any satisfactory feature to which the Minister can point in relation to this year's Budget?  What are the chances of taxation coming down soon?  Supposing we continue next year with these £4,000,000, thus making £16,000,000 in the four years, what then?  We say nothing about getting back the £2,000,000 that we were told by the Ministers opposite could be saved to the country in taxation. What is the chance of taxation being kept even as it is?  Is there any indication now that any of these increased demands will stop soon?  Are the Government aware that they would get a better yield by way of revenue through lower taxation if there was increased productivity?  Is there any sign of increased productivity?  The only thing we can see is that the income tax has yielded £800,000 less than was expected.  There is no sign there of industrial activity.  The Minister proposes to meet taxation by borrowing this year for certain items in his Budget.  There has been so much money put into local loans for the sake of giving employment.  We presume that money has been spent usefully for employment.  Then there are the housing grants.  All these things were to lead to better employment, even if not to an increase in industry.  But it was a transitory thing.  Even with all that, there is a bigger draw on the Unemployment Fund than ever before. And the payments into that fund do not represent any big additional number of people having found employment at industrial work.  If that is the situation when we are putting so much money into local <Col N="1115" /> loans, what is it to be when that money stops filtering in?  Is that to go on? How are we to find money to put into the Local Loans Fund in the coming years?  How is it to be got?  The Minister tried to get £6,000,000 last year and he failed to get it.  The Minister admits that it was those people who were not politically affiliated with him who helped him to get that loan.  They have got the Minister's thanks for coming to his rescue. If the Minister is not going to get this money next year by borrowing, where is it to come from?  He took sixpence off the income tax this year.  Is it not clear that that was rendered necessary by the yield last year? Is it not clear that taxation has got to the saturation point?  The Minister was forced by circumstances to reduce taxation by 6d.  He still has an extra 1/- on the income tax; the two sixpences that he put on still remain. There will be no better yield from the tax next year and the indication on the White Paper was that it was estimated by the experts at much lower than ever before.  It will be up by about £100,000.</P>
    <P>Where does the Minister found his phrase about increased revenue, about everything being buoyant, about there being prosperity, when the ordinary test, the biggest test, the income tax test, proves conclusively that the money is not there?  The business is not there to yield the return.  The Minister has met with failure in the matter of taxation.  He made one failure, for reasons that he may desire to explain, in the matter of borrowing. He is between those two points in the dilemma.  Can he tax more?  It may be through customs.  It may be the industrial system here is yet so incomplete or so poor that necessaries have to be got in from England and, in an indirect way, the Minister may get some money from taxing these articles, but direct taxation is failing him.  If he cannot tax any further he cannot make reductions and, with the lot of the unemployed swelling, it is doubtful if there is any saving to be made on the expenditure side.  He is then faced with borrowing.  There is a sum of <Col N="1116" /> £7,000,000 to be met in some way other than by taxation.  £13,000,000 in two years&mdash;that soon comes to the saturation point, too.  And that is not for the reason that the Minister for Industry and Commerce said, that there is so much industrial activity that people have not money to put into Government loans, but simply that there is not the money here amongst the people.  Those are the two things that will teach the Minister a lesson about economy, the economy that he so often preached from here and that he now so definitely dishonours since he attained a Government position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>One does not expect the Deputy, who has just sat down, to be courteous or polite to anybody, but, at any rate, one did not think he would be candid about his friends.  He opened his speech by saying that he had never listened to a Budget debate in which there was such an absolute avoidance of ordinary facts, and in which there was displayed so much ignorance of business methods as applied to public finance.  And that was said after speeches by Deputy Cosgrave, Deputy MacDermot, Deputy O'Sullivan, Deputy Fitzgerald, Deputy O'Higgins, Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney, and Deputy Anthony, who probably delivered the most intelligent speech upon the Budget&mdash;at least, if Budget statements are to be judged by the standards which Deputy McGilligan has set up for himself.  Appropriately enough, after making that observation, the Deputy proceeded to ask the question: &ldquo;Did you ever see a dream walking?&rdquo;  I say, appropriately enough, because the Deputy has a jazz mind, and it is appropriate that a jazz tune should occur to it as being the most fitting prelude or overture to the grand attack which he was going to launch.  The Budget speech was delivered on the 9th of this month, just a week ago, and after seven days' labour that mountain of a mind which has just evacuated the House asked: &ldquo;Did you ever see a dream walking?&rdquo; That question was asked in regard to a Government which has this record to its credit: In three years, over and above what Cumann na nGaedheal used to give the people of this country, <Col N="1117" /> we have provided (1) for the encouragement of agriculture, £7,000,000; (2) for increases in old age pensions and other social services, £2,000,000; (3) for increased grants in relief of rates on agricultural land, £1,000,000; (4) increased provision for the Land Commission, £1,100,000; (5) increased unemployment maintenance, £1,138,000; (6) increased provision for relief works, £1,900,000, and, in addition, after making those provisions for the past two years and for the year yet to come, we are providing for widows' and orphans' pensions, for a new housing scheme in the Gaeltacht, for I.R.A. pensions and, in addition, we are reducing taxation substantially.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Did you ever see a dream realised, a dream that has been dangling before the people of this country for countless generations, that some day there would be in this country a Government that would govern for the people and make it a country in which the Irish people might live and die in peace and happiness? Could we not, says Deputy McGilligan, reduce taxation to the level at which we found it?  That comes fittingly from a Deputy who, when he was a member of the Government, said quite callously that men might die in this country of starvation as they had died previously, but it was not the duty of the Government to provide either work or maintenance for any of the citizens.  Of course, when Deputy McGilligan sees what he thought was a dream being actually realised, the first thing that occurred to him was: &ldquo;Which of these social services are we going to pare down?&rdquo; He looks back on the exploits of the Government of which he was a member and he sees that their very first act after they felt themselves secure in office was to reduce the pensions payable to the aged poor in this country, and he says: &ldquo;Cannot those men&rdquo;&mdash; this Government that has helped the people of this country to see a dream realised&mdash;&ldquo;reduce taxation as we did?&rdquo;&ldquo;Can they not,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;pare the old age pensions as we pared them?&rdquo; Can they not throw over or shelve the scheme for widows' and orphans' pensions as we shelved it?  Can they not abandon housing and get back to the <Col N="1118" /> condition in which, for over ten years, when an Irish Government was in office, not a single house was built for the worker and the small farmer in the rural districts, and in which the provision made for housing, even in the urban districts, was not sufficient to overtake the number of houses that every year were falling into decay and were being condemned as unfit for human habitation&mdash;a Government that, after ten years in office, had to be compelled by the force of public opinion, expressed by us in opposition, to do something to speed up land division in this country, a Government that, when it was carrying out public works like the Shannon scheme, fixed a rate of wages at such a level that if a married man was employed on the scheme he would not be able to send home sufficient to maintain his wife and family? Therefore, it is quite natural, when this man, who was a member of the former Government, the Government of inertia in this country, sees before him the results of our activities, that he should say: &ldquo;Cannot you do something to reduce taxation; cannot you cut off the old age pensions; cannot you cut off the widows' and orphans' pensions; cannot you cease to divide the land; cannot you stop developing agriculture; cannot you do what we did in 1931 when our own Minister for Agriculture came before us and asked his colleagues in the Cabinet to bring in to this House a Bill on the lines of the Butter (Prices Stabilisation) Bill that would save the dairying industry&mdash; cannot you do as we did then&mdash;fold your hands and say: &lsquo;Let the farmers of Limerick and the farmers of Tipperary look after themselves, let the dairying industry upon which we are told the whole agricultural industry depends, look after itself and sink and go down if it must?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is complained that we are going to borrow extensively.  Anything for which we are going to borrow we can justify.  We are borrowing for the local loans in order to enable the local authorities to deal with the housing problem.  This year, as Deputy Norton said, houses are being built at the rate of 15,000 per annum.  All these houses <Col N="1119" /> are being built at such a cost to the local authorities that they can be let at rents which those who are going to inhabit them can afford to pay.  We have provided for that because, as well as providing the necessary funds to make the necessary loans to the local authorities through the Votes for Local Government and Public Health, we are providing in addition free grants to the local authorities which will enable them to reduce the capital cost of the houses to themselves and, after meeting the capital charges on the loans, they will be able to let those houses at one-half the rent at which they were compelled to let them under the Housing Acts of our predecessors, even under the last Act passed by our predecessors in 1931.</P>
    <P>We are creating, therefore, in this country a tangible asset&mdash;new houses for our people, houses which, apart from anything else, are going to yield a substantial return to the State in the reduction of the expenditure that we have to make at present upon public health and police services&mdash;upon the prevention of disease and crime&mdash; because families that in this country have been lodged in conditions that are a disgrace to civilisation are going now to have decent Christian homes in which they can bring up their children to be good citizens.  When we do that&mdash;because prevention is better than cure&mdash;we will have been able to secure a corresponding reduction in the expenditure that, at the present moment, is necessary in police and public health services.  When he asks us are we going to reduce taxation and when are we going to bring taxation down, is he asking us in effect when are we going to stop the provision of free grants to enable the local authorities to do their task of housing the people decently?  We are borrowing £4,200,000 for local loans, but against that we are creating, as I have said, real estate in this country.  We are investing this money mainly in house property, and the sinking fund and interest on the loans are secured, first of all, by the rents the local authorities will derive from that property, and, secondly, as far as we <Col N="1120" /> are concerned, by the local rates. There never can be and there never was in this country a loan better secured, and there is no reason whatsoever why we should hesitate to borrow for a purpose of that sort.</P>
    <P>We are borrowing £1,000,000 to discharge a debt of honour, a debt that was acknowledged, not merely by us&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to interrupt the Minister, but before he passes to the next point, I wonder if the Minister would say, roughly, how much of the £4,000,000 odd is to be invested in houses?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Practically the whole of it.  I was dealing with one other item for which we are borrowing&mdash;the sum of £1,000,000 for the repayment of the Dáil Eireann External Loan. The ink on the Treaty was scarcely dry when the late General Collins made a statement in the Second Dáil of the Republic that the first obligation which the Government of the new State would assume and discharge was that of repaying the External Loan.  He made that statement, in reply to the late Harry Boland, who had been largely instrumental in raising the loan, I think, in March of 1922.  What he said in March of 1922 was repeated in the Parliament of the Provisional Government in August of that year, and I think was repeated subsequently on behalf of the Government of the new Free State&mdash;the first Government of the new Free State&mdash; in March or April of 1923.  When the former President of the Executive Council was in America he gave categorical pledges there that that loan would be repaid, or, if he did not, his Minister for Propaganda, as he, in effect, was, the present Deputy Fitzgerald, did.  Many times in this House the honour of this country was pledged for the repayment of that loan.  That pledge was never fulfilled and no attempt was made to fulfil it until we came into office.  Then, not only or primarily because of statements that were made even by members of this Dáil that we were defaulting in our international obligations and refusing to honour our agreements, but because we felt ashamed that this debt should have <Col N="1121" /> gone so long unhonoured by us, we brought in, at the earliest possible opportunity, a Bill to redeem that pledge.  It is not our fault that for the past 12 years sums of money were not set aside every year in the times that we have been told so often were good times in this country.  It is not our fault that a sinking fund was not built up to amortise that loan, and, therefore, it is not our obligation in this year to impose additional taxation to the tune of £1,000,000 in order to honour that pledge, the fulfilment of which is at least ten years overdue. And since the pledge must be honoured and the loan redeemed, we propose to do this year what our predecessors did in respect of the Dáil Eireann External Loan&mdash;to raise the money by borrowing and to spread the burden over 25 years.  It is not right that this generation should bear the whole cost of the war of independence. Our predecessors realised that when they borrowed to repay the Dáil Eireann Internal Loan, when they borrowed to pay the sums that were expended in compensating those whose property was damaged or destroyed and when they borrowed to raise the sum required to compensate those who were killed or injured, during what is known as the Black-and-Tan war, in borrowing for that £1,000,000 we are merely acting on the principle which they established.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are borrowing also £1,500,000 for the payment of the export bounties and subsidies, and we are borrowing it against an asset which we have created.  If we had not remitted or funded the annuities which were due in respect of the last half-year of 1932 and the whole of the year 1933, and if we had insisted upon the payment of those annuities, we would have collected into the Exchequer, and would have had a sum of something like £4,450,000. We did not so collect them.  To meet the demands that were put forward from the Opposition Benches, to ease the burden on the farmers, until they had time to reorganise their agricultural production on a new basis, we gave them time to pay.  We did not collect their annuities.  We funded them, and we have spread the payment <Col N="1122" /> of that £4,500,000 by annuities over something like 40 years.  We are collecting those annuities.  Deputy Cosgrave said they were, to his mind, a very uncertain asset, but Deputy Cosgrave is not very familiar with the situation in the country.  The fact is that, in some counties, over 92 per cent. of the land annuities due have been paid and that, over the country as a whole, something like 80 per cent. of the annuities has been paid.  It is quite true that in certain areas there was an organised attempt to break down the system of land purchase in this country. Remember, that speaking in this House on the same subject, in precisely these circumstances, I think in 1924 or 1925, Deputy Hogan, who was then Minister for Agriculture, said that the sheriff was the last bulwark of civilisation. Very well; he is going to be one of the instruments that are going to preserve the local services, and the Government of this State.</P>
    <P>There are, as I said, certain areas where there was an organised attempt to keep the people from paying their annuities.  Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney, when he was speaking, was asked how did he think Mayo was affected by the economic war, and he said that Mayo was one of the counties worst hit by the economic war.  What is the position there?  Out of the total rates due, over 99 per cent. of them have been collected.  The total levy for rates in Mayo is £110,000.  The amount outstanding was £1,100, and of that £1,100 £400 was written off as irrecoverable, because they were rates upon vacant or disused property.  The balance of the rates outstanding in County Mayo is £700.  Deputy Cosgrave, in the course of his statement, referred to two demand notes which had been issued in County Mayo. He ought to treasure those notes; he ought to frame them and add them to his collection of curios, because they are rarities in County Mayo.  The total warrant for land annuities in County Mayo is over £50,000, and the amount collected to date is over £46,000.  Over 92 per cent. of the land annuities and over 99 per cent. of the rates&mdash;almost 100 per cent. of the rates&mdash;have been paid in Mayo, one of the counties <Col N="1123" /> which, in the words of Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney, have been the worst hit by the economic war.  That is not the case in some of the richer counties.  It is the case in Mayo, where, as Deputy Dowdall pointed out this evening, in reply to the speech made by Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney, in 30 years, the number of bullocks on the soil has increased by 30,000 head, and the population living on the same land has decreased by 40,000.  The reason why Mayo has been able to meet its obligations in respect of the land annuities and the rates is because the new policy is providing a livelihood for the man where formerly only the bullock could graze.</P>
    <P>I was saying that while this was true in respect of a number of counties, there were other counties where the collection had been very unsatisfactory, and the counties Tipperary, Waterford, Kilkenny in particular, may be singled out for mention.  What is the position now?  The sheriff, this last bulwark of civilisation, has gone out&mdash;it is rather a mixed metaphor, but still it is my predecessor's&mdash;and the annuities are now being collected in full and are being paid promptly, and not merely the annuities but the sheriff's fees as well.  The whole campaign of non-payment has gone to pieces, and before this year is out we shall establish, beyond yea or nay, this fact, that the funded arrears are going to be a tangible asset, against which, if necessary, we can borrow £1,500,000 to enable us to win through the struggle in which we are now engaged, to enable us to put Irish agriculture upon the same basis upon which it is now being put in Mayo, upon that basis in which the man will increase and prosper, without necessarily involving any decrease in the number of bullocks upon our soil.</P>
    <P>The other point, and, I think, the only point upon which I was challenged as to our policy of borrowing, was in respect of the money which we require for industrial alcohol.  I am not certain whether, in fact, we shall have to borrow for that, because, if that expenditure should happen to be spread over a number of years, we should <Col N="1124" /> naturally meet it out of ordinary revenue.  If we had to borrow for it, it is part of capital expenditure; it is part of the cost of finding a way out of our present difficulties.  We can just as legitimately borrow for that as we can borrow for the export bounties and subsidies, and I have no apology to make for doing it.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan referred to a report written by a chemist who had been engaged in this particular industry 16 or 18 years ago.  That just indicates the obtuseness of Deputy McGilligan's mind.  He quoted a passage from a speech in which I referred to the fact that in the kingdom of the blind the one-eyed man is king.  Upon that basis Deputy McGilligan does not rank with the kings; he walks with the common proletariat, because he has no eyes to see that 16 or 18 years have passed since this professor to whom he refers was engaged in this particular industry, and that there have been 18 years of mechanical and chemical progress since then.  Just as when we instituted the sugar beet industry here, and found that this country was better fitted for the cultivation of beet than any other country in Europe, and that we are getting a higher yield from sugar and a higher sugar content from our beet, so, too, there is a possibility that we can get a higher starch content from our potatoes than possibly any other country.  It is a crop to the cultivation of which a great deal of the Irish farmers' time and hereditary skill have been devoted.  I know that in the North of Ireland, at any rate, where this experiment is going to be made, we can have a much larger yield and produce a much better potato &mdash;I am not certain if this has much to do with it&mdash;than anywhere else in Great Britain or Ireland.</P>
    <P>Apart altogether from that, there is this fact, that for certain purposes a mixture of refined petrol and industrial alcohol is absolutely necessary.  I believe it makes the best aviation spirit.  I believe that for racing machines it is superior to any other, and the quantity which we will turn out as a result of the establishment of that industry here is a quantity that we can quite easily absorb in <Col N="1125" /> specialised services in this country. Quite frankly, it is an experiment, but it is an experiment which I believe holds in it great possibilities for this country.  If it goes down, if we fail and the money is lost, well it is not right and it would not be equitable that the people of the country in one year should bear the whole cost of that experiment. If it succeeds, not merely ourselves but posterity will benefit, and we are quite entitled in those circumstances to borrow for that sum.  In any event, even the loss goes to the farmer.</P>
    <P>We have been challenged because we are going to borrow in all £7,000,000 for purposes of this kind.  Who are questioning our right to borrow?  Who are the people who are saying that this Budget is fundamentally unsound because we are borrowing?  They are the gentlemen&mdash;and I have their record here dating back from 1925-26&mdash;who borrowed for public works and buildings, for the normal cost of the Army, for the Land Commission, for forestry, for Army pensions, for advances to agricultural credit societies which had afterwards to be written off, and which they knew at the time they were making them were not likely to be recovered.  They borrowed for a hundred and one items throughout the Estimates&mdash;items like forestry, provision for the Army and Army pensions. We are not borrowing the additional £180,000 that will be required this year to pay pensions to soldiers of the I.R.A., who were loyal to the cause for which they first enlisted.  We are not borrowing anything to defray the cost of the Army this year, even when the cost of the Army is going up.  Our predecessors, those financial purists, had no hesitation about borrowing for at least a dozen services which we are meeting out of ordinary revenue, because we know that those are going to be recurring expenses, and that they can honestly be paid only out of ordinary revenue.  How much did they borrow?  I have a list of services the cost of which should have been defrayed out of taxation, for which our predecessors borrowed £4,900,000.  In respect of those borrowings they have <Col N="1126" /> saddled the people of this country with a debt which, for the next 20 or 25 years, they will have to pay off at the rate of about £300,000 per annum. Where are we going to reduce taxation, says Deputy McGilligan?  We could reduce taxation by that £300,000 if they would come forward now and provide us with the £4,900,000 which they borrowed, when they ought to have taxed for it.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan said last year that we raided the Suspense Account.  What is the record of our predecessors?  They raided the Local Loans Fund.  Deputy Cosgrave asked me how it was that in the year 1932 I valued the assets of the Local Loans Fund at only something like £2,500,000, whereas, in fact, in my last statement I valued them then at £2,800,000, and although we had only appropriated £2,250,000 for the purpose last year and £550,000 for it the year before, nevertheless the Local Loans Fund now stood at the figure of £6,018,000.  I will tell you how we account for that.  When I came in, the figures were presented to me in the way in which they were presented to Mr. Blythe.  I took the figures and put them in my 1932 statement, because that is the way they would have appeared if Mr. Blythe had been Minister for Finance at that date, and our predecessors had been in office.  They would have had no scruples in raiding the Local Loans Fund, and in withdrawing from it, in the year 1932-33, £300,000, in the same way as in the preceding year they withdrew £100,000 and said: &ldquo;Oh, that is the interest due to the Exchequer on the Local Loans.&rdquo; We have not withdrawn it.  It has gone into the Local Loans, and will remain there until we are in this position, that for the continuance of our housing scheme and for such other development works as we may have to undertake, like the development of afforestation in this country, we will have from the Local Loans Fund sufficient revenue, independent of borrowing, to pay for development work in this country.  We are building up a development fund that will enable us to do all the things that should have been done by our predecessors during the ten years they <Col N="1127" /> were in office, without having to impose an additional penny piece of taxation upon our people.  I move to report progress.</P>
