      <P>In the course of my remarks last night, I made an appeal to the Minister to consider the question of a bounty on lobsters.  I have been pressing that for the last 12 months and I am very glad to see by this morning's Press that the Department has yielded to the pressure I have brought to bear on it during the past 12 months.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnONeill" hpid="Mr. O'Neill Mr. O'Neill">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>As I am on this question of bounties, there is another aspect of our sea fisheries that might also be considered in this light&mdash;the export of salt mackerel to the American <Col N="327" /> market.  This has been a fairly remunerative market for many years past.  The trade is confined to the south-western coast of the Free State, on a country extending from Dingle down through Valentia, Castletownbere, Garinish, Allihies and those other places and it was a very remunerative trade for the fishermen of that portion of our country.  It is an autumn trade and the mackerel are packed in barrels and salted.  The only outlet for them has been the American market.  There has been a tariff against this class of trade in the American market for some time past and we have made representations, through our representatives in New York, to the American authorities from time to time to have this tariff modified but not with any degree of success, so I would suggest that the Minister, if he is in a favourable mood to consider the encouragement of Irish fisheries, should look into the question of an export bounty on fish sent to the American market.  It is a very important matter.</P>
      <P>In his opening remarks, the Minister made reference to certain changes in the personnel of the Department.  He has told the House that these changes have brought about a certain amount of reduction in the Vote and that is so, but I think we would be more concerned to know whether these changes have made for efficiency in the administration of the Department. The Secretary of the Department, Mr. Moriarty, who filled that position for many years is gone.  He was in that position for many years before the Free State came into existence and he has retired&mdash;I suppose on the age limit. He is a man we are very sorry to lose because he had a perfect knowledge of fishing conditions in the country and we can only hope that the gentleman succeeding him will be able, with his knowledge and experience gained from studying the methods of his predecessor, to fill the position just as successfully.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was one change in the staff which I find it very difficult to understand. That is the case of Mr. McKnight.  He was in the Inland <Col N="328" /> Fisheries Department.  He had 35 years' experience.  He was a man second to none in his knowledge of the administration of that Department.  He was a painstaking and courteous official, and an expert in the particular work on the administration of which he was engaged.  He was called upon to resign on the 1st April, and he has resigned.  I do not think any reason has been given for calling upon him to resign.  He has, of course, got the pension to which he is entitled under the statutory terms of his appointment, but it would be well for us to know why his services were dispensed with, because he was a man capable of many good years excellent service in the Department. Somebody else has been appointed on another salary to fill his position, while he has gone out on pension. It is an increased cost which, in my opinion, does not seem to be warranted.</P>
    <P>With regard to the fisheries in general, there is one very definite element which has to be taken into account in connection with the fishery question on the shores of our country, and that is the psychology of the Irish fisherman.  The Irish fisherman is a very peculiar and temperamental being.  In any schemes that we may evolve for the betterment and development of fisheries we have to take that element into account.  The Irish fisherman, like Irishmen in other walks of life, expects a lot to be done for him.  Our aim should rather be to develop in the fisherman the spirit of self-reliance and the spirit of initiative. I saw yesterday in the report of some of our industrialist associations a reference to the fact that the Irish fisherman has been too prone to stick to purely inshore fishing.  They allege that the want of success in our fisheries is due to the fact that the fishermen are not equipped with gear which will enable them to follow the fish from the confines of their own harbour.  There is a good deal in that.  We find on our coasts men from all over the world&mdash; certainly from all over every maritime country in Western Europe&mdash;engaged in fishing there.  We should try to encourage in our people the spirit of <Col N="329" /> adventure.  Sometimes, while there might be very good fishing off the coast of Donegal, there might be very bad fishing off the coast of County Cork. Our fishermen should be so equipped and provided with gear that they will be able to follow the fish where the fish abound.  Something should be done on educational lines to inculcate in our people that spirit of initiative and adventure in regard to fishing.</P>
    <P>That brings me to another point, which is that we have in the maritime towns of this country a lot of young men who, in the natural course of events, would have adapted themselves to the mercantile marine; that is, they would have gone as sailors on British ships.  Owing to the decrease in British shipping, and the decline of foreign trade, a lot of those young men now find themselves without berths.  I think it might be well for our Department of Fisheries to consider the question of equipping up-to-date trawlers. Mind, I want to get away from the idea of chartering secondhand trawlers of an out-of-date type, as we have done for the last few years.  The building of modern trawlers, getting experienced men from other countries, if necessary, preferably Scotchmen, whom I find, from experience, to be the best men for that type of work, getting our own sailors to man those boats, to sail them under our own flag, and to carry on the fishing industry as it must be carried on&mdash;all those things are necessary for the success of that industry.  You must have boats and you must have gear capable of dealing with this in a big way.  You must have ships capable of staying at sea in all sorts of weather, and able to follow the shoals of fish from any part of the shore to another. This, of course, will involve expense. It will involve very much more; it will involve imagination; it will involve enterprise on the part of our Department, and, above all, it cannot be done without the Department making a generous gesture, and without the Government backing them with regard to funds.  As I pointed out last night, the amount of money asked for in this vote is altogether inadequate for an industry that ought to be the second industry in this country.  It ought to <Col N="330" /> be second only to agriculture.  The total amount asked for the whole service here&mdash;Gaeltacht Fisheries, the Sea Fisheries' Association, and all the other activities&mdash;is not one-tenth of what was spent last year on the cultivation of tobacco.  As I pointed out, the increase on the Vote for the Civic Guard this year was about £70,000, principally necessitated by the creation of a new unit, and still our whole fishing industry is put down for a miserable sum of only £50,000.  If this fishery question is to be taken seriously it has got to be tackled in a way in which it was not tackled in the past.  More money is needed for it.  If money can be found for the purposes I have indicated it certainly should be found in a very liberal manner, in order to encourage this very important industry, or rather what ought to be an important industry.  It is not, at the present time, an important industry.</P>
    <P>I think I have very little more to add on the matter, but I say that this whole question is one which has got to be examined very carefully. Hitherto it has not got the examination it requires.  It has got nothing like the examination adequate to its importance.  I would impress upon the Minister that he should do something bold, and do it very quickly, if the fishery industry on our coasts is going to be something better than it is.  At the present time it is really non-existent.  There is really no such thing as a fishing industry on our coasts.  It is in a very spasmodic form, and is limited to a very low proportion of the people on our sea coast who might derive a profitable living from it if it were properly developed.  I sympathise with the Minister, because I realise that he has a very difficult task.  As I pointed out last night, I do not want to assail the present Government for any drawbacks in the present administration of the Fisheries Department, but I say that since we have assumed self-government in this country, since we got control of the affairs of our nation, neither the previous Government nor the present Government has grasped this problem or attempted to grapple with it in <Col N="331" /> the way in which it should be grappled with.  I sympathise with the Minister in dealing with&mdash;I do not want to be funny&mdash;this very slippery subject.  It is one that certainly ought to command a little more attention, and a little more earnest consideration than up to now it has received.  It is a Department upon which money might well be spent, and upon which money must be spent.  There is no use in trying to tinker along with it in the way it has been tinkered with.  It has been simply a tinkering Department up to now.  I would appeal to the Minister, and to every Minister of the Government, as well as to the financial authorities behind them, to make a generous gesture with regard to doing something to give our fishermen on the shores of this country an adequate opportunity of getting trained in modern methods of fishing, and equipping our people&mdash;those who are already trained&mdash;with boats and gear to enable them to get some return from their labours on the sea. I would also appeal to the Minister to wipe out some of the old debts for boats which are out-of-date, which were bought at very high prices, and which became to us after the war a sort of <i>damnosa hereditas.</i>  They were built at the peak of boat building costs, and proved after a short time totally inadequate, out-of-date and unfit for service.</P>
    <P>With those remarks I will conclude, but I would ask the Minister to do something very bold.  It must be done. The Fisheries Estimate here year after year has been, as I pointed out yesterday afternoon, a sort of joke. Fishing is not a joke.  For the men who have got to go down to the sea in ships and earn their living in the waters it is anything but a joke. It is a very tragic experience for the best of them.  Those who have to win their living from the sea have got a very arduous task indeed. They deserve the sympathy of the House; they deserve the consideration of the Government; and they deserve very liberal terms; because I really do say that sea fishing as an <Col N="332" /> industry is not known in this country. It has never been really practised and it has not been understood by any of our administrators.  I, therefore, make a very strong appeal now that this question should be tackled once and for all and should receive the consideration which such an important matter merits.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHales" hpid="Mr. Hales Mr. Hales">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hales</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very gratifying to know that the Minister has at last determined to tackle this problem.  I have not the experience of the fishing industry which Deputy O'Neill has and I will just deal with what experience I have gained from the fishermen of West Cork from the point of view of protection, which after all is the all-important factor.  I have a suggestion to offer and I think suggestions are most valuable in this matter.  Protection to be effective must have in it the element of surprise and to have the element of surprise you must be within reasonable striking distance.  That, in itself, of course rules out all argument in favour of the &ldquo;Muirchu&rdquo; and even the provision of two or three boats of the same type would, I believe, not be effective.  What I am going to suggest should interest not alone the Minister, but the Minister for Defence, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and the Commissioner of the Gárda Síochána.  Deputy O'Neill stated that a big sum is being spent on a new force.  Does not this provide an excellent opportunity, not alone to put this force into effective training, but to give them practical work to do?  I am confident that it would pay the Minister for Finance if this matter was dealt with in the way I am suggesting as, not alone would you safeguard the fishing grounds, but you would prevent a large amount of foreign brandy coming in here which is being sold as whiskey.  I am also confident that it would pay the Minister for Industry and Commerce to prevent other goods coming in here and being sold wholesale through the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These trawlers are off the coast of West Cork day after day and night after night.  My suggestion is that the Minister should consult with the Minister for Defence and the Commissioner of the Gárda Síochána and <Col N="333" /> arrange for the employment of this new force in the work of protection. Personally, if I were in charge of my part of West Cork with ten men I would not let a trawler in there&mdash;I would clear them all out within a month.  These trawlers come into the harbours there.  On Sunday morning I saw one anchored inside Bantry Bay. You have 25 miles on the outside to cut off their retreat.  You want disciplined men who are prepared to risk their lives at the job.  Lifeboats that would stand the recoil of an effective gun would do the job.  They should have a speed equal to the trawlers.  I am told that a trawler when trawling cannot exceed two miles an hour and that its highest speed would be eight or ten knots. Once you create in these pirates a sense of insecurity they are finished. You can only create that by making them realise that the protective force is here, there and everywhere.  To my mind, a protective force like that will save the Exchequer a pile of money.</P>
    <P>Probably my suggestion will be turned down by the Department of Fisheries.  Possibly all good and sound suggestions are always turned down or misunderstood.  I believe, however, that the time is ripe to deal with this matter in the manner I am suggesting. It is time that the Department of Fisheries, the Department of Defence and the Commissioner of the Gárda Síochána should go into this whole question.  In my opinion, they are the only people who will be able to deal with this.  I have had suggestions made to me by the practical fishermen of West Cork.  These men spend night after night fishing.  Their boats go as far as the Scottish coast and the Isle of Man.  They have been in boats that stood the recoil of a 3-inch gun.  I know that if I sent suggestions up to the Department they would only laugh at me.  The time has come for an earnest effort to be made to deal with this matter.  Anyone who says that the protection of the fisheries will cost more than the catch I believe is absolutely wrong.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Neill certainly raised a fundamental point about the catches off the coast in the time of the Great <Col N="334" /> War and also about the old debts. One certainly has relation to the other. But for the great catches during the European War and the quantity of fish available you would not have these old debts to-day.  These loans were made at the peak point of prosperity. They were made at a time when the banks were giving thousands of pounds to farmers and when a farmer would get £40 for an old sow.  Personally, I think that the sooner the Department consider drawing the blue pencil across these debts the better.  We do not want to criticise the Minister here. He has an enormous task before him. He certainly has done wonders for agriculture.  Now he has taken up fisheries as a new branch.  I earnestly pray that he will prove to be as successful in that as he has been in the other.  I have no doubt that he will get the co-operation of Deputies opposite in dealing with this problem and that we shall have something effective done.  I put forward my suggestion honestly and sincerely as the only alternative possible.  The Minister should consult with the men who are able to do this, not alone for the sake of his own Department, but also for that of other Departments which are so vital to this State.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMichaelBurke" hpid="Mr. J.M. Burke Mr. J.M. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.M. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me start by remarking that the amount of money allocated to this particular Department is simply negligible and by no means commensurate with the importance of our fisheries, which if properly fostered and developed would be an invaluable asset to this country.  Deputy O'Neill very properly and truly said it was second only in importance to agriculture. <Col N="336" /> There is no doubt that so far as the inland fisheries are concerned there has been a considerable and marked improvement since the Free State was established.  I have, like Deputy Fionán Lynch, a certain amount of sympathy with the genuine sportsman who surreptitiously hooks or spears a salmon, not for mere profit or gain but for the simple sport of the thing, but I do think that the penalties imposed on the poisoner who, with spurge or <i>bainnicéan</i>, destroys the whole river from its upper regions until it enters the sea are entirely inadequate to his offence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me say in passing that while I am glad to see that the Limerick Board of Conservators are now being restored to a position of normalcy through the assistance of the Department, I am credibly informed that their financial position was largely due to inefficient administration and imperfect accountancy.  However, the matter in which I, naturally, as a representative of the district which Deputies Hales and O'Neill are also representing, am chiefly concerned with is the coastal fisheries.  Undoubtedly in recent years, for various reasons and owing to circumstances some of which were inevitable, the fishing industry has considerably declined.  I can well remember myself when you could almost cross Baltimore Harbour by stepping from fishing boat to fishing boat.  That port has now practically become a deserted village.  During the war that and other ports were humming with industry.  During that time, as has been pointed out by other speakers, many of the fishermen, hardworking, thrifty, industrious men, were encouraged when the fish were plentiful and their price had soared to inordinate heights to purchase fishing boats.  Unfortunately the fishing industry collapsed and the result is that many of these men are unable to pay the debts which they incurred in the circumstances that then prevailed. In consequence many of their sureties are now being harassed day by day with threats of civil bills, plenary summonses and the machinery of the law.  I agree with Deputy Hales that the time has arrived when in the interests of the Free State and for the <Col N="337" /> encouragement of the fisheries the blue pencil ought to be drawn through all these debts.  It is a fact, and it is well known to some of the representatives here, that the fishery harbours, our coves, creeks and harbours, are now full of rotting hulks which I may describe as the unsplendid wrecks of former times.</P>
    <P>I do appeal to the Minister, who, I am sure, will be very sympathetic and will do his best in the matter to come to the relief of these poor people who, through no fault of their own, have become unable to meet their obligations. By doing so he will give encouragement to the fishermen of the area which I have the honour to represent.</P>
    <P>Last evening Deputy Corry made the most sensible and certainly the sanest speech I ever heard him make in this House.  It reminded me of the old saying that out of the mouths of babes wisdom comes.  I am quite sure, and I would lay more than an even bet, that the Deputy could not distinguish between a brill and a turbot, a pilchard and a herring, but he was quite right in saying&mdash;though these observations created some cachinnation and giggling in the House&mdash;that most of the so-called sardines sold in this country are in reality Irish sprats.  I believe that is about the truest thing that Deputy Corry or any other Deputy ever gave expression to in this House.  It strikes me that most of the Deputies in this House are interested in angling because, judging from the truthfulness of the statements usually made here, I am sure that they are all devotees of Izaak Walton.</P>
    <P>What is really of great importance is the protection of our coasts from the foreign trawlers.  We have historical evidence that from the very earliest times foreigners have found the Irish sea coasts happy hunting grounds.  I may tell the Minister and the Government that in the old days, as may be learned from some of the ancient inquisitions, the Irish chieftains made them pay very well for their incursions into Irish water.  It is a great pity that with all the machinery, all the instruments of protection which are within the grasp of a modern Government, no <Col N="338" /> effective steps have so far been taken to preserve our fisheries from daily attacks and encroachments by foreign trawlers.  As a matter of fact, I may say that at the present time the position is simply Gilbertian.  Some time ago a friend of mine in France sent me a French paper&mdash;I think it is called <i>L'Ouest.</i>  I am not now saying that my pronunciation is either according to Hoyle or Cocker.  So far as I can make out, that is more or less the correct French pronunciation.</P>

      <P>This paper is recognised as &ldquo;Truth in the News&rdquo; of France. I read in it that there is a common fund established by the fishermen of France out of which all penalties imposed on them for trawling within the territorial waters of another State are paid.  That was printed in the very largest type, such a type as sometimes is used to report Deputy Corry's speeches when he delivers an oration of supreme national importance.  I am aware that some time ago a Spanish boat was caught infringing the law, and a very smart penalty was put on the skipper.  His gear was confiscated. When the captain was released from custody he said: &ldquo;One scrape on my way out will pay the whole cost.&rdquo;  This is a state of affairs that surely the Government is able to cope with and I am sure every Deputy here will agree that it should be dealt with drastically and at once.  There are just running through my mind some lines of Rudyard Kipling which, with necessary modifications, I may apply to the situation with regard to the trawlers invading our coastal waters:&mdash;</P>
      <P>English there be and canny Scottie</P>
      <P>Who hang on our inshore flank</P>
      <P>And the pirate Dane and the robber from Spain,</P>
      <P>But the worst of them all is the Frank.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In all sincerity and with all the earnestness of which I am capable I appeal to the Minister and those associated with him to take immediate steps to put an end to what has become a shame and a disgrace to the Free State.  It means a big loss <Col N="339" /> to the industrious fishermen along not only the West Cork coast but the coast-line all around Ireland.  I was very glad to observe this morning that the Government is affording some relief to the poor lobster men. Lobster fishermen wring a very scanty and a very precarious livelihood from the reluctant bosom of what Homer calls the unvintageable brine. Very few Deputies are aware of the difficult conditions under which those toilers of the deep ply their trade. I will take one island along the coast of West Cork as an example. I suppose Hare Island is one of the poorest places in the whole country. Men from that island carry on their calling from the Blaskets to Ballycotton. They venture into the sea in open boats.  They cook their meagre meals on board.  At night time they seek refuge in some sheltered cove. What they earn after all this difficult and dangerous work would be considered by any Labour representative in this House, and rightly considered, a wretched reward for very strenuous toil.  I therefore hope that in addition to the relief which the Minister has already afforded to the lobster men he will give further assistance to those people to whom I have referred.  They really deserve the fullest consideration and the most liberal encouragement.</P>

      <P>I agree with those Deputies who said that the fishing industry has been on the decline for a good many years. It is very hard to know where to apportion the blame.  I do not think there is anyone to blame, either on this side of the House or on the opposite side, because, in the first place, the situation, as far as the fishing industry is concerned, has become chronic, so much so that it will take years of endeavour and keen concentration to bring it back to anything like a satisfactory standard again.  A month or two ago a Bill was introduced here for the protection of the fisheries.  The object, of course, was to provide powers by which foreign trawlers coming to our coast with the intention of fishing, and executing depredations upon the home fishermen, could be dealt with and stopped.  So far we have had no satisfactory results in that direction.  I hope, in the near future, three, four, five or six motor launches will be provided and equipped and fitted with armaments if necessary, to enable them to bring these trawlers, carrying out any depredations on our coast, to account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like other Deputies who have spoken, I was very glad this morning to learn it was the intention of the Minister to pay bounties on the export of lobsters.  We have been pleading for that in the last year and a half, ever since the British first imposed tariffs, because we realised that as long as <Col N="341" /> these tariffs existed there was not much chance for our fishermen deriving any profit from the lobster fishing industry.  Listening to Deputy O'Neill one would imagine that it was he was responsible for the bringing about of this bounty on lobsters.  One thing the Minister has to his credit, already, since he assumed control of the fisheries of this State, is that he has given this intimation of paying bounties until further notice on the export of lobsters. There is one thing, and it is most important, that I wish to stress: that is the condition by which people have to pay a deposit of so much per cent. before they can get boats from the Sea Fisheries Association.  I emphasise this point very much.  It is our avowed intention to do our best for the fishing industry, and to promote it in every way, and while giving expression to these sentiments in words, that we are out to promote the fishing industry in this country, we come along and place what amounts to a heavy tariff on the industry of the fishermen.  It is worse than a tariff.  It is an initial tax. Before the men can go out fishing at all they have to plank down a deposit on the nail, before they can get a boat. I do not think that is in keeping with wise procedure.  If this is being done from the point of view of security, the boat should be sufficient security, because the boat will be all the time the property of the Sea Fisheries Association, and ultimately the property of the Department.</P>
    <P>Again, under this system of deposit a person with a little more money than his neighbour will get a boat though he may not be half as well up in the fishing business as the person who has no money.  That is why I say this deposit condition should be completely eliminated in this business.  As I said, it amounts almost to a tariff.  It is bad enough to have a direct tariff on the product of the industry without having another introduced now.  I hope the Minister will see his way to revoke this condition and to provide boat and gear for the people who want them and have rendered a good account of themselves for the past eight or ten years.</P>
    <P>Now, before I deal with the inland fisheries, I take it that the chief difference between the policy of the <Col N="342" /> present Fianna Fáil Government and the policy of the previous Government with regard to fishing is this: The previous Government were more in favour of encouraging trawling and chartering trawlers from outside for the purpose of keeping the Irish market with a constant supply of fish.  It is the policy of the present Government to develop the inshore fisheries first, and, I think, that is the wiser policy, because when that is made a success, out of it the other will develop.  I am glad to see that it is the intention of the Minister to convert those boats lying idle in the boatyards to some use.  Perhaps, after a while, when the inland fisheries are brought up to standard we can then turn our attention to trawling.</P>
    <P>With regard to the inland fisheries there are many complaints made that our rivers are not properly protected from the depredations of poachers and people like that.  It would not be so bad if these people confined themselves to ordinary poaching, but in some cases they come along at night and dynamite a river.  That state of affairs is particularly applicable to the Feale and Cashen rivers in which I am deeply interested.  I advise the Minister to look to this question of the protection of the rivers, and to make sure that no further depredations of this sort will be allowed. Another point.  I do not think it is advisable to allow net fishing on other than tidal waters.  Many people have made representations to me in reference to that, and pointed out that such a thing is always injurious to rod and line fishing.  That is all I want to say; I will finish by thanking the Minister, on behalf of the fishermen engaged in the lobster fishing industry, for his guaranteeing them a bounty on their export of lobsters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyJMurphy" hpid="Mr. T. Murphy Mr. T. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been in this House for about 11 years, and there is very little difference in the speeches I heard to-day from those delivered during that time, on this Estimate.  One refers to the Estimate with a feeling more of sorrow than anger, and what one has most about the fishing industry is a sort of feeling of hopelessness.  I might be unduly pessimistic but that feeling <Col N="343" /> has not been alleviated much by a great deal of what I heard in this debate.  Word for word it is a repetition of the annual tale in connection with this industry.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lynch's statement last night was fair.  He was anxious to be helpful, but practically admitted that during the time that he had charge of this Department very little progress was made.  Changes were made in certain directions, but generally the industry continued to decline.  I should like to hear from the Minister what proposal he has for ascertaining definitely what is wrong.  The provision of facilities in the way of gear and equipment, and for restricting the invasion of the fishing grounds, in which Irishmen should have first claim, are all to the good.  I should like to know if the Minister has examined the position sufficiently to ascertain if there is nothing more wrong with the industry. Has the Minister satisfied himself that more rapid progress could not be made, or is it the position Deputy Kissane referred to, that that will take long and weary years.  I desire to support my colleagues from West Cork with regard to the necessity for protecting our fisheries.  I noticed with pleasure that recently fines have been imposed which have been very substantial.  That was a source of complaint in the past.  Without wishing to comment in any way on judicial decisions, it was felt that the protection given in that way was anything but adequate.  If the penalties are made more severe that should help to stop foreign poachers.  Deputy Corry and other Deputies who went to the trouble of making suggestions as to how better protection might be organised deserve a good deal of credit. The difficulty when dealing with a question like this is to find people with constructive views.  We are all pretty free in complaining, but when we get down to the task of examining the position, it is much more difficult to produce a constructive scheme of organisation.  I would like to hear what the Minister's proposals are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What are the proposals of the Sea <Col N="344" /> Fisheries Association to secure the regular sale of fresh fish in inland towns?  Attempts in that direction in the past were not successful.  There is an opportunity to do a good deal in that way.  Last year I found in more than one seaside town that not a bit of fresh fish was available.  One begins to wonder why people have to be contented with tinned fish in places like Castletownbere on Fridays.  There is certainly room for improvement in that direction.  I should remind the Minister that the Sea Fisheries Association is not in many parts a very popular organisation with fishermen.  I am not going to enter into the cause now, as I am not in a position to judge, but a good many of the fishermen feel that that Association could be much more helpful.</P>
    <P>I re-echo what Deputy Kissane said as to the initial outlay demanded from fishermen, many of whom while being capable fishermen, are not in a position to find substantial sums of money to deposit for the purchase of boats.  I wish to support what other Deputies pointed out, the necessity of improving the facilities for landing boats, and providing shelter.  Co-operation between the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, who certainly knows a good deal about this industry, should certainly be helpful by providing grants out of the relief schemes for small marine works here and there along the coast.  That would make the work of the fishermen easier.</P>
    <P>The Minister might also consider the advisability of examining into the question of how far our harbours are safe for fishermen who have to use them at night.  There have been complaints for many years about the lighting of harbours, about the removal of certain marks and lights in West Cork which have not been replaced.  Finally I want to endorse what has been said regarding outstanding loans.  The officials of the Fishery Department are deceiving themselves in retaining accounts dealing with these loans on the books.  They are absolutely irrecoverable. The main responsibility for that state of affairs is the decline of the industry.  If the policy of trying to <Col N="345" /> recover these loans is continued it simply means mulcting kindly neighbours who backed up the fishermen when there were better possibilities in the industry.  As Deputy Hales said, many people purchased boats at a time when there was a shortage of food. When the demand declined they found themselves in a difficult position.  Boats have been lying derelict at Baltimore for that reason.  There is no earthly chance of recovering this money, except the Minister wants to recover it from those who went security.  That would be a hardship, as long as the persons who are primarily responsible for the debts are there.  I believe the Minister feels it would be unwise to pursue that policy, more especially in view of the undertaking given by the President and other Ministers, that the slate would be wiped clean.  At least, that was the view taken, that the slate would be wiped clean of old loans.  I am anxious to hear what the Minister has to say on the points raised.  I feel that the Minister's position is not a very enviable one but he will have the co-operation of all sides in trying to make it easy for him, and to make the results as fruitful as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Neill appealed to the Minister to bring about a spirit of initiative and adventure in our young fishermen.  The Deputy was probably referring to men who have not yet taken up fishing as an avocation. It would be a wise thing to pursue that proposal.  Where is the initiative to come from?  It is clear that it can only come if there is some inducement from the Department.  We are going backwards instead of going forward in this industry.  There is no use in bandying criticism about responsibility. The young men of to-day were only ten or twelve years old when the war ceased and when the collapse came about in the fishing industry.  In the intervening period, for all practical purposes, the fishing industry around our shores is dead.  There is no blinking the fact that the Irish fishing industry is practically dead.  The sooner we face the fact the better. Having reached that conclusion, what are we going to do?  In my opinion the <Col N="346" /> greatest blunder that could be made was made recently, in the division of the Gaeltacht and Fishery Services. That was a primary blunder, and until it is remedied we are not going to succeed, because the men who originally amalgamated or set up the machine to deal with these twin services were men who had intimate acquaintance with the question.  They were men of vision and courage.</P>
      <P>What did they do?  Under the British administration, through the efforts of the Irish Parliamentary Party, pressure was brought to bear on the British Government to set aside a considerable sum of money which was to be put at the disposal of a board to deal with this problem.  In other words, it was considered then that it was a problem in and by itself. At the inception of the Free State, after the Treaty, the Congested Districts Board was abolished.  In my opinion, that was a blunder of the very first magnitude, because, I again repeat that, in my judgment, this is a problem by itself.  It is a problem that should be dealt with by itself, and is a whole-time job for any Minister.  This method of dealing with the question is purely tinkering with it.  It is purely a waste of money.  What is this Vote for?  What is going to be done with this money when it is voted here? Nothing.  You are only, as I have said, tinkering with the job, and this method of dealing with it is leading nowhere. What do we find here?  This invalid baby is being handed over to the Minister for Agriculture, and while I do not want to exaggerate the responsibilities which he has already, I think he will himself be the first to admit that the job he has already is more than one man's job.  Certainly, I think it is highly unfortunate that the Minister was so unwise as to accept responsibility for this Department, whoever pressed it on him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In three years we have had three different Ministers for this Department. I think the three Votes we have had for the past three years were under separate Ministries.  What impression does that give one except, as I have said already, that of handing round the baby?  The first man put in <Col N="347" /> charge of it tired of it.  It was passed on to another man.  He passed it on to the next man who will, I suppose, pass it on to somebody else.  We hear talk about protection.  Protection for what?  Protecting the fisheries of a State which only consumes two pounds of fish per head of the population.  We talk about self-sufficiency, self-sufficiency in everything.  Yet our consumption of fish averages only two pounds per head of the population, while the consumption in England is approximately 32 pounds per head of the population.  Just contrast these figures.  Everybody knows that England is a predominantly Protestant country, and that there is no obligation to eat fish any day in the week.  There is an obligation on the majority of the people in this Catholic State to eat fish at least once a week, and yet we consume only two pounds of fish per head of the population.  Where is the use of protecting the industry if that is the total consumption for the country? There is no industry to protect.</P>
    <P>Again I come back to the suggestion of Deputy O'Neill with regard to some initiative on the part of our people. The trouble is where is that to come from?  If some organisation is founded to create and generate that initiative, where is it to come from?  Clearly it has to be a Government Department or a department financed by the Government under Government control, but, if you like, acting semi-independently. In my opinion it is sheer waste of time to deal with this question unless it is done in that way.  I would venture to prophesy that no matter what the Minister's intentions are, though they be of the very best, he has not time at his disposal to deal with the problem.  Certainly the money he is asking for this year is not going to lead him anywhere.  He is just going to end where all the rest ended&mdash;he is going to end in failure.  I say that the division of the Gaeltacht and fishery services was a primary blunder on the part of the Government.  I would ask the Minister at the earliest date that he can, with dignity to himself, to get rid of this responsibility and hand it to somebody else.  Let it go back where <Col N="348" /> it was originally, and let us have a Department for dealing exclusively with fisheries and the Gaeltacht.  Assuming we are going to have the Department as at present, what line is the Minister going to take?</P>
    <P>Last year when the Vote was introduced by the Parliamentary Secretary, he had a complaint to make about difficulties in regard to fuel.  His trouble then was, if I remember correctly, that we had not a supply of native fuel but luckily he said a new discovery had been made and we were using crude oil for trawlers.  In the statement read out last night by the Minister there was practically not a word about the trawlers.  There was not a word about the trawling organisation or what happened the trawlers. Was it that they departed from the use of home fuel and began to use crude oil and that the smoke which issued from them was so black that they landed in some black sea, so black that they were not able to get back?  What has happened to the trawlers?  What is their record for the past year?  There is not a word about them in the statement read out by the Minister and the inference that I drew from that was that the trawlers had been lost because the Minister went on to state that smaller boats are going to be completed for a sort of semi-inshore fishing. Apparently, the new fleet is not going to be allowed to go abroad.  They are not going to be allowed into the Black Sea, so black that the trawlers could not get back.  Surely, the first thing the Minister should have told us was what happened the trawlers.  What of these powers of propulsion with the new fuel that was apparently so effective according to the Parliamentary Secretary last year?</P>
    <P>Deputy Kissane has told the House from the depths of his wisdom that the policy of this Government with regard to fisheries is the reverse of that pursued by the Cumann na nGaedheal Government.  They have certainly reversed the progress of the previous Government.  The Fianna Fáil Government are going to adopt inshore fishing. Everybody who knows anything about fisheries, knows that our inshore fishing is as much developed as it ever will be <Col N="349" /> and that for all practical purposes all the fishing our fishermen do is inshore fishing.  If this country is ever going to have a constant supply of fish, it will not be because of all this prating about self-sufficiency.  We are at present importing 50 per cent. of our fish supplies.  Yesterday somebody asked was not this an island surrounded by water.  I understood that islands are usually surrounded by water.  This is an island surrounded by water and what kind of water is it?</P>

      <P>The Atlantic Ocean, which is supposed to be teeming with fish.  Yet we import 50 per cent. of our fish supplies.  That is a nice commentary on the efforts of this Department&mdash;getting crude oil for a fleet of trawlers, sending them to sea and saying not a word of what happened them or of how successful they were or how much fish they caught.  Deputy Corry told us last night that it is always the same old tale with regard to this Department and that we are importing and exporting the same amount of fish. Are we to take it that these trawlers were supplied with crude oil and got lost in the convex world?  I should like to know from the Minister if he intends to confine developments to inshore fishing.  If that is his policy, there is no doubt that we shall never supply the total requirements of our people.</P>
      <P>When I saw that this Department was being passed on to the Minister I was curious to know why that was being done.  When I saw the Order made about the slaughtering of the calves I was wondering was he going to have handed on to him an order for the slaughter of fish, and I said to myself that if it is going to be done it will be a good thing, because if the fish are slaughtered, whether it is to be done by trawlers or by small inshore boats, it is a sound proposal. Now, as I said, the trawling and inshore fishing are developed as much as possible.  Take, for example, Downings, Lough Swilly, Burtonport, and the whole West coast of Ireland&mdash; night after night and day after day the men are out fishing and trying to get what they can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="350" /> There has been a lot of complaint about the trawlers and about protection for fishing.  Undoubtedly, this question of protection is a major issue. When the Fianna Fáil Party were on these benches, and when I was not in this House, I used to be interested and amused reading their speeches.  A lot of their speeches were very amusing&mdash; the jokes about the &ldquo;Muirchu&rdquo; and so on.  About a fortnight or three weeks ago I was down in Donegal and I was told that the &ldquo;Muirchu&rdquo; was in Killybegs harbour.  By a curious coincidence, Deputy Lynch, in his speech last night, mentioned certain proceedings of the Moville Board of Conservators and that while the meeting was going on there were trawlers close in to the shore around the coast of Inishowen at the time.  While the meeting was being held the &ldquo;Muirchu&rdquo; was in at the south of the county while the board of conservators were meeting at the north of the county. It reminded me of a &ldquo;Life of Napoleon&rdquo; that I once read, where it described the time when Napoleon was in Egypt and the French fleet was destroyed.  Napoleon had no way of getting home, and everybody thought that he was a prisoner and could not get back.  Nelson was in the Mediterranean with the British fleet at the time.  Napoleon succeeded in making his way home and afterwards there were cartoons in the comic papers of the time showing Nelson on the deck of a warship in the Mediterranean flirting with Lady Hamilton while Napoleon in a small boat was getting around the coast and home to France. I was reminded of that story when I heard the description of the depredations of the trawlers around the coast up there while the &ldquo;Muirchu&rdquo; was in harbour.  Probably the officers were flirting with the maidens of Killybegs.</P>

      <P>The whole thing would sound humorous if it were not that it is a serious matter, but the way it is being dealt with makes it humorous, and even the most unhumorous person would have to regard it as funny.  This House should take this thing in hand.  Let the Government do something, and I am <Col N="351" /> sure that, so far as every Deputy in this House is concerned, the Government will have their whole-hearted assistance in any scheme they propose or their assistance in propounding a scheme.  If it is going to be dealt with properly, let the Minister this year ask for a sum of money commensurate with the requirements of this matter and let the Government, with the assistance of everybody in the House, launch that scheme as a great national scheme, and then there will be some chance of success.  A Deputy spoke of aeroplanes.  What is the use of talking about aeroplanes out on the West Coast of Ireland on a wild and stormy January night during the spring fishing, when the winds are blowing across the Atlantic at 60 or 70 miles an hour?  An aeroplane could not live for five minutes.  Deputy Kissane says that he is going to have armed launches.  I thought the Deputy came from Kerry.  An armed launch would last about half an hour in a boiling, raging sea off the Donegal coast on a winter night.  If she went out any distance she would never get back.  If we are to have protection, it must be protection by gunboats or something of that kind that can go out to sea in any kind of weather and can stay there in any weather.  They must have a speed also, equal to or in excess of that of any of the trawlers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That disposes of the future of the Department as such, the question of trawling, and the question of protection.  Then there is the question of the inland fisheries.  There has been a falling off in the receipts, but the Minister has given us a reason for that with regard to the extended grants to the Limerick and Erne Fishery Boards and the withdrawal of reservations of the right to fish in certain cases.  I should say that inland fisheries, generally, are enormously improved. All our rivers, so far as I know, are immensely improved.  The fishing in many of the inland rivers this year is better than it ever has been.  So far as protection is concerned, the bailiffs and Guards are doing excellent work, and are also doing splendid work in conjunction with the customs men at the export points.  The customs men are <Col N="352" /> very efficient in the matter of stopping any consignments of fish going out of the country either by sea or overland through Northern Ireland.  I think it would be very unfair and very unjust of this House not to pay a tribute to the wonderful work done by the Civic Guards in that respect.  They are out all night, often having to battle with poachers, getting wet and in danger of injury.  I have known of some of them being permanently injured and, owing to some technical flaw, not getting any compensation.  Accordingly, I think it would be very unfair of this House not to pay an adequate tribute to the services they are rendering for the protection of our inland fisheries.  The Minister cannot do anything this year, but if he is going to keep this invalid baby in his arms he should try to do something this year to keep it alive, and if not he should shake the ashes off his feet as soon as he can.</P>

      <P>I am particularly interested in the proposal to erect a purification tank for mussels in Dublin Bay.  It is quite true that the market for mussels has been closed owing to the fact that medical officers on the other side have declared their suspicion that germs are coming in in the mussels, and consequently the market was closed.  Although we have a narrow coastline in County Meath, we have an industry which is capable of expansion, an industry which, in past years, gave an amount of employment to a large number of people.  I am quite aware of the fact that the Government allocated £5,000 in last year's Estimate for the erection of a purification tank in Dublin Bay.  It was a demonstration of their will to do something for the mussel fisheries, but a great delay has ensued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister stated, in his opening speech, that he found difficulties in his way in having the tank erected.  He mentioned the fact that a 30 per cent. duty has been placed upon the mussels entering on the other side.  I would suggest to him, however, that he should provide, as he has in the case of the lobster fishing, a bounty on the export of mussels.  I believe these fishermen would be as much entitled to a bounty as the people who are sending their cattle across to Britain. <Col N="353" /> The rumour has gone abroad&mdash;the Minister has not made the statement&mdash; that the market on the other side has been somewhat restricted of late.  I am told by the fishermen in Mornington who, I believe, know all about mussel fishing and the mussel market that that market is not restricted, that they had numerous inquiries last year which they were unable to supply and that there is a likelihood of the same thing happening this year.  I believe that the Sea Fisheries Association, who are responsible for pushing forward the erection of the tank, are rather dilatory in the methods they employ.  If the Sea Fisheries Association do not proceed speedily in carrying out the work, I suggest that the Minister should take it out of their hands altogether.  Deputy Lynch, the ex-Minister for Fisheries, stated last evening that his Government were prepared to give a certain amount of money to the Sea Fisheries Association to carry out their work.  The Sea Fisheries Association was established in 1930.  In 1932, when Fianna Fáil came into power, they found that nothing had been done for the mussel fishing.  There was no tank erected, although the call was there for a considerable time.  At that time there were no tariffs on mussels entering the English market.  The Deputy cannot pat himself on the back and say that he, or his Ministry, at that time, did anything for the mussel fisheries.  I believe that his methods deserved the condemnation which they received at our hands.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that if he considers that the overhead charge of the central tank in Dublin Bay would be too great, he should allow the fishermen of Mornington to erect a smaller tank.  The proposal was made a few years ago by the fishermen there that they should be allowed to erect, at a cost of £700 or £800, a miniature tank on the lines of the tank at Conway, in North Wales.  If the Minister thinks that the market is not sufficiently big to justify the larger proposal, perhaps he would consider the possibility of erecting a smaller tank, which would ensure that the fishermen of Mornington and <Col N="354" /> Baltray, on the County Louth side, would be able to supply the market which they believe is in existence. They are dependent on grants in the winter time.  Last year, and the year before, we had grants devoted to the enlarging of the mussel beds, so that this year, and in future years, the fishing grounds will be larger than they were and the fishing industry will be capable of greater expansion. Last year, a shelter was put up for the fishing boats and for those things the fishermen are very grateful to the Ministry.  At the same time, they do not look merely for the provision of relief grants.  They believe that, if a relief grant be given, it should be devoted to the erection of a purification tank.  Three or four hundred people in Mornington engage in fishing and earn their livelihood by mussel fishing.  When the summer season is finished, they enter upon mussel fishing&mdash;in October of each year&mdash;and carry on during the winter months.  I think that the Minister expressed the hope that this tank would be erected during the year.  I urge him, in the interest of these men and their families, to speed up the initial work in connection with the erection of the tank. These men are looking forward to the day when they will be able to resume the export of mussels to the English market.  In connection with inland fisheries, I urge upon the Minister the necessity for withdrawing the licence or permission to have nets in fresh water.  On the River Boyne, there are a couple of nets which catch all the fish which pass through the tidal waters.  The anglers in the upper reaches who have paid licence fees each year are, as a result, unable to catch any salmon.</P>

      <P>Everything that could usefully be said on this Vote has already been said.  Therefore, I do not propose to occupy the time of the House for longer than five or six minutes.  Deputy Murphy said, in the course of his remarks, that there was a very striking similarity between the speeches delivered on this Estimate this afternoon and the speeches delivered a year ago, two years ago, <Col N="355" /> or even ten years ago.  This industry appears to me to be the cinderella of Irish industries.  I do not pretend to have much knowledge of sea fisheries, but I do claim to have some knowledge of the inland fisheries.  I have spent a great deal of my spare time in both deep sea and inland fishing.  One thing which struck me very frequently in connection with these debates, and in connection with the position as we know it, is that if fish are to be found in abundance around our coasts and if it is profitable and a good economic proposition for foreign trawlers to come in and reap the harvest of our seas, why is it that it could not be made a paying proposition for our people in similar circumstances, assuming that they are similarly equipped? We claim, and claim with truth, that our fishermen are as daring and as brave as any of their class anywhere. Complaint has been made that they are not sufficiently equipped.  If this is found to be a good business proposition for other people, how is it a sufficient number of Irish nationals, with enterprise, will not act up to their protestations and invest in an industry of this character or subsidise it to some extent without calling on the State? It is appalling, not to say humiliating, to find that, in the case of nearly every industry, people are calling for subsidies, subsidies, and still more subsidies. The question of bounties has been raised again.  My experience of bounties&mdash;it is, of course, quite recent &mdash;is that they are most provocative to the traders, who have to wait to get the bounties back from the Government Department.  If the Government are going to add one further method of provocation to the people, I would suggest to them that they should add another bounty.  I do not want to be taken now as saying anything that would militate against our deep sea fishermen, but I feel it is time whether the speakers come from Fianna Fáil or from Fine Gael that they should drop this begging of bounties, and still more bounties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of loans was referred to by Deputy Murphy and other Deputies. They suggested that these loans were <Col N="356" /> given at a time when the fishermen, and the fishing industry generally, were at the peak point of prosperity&mdash;that is to say, during the war period and for some time after.  They have put forward a suggestion that the people who went security for the loans granted should be relieved of any further responsibility.  That, in my opinion, is highly immoral unless you are going to make the whole thing retrospective and make a refund to those who have met their obligations.  It would be unfair, I think, to give an advantage now to certain persons who went security for boats and other things during that period.  Personally I deprecate that attitude very much.  I would much prefer to see these people standing on their own feet and not have the hope held out to every person who is wailing about industry that we are going to give bounties, because, in the long run, it is the ordinary people who will have to pay those bounties.</P>
    <P>A good deal has been said about the shortage of fish in this island, where one might assume we would have a plentiful supply of fresh fish all the year round.  Those engaged in the industry, whether they are the people who finance it and are the chief distributors, the ordinary fishermen, will tell you that unless you have one great pool in the Irish Free State, or, alternatively, unless you contribute to some bigger pool across the Channel, you will never have a constant supply of fish in this country, and when I say that I mean a supply for the 365 days in every year.  Apart from those who earn their livelihood by catching fish&mdash; indeed they make a very precarious livelihood from it&mdash;anybody who knows anything about the habits of fish must know that it is not by any means certain that you will always meet fish, in the way, say, that you meet cattle, and that all you have to do is simply to throw out your nets and haul them in.  Anyone who follows fish, whether at sea or inland, must know that their habits are frequently very uncertain, although of course there are certain well-established signs by which you can make a fairly useful estimate.  My opinion is that without having a great pool in this country, where all your <Col N="357" /> fish could be pooled and then distributed, there is not any use in subsidising the industry.  We were told yesterday that the Minister's heart had softened and that he was going to give a bounty on lobsters.  That, to an extent, would help a number of people around the coast, but it does not spell &ldquo;fisheries.&rdquo;  It is only one branch of the whole industry.</P>
    <P>I do not want to repeat the requests that I have made here on previous occasions.  In some measure these requests have been met by the ex-Minister for Fisheries and also, to an extent, by one or other of the Ministers who followed him in office.  Having regard to certain evidence given quite recently before the Commission that has been set up to inquire into the inland fisheries, the Department may get some useful hints as a result of the Commission's investigations and I suggest to the Minister that his Department should act on any suggestions made as far as it can be usefully done. I would urge on the Minister the great importance that all authorities attach to State hatcheries.  I do know that the Department has done something in that way.  It has acted very liberally towards anglers' associations and such bodies, especially in giving them yearling trout.  I would urge on the Department that there should be closer contact between the various anglers' associations&mdash;it need not be official contact&mdash;but contact in the sense that they would know what is going on in the various areas, and the extent to which the stocking of the rivers is a success or otherwise.  Again, every angler who has ever fished for salmon or trout, particularly for trout, must know that many rivers in Ireland which were reputed to hold, and did hold a good deal of fish, have of late years fallen away very much.  Because of that I am afraid that unless we have re-stocking, much of the great name which many of our inland rivers had for trout-fishing will disappear.</P>
    <P>Last evening the ex-Minister for Fisheries, Deputy Fionán Lynch, made a suggestion to the effect that there should be a reduction in the amount paid for salmon licences in the case of trout anglers who would like to take <Col N="358" /> out a licence for the killing of salmon trout.  I am not going to go into the various forms of salmon life.  I will refer simply to what is known as <i>salmo trutta</i>, generally referred to as salmon trout.  I would urge on the Minister that he should agree to act on the suggestion made by Deputy Fionán Lynch.  Many trout anglers who fish for ordinary brown trout may, in the course of their fishing, hook a salmon trout.  The salmon trout will take the same fly as the brown trout, and the person who has not a salmon licence, if he happens to hook a salmon trout, will either have to throw it back into the river or run the risk of being prosecuted and heavily fined if he is caught with it.  Deputy Lynch suggested that a licence at a charge of £1 should be made available so that men fishing for brown trout, who accidentally catch a salmon trout, may be saved from the risk of prosecution by having that £1 licence.  As Deputies are aware, a salmon licence is £2, so that all that is in question here is the sum of £1.</P>
    <P>I am against the principle altogether of charging any licence to brown trout anglers.  I think it is a bad principle. I agree with Deputy Fionán Lynch that it would be better to have the £1 licence than none at all.  Speaking as one who always takes out his licence, I feel that you have numbers of working class people who cannot afford a £1 licence. They will not fish for salmon, but quite accidentally they will sometimes kill a salmon trout and, once in a way, they may have the opportunity of killing them in tidal waters.  I think that the Minister would be doing an acceptable thing if he removed from the Act the section which renders a person liable to prosecution and fine if he is caught in the possession of a salmon trout without having a salmon licence.  In making that appeal to the Minister, I am not thinking of myself or of others like me who can afford the £1 licence, but rather of the thousands and thousands of anglers, working class people, who go out Sunday after Sunday to enjoy a day's fishing but who, if caught with a salmon trout in their possession, will be prosecuted and fined.  These are the only points that I want to urge <Col N="359" /> on the Minister.  My last appeal to him is to see if anything can be done by way of further re-stocking our rivers with yearling trout.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>The last speaker referred to the question of a pool for fish.  In actual practice, the operations of the Sea Fisheries Association work out that way.  They do pool the catches of fish and distribute them in accordance with the demand.  When the Deputy cavils at bounties, he should realise that there is no question of a bounty for deep-sea fishing whatever.  Two speakers on the opposite side made play with the fact that Ministerial responsibility had been changed three times since Fianna Fáil came into office.  I do not think there is any point in that because, when they were here and had Governmental responsibility, they decided that they would not hold direct responsibility themselves for the question of fishery development.  They delegated their authority to an association known as the Sea Fisheries Association, and that body has the immediate and effective control of the development of sea fisheries.  It does not make a whole lot of difference in actual practice what particular titular head is attached to the Fisheries Department, at all events so far as sea fisheries are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the operations of the Sea Fisheries Association, Deputy McMenamin, a while ago, wanted to know where the trawlers had gone, and he asked if they had gone to the Black Sea and been swallowed up.  If he had examined the question, he could quite easily have found out what happened to them.  When the Party to which he is attached were the Government Party, they gave sanction to the Association for the undertaking of a rather large and costly trawler experiment to develop the catching of fish in Irish waters.  A number of trawlers, which were idle across the Channel, were brought over at a rather high figure. The two principal employees came with the boats and, after several years' operation, it was discovered that these boats had resulted in a net loss of <Col N="360" /> between £40,000 and £50,000.  The Fianna Fáil Government came in and they put a stop to it very quickly. That is what happened to the trawlers. Our Government was not satisfied to spend huge sums of money on foreign chartered trawlers from which the Irish fishing community were not getting any direct benefit.  With regard to the supply of our own fish, it will be interesting to a number of people to learn that for an expenditure of over £50,000 on that experiment, there was a gross take of fish worth about £14,000, which was reduced, after expenses were deducted, to £9,000.  That is what happened to the trawlers, if Deputy McMenamin is interested in hearing it, and I think the Government was quite wise and quite right in putting an end to it.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also said that there is not any fishing industry here and he pointed out that the Irishman eats only 2 lbs. of fish as compared with 32 lbs. eaten by an Englishman.  Almost in the same breath, he asked the Government to appoint a special Minister to look after the fishing industry.  The thing is not consistent.  As I say, the refusal to carry on with these trawlers has been, to my mind, responsible for the reduction in the amount of money allocated for fishery development in this country and that reduction can be justified. The present sea fisheries organisation with the machinery which has been set up to deal with it, has made representations to the Government and submitted its estimate and it did not require the large sum of money for its operations that was formerly required when it had these very costly trawlers. Criticism of that kind is entirely ill-informed. Home development, to my mind, has not been at all impeded by the sending home of those foreign trawlers.  On the contrary, the Sea Fisheries Association have now decided to put out four trawlers commanded by Irishmen and under their own direct control.  The boats are their own property and it is an attempt to develop the idea of the short trip by oil fuel trawlers.  The men who will man these trawlers will be whole-time fishermen, and that is, to my mind, what we <Col N="361" /> should try to develop in this country &mdash;the whole-time fisherman.</P>
    <P>There is also another responsibility which might be placed on these trawlers.  I do not say that these short-trip trawlers are the ideal way of dealing with the question of the supplying of our own fish requirements and I do not believe it can be done in that way.  Eventually, I think we shall have to get into the deep sea trawling end of it, but it is much better to get along to that by having a connecting link between the inshore men and the deep sea trawlers.  These short-trip trawlers will form that very necessary and useful link.  The deep sea trawlers, and, very possibly, the short trip trawlers, also, can by degrees take on some of the responsibility for coast protection and they can be a very great help in combating the poaching foreign trawler and, for that reason, I should like to see many more of these short-trip trawlers put to sea.  At least every boat that is now lying idle in our harbours and which is capable of being fitted out at a reasonable cost should be put to sea.  I have advocated that myself time and time again.  We can get plenty of men who are prepared to become whole-time fishermen and these crews would be the nucleus of a very efficient coast protection service as well as a fishery protection service.</P>
    <P>I would strongly recommend to the Minister the desirability of providing cold storage facilities, particularly in places like the Aran Islands where quick transit is not available.  It has often come to my notice that consignments of fish taken by men who are affiliated to the Sea Fisheries Association have found that their consignments were tainted on reaching Dublin or Galway, with the result that the prices which these fishermen would otherwise have got were considerably reduced.  If quick transit cannot be made available&mdash;and I admit the difficulty of providing quick transit at a place like Aran&mdash;the alternative, to my mind, is cold storage, so that fish can be kept in good condition until the regular sailing of the steamer takes place.  There are other places around the coast where cold storage facilities are essential to the <Col N="362" /> development of the fresh fish business. There are many places from which fish is consigned which is not in very good saleable condition particularly in warm weather.  I know it is costly but I would draw the Minister's attention to it.  It was suggested that the Sea Fisheries Association was not popular with fishermen around the coast and I think that is true.  It is not very popular.  That is my experience of it.  I do not know why.  From my experience of the way prospective members react to the suggestion of becoming members I think that the amount of revenue which the association gets in the way of membership fees is hardly worth the trouble.  As soon as a member pays his initial 5/- to become a member he expects to be provided with facilities including £300 worth of a motor boat.  Of course it is provided for in the Act under which the Fisheries Association has been established, and I suppose it cannot very well be dispensed with even by the Minister.  At all events it is possible that the Minister may need to have an amending Act dealing with fisheries in general, and I would recommend to him that the rules of the association should then be overhauled. That applies particularly to the provision of curraghs for lobstermen and scallop fishermen.  Very often a curragh may have been destroyed or broken just before the lobster season commences.  The owner becomes a member of the association but it takes a good deal of time before his case is listed.  Possibly the season is over and the next season has come round before his case can be attended to.  I think for small cases of that kind there should be some more speedy machinery, with regard to the lobster and scallop men particularly.  On the question of scallops and shell-fish generally, I wish to draw the very serious attention of the Minister to the fact that there seems to be what I regard as an unnecessary delay in the paying of the bounty.  The scallop fishery, in parts of County Galway at all events, is a very lucrative one.  A great deal of money has been made on it.  They have been complaining that <Col N="363" /> there is great delay in the payment of the bounties, and I wish to call the Minister's attention to that question.  I do not think there is anything else I wish to say on the matter.</P>
    <P>I think that on this question of the development of the fisheries I agree with most of what Deputy O'Neill has said, except one thing, and that is the question of mackerel fishing.  I think it would be most unwise to undertake large expenditure on the development of mackerel fishing.  I certainly agree with the Sea Fisheries Association in their policy in that regard&mdash;that is, to try to get the fishermen on to the white fish.  It would be very easy to get them on to mackerel and herring fishing, if that fishing offered any prospect of reasonable remuneration.  It is much more difficult to get them on to the other fishing.  At all events, there is this difference, that you have no market in Ireland for mackerel and a very limited market for herrings; we are not supplying our requirements in white fish.  There again, the Government is up against the question that they are being urged to spend money on the development of fisheries, even on the white fish.  The total import of white fish last year was only £200,000, and, of course, it will be readily understood that you could spend £200,000 very foolishly on fishery development. As I have pointed out, £50,000 have already been spent on it, so that the Government, while the position is not satisfactory, must at the same time be cautious and take all the circumstances into account.  I myself believe, from all the speeches I have heard, that there has been a great deal of loose thinking on the subject.  I am all out for deep sea fishing, because with the development of the country the requirements of fish will be greater. I suppose we will develop a better taste for fish as time goes on.  I may add that in regard to deep sea fishing it should, to my way of thinking, be subsidised with money that would otherwise be spent on coast protection, and on the tackling of the poaching trawler.  Our own trawlers could be very usefully employed in that way when not engaged in fishing.  At all <Col N="364" /> events, they could be used as an intelligence service for whatever patrol boats we might have.  I strongly recommend that suggestion to the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SydneyBMinch" hpid="Mr. Minch Mr. Minch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Minch</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise on behalf of the humble consumer.  During this discussion to day we heard about Lord Nelson, Lady Hamilton, dynamite, gun-boats, high explosives, sardines and sprats, but the main subject that I should imagine would appeal to the House, as far as the fishing industry is concerned, is the consumers' point of view, and the putting of fish into our inland towns so that the ordinary people would have better opportunities and better facilities than they have to-day for obtaining fresh fish at a reasonable price.  It is notorious in our inland towns that during the Lenten season and on days of abstinence the vast majority of people are unable to obtain fish.  I have heard Deputy Bartley state that the herring market here is a very limited one, and that it is not one that should be concentrated on.  I agree about mackerel, but not about the herrings.  I can appreciate that the herring arrives at mysterious times, and departs unexpectedly; that it is quite impossible to follow the shoal or to know when its harvest can be garnered; that sometimes when it does arrive the equipment and boats and fishermen are not enough to cope with it, but somehow or other I think that we ought to give deep consideration to the distribution of fish in our inland towns. I see advertisements in the paper about the Fishery Association, giving particular attention to such things as hake, etc., but we have no advertisements about deliveries, or any attempt to get the ordinary people interested in the system of deliveries.  In the main, the poor people in the country towns are anxious to obtain fresh herrings.  I have seen private lorries coming across from the East coast when the herring arrives there.  They go through Tullow, up through Carlow, and into Athy, through the local villages. They are eagerly sought for by the people and every single arrival of fish has been disposed of.  If we intend to develop the fishing industry <Col N="365" /> with any kind of an internal policy, from the point of view of assisting the fishermen on the coast to obtain a market the Irish people would want to receive a course of education in order to get them on to fish-eating on a much larger scale than at present.  It is true that the majority of types of fish are either out of the range of the ordinary man's pocket or else he has not cultivated any taste for fish.</P>
      <P>Dublin is a notoriously bad place in which to obtain fish on Mondays. Whether it is because there is not a proper means of storing fish I do not know, but if you go to an hotel on a Monday and order some fish, you will always get fish which has been kept in ice and which is not altogether fresh. Of course, that is a matter for the purveyors and the dealers.  As it was mentioned by Deputy Bartley that fish had arrived from the Aran Islands tainted I can quite understand that it is a matter for the Sea Fisheries Association to see if they can help the fishermen when the fish are caught to store them properly so that they can arrive without being tainted.  Nothing is more dangerous to public health than tainted fish.  The point made by Deputy Bartley should open the eyes of those of us who do not live on the sea coast to the dangers associated with the fishing industry unless there is a proper means of storing the fish and getting it to the market in a fresh condition.  I know of one institution in this country which gave an order to the Sea Fisheries Association for the delivery of certain classes of fish against Grimsby prices and the Association were not able to deliver them. They sent some other variety of fish because, I suppose, they could not guarantee to supply what was required in the necessary quantity.  That is a matter which should be gone into and, if possible, put right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This whole debate seems to have centred around the futility of the protection provided both for our deep sea and inshore fisheries.  We have had suggestions about the use of aeroplanes and wireless.  One would almost think that we were having a discussion here on munitions of war.  It has been brought home to those of us who know <Col N="366" /> very little about deep-sea fishing that there is something lacking in the protection provided and that the inroads made on our fishing grounds are of such a nature that our own fishermen are being robbed practically of any opportunity of earning a livelihood.  I have seen, when passing along parts of the coast at night time, substantial looking boats with lights out practically up against the coast, and these boats disappear before morning.</P>
    <P>My view is that the only way of dealing with these people is to purchase a couple of obsolete destroyers, if not from Great Britain, then from some other country.  There are plenty of these vessels for sale now.  We should put ex-naval men on them and let it be seen once and for all that this poaching must stop.  If necessary, we should fire across these boats and make them heave to.  If you are going to do this thing at all, do it properly, otherwise you are simply wasting time trying to stop it by the methods adopted up to the present or by debates here.  If they are using force, and if they disregard the law and the slight protection at present afforded, let them see that this poaching will not be allowed to go on.  I do not know what the international law about this matter is.  There may be all sorts of reactions and difficulties and strained relations.  I have, however, read a good deal about the Icelandic position.  Up there there is no nonsense tolerated. If any invasion of territorial rights takes place along the Baltic coast or anywhere else up there they do not hesitate to take the most drastic action and to fire, if necessary, if the flag of the country concerned is ignored.  We hear a lot here about the Irish flag and what it stands for; when, however, the flag is ignored by these poachers, we hear fine speeches, but we have very little action.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanGoulding" hpid="Mr. Goulding Mr. Goulding">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Goulding</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not have intervened at the tail-end of this debate but for the statement made by Deputy Bartley.  It is very disquieting to learn that the Sea Fisheries Association has, in such a short time, lost something between £30,000 and £50,000.  If we establish an association to foster Irish <Col N="367" /> fisheries, and if, instead of fostering Irish fisheries, the association has spent between £30,000 and £50,000 in subsidising foreign trawlers, it looks a strange way of fostering Irish fisheries. I hope I understood Deputy Bartley rightly when he said that the services of these trawlers have been dispensed with and that in future Irish boats manned by Irishmen will be used. Opposition speakers taunt us with our attitude when in opposition.  We are not ashamed of the attitude we adopted when in opposition.  We criticised the Department of Fisheries then, and we are prepared to criticise it now.  Our criticism when in opposition was of a constructive nature.  We made the very suggestions then that I have heard from the opposite side throughout this debate.  The suggestions made by Deputy Minch were made by us five or six years ago.  One lives and learns, I suppose.  Many of the suggestions that were made at that time for the protection of our sea fisheries and for the prevention of poaching by foreign trawlers we found were ineffective.</P>
      <P>The suggestion made by Deputy Bartley that the new boats which are being used by the Sea Fisheries Association could be employed for the purpose of protection is rather a good one, but these boats should be specially equipped for that service.  The suggestion of Deputy Minch that it would be advisable to fire shots through some of these trawlers sometimes should be taken very cautiously.  Very serious international complications might arise if one of our boats was to put a shot through any foreign trawler.  Perhaps, however, if some international complication did arise it might have a good effect.  As a result of some trouble we had off the Wexford coast some time ago, French gunboats had to come across to prevent French pirates from poaching off that coast.  Perhaps if some drastic action were taken against the pirates of other nations their gunboats might come across to see that their nationals did not insist on poaching in our waters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This question of protection has been discussed here for the past ten years, I suppose.  The same suggestions have <Col N="368" /> come across from the opposite side of the House as from this side of the House.  Nothing practical has been done.  We all, for the past few years, made fun of the &ldquo;Muirchu&rdquo;; she is still perambulating around the coast and trying to do her best.  Other suggestions have been made now, and I would ask that the Department should take them seriously.  I would urge that the &ldquo;Muirchu&rdquo; be scrapped or else that she should be given some assistance by putting two or three other boats of the same class around the coast with her.  Then there would be some chance of giving the fisheries protection. It is no good to depend on the one boat to cover the whole coast.</P>
    <P>In regard to the loss of this money by the Sea Fisheries Association, I would say that the matter is very serious.  It would be well that the House should know what loss is now being sustained by the Sea Fisheries Association.  I take it that since the foreign trawlers were dispensed with the loss is not so great.  Is the State getting in other ways compensation out of this loss?  That is the question for the Department to consider.</P>
    <P>I notice that Deputy Minch says that fish cannot be obtained in the inland towns of the country.  I understood that the main object of the Sea Fisheries Association was to secure that fish would be procurable and on sale around the inland towns; that arrangements would be made for a regular consignment of fish to be sent to them.  Apparently that was not done.  I know that it is almost impossible to get a regular supply of fish in the inland towns around the country. It is possible, of course, that you will have a catch of fish at one port one day, but that would not be continuous. You may have a catch, for instance, in Kinsale one day and nothing the following days; then you may have a catch another day in Arklow or some other port.  I think if it were possible to do what Deputy Minch has suggested, to set up cold storage somewhere where the fish could be piled up, it would be, perhaps, a more effective way of dealing with the matter.</P>
    <P>I should like to see a development in this country of deep sea fisheries. <Col N="369" /> It is a matter of business.  If there is sufficient demand for fish in the country some business person, one would imagine, would come along and supply the fish.  But apparently there is not. If an English or Dutch firm trading to our ports were to-morrow to go into this business of supplying the fish for the inland towns, it could be done. Apparently it does not pay them to do it.  Deep sea trawling is a very big business.  It is a thing that requires very large capital.  Some of the firms engaged in the business have tremendous capital behind them.  They have a large fleet of trawlers, and in many cases they have their own shops. It is only on lines like those that the business could be developed.  A sum of £50,000 has been paid for a trawler by one of these firms.</P>
    <P>The criticism of the Department on this Vote, in the main, has been good, but it is not one bit different from the criticism made during the past ten years.  I hope, however, that some effort will be made now to meet the points raised.  As to the matter of the inland fisheries, I am glad to say that the position is good.  Our rivers are full of fish.  They are being well preserved. I made the suggestion here years ago that an effort should be made to prevent the spawning fish getting too far up in these rivers. Possibly it could be arranged that the spawning fish would be kept from going too far towards the upper reaches. In that case there would be a better chance for the spawning fish.  I am afraid there is still a good deal of damage being done by poachers in the upper reaches of the rivers.  It is impossible for the Gárda or the river bailiffs to stop it entirely.</P>
    <P>If the hatcheries were more fully developed it would compensate for the loss in the natural spawning.  From the tourist point of view trout fisheries could be made very interesting and profitable, and these ought to be properly developed.  With reference to the point made about the salmontrout, I must say that I would not like to ask a man who is fishing for salmontrout to get a special licence.  The man who accidentally catches a salmontrout&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Every angler knows that there is a fly called the white trout fly, but a man catching a white trout, unless he is found to be using white trout tackle, should not be expected to have a special licence.  It would be unfair to ask a man fishing for white trout to pay a licence if, by accident, he should happen to catch a brown trout.  Quite a number of people are interested in this fishing.  It would be rather going too far to expect that a man should throw back the trout into the water if, by accident, he caught a trout which he was not licensed to catch.  I would be against penalising a man for an accidental catch like that.</P>

      <P>The Minister has heard so much about fish for the last two days that I think he will dread the advent of Friday, and in the remarks I have to make I do not propose to pile on the agony.  I will only deal with two concrete instances as regards the River Slaney, in the Country Wexford, portion of the country with which the Minister is well acquainted.  I would add my quota to what has been already said about white trout fishing.  I would suggest a special licence of 5/- for white trout fishing.  There are a number of white trout fishermen in Country Wexford.  This is not the same sort of industry as in the West of Ireland. There are ordinary fishermen there who fished for white trout in the past and, to a certain extent, the catching of a white trout was ignored by the powers that be.  I suggest that if a small licence fee of 5/- were imposed, it would cover the matter.  A large number of fishermen fish in the Slaney and in the tributaries flowing thereto.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like the Minister to look into the question of ante-dating the net fishing season in the Slaney.  The fishing season commences there on the 1st April.  If it were ante-dated a fortnight or even a month it would cause no hardship, and it would be a great boon to these people.  It would not do any hardship to the rod fishermen, nor would it be impossible from any point of view, climatic or piscatorial.  It would be perfectly possible <Col N="371" /> and would result in having a large body of men, a couple of hundred with their families, benefited.  I would ask the Minister to agree to that suggestion.</P>
    <P>I think I heard Deputy McMenamin echoing a suggestion made by another Deputy, Deputy Kissane, with reference to armed launches for the protection of the coast at night, and Deputy McMenamin asked what protection would armed launches give.  He pointed out that in a howling gale at 70 or 80 miles an hour a motor launch could not give any protection.  I think a howling gale of 70 or 80 miles an hour would be ample protection itself. I merely throw out that suggestion for what it is worth.  As regards the foreign trawlers around the coast, the menace is as bad in Wexford as anywhere else, even though we are not quite as voluble as are our kinsfolk on the South and West.  I hope we will get the protection we ask for.</P>
    <P>I would press the question of ante-dating the season for starting the fishing by a fortnight or a month.  That could be done by an insertion in the coming legislation.  A large number of fishermen in the Slaney and its tributaries would be facilitated.  I also suggest that these men would be helped by allowing them to fish for white trout on the production of a 5/- licence.  As the subject is a very slippery one, I do not intend to continue.</P>

      <P>There has been such a variety of questions raised on this Vote that perhaps the best way I can deal with the matter is to reply to the points raised by various speakers.  Deputy Fionán Lynch referred to the very big reduction in the grants-in-aid which we gave to the Sea Fisheries Association for general development.  He said they got £53,000 in 1932-33, and that amount had been reduced to £20,000 in 1933-34 and to £15,000 in 1934-35.  That reduction must not altogether be interpreted as Deputy Lynch interpreted it.  He put it as if the present Government were inclined to neglect the development of the fisheries.  As a matter of fact, the Estimate which was prepared by Deputy Lynch for 1932-33, when he was <Col N="372" /> Minister, was £20,000, but the losses on those trawlers were so enormous that a Supplementary Estimate had to be brought in for an extra £33,000.  Even Deputy Lynch, when he was Minister, did not contemplate a larger expenditure than £20,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanGoulding" hpid="Mr. Goulding Mr. Goulding">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Goulding</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it a fact that they lost £33,000 in one year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether you would call it a loss or not, but at any rate they spent £53,000.  An important point is that these trawlers were foreign trawlers; they were chartered and they were not employing all Irishmen.  In fact, a minority of those employed were Irishmen, and we were really relieving unemployment in another country at a very big cost to ourselves.  I think the Sea Fisheries Association were quite right in dropping this experiment with foreign trawlers, and turning to some other method of developing the fisheries. The next point Deputy Lynch raised was that we had not done anything to develop the fisheries as we promised during the 1933 election.  He quoted a speech of the President in Skibbereen showing that we had made certain promises.  I think a very big advance was made last year in the marketing of the in-shore fish.</P>
      <P>I believe the Sea Fisheries Association is going on the right lines now. They went altogether wrong in the beginning.  They went out on a very big scheme, chartering foreign trawlers before they had the organisation prepared to run the trawlers or to deal with the sale of fish.  They are now building up in-shore fisheries.  They organised a certain number of the in-shore fishermen during 1933, and the fisheries which were regulated by the association realised £12,000 on sales. Their losses during the first year&mdash;and naturally there would be a loss during the first year of organisation, where there would be initial expense&mdash;was only £1,258, which is very creditable when compared with the first year's loss on the foreign trawler experiment. This in-shore marketing has been taken up in 12 centres, notably in Dingle and other places, at very little cost to the taxpayer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="373" /> Deputy Lynch raised another question with regard to boat-yards and boat repairing.  He drew attention to the fact that it had appeared in the Estimates for many years, but now it did not appear.  That service has been taken over by the Sea Fisheries Association and is run as a commercial undertaking.  It was taken over voluntarily by them without any pressure from the Fisheries Department. They were very anxious to take over the boat-yard and boat building and they intend to make it pay without subsidy.  Deputy Lynch asked for a report of the operations of the Sea Fisheries Association.  Of course, the chairman reports each year, just the same as the chairman of any company. That report is sent out to all members, just as in the case of a company.  It is submitted at the annual meeting and the chairman has to answer the usual questions that a company chairman has to answer. Press representatives are present, and any information that is necessary can be got.  We are not bound, so far as I know, to lay that report on the Table of the House.  It is not secret and the report can be got quite easily from any member.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>But, after all, there is public money voted from this House in support of the Sea Fisheries Association, and does the Minister not think it would be only right that a document of that kind should be put at the disposal of Deputies in the Library and not let them chance what might appear in the papers?  The papers do not have space to give a full report and there might be matters that Deputies would want information about that might be omitted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what my legal powers are in the matter.  I suggest that the Deputy would know something more about that than I do, as he was Minister at the time of the inauguration of the association.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will look up that matter. The association, in pursuance of a policy outlined by my predecessor, <Col N="374" /> Deputy O'Grady, are converting four drifters into oil-driven short-drift trawlers, and they are also chartering a vessel from an Irish owner.  They hope to train men in the business of trawling on these short trips.  If things go well they may be able to go further afield and take over bigger trawlers and go after certain classes of fish that we cannot get in our own waters.  In the short-drift trawlers young men are learning the business and we are hoping to have only Irishmen employed.  The vans are still working in places such as Athlone, Tralee and Thurles.  As a result of the pioneer work in Tralee, a retail shop has been started, and is doing quite well.  I think it can be truly said that in some of the districts, particularly Athlone and Thurles, the consumption of fish is on the increase.  There again it is rather a costly thing on the association in some cases to get these vans going.  In some places there were losses in trying to induce people to eat fish. It is not so easy for the association to stand heavy losses in this way.  They may gradually be able to get fish introduced into most of the towns as time goes on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to protection, Deputy Lynch was very apprehensive lest something might occur under the regulations we have issued.  The Deputy was also rather inclined to attack us for not protecting the fisheries.  He cannot argue both ways.  He must give us a chance to put these regulations into effect, to use the powers we have, and if we instruct the commander of our protective boat to fire over a poaching vessel, and if that warning is not sufficient and he is defied, then he is instructed to fire into the boat.  That may be necessary.  Deputy Minch will agree, I think, that if a foreign trawler ignores a shot fired over her, and tries to get away, and does not take any notice of the &ldquo;Muirchu,&rdquo; then the only thing for the &ldquo;Muirchu&rdquo; is to fire into her.  The reason these regulations were issued was in order that trawlers, fishing on the coast, after they had got fair warning, and had chosen to ignore that warning, might expect to have a shot fired into them. They would have a fair warning that the &ldquo;Muirchu&rdquo; was about to fire into <Col N="375" /> them.  I remember, in 1915, talking to a man in the City of Waterford, and he said: &ldquo;These Volunteers will be going on until they shoot somebody.&rdquo;  If the &ldquo;Muirchu&rdquo; goes on, she may go on, till she shoots into somebody.  If these trawlers are given fair warning and take no notice of it, then she will have to fire into them.  I do not believe there is any great danger in having what the Deputy referred to as an inexperienced officer.  That officer has been acting as first officer for a long time, and while he was obeying orders, in a certain sense, he was also commanding men to obey.  The first officer himself takes command sometime or another, and I think we may rely sufficiently upon his ability to act quite properly.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lynch also raised the question of granting special licences for sea-trout fishing.  The matter was raised by other speakers as well.  I am not in a position to give any view upon it just now.  I am glad to say that, because I know that certain evidence has been placed before the Inland Fisheries Commission upon this question, and I hope they will give a ruling.  They will be in a position to weigh the evidence.  Evidence has been given before them in favour of Deputy Lynch's suggestion; I do not know whether they got any evidence against it, but they will make a report, and as their report will be followed by legislation, that matter can then be dealt with.  Another question that will be covered in the same way was the question raised by Deputy Kehoe about extending the season on the Slaney. Possibly there would be some demand from other Deputies on that point if it had struck them.  This question would also be investigated by the Inland Fisheries Commission, and I hope they will report upon the proper time for opening and closing the season.</P>
    <P>Another point, raised by Deputy J. P. Kelly, was the question of allowing net-men in fresh water.  That too will be reported on by the Inland Fisheries Commission.  Deputy Lynch said that we should have two or three protection boats as the &ldquo;Muirchu&rdquo; was not sufficient. A good many Deputies expressed the opinion that the <Col N="376" />&ldquo;Muirchu&rdquo; herself was of no use. Others said that if we had two or three boats of the same type it would be all right.  I agree with the latter views.  I say the &ldquo;Muirchu&rdquo; is all right but, of course, it is absolutely impossible for her to be at Donegal and Cork at the same time.  I expressed the opinion, when introducing the Sea Fisheries Protection Bill, that if any person, such as a Civic Guard or other authorised person, took the number, or the mark, of a trawler inside the territorial waters that boat could be arrested even six months later by the &ldquo;Muirchu&rdquo; when she came round, and that would obviate the need of having a protection boat within call on every occasion.  If the number of a trawler was taken, and passed on, then when the &ldquo;Muirchu&rdquo; came up with that trawler she could arrest her for the offence that was committed some months previously.  I expressed the opinion that we should give that a trial when the Act came into force and as the Act is only coming into force now that suggestion should be given a trial.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that is a fair question to ask in case of the possibility of a war or anything like that. Deputy Lynch also said that he often had complaints from boards of conservators to the effect that the Minister for Fisheries was very much inclined to reduce penalties, but that these complaints had not been coming for some time.  I do not think I have, in any way, altered the practice of those who preceded me.  As Deputy Lynch knows, the Minister for Justice has power to remit, or partly remit, fines.  The Minister for Justice has never, so far as I know, exercised that prerogative except after consultation with the Minister for Fisheries, and the Minister for Fisheries never acts on his own at all: he acts on a report from the District Justice or the Civic Guards, or <Col N="377" /> both.  Very often the District Justice says he had to inflict a certain fine under the law but that he thought it unnecessarily severe.  In such cases, the Civic Guards agree, perhaps they will say the particular man is not in the habit of poaching and will agree with the District Justice that the fine is severe.  It is my practice in that case to act on the District Justice's recommendation.  On the other hand, in a case where there is a conflict between the District Justice and the Civic Guards, I often agree with the Civic Guards because they know the history of the person and whether he is an inveterate poacher; the District Justice may be lenient where he does not know all the circumstances.  But of course the District Justice has to inflict the fine under the law and that is why he is inclined, very often, to recommend a revision of the fine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>There used to be a third source of information, namely the Board of Conservators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The Board of Conservators do report but they almost invariably stand out for the fine inflicted though I do not invariably hold with them.  Deputy Corry talked about seaplanes for the protection of our fisheries and suggested that the Department should wake up and look into this matter.  I can assure the Deputy we were awake to this matter before he ever thought of it.  That matter was considered long ago.  It is certainly not an ideal way to protect fisheries.  Something might be said for it by way of scouting, but it is certainly not an ideal remedy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Corry said our imports and exports remained at the same figure. It is rather peculiar that we should be exporting and, at the same time, importing fish.  The fact of course is that our fishermen catch an excess of certain fish and less than we require in other cases.  Our fishermen do not catch sufficient plaice or sole and we have to import.  On the other hand, they catch more than we require of salmon and lobster, herring, and mackerel.  That explains why we export and at the same time import fish.  They are different varieties of <Col N="378" /> fish.  The fact that the imports and the exports are equal in value is of course accidental.</P>
    <P>Several Deputies mentioned that sufficient slips and piers were not provided. When any case is put up to the Fishery Department that proves to be a deserving one, where the provision of such accommodation would improve fishing, it has been done.  Many of these things should really be done by county councils.  These bodies should take the initiative.  I suggest to Deputy Corry that we have no responsibility for Cork County Council. There are many places where the county councils, concerned with relief grants, might be able to deal with these matters.  Where it is a case to be dealt with by the Department it will be considered.  I think Deputy O'Neill was wrong when he said Spanish trawlers came near our coast.  They go in for &ldquo;pair&rdquo; fishing more or less on the high seas.  I inquired into the matter on a previous occasion when it was reported that Spanish trawlers were coming close to the coast and I was told that they only came in for provisions and did not fish near the coast.  The Deputy may be right in saying that, in some cases, they come in, but generally these trawlers do not fish near the coast.  The difference between a sardine and a sprat has not been decided.  I do not know if the inland fisheries people will decide it or not. Deputy O'Neill also spoke of salt mackerel going to America.  I think the tariff the Americans put on has nothing to do with the question.  American consumers have changed their taste, as has happened in many countries.  They have changed from salt fish to fillet which they can get as easily as we can get it.  They can get mackerel much cheaper than we can give it.  They get it from Canada and, as far as I know, Canada has to pay the same tax as we have to pay, but we are not able to get it in at the same price.  I do not think that an export bounty would be of much use to try to capture the American market for mackerel.  Deputy O'Neill also referred to the question of providing larger boats for fishermen. It might be a mistake to advocate indiscriminately the provision of larger <Col N="379" /> boats for fishermen, because some fishermen have applied for leniency in the collection of old loans which were issued to secure larger boats.  That proves that the fishermen could not make the large boats pay.  If they could they would have made some attempt to repay these loans.</P>
    <P>The Deputy spoke of herring fishing. Just like mackerel fishing, herring fishing has been carried on at a loss generally for the past few years.  The Scottish company operating off our coast had, I believe, rather heavy losses last year.  Of course that is a proprietary company and is in no way financed by the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SydneyBMinch" hpid="Mr. Minch Mr. Minch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Minch</NameTxt>
      <P>Was it due to a bad harvest or bad prices?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it was due to bad prices.  I would not like to have to agree with one point made by Deputy Burke.  Many Deputies expressed the same opinion, that the man who goes out to spear a salmon by illegal methods is not harming the remaining fish, and should not be regarded as having committed an offence.  I think we will have to say that that is wrong, is illegal, and will have to be dealt with.  No doubt it does not do the same harm as the person referred to by Deputy Kissane, who goes out with dynamite and blows up a river.  It is a different matter.  Deputy Kissane spoke of the deposits that have to be made for boats supplied by the Sea Fisheries Association being too high. I have inquired about that.  We are giving to the Sea Fisheries Association the best terms that any country has given to fishermen in the way of deposits. Deputies will agree that when lending money for any purpose some deposit is necessary to show earnestness and good faith on the part of the borrower.  It is quite true that a person with a deposit may not know as much about fishing as a person who had not the money to make a deposit. The same argument could be used about two men going to buy a farm. One man might be able to put down one-third of the money, and to get the rest from the bank, while the man who might be the better farmer might <Col N="380" /> not be in that position.  It is a general rule that where loans are given by the Government a deposit is necessary. In these cases the deposit is more favourable than that required in any other country.  We can hardly be expected to make the position easier. Deputy Kissane said that the rivers were not properly protected.  I have not heard any complaint of that kind for some time.  As a matter of fact, most Deputies stated that our rivers have been vastly improved during the last eight or ten years.  One Deputy said that this was the best year he remembered for river fishing, as regards the supply of fish.  I think Deputy Kissane cannot be altogether correct.  The majority must be right, that our rivers are being well protected and that fishing has improved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Murphy made a very good start when he stated that there was plenty of destructive criticism but very little constructive criticism.  I suppose that is a fault in all debates, that it is very difficult to get constructive criticism but very easy to get destructive criticism.  The Deputy asked what proposals we had for developing our fisheries.  That was a reasonable but a rather difficult question to answer.  We want to protect our fisheries for our own fishermen.  We provided the fishermen with protection when we put a gun on board the &ldquo;Muirchu.&rdquo;  We will have to get a few more boats, if the &ldquo;Muirchu&rdquo; is not sufficient for that purpose.  That is, as far as protection goes.  In the next place, we must enable our fishermen to catch fish.  The Sea Fisheries Association is there to develop the fisheries, to provide boats and gear, and to do marketing as far as that is possible.  It is there to create and develop markets in inland towns by means of vans and retail shops, and by increasing the potential consumption of fish, as far as possible.  That is being attended to.  The third point was attended to, to a certain extent, in this year's Budget, by protecting the market for our own fishermen.  One of the things that interfered perhaps very much with our fishermen was the sale of imported fillets.  We have put a rather high tariff on fillets.  It is doubtful <Col N="381" /> if they will come in any more with that tariff, so that our fresh fish will get a more ready sale here in future.</P>
    <P>We have to ensure&mdash;which is a more difficult thing&mdash;a regular supply of the fish required.  We are not doing that at present.  At the present time we are not ensuring a supply of the fish that is necessary or the fish the people want.  What we really should do if we can do it, is to give the people the fish they want rather than compel them to change over to the fish we want them to take.  I have already said that there is a big demand for plaice and sole, which we are not supplying.  We shall have to go further out in the high seas to get those fish, but we shall not be in a position to do that for some time.  We shall have first to develop our inshore fisheries.  In the meantime we have to import whatever is required in the way of plaice and sole &mdash;to import them as whole fresh fish rather than as fillets.</P>
    <P>Deputy Murphy further said that he thought the Sea Fisheries Association is not very popular with the fishermen. There may be a certain prejudice against an organisation like that. There generally is against any sort of organisation, but the membership of the association is increasing, and where you have an increasing membership it is a sign that on the whole the association is maintaining its reputation and its popularity.  Deputy McMenamin did not contribute very much except to say that men of vision and courage, meaning, I presume, the British Government and British officials, put the Gaeltacht and fisheries together and that we had now come along and divorced them.  The rest of the Deputy's speech was, more or less, what I would call insincere nonsense. It was both nonsensical and insincere. Deputy Kelly spoke of a cleansing tank for mussels, but he must remember that that is one of the most difficult questions we have to deal with technically. There is no use in having this tank unless it is going to be constructed in such a way as to be effective. It appears, from what I can learn, that that is a difficult task. <Col N="382" /> There is not, I believe, any unnecessary delay in dealing with this matter. The whole difficulty is to construct a tank that will meet with the requirements of the different public health authorities.  As soon as we can get going on the matter there will be no time lost, I can assure the Deputy.</P>

      <P>Deputy Anthony put a rather sensible question.  He asked if it pays the French and the Spaniards to trawl along the Irish coasts why should it not pay an Irish company to engage in the same business?  Evidently the French and the Spaniards are making it a paying proposition.  I suppose, in the first place, we have not men of sufficient enterprise here to go into competition with them.  I should like to say to the Deputy that it would be no great use to this country if they did, because they could not compete very well, I believe, against those people, in the sort of business they are carrying on, unless they were to go to the British markets.  I do not know if there is any continental market that would require this fish.  They would probably go to the British market, and in order to compete against these other trawlers, they would have to go to a British port for coal.  They would call into these ports with their fish and to get coal.  If most of the crew were married men, the only chance they would have to get off to see their families would be when they reached the other side, so that they would have to bring their families over there, and really they would be of no use to this country at all.  That type of fishing is not much use to us.  If we can develop our inshore fishing, there is one big advantage in oil engines as against the coal or steam engines.  The boats will not have to go to the port of another country to get fuel.  They can get oil as cheaply here as they would on the other side.</P>

Is that recommendation of the commission, now sitting on the question of inland fisheries, going to supersede the present machinery for dealing with the question of opening seasons earlier or later?  You have the present machinery, under which a public inquiry is held in any given case with regard to any given river.  Both sides are heard at <Col N="384" /> that inquiry, a report is made to the Minister, and the Minister makes his decision on that report.  Surely that machinery, which is extremely efficient for the purpose, is not going to be superseded by some roving temporary Commission.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  It has been found that the spread of infectious avian disease is a serious hindrance to the maintenance and development of the poultry industry and that it is desirable that power should be obtained to control the importation of poultry, the separation of affected poultry, and notification of disease in poultry.  It is intended to safeguard healthy flocks and to eliminate disease as far as practicable. The Diseases of Animals Acts, 1894 to 1914, will be amended to provide that the powers exercisable under these Acts in relation to animal disease may be applied to avian disease in so far as may be considered necessary.  The Diseases of Animals Act, 1894, will have effect as if the word &ldquo;animals&rdquo; included poultry for the purpose of preventing the spreading of poultry diseases.  The Minister may make orders applying to poultry such of the provisions of the Diseases of Animals Act, 1894 to 1914, as he may consider necessary, declaring any avian disease to be a disease of poultry for the purposes of the Act, requiring the separation of poultry affected with disease from poultry not so affected, and also the notification of disease in poultry, for regulating or prohibiting the importation of poultry, or eggs intended for hatching, or the use of imported eggs for hatching.  Day old chicks will be regarded as poultry.  Power will be taken to charge a fee for the work incidental <Col N="385" /> to the importation of poultry.</P>
      <P>Our experience in the Department&mdash; and, I may say, my experience personally, and I am sure it has been the experience of many Deputies here&mdash;is that whole stocks have been wiped out through certain poultry diseases. Recently&mdash;within the last few years in particular&mdash;they have been exterminated through a disease known as bacillary white diarrhoea in chickens. We intend to give facilities for blood testing to any person who is anxious for pure stock.  For that purpose a veterinary surgeon, who will be a specialist in such things, will be appointed by the Department as a full-time official.  So far as egg-laying and so on is concerned, we have a very good stock on record in this country.  If that stock were free from disease, there is very little doubt that we would not be very long until we would be able to hold a very high place in the world as breeders of pedigree birds, and be able to get some of the advantageous prices that are going at present to Great Britain and America principally.  Apart from the great economic advantage at home of saving our fowls from these diseases and preventing losses in that way, we would have the second economic advantage of getting those big prices, because we would then be able to guarantee them as absolutely free from disease.  I think that the Bill is very simple, and that it is, as a matter of fact, merely a question of classing poultry as animals for the purposes of the Act.  The Bill, as I say, is very simple, and I think it requires very little explanation from me.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SydneyBMinch" hpid="Mr. Minch Mr. Minch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Minch</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister whether or not he is sure that this disease, which is threatening the poultry industry so much in this country, is due to the stock, or whether there is any possibility of that disease having any connection with certain patent poultry meals or foods that are being sold in this country. Has any inquiry been made into that? I do not know whether it is correct or not, but experience has shown us&mdash;and when I say &ldquo;us&rdquo; I mean some of us who were in this business&mdash;that some of the poultry meals and other foods <Col N="386" /> on the market had a definitely bad effect on the poultry themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister mentioned facilities that are to be given for blood testing.  Will these tests be given free?  Does it mean that all a person has to do is to send a specimen of blood to the inspector and that he will send it to a pathological expert to have it tested?  We know, of course, that such a thing as disease exists in poultry as in animals, but in very many cases the explanation as to the origin of such diseases is obscure and hard to place.  I remember that, some three or four years ago, there was a terrible outbreak of a disease among dogs.  Everybody was trying to find out what was the cause of it.  Ultimately, a lot of people arrived at the conclusion that it was due to a certain dog biscuit that was very well known on the market.  I should say that this conclusion was unfounded and that the particular dog biscuit had nothing to do with the origin of the disease.  I should say that there was some other explanation.  However, in connection with what Deputy Minch said, I should like to know from the Minister whether or not any connection at all has been established between any of these artificial feeding-stuffs and this disease in poultry.  I read of a case some months ago where one of the greatest poultry breeders in England, who had some hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of pedigree poultry, had his entire poultry farm wiped out through the disease.  This man took certain drastic action.  Apparently, this disease remains in the ground over which the chickens have been travelling. This man closed down the entire place and began afresh on new ground.  He succeeded and was able to make good again.  If the veterinary inspectors could corroborate a statement of that kind, I think it would be wise for the Department to adopt the suggestion that, where a pedigree flock of birds were all seriously affected by the disease and a large number lost, peremptory orders should be issued that that particular ground should be closed down entirely for a very considerable period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="387" /> The Minister says that the main purpose of this Bill is to class poultry as animals.  I suggest that it has a larger purpose than that.  With regard to this question of proposed facilities for blood testing, I suggest that the Minister should provide the services for pathological examination of the blood free.  I think that any breeder should be at liberty to send the blood to Ballsbridge to get it tested at the expense of the State.  It would be difficult and rather expensive on a person with a small flock of birds to take samples of blood and send them away to a veterinary pathologist.  I suggest that he should not have to do so at his own expense.  I think the State should supply that service free, and I believe that money spent by the State in that way would be well spent.  Since we are classing poultry as animals for this purpose, I think it would be very wise to attend to that matter when we are passing this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not heard that this disease is carried by certain foods, as Deputy Minch has stated.  As a matter of fact, as far as I know&mdash;and I have come across some cases where the explanation of the origin of the disease was obscure&mdash;there was always a cause found on examination, either in the egg from which the poultry was produced or in the poultry themselves.  In other words, it was always found that the disease came from infected stock where the disease appeared for the first time on a poultry farm.  I do not think that it was ever suspected to be due to feeding stuffs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SydneyBMinch" hpid="Mr. Minch Mr. Minch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Minch</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The disease is very infectious and, as Deputy McMenamin says, the ground would become infected.  Not alone the ground, but the different fittings, such as boxes, cages, incubators, feeding troughs, and so on, would also become infected.  They would have to be disinfected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that the <Col N="388" /> Minister should make an order that, in the case of infection, all the boxes, traps, incubators, and so on, should be destroyed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, of course, as the Deputy knows, certain incubators are very expensive, and they are made in such a way that they can be disinfected very effectively.  If our inspector is satisfied that an incubator has been properly disinfected, he will not ask, naturally, for its destruction.  I think that the Deputy can rest assured that our officer will take every measure to see that the disinfecting process is made effective without creating any unnecessary loss or expenditure on the owner.</P>
      <P>With regard to the question of a fee, I quite agree with Deputy McMenamin that poultry owners would not be inclined to pay any big fee.  However, I think that a small fee might be useful in order to prevent people from using the free services too liberally, as they would use them, of course, if they were entirely free.  Some small fee only will be prescribed.  We have not yet decided what the fee will be, but we shall have to decide that before long. It will be prescribed by regulation.  I think that Deputies will agree that where you give free service like that, it is sometimes abused.  A small fee is useful in such a case.  The fee will not be exorbitant.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>Why should a small fee be useful?  In all these cases where tests take place, such as water tests and blood tests where dispensary doctors are not sure whether typhoid or diphtheria germs may be present, the service is free.  These pedigree flocks will be limited.  It is a specialised job, and I do not think it would be worth while to charge a fee of any kind.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a good deal of discussion on the matter to which this amendment relates.  It refers particularly to the area of Ringsend.  I proposed in the Bill, as read a First and Second Time, that Ringsend should be in South Dublin.  Great pressure was exercised by the Opposition&mdash;the view was voiced particularly by Deputy Costello&mdash;that Ringsend should not be left in that area.  Ringsend, as we all understand it, is not now in Dublin County.  It is part of Greater Dublin, and was actually added to Dublin City by the Local Government (Dublin) Act, 1930. It was part of Pembroke Urban District, and it has now no connection with the administrative County of Dublin.  At the moment it is in the County Dublin constituency.  The line which encloses the portion of Ringsend to be added to South Dublin City constituency, as the Bill stands, is, as Deputy Costello described it, quite <Col N="390" /> arbitrary.  But it is a well-defined line, and the reason for adding this portion to South City is that the total population of the wards in the city south of the Liffey is 144,497.  This would give an average of 20,642 per member.  Rathmines and Pembroke, which form Dublin City South, or Dublin townships, as proposed in amendment No. 3, would have three for 73,367, or an average of 24,456.  The portion taken off Pembroke is estimated, according to the 1926 Census, to have a population of 6,700 and, in transferring that portion, I endeavoured to adjust the population so as to keep the averages as nearly the same as possible.  I recognise some merits in the case to keep Ringsend in its present location in Pembroke area and, as in neither case would the average be below 20,000 per member, it will not do any great violence to the Constitution if the averages are 20,642 and 24,456 instead of 21,599 and 22,222.  This will give Dublin townships the highest average, but that is not such a grievance in the case of Dublin as it might be in the case of a more distant constituency.  I think that the proposition meets the case put up by Deputy Costello.</P>

There was practically an even division.  The Ceann Comhairle, so as to leave the matter still open to discussion, gave his casting vote in a certain direction. The House having expressed the opinion that Donegal should not be undivided, it would not be in order to move the amendment moved in Committee. I have considered the question of the division of Donegal and I cannot suggest any better division than the one I suggested originally in the Bill.

My first objection <Col N="393" /> to this proposal arises from my natural antipathy to any form, taste or smell of partition.  There is no county in the Free State or in Ireland that has been so much tortured by partition as Donegal.  My principal objection to this proposal is that nothing stinks in the nostrils of my people so much as any mention of partition of any kind.  Whatever the country is suffering generally as a result of partition Donegal in particular is suffering very much.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Deputy would allow me to make the matter clear?  There was a proposal on the Committee Stage that a paragraph of the First Schedule be deleted in order to make way for an amendment which proposed that Donegal be left as one county constituency.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle voted for the deletion of the words in order that that amendment might be moved, stating that the House would have a further opportunity of deciding on the matter. The amendment was put that the county be left as one constituency. That amendment was defeated on an open vote, and no similar amendment can now be moved.  The House is now getting a further opportunity of considering the division into East and West Donegal.</P>

      <P>I just want to review what I stated on the last occasion when, on behalf of my constituents, I registered a protest against the division of the county.  I might be disposed to support this in my own self-interest, but it is not in my own self-interest that I am here but in the interests of my constituents.  I am in entire agreement with my constituents in their hostility to the partition of my county in any shape or form.  With regard to the proposed division itself, as I pointed out on the last occasion, it is proposed to divide what is known as the Gaeltacht area: to put a minor portion of that area into an area that is pronouncedly different from it.  No two areas could differ so much as the two areas involved in the County Donegal. A small portion of the Gaeltacht area will be taken now and put into an area that has no cultural associations whatever with it.  In other words, a small area of the Gaeltacht is being taken away and put into North-East Donegal.  It is being put into an area which is commonly known to us, and I suppose to many others here, as a planted area.  I think that is a correct description of it.  That small area is being taken and thrown in there.  The result will be that no Deputy in that area will have any particular interest in it.  He will feel that he will not have any substantial mass of public opinion behind him to agitate for any reform that he wants for this minor portion of the Gaeltacht.  It was said on the last occasion by Deputy Brady that the question of convenience made this a practical proposal, and he gave that as a reason why it should be adopted.  I had spoken before Deputy Brady.  Had I spoken after him I would have put a question to him.  He said that he lived in the south end of the county and that it was very difficult to get to the north. I would like to put him this question. If a person had two appointments, one at Moville, in the north of the county, and the other at Gortahork, a northwest point in the new divided constituency, which would be the easier to get to?  Surely it would be much easier to get to Moville from Killybegs than it would be to Gortahork.  Important issues, both cultural and economic, <Col N="396" /> arise in the County Donegal, and this proposal cuts right across them.  This proposal will cut off one section of Donegal entirely and completely from the other.  It will give us a planted county and a non-planted county.  It will give us a planted area which, in the main, has no affinity at all with the other part of the county.  For that reason, in addition to the strong objection I have to any form of partition, I oppose the amendment.</P>

      <P>Has the Minister got the map before him?  Let him look at East Donegal and let him draw a line from the Tyrone corner to Barnesmore Gap right along the mountain road into Dunfanaghy.  He will see that it cuts off the Gaeltacht areas of the north and north-east&mdash;the entire planted area.  You have there the old landmarks of the planted and non-planted county.  You have the county of the Gael and the county of the non-Gael, if I might put it that way.  I do not mean to be offensive in saying that. I merely wish to draw a distinction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe the Deputy intends to be offensive to anybody, but I do not think he can say that East Donegal is an entirely planted area.  There are a great many good Gaels in that area whom I know, and in West Donegal there are people many of whom would not be described as Gaels.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there are. As I say, I do not know the county as <Col N="397" /> well as the Deputy, but from my knowledge of it I do know that there is a good sprinkling of Gaels&mdash;people who are known as Gaelic people&mdash;in all parts of the county.  In one end of it, the east, what the Deputy describes as the planted area, it is stronger than in the west, but taking the county as a whole, I think the population is fairly well mixed.  In the west it is more Gaelic.  Certainly, whatever Gaeltacht there is, and there is a considerable area in County Donegal, it is in the western area, but that does not say that the population is not fairly well mixed all over the county, in the west as well as in the east.  For parliamentary purposes, I cannot see where, with any propriety, the word &ldquo;partition&rdquo; can be used, or where one can stress the mere separation or division of counties.  There is a division for parliamentary purposes, but that does not make it any more difficult for a person to go from Barnesmore Gap to Moville or to Gortahork, as the Deputy said.  The mere fact that there is a parliamentary division will not make transport from one end to another any more difficult.  I proposed this amendment in accordance with the general principle of the smaller constituencies rather than the larger, and I believe it will also be for the greater convenience of the people in Donegal as a whole.  I believe it will have better results from the parliamentary point of view, and better results from the point of view of local convenience.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The point that is rather puzzling in connection with this is that when the House voted equally on the Minister's proposal, it was fairly obvious that a stronger case should be made for the Minister's proposal than was then before the House. Such matters as constituency arrangements ought not to be the subject of political weight in this House.  If it be desired to have them, future parliaments can take note of that and can alter these arrangements and so on. The only suggestion the Minister has to make in support of this proposal is the smaller constituency.  Seven is too large.  That is a very poor argument. It is not much of a compliment to the <Col N="398" /> House which voted in equal numbers on this particular proposal.  It is almost the invariable rule, if one wishes to interpret the feelings of the House and to get the support of the House for a measure of this kind, which should be decided on grounds other than Party grounds, that due consideration be given to the expression of the view of the House.  That was not possible when the Ministerial weight is thrown in against the single constituency as happened in this particular case.  This is a large county at present and it has been so far 12 years and people are accustomed to the fact that it has been so.  It is broken up now and is, and must be, an inconvenience except in the case of a highly regimented Party or Parties, as the case may be.  If the case is as presented by Deputy McMenamin, and he ought to know the district better than the Minister, there is every reason in the world why it should remain a seven-member constituency.  The Minister says he has been there, but does not know as much about it as Deputy McMenamin.  If he does not take the Deputy's presentation of the case, then it is a matter that ought to be considered, but the Deputy who speaks on behalf of Donegal and who, I presume, opposed this particular allocation of seats&mdash;four for East Donegal and three for West Donegal&mdash; must, I feel sure, be in possession of more expert information about it than is likely to be in the Local Government Department.</P>

      <P>I should like to know how often the Department send up an inspector to find out what particular divisions there are in the county?  It is not their business and if they are doing it, they are neglecting something else.  The political divisions in any county are no affairs of theirs.  What they have to do is to administer them and to see that the laws are carried out.  If we are standing for the principle of proportional representation, as it is understood, in the large constituency there is an opportunity for <Col N="399" /> free expression of opinion in that connection. If what Deputy McMenamin says is correct, there may possibly be 4,000 or more of the people in whom he is interested in one constituency who will not be able to pull their weight and almost an equal number in the other.  Normally, they would be able to get a seat, but, with this division, they would probably be disfranchised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I see that the difficulty about this position at the moment is the contradictory vote which was previously given by the House.  It voted against the proposed division of Donegal and subsequently voted against Donegal remaining a single constituency.  Now, the position is that there is only one proposal before the House, that one being the proposal advanced by the Minister and the House finds itself in the position of being between the devil and the deep. The only spokesman for Donegal, and the only spokesman who gives every indication of a thoroughly intimate knowledge of Donegal politically, economically and geographically, has clearly expressed his opposition, or, rather, the opposition of the people he represents, to the present proposed subdivision, not only on those grounds but on historical grounds and supported by arguments of dissimilarity of tradition, religion, outlook, and sentiment of the people.  The Minister's case against Deputy McMenamin is the principle that he is opposed to the large constituency and that that principle weds him for all time and in all places to the smaller constituency.  I might remind the Minister that, during the Committee Stage of this Bill, when that particular principle of small constituencies as opposed to large constituencies was submitted to a free vote of this House, in the case of Limerick and in the case of Tipperary, on both occasions, the free vote of the House was for the larger constituency. That point was conceded, I may say, in a broad-minded spirit to a non-Party vote.  It was conceded in the case of Limerick; it was conceded in the case of Tipperary.  There was a <Col N="400" /> mix-up in the case of Donegal; there was a contradictory vote.  Now the people of Donegal are presented with a pig in a poke, an accomplished fact; it is that or nothing.  If this particular proposal is out-voted here to-day, I suppose Donegal will be back as it was&mdash;non-existent.  That is not a fair position to put the House in.  The circumstances are exceptional.  The particular events that happened on the Committee Stage were contradictory. In the two votes that were taken with regard to Donegal all the people voting did not, perhaps, quite understand. However, it is not fair, in face of the votes previously taken regarding Donegal, and in view of the verdict in connection with Limerick and Tipperary, to face the House with what amounts to an accomplished fact, and say it is that or nothing.  I think some further consideration should be given to the arguments advanced by Deputy McMenamin, and that some appreciation should be expressed for his thorough understanding of the Donegal position and of the Donegal people.  I would particularly urge on the Minister, in view of the absence of any opposite opinion expressed by any representative of Donegal, that further consideration &mdash; sympathetic and generous consideration&mdash;should be given to the case advanced by Deputy McMenamin.</P>

We ought to be consistent in something.  I cannot see any logic or sense in pressing the case of Donegal to a division when two <Col N="401" /> smaller constituencies were left as they were.  I, in common with some of the other Deputies, would urge the Minister that this, a similar constituency, should also be left as it is.

      <P>The first is in connection with the anomalies that arise. Let me put this before the Minister.  I was born in a townland that is Gaelic. The entire townland is Gaelic.  The next townland is non-Gaelic.  If this division is carried I can snap my fingers at the Gaeltacht in Donegal.  I am out. I may as well sit for Belfast as far as that is concerned.  Take the other case. Take the problems that arise there.

      <P>Take another problem which arises.  There are 4,000 or 5,000 of Deputy Myles' constituents, Protestants of South Donegal, going to be disfranchised.  Is that right?  Are they not citizens?  Are they not taxpayers?  Are they not entitled to representation in this House?  That is another of the special problems which arise.  You have those 4,000 or 5,000 electors&mdash;making perhaps somewhere about 8,000 or 9,000 people altogether&mdash;disfranchised if this division is not carried.  That is not fair to those people.  There you have myself de-Gaelicised if you like.  You have 4,000 or 5,000 electors in South Donegal without any representation.  Then you must remember the united effort we had here, all Deputies in Donegal, irrespective of what Party they belong to, acting together on behalf of Donegal, owing to the special problems that arise there.  If I were working for selfish ends I would vote for that division.</P>

Deputy Dillon unquestionably did oppose the division, as Deputy McMenamin did on the last occasion, but the other two took the other side equally strongly. The House gave an indeterminate decision on the small constituencies, and, therefore, the House, having left it indeterminate, I think I am entitled to stick to my views on the matter.  There is another point which I might make. On the last day, at the end of the Committee Stage, I was asked to give an extended time for consideration of further amendments to be put in on the Report Stage.  This was a matter that had raised considerable interest, not alone on the part of the members representing County Donegal, but on the part of other members as well. Despite the fact that Deputy McMenamin is so interested&mdash;as I am sure he is, for very good and proper reasons&mdash; he put in no amendment on the Report Stage.</P>

      <P>I gave not only a fortnight but a month for reconsideration. Several times I was asked to bring forward the Bill for the Report Stage, but I said that there was no great urgency about the measure; that there were a lot of interests to be consulted by people who were taking an interest in the matter and that other amendments might come in.  No amendment, however, came from Donegal.</P>

      <P>As regards amendments Nos. 9 and 10, amendment No. 10 deals with a specific point, that is, that Youghal area be retained in South East Cork.  Amendment No. 10 embodies three points, Youghal area, the number of Deputies for the constituency of South-East Cork, and the transfer of certain electoral divisions from West to South-East Cork.  Amendment No. 10 will be taken first.  The decision on that will govern part one of amendment No. 9; part two of amendment No. 9 is out of order as it advocates a principle which was not adumbrated in any way on Committee, to wit&mdash;the transference of certain electoral divisions from West to South-East Cork&mdash; and the third portion does not arise.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 10:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 8, First Schedule, Part II, in the references to the constituency of Waterford to delete in the second column all words after the word &ldquo;Waterford&rdquo; where it secondly occurs; and in page 9, First Schedule, Part II, in the reference to the South-East Constituency to insert in the second column the District Electoral Divisions of &ldquo;Ardagh, Clonpriest, Kilcronat, Killeagh (Youghal), Kilmacdonagh, Youghal Rural and the Urban District of Youghal.&rdquo;&mdash;(Deputy Broderick).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Broderick Mr. Broderick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broderick</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I move this amendment I would like to explain that I submitted earlier another amendment which had for its object the making of East-Cork a four-member constituency.  In doing so it was necessary to take a portion from North Cork.  I realise now that that would be completely out of order. Lest it may be taken that that amendment meant in any way to deprive Waterford of its four members, I would like to give this explanation, because I believe Waterford is entitled to be a four-member constituency and I am going to make no attempt to lessen its representation.  I move the amendment in my name to exclude Youghal Urban and Rural from the Waterford constituency.  In doing so I have in mind the principles laid down by the Minister, on the introduction of the Bill, for his guidance <Col N="409" /> as to the future.  He said that, as far as he could, he would retain county boundaries, historical associations and unified national and administrative activities.  I submit, in the case of Youghal, it completely conflicts with all the principles laid down by the Minister.</P>
      <P>Before taking up the argument in favour of the amendment, I wish to deny some of the statements made here, first, that there was any attempt by the people of County Waterford, no matter whom they represent, to grab a portion of a Cork constituency, or that there was any traditional hostility between the people of Cork and the people of Waterford.  Many of our public men in Youghal, some of our most appreciated and respected citizens, themselves or their immediate parents, originated in that county. The best possible relations exist, as they should always exist, between the peoples of those neighbouring counties. You have had submitted to you resolutions from the Youghal Urban Council and the Cork County Council in opposition to the Minister's proposal in this Bill.  Both these bodies are opposed to it.  Particularly let me mention that the man who presided on the night the Youghal resolution was passed is a supporter of the Minister, and no man could speak more strongly against the Minister's proposal. The Cork County Council, likewise, took up the same attitude.  They, too, want continued the associations that always existed between Youghal and the people of the neighbouring counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are not opposed to going into Waterford through any feeling of hostility.  Waterford is a county that has great national traditions.  It is the home of many of our country's most distinguished men.  We, as fellow Irishmen, feel proud of that. We readily grant them all they claim for their county, national and unified control: we enthusiastically support them there.  But surely this House will find no fault with us if we say that what we readily grant and are prepared to support for Waterford, we demand for ourselves?  The Minister says that in East Cork and County <Col N="410" /> Waterford they have not sufficient electors to entitle both to four-member constituencies.  East Cork has 79,000 electors and Waterford has something over 78,000.  The Minister's plan is to take Youghal and its immediate neighbourhood and transfer them to the County Waterford, thus providing a sufficient electorate to entitle Waterford to a four-member constituency. In doing so he cuts across every principle laid down for his own guidance. He claims that he is dominated by the Constitution.  The Constitution lays down a minimum of 20,000 and a maximum of 30,000.  Waterford falls short by a few hundred votes of the required number that would entitle it to a four-member constituency.  I am not going to put up the argument that East Cork has a bigger right than Waterford and would be more entitled to a four-member constituency.</P>
    <P>In Cork we have 18 members, and it has been frequently demonstrated in this House that that number can always be relied upon to advance or protect the county's interests.  I am not going to be selfish enough to try to lessen Waterford's representation to the advantage of Cork.  The case for the amendment is to leave Youghal in East Cork and East Cork a three-member constituency.  We will have 26,000 electors to each representative, a figure which complies with the Constitution. Waterford will have 19,800 and it is clearly a matter of choice whether the Minister is to be governed by the principles he laid down for his own guidance on the introduction of this Bill&mdash;the retention of county boundaries, the holding together of administrative and national interests as a unit and the preservation of historical associations and background &mdash;or whether he is so slightly to infringe the Constitution that it is hardly noticeable.  We have 19,800 voters as against 20,000 and it is a figure which, in all probability, is at the moment rectified, because the Minister must bear in mind that the additions this year to the franchise in the Saorstát number at least 50,000, and Waterford will have its share of those.  Probably it has now, on this franchise, reached more than the minimum <Col N="411" /> that entitles it to a four-member constituency, without the inclusion of Youghal.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the Minister's choice may be, but I am satisfied that the unfettered opinion of everyone in this House will support my contention. I am equally satisfied that all independent opinion outside this House that has considered this question and that clearly understands and appreciates the motives of this amendment, will be prepared to support it.  I will ask the Minister earnestly to consider it.  If the Minister still maintains that, according to the Constitution, that cannot be done, one would be almost tempted to ask the Minister when he developed this oriental submission to and reverence for the Constitution, particularly as the very words in the Act are &ldquo;as near as possible.&rdquo;  I suggest that by accepting my amendment your primary object, the reduction of a member, would be maintained.</P>
    <P>In order to concentrate the mind of the House on what has been done in our case, I would like to draw a comparison between Limerick City and ourselves.  Limerick City is much closer to Clare than we are in the case of Waterford and East Cork.  It is bound up with Clare by half a dozen bridges.  Many of its suburbs are in the County of Clare.  I wonder what would be the feeling of indignation of the people of Limerick if the Minister were to do there what he is doing with us, if he were to transfer Limerick City, Sarsfield's City, and make it portion of a Clare constituency? I venture to say that even the supporters of the Minister, if they were to support an action of that kind, would not long represent an outraged and indignant people.  I sincerely hope that this House will not consider that we feel too intensely about this matter, or that we have too great a regard for our historical past; yet I will submit that you can hardly realise the affection we have for our town and all that concerns it.</P>
    <P>A few evenings back I was walking beneath the old town walls that towered over my head, their massive <Col N="412" /> structure defying time, the old cannons still in place, eloquent monuments to the determination of former generations of our townsmen in the struggle to retain their individuality. Look where you will there, you will see the ruins of abbeys, friaries, the remains of monasteries; you will see our college, the first in later times that was established in this State and that is still in being&mdash;all silent witnesses, if you like, of our spiritual and intellectual past.  In all ages the people of that town have taken part, and a prominent part, in the struggle for national and religious liberty. Each hallowed spot there has its own history of sacrifice on the altar of both.  I would despise myself if any word or act of mine tended in the smallest degree to revive any bitter memories.  I have nothing but contempt for the mind that wallows in traditions of hatred and creeds of revenge in the broader atmosphere of to-day, of better understanding, mutual appreciation and respect.</P>
    <P>For over 700 years we have been a corporate town, always having our own representatives.  Isaac Butt, one of its members, framed the first Home Rule Bill.  Many of its townspeople were leaders in the '67 movement.  It was the centre of the land agitation. I remember, as a child, seeing its revered pastor, the late Monsignor, then Father Keller, led out a prisoner to be lodged in Kilmainham. Visualising all this, no wonder we feel deeply that we who survived the occupation and domination of Cromwell should in this, our own day, by the act of a Minister of a National Government created by our own people, be torn ruthlessly from all our historical past, as little considered as if we were merely an addition to a labourer's half-acre, and thrown to a neighbouring county across the Black-water at its widest portion, where it is a mile wide, taking with us one of the neighbouring villages, Ballymacoda, the birthplace, cradle and burial place of Peter O'Neill Crowley and many of the young men who gave their lives in the late movement.</P>
    <P>I view this Act, and many other measures, as expediency measures, <Col N="413" /> having no element of permanency in them.  I regard the welter of brutal passion, which nowadays masquerades as patriotic or national activities, as a transitory phase.  Reason will yet reassert itself and the real characteristics of our people will declare themselves and, as becomes a Christian nation, we will concentrate our energies on the only victories which will leave no regret&mdash;victories over vices, ignorance and inhuman conditions of life.  When that time comes, we desire to take our place in the midst of our old associations, which will be to us an inspiration and guide.  (<i>Interruption</i>). I would like to say that the person who is entirely dissociated from this country, the person whose appearance is so very objectionable, ought, at least, to pay me the honour of listening to me in silence.  I have listened in silence and contempt to him.</P>

      <P>Can there be a more contemptible creature than one who is so entirely dissociated from our national life, one who can know nothing of our hopes and ambitions, one whose future is securely invested in another country, one who lives here in security, bringing misery upon this unfortunate country and playing the part of <i>agent provocateur</i> between ourselves and the people on the other side?  You are outside the House now, Deputy.  I can give you nothing but the contempt a creature like you deserves. I have to apologise to the House and to the Minister, but I am sure you will all agree it was not my fault.  In view of all these considerations to which I have referred, I would appeal to the Minister to accept this amendment, particularly as it is practically certain that the numbers that we are short are made up on the present additions to the franchise of 50,000 new voters.  If the Minister feels that he cannot accept responsibility, let him leave the question to a free vote of the House.  The reason why I ask this is two-fold.  Firstly, if the Minister carries it through with a <Col N="414" /> mechanical majority, many of that majority having already declared against it, we will always resent his action as an unnecessary and tyrannical abuse of power.  Secondly, if he leaves it to a free vote of the House, and even if the decision is against us, much as we regret it, and we will regret it intensely, we will respect the decision of our National Parliament.</P>

      <P>I listened very attentively to the eloquent plea of the Deputy who has just spoken.  All the arguments he put forward and all the magnificent things he said may be quite correct.  Youghal, no doubt, is a very old and very historic town and, no doubt, we in the County Waterford should be all the more anxious to have it associated with us in our national affairs.  There are other reasons, also, and in my own case there are personal reasons.  From one of the monuments in Youghal my great-grandfather was hanged in 1798.  Many years ago Raleigh, from his headquarters in Youghal, ravaged County Waterford. He came up to my native town, Lismore, ravaged it and drove the people out and took possession of their land.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Goulding</NameTxt>
      <P>I am answering the eloquent plea made by Deputy Broderick.  When historical references are made by Deputies on the other side of the House, I am entitled to introduce such references into my speech if I wish to do so.  Youghal was also the seat of Edmund Spenser, and, when we Irish people hear historical references made to Raleigh and to Spenser we should bear in mind that they and their followers ravaged many towns in the South from their seats in Youghal. In Youghal, to-day, I regret to say there are many people of the way of thinking of Raleigh and of Spenser.  In taking over Youghal we, in Waterford, will be taking over many people who, if they had their way, would restore the Ireland of Raleigh and of Spenser&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The only thing we can gather from Deputy Goulding's speech is that the Waterford people having a grievance against the Raleighs and the Spensers in the past, according to the Fianna Fáil policy now, have to wipe their feet on the citizens of portion of this State to-day.  The mere Youghal people are to be trampled under the feet of Fianna Fáil, because they would not come to the aid of their supporters in Waterford.  If you cannot hit Raleigh and Queen Elizabeth and Queen Anne, you can surely have a belt at someone else, and so, far the present, they are having a belt at the Youghal people.</P>

      <P>I do not think I could add anything to the appeal made by Deputy Broderick in this matter.  I regret butting into this discussion.  I regret the attempt made to tinge with any political significance what has been done.  But as a representative of the constituency I have during my period of public life, and before it, made many friends in Youghal.  Some of these friends, comrades of mine, were butchered in Waterford in 1922.</P>

      <P>I bow to your ruling.  The matter I referred to was drawn out of me by the intervention of Deputy Mulcahy.  There was one thing disclosed in the statement of my <Col N="416" /> colleague, Deputy Broderick, with which I cannot agree, and that is his generosity.  It is a great feature always of Deputy Broderick to give something away.  I cannot agree for one moment with the idea that 26,000 East Cork people are to be only equal to 19,000 people in County Waterford.  That is an admission of inferiority with which I cannot at all agree.  It is the second time that Deputy Broderick has committed himself in this matter.  He committed himself before in the Cork County Council to handing over part of the representation of West Cork.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with West Cork when the Deputy comes along.  I am anxious and more than anxious that the town of Youghal, and the districts surrounding Youghal should be left as they always were, portion of Cork County, and I cannot for the life of me see any reason for taking them away from it.  I certainly would insist that the people of West Cork are just as much entitled to one representative for every 20,000 people as Cork City or Waterford City, or any city or county in the Free State.  I spoke at length on this matter when it came up here before, but I feel keenly and very keenly upon it.  As I say, I have been associated with that area both during the Black and Tan period and from that on.  These people have been dear to me and I feel bound up with them.  I would feel very keenly the idea of handing over any portion of Cork County to Waterford or any other county.  There is a case to be made. We made it fully before, but if there is to be a change in the constitutional representation here the change should be by portion of County Waterford being transferred to County Cork. Youghal No. 2 Rural District embraced the town of Youghal, portion of the district surrounding it, and portion of County Waterford, and that portion had its headquarters and centre in the town of Youghal.  It is a great deal more fitting that a bunch of County Waterford men should be ruled by County Cork men out of County Cork than seeing any portion of County Cork going there and being ruled by <Col N="417" /> Waterford men.  I regret keenly the decision of the Minister in the matter, and I hope he will see his way to change it.</P>

      <P>I listened with a great deal of interest to the eloquent speech of Deputy Broderick.  I have certainly great sympathy with him.  I know he feels what he says, and that it is a kind of wrench to him to see any portion of the area with which he is so familiar and with which he has been associated so long in public life, associated with another area, even though that area is just across the water, whatever the distance in space may be. But I am ruled by the necessities of the case, and I am sorry I cannot give way to the Deputy's suggestion or accept his amendment.  I realise that it was not in any spirit of hostility to County Waterford he spoke.  As a matter of fact, if he had his way, he would be more generous to County Waterford at the expense of his own constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Broderick Mr. Broderick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broderick</NameTxt>
      <P>It is so important that everyone wants it retained, on the grounds the Minister laid down for his own guidance, historic associations and unified control.  We are prepared to make any sacrifice so long as we are left as we are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I cannot go that way.  I could not make any sacrifice, and I do not feel that the necessities of the case are such that what I regard as a sacrifice is necessary.  I do not see that there is any very great sacrifice, with all respect to Deputy Broderick and his deep feeling in the matter.  I cannot feel it, perhaps because I am a Dublin man and not a Cork man nor a Youghal man.  I cannot see any sacrifice by the people of Youghal being associated with very close neighbours, with whom they have very intimate contact in business of all kinds daily.  I spent a couple of summers in Youghal on holidays. That is about all the intimate knowledge I have of Youghal and the surrounding country.  I spent some happy days there and travelled around the neighbourhood.  I met County Waterford people who came in, and I am glad to say I made some use of the acquaintances I made by learning some of the Ring Irish, and learning <Col N="419" /> some more in the town of Youghal from some old and distinguished citizens there.  They were not the type described by Deputy Goulding, but were of the old Gaelic stock, and retained their Gaelic tongue.  I know the neighbourhood and I know that there is close and intimate contact with that part of Waterford close to Youghal.  Even the fishermen there cross the water and come in almost daily.  I crossed in a fisherman's boat from Ring to Youghal and went back the other way frequently.  I profited also by learning a little Gaelic as well as other things from them.  I know that there is close association, and for these reasons I cannot see&mdash;if the Deputy will pardon me saying so&mdash;that there is the sacrifice entailed that he would have us believe exists.  Therefore necessity compels us to keep Waterford with this membership until the next census.  I believe it will be only until the next census figures are taken, when we will have to bring in another Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is my belief that in many of the constituencies, which according to the 1926 Census lose a member, the increase of population will probably be such that the members who are now lost will have to be restored.  That I believe to be a fact.  In all probability the period will not be long when a constituency, such as County Waterford, which is losing a member, will have that member restored if present economic conditions continue.  I have not that deep reverence for the Constitution as Deputy Broderick suggested that some people have.  I do not know that it is very deep in any Party.  The other Government tore the Constitution to ribbons.  We have done a fair share of it, I know.  This present Government has amended the Constitution in many ways, but I think that we have not yet brought in as many amendments to the Constitution as were brought in and passed by the last Government.  I am speaking now personally when I say that I have not that deep reverence for it.  I do not want to enter on a discussion of constitutional matters, but it is not by reason of the very deep reverence that a <Col N="420" /> Minister would be supposed to have for the Constitution that I am sticking to this Bill and this part of it relating to Cork and Waterford.  It is because of the necessities of the present situation.</P>
    <P>There were one or two remarks made by Deputy Mulcahy to which I would prefer to reply when he is present.  I did not like his remark about the Fianna Fáil Party wiping its feet in the mere Irish.  If there is anybody who did more than wipe his feet in the mere Irish it is Deputy Mulcahy, and if he were present I would remind him of the wiping he did.  As he is not present another opportunity will arise.</P>

      <P>Well, for instance, in the County Borough of Dublin the existing Under-Sheriff is to be Returning Officer for the constituencies in both North and South City.  I do not see the point in not retaining the Under-Sheriff for the two constituencies created in Kerry.  After all, the arrangement for Kerry now is merely a division of the constituency into North and South, while retaining the same number of Deputies as formerly represented it when it was one constituency, namely, seven Deputies.  For a number of years the Under-Sheriff has been accustomed to act as Returning Officer for the whole county.

      <P>There will be this difference in the new arrangement: that you would have to supervise two areas with two separate headquarters. In the case of Dublin there is the one headquarters and all the staff can be under the one supervision and control of the Sheriff or Registrar, as the case may be.  That could not happen in the case of County Kerry, or Donegal or Mayo.  The fact that it would be so difficult to supervise staffs in two different centres for the day of the nomination or the day of the counting of the votes was what determined this, because it was felt that this new arrangement would lead to more efficient work in these areas if they were divided so as to have two Returning Officers, each with undivided responsibility.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Read in its proper place, that amendment will have the effect of providing that this measure will operate not as from the date of the next dissolution, but as from the date of the dissolution <Col N="425" /> after that.  The purpose of the amendment is to oblige a general election to be held before this measure shall begin to operate.  I put it in that form because, in the many lectures we have got in this House as to the powers of the elected representatives under mandates which they get from time to time, it has never yet been asserted in this House&mdash;I want to know if it ever is going to be asserted&mdash;that this question of university representation was put to the electorate at any election recently held and that a definite, or even an indefinite and vague, mandate was got by any Government for the abolition of university representation.  I do not want to argue the point as to the numerical strength of the representation given.  I simply put the argument on this single ground&mdash;that there was a Constitution enacted here by a Constituent Assembly, that into that Constitution there was written the principle of university representation, that that constituent law was not changed by legislation in the period in which it was possible to change it by legislation and has not since been changed by referendum.  Apart from these Constitutional difficulties, there is the question of right.  University representation was provided for in the first Constitution.  That Constitution went immediately before the people.  It was accepted by them.  At that time, it can be said that many points in the Constitution were questioned, but no point of objection was taken to the idea that university representation was a good thing or to the fact that it was provided for in the Constitution.  Several other elections were held and at none of them was this matter made an issue. It has, more or less, been made an issue now by the introduction of this Bill.  People who believe in and prate so much about democracy and, particularly, people who lean on what they call mandates should be satisfied to let this Bill run the gauntlet of a general election.  If a Government places this item on its programme and it is returned, then it is entitled to go ahead with it, if it can get over the Constitutional difficulties.</P>
    <P>At the moment, the situation is that <Col N="426" /> this principle was written into the Constitution.  It was not objected to or made an issue at an election. Despite all that, it is being taken out. It cannot be said that it was written in without advertence, because it had been an agitated point, a point upon which a great many people were asked to express a view in early days.  The expressions of their views were entirely in favour of university representation. I have gone over these already.  I want to summarise them again.  The late Archbishop of Dublin, who was also Chancellor of the National University, raised the cry in the first instance.  He raised it at the time that the Representation of the People Bill was before the British House of Commons.  It was pointed out that representation was provided for Trinity College, Dublin.  The Archbishop of Dublin summoned the people interested in the matter, and summoned everybody believed to be interested in the matter, by a letter which he wrote to the Press in the year 1917.  In that letter, he gave many cogent arguments why representation should be given to the National University. He wound up his letter and his exhortation by saying that he did not want this letter to be taken as meaning other than what it stated&mdash;that he wanted university representation for a particular university and did not want, on the contrary, that the representation which Trinity College had should be taken from it.  He specifically said that he did not want to deprive that venerable institution of a privilege which it had enjoyed for over 300 years.  His influence and authority gave great impetus to the movement that was, all the time, growing in favour of university representation. Impelled by that letter, the Graduates' Association, then in being, called a public meeting.  That meeting was attended by men of eminence in practically every walk of life.  Even the list given by the newspapers of those attending showed that, so far as the professions were concerned, all the distinguished people who had come out of the old Royal University, or out of any of the constituent colleges established from time to time under other <Col N="427" /> university systems, were present or represented.  The present President of University College, Dublin, proposed the main resolution, which was carried unanimously.  It was carried unanimously by a body which the list in the newspapers would certainly show to be a very important body. Lest it might be said that there was some sort of selfish interest involved, I must point out that the senior students then in University College, Dublin, took the matter up.</P>
    <P>They got the acquiescence and the agreement of the students elsewhere. The Student Representative Council in the Dublin College at that date had at its head a man who is now distinguished in the administrative life of this country and previously had been very distinguished in very many ways in the national life of the country.  He headed a delegation.  All those agreed that such representation should be demanded, that it was a thing worth having and a thing worth agitating for. The then President of that Student Representative Council and some others delegated for the duty visited whoever were the leaders of Sinn Féin then free.  Sinn Féin accepted this principle of University representation. Meantime this measure was being fought in the House of Commons and the Irish Parliamentary Party took up the matter.  The Bill had gone a certain stage when, owing to their exertions, it was referred to a Speaker's Committee on which, I think, four Irish members served.  The result of their endeavours was that the committee reported back in favour of the inclusion of representation for Universities on a wider scale than previously, so that in the year 1917-18 you had this combination with the Archbishop of Dublin, being also Chancellor of the University, and a distinguished figure in the national life of the country, leading the movement.</P>

      <P>There is the position that you had that mandate for University representation accepted by everybody who counted in the country at the time.  The movement was led by the late Archbishop in his capacity as Chancellor of the University, and surely the Minister cannot disregard the fact that the Archbishop acted in that and ever other capacity as a sterling nationalist.  You had the graduates.  You had the students.  You had the two political parties in the country.  Both of them accepted this idea and put it as a matter to be fought for and to be pushed forward by whatever influence either or both parties had.  Where has the change been in that situation?  The year 1917-18 saw that.  It was then written into our Constitution and there was no objection taken.  The Constitution was presented to the people and there was no word of protest raised against this matter.  There have been five general elections since and this matter did not emerge as an issue.</P>

      <P>I would like to know where.  It is not in the manifesto and it is not in the plan, and we have seen most of the plan honoured by breach, and we have seen a great deal of the manifesto dishonoured in the same way.  Certainly the question of University representation does not <Col N="429" /> come into either.  There is no demand for this.  The Vice-President fell back the last day on a resolution passed by Convocation.  Would he tell us the number who were present?  Would he tell us how many times meetings of Convocation fall through because a quorum cannot be obtained?  Does he know what the quorum is?  Does he know that the Senate of the National University, with the President of the Executive Council sitting as Chancellor, passed a resolution on this matter? Does he think it is in favour of the Bill?  There is all that weight on one side and what have we against it? What have we in favour of this?  This resolution of a few people in Convocation. We have a number of University representatives in this House.  I have not heard any voice that may be counted as that of a representative of a University raised in favour of this Bill.  I have heard many against it. I have put my amendment down on the simple point that if it is thought that this is a popular thing and that there is a mandate for it, test it.  The measure can come into force on the dissolution after the next one.  That will give the people a chance.  It will give the two University representatives of my constituency a chance of appearing before their constituents to say what they have done for the University in any way, and to make argument in an election address as to why the University constituency should no longer be allowed to exist.  That is the situation I would like to see.</P>

      <P>I do not intend to say very much about this.  I would like to support, in every way that I can, Deputy McGilligan in what he has said on the amendment that he has put to the Vice-President.  It seems to me to be an eminently reasonable amendment. It raises a very important matter indeed, and that is the need for taking time about these destructive changes.  If ever there was a case where it was advisable to go slow it is when we are proceeding to destroy.  Let Fianna Fáil take care they are not raising up a maxim against themselves to destroy hastily.  I think that whatever the Vice-President is going to <Col N="430" /> say about the question of a mandate he can satisfy himself very easily on one point, and that is that throughout the country this will be taken as something which was unexpected.  Every one that I have spoken to about it has confirmed the view that this came as a matter of surprise to them.  It may have been raised in some places, but I think it is undoubtedly true that it was not a matter that was before the public eye at all at any previous election. Therefore, there is every reason for taking time before bringing about this change in our general representation. I can only imagine one reason for refusing this amendment, and that is the hurry to gain two votes.  Otherwise, having passed the general principle, there can be no gain in having it put into application at a somewhat earlier date than another.  I would plead strongly with the Vice-President to take his time about this matter, and let the public have the chance of expressing their views about it in public before he makes it, as far as he is concerned, an irreparable act.</P>

      <P>I cannot accept the amendment.  On the question of the mandate, may I say that I heard this question of the abolition of University representation discussed.  I can distinctly recollect two large meetings in Dublin at the last two general elections where it was discussed.  I cannot say if it was in any of the documents that Deputy McGilligan is so fond of quoting.  It is so long since I saw any of them that I am hazy about what points are in them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>If it was in it, I am sure the Deputy would have reminded us of it.  At any rate, I know that it was discussed in public in my hearing and that announcements were made as to what our programme was at very large public meetings in Dublin on the occasion of the last two general elections in 1932 and 1933.  So far as the suggestion of taking people unawares is concerned, I know it was discussed. It is also a fact, I think, that all Governments introduce such legislation as they think right or proper or <Col N="431" /> for the good of the community, whether they had ever put such legislation in the forefront of their programme at a general election or not.  That is a practice common to every Government that has so far been on these benches.  I do not think that anybody will dispute the right of a Government to do that, with or without a mandate, and we believe that this Bill is a necessary corollary to the Bill, the Report Stage of which we have been discussing, and which was discussed here at considerable length recently, dealing with the reduction of the membership of the Dáil.  Not that this Bill does not involve very distinct principles in itself, and not that it does not raise issues which, to some, are of considerable importance, but if we believe the House ought to be reduced in numbers, this certainly would strike one as one way that should be examined first.  If convinced that it is not an unjust thing to do, a Government seeking a reduction of numbers could, without doing hardship or injury or inflicting any injustice on any party or section of the community, examine this method.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It cannot be said that University graduates and the Universities themselves will be left entirely without representation.  There is nothing to prevent graduates from seeking election, and, in fact, we have had on different sides of the House here distinguished graduates, at any rate, of the National University, who came in from constituencies rather than from the University itself, and that will always be so.  It will, in fact, probably be a help, when candidates come to be selected, to men who wish to be selected for a constituency if they have distinguished academic qualifications. I have no doubt whatever that all that Deputy McGilligan says about the history of University representation, so far as the National University is concerned, round about the year 1917 and so on, is correct.  There was unquestionably a big agitation got up at that time, and a strong demand, voiced by representative people at big meetings for representation for the National University in the British House of Commons, but the real reason for that <Col N="432" /> demand was the demand for equality, the demand that the newly-founded National University should have equality of representation with Dublin University.  That was the <i>raison d'être</i> of that demand.  It was not merely the principle of University representation; the principle they put forward was the right of the National University to equal representation with Dublin University.</P>

      <P>It is, yes.  That is what gave rise to the demand at that time.  There was a Bill going through which would affect the issue, and, unquestionably, Dublin University having representation, the demand was made that National University should get similar representation.  That is my recollection of what happened at that time, and of what gave rise to the demand.  Deputy McGilligan says that the Senate of National University passed a resolution and that the present Chancellor, President de Valera, was in the chair.  I do not know whether he was in the chair or not, but I believe the resolution was passed.  The Deputy talks about the members present at Convocation when a certain resolution was passed.  We do not know how many were present when the Senate passed that resolution and we do not know whether it was passed by a majority of one or not&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I understand the Deputy and I see what he wants.  I am not making the case that discussion at a Fianna Fáil Convention constitutes publication to the electors, but I do want to say that it was discussed, and I really believe it ought to have been in the Press, because it was discussed openly at Conventions in the Mansion House.  I cannot say now whether it was in the Press or not, and I do not want to make the case that that discussion meant publication to the electorate.  I do want to say that, so far as we are concerned, it has been discussed over a number of years, and that there has been only one opinion about it.  As to the point properly <Col N="436" /> made by Deputy Thrift as to whether that is to be regarded as a mandate, I do not claim that at all. It appeared, I believe, in the Press which reported Fianna Fáil matters. I have a recollection of having seen it there, although I have not got those papers by me, but I can look up the minutes and, I believe, produce the minutes showing resolutions passed in years gone by at Fianna Fáil Conventions, calling for the complete abolition of University representation.</P>

The Vice-President comes in here with his oldest inhabitant point of view, <Col N="437" /> and says he remembers two big meetings at which it was certainly discussed. At the end of his speech, feeling that that was not too solid a prop to lean on, he says it was discussed at the Fianna Fáil Ard Fheis; that there certainly are resolutions somewhere in the Minute Book, but no publication.

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The onus is on me to prove what?  There is a constitutional provision.  There is a Bill introduced to take it out.  On whom is the onus?  It is on the people who are striving to disturb the existing state of things.  I proved the mandate from 1917-18 for University representation, and not what the Vice-President has said it was; I am going on to that. It is now sought to remove the representation that was put in to the British legislation first, and into the Constitution here, on foot of what the people wanted.  It is now sought to remove that.  On whom is the onus?  At any rate, whether the onus is on me or not, I have given a statement as to what people said and thought, and the force they had behind them, two political Parties in the country joining on the idea of University representation and not simply as a counter to Trinity College.  Whether the onus is on me or not I have put forward a case. Against that, we get this tired memory of two big meetings and some minutes. There is the outstanding fact that two candidates who stood for that Party in the National University did not mention the idea of dropping the Universities as electoral bodies.  It was not mentioned.  They kept clean away from that.  There was no definite statement that that was part of their programme. The Convocation passed a <Col N="439" /> resolution.  Let us assume, as we must assume, that there was a quorum there. I repeat what I said before; the quorum had been lowered in order to&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's inability to pass a certain examination kept him away from that body at any rate.  That is the fact; the Convocation quorum was lowered, because it was found that people were not attending in sufficient numbers.  There is a lower quorum now than there used to be.  Let full weight be given to that, whatever it is worth.  At a meeting presided over by the President, in his capacity as Chancellor of the University, a resolution was passed relating to this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>It was after the Bill was introduced.  It was two Senate meetings ago, I think.  That is on record.  They are not a very large body.  They are culled from the three constituent Colleges.  They have representatives on outside bodies, county councillors and other people.  They passed a particular resolution. In the teeth of all that I have said about the people who had previously moved in this, it is said that the onus is on us to show that it should not go through.  The way the Vice-President thinks he ought to discharge the onus is by that peculiar phrasing he used. I think the phrase he used shows that he realises there is no mandate for this and no approval of it.  I should like to see the Fianna Fáil representatives of the University attending a meeting some day and really seeing what was the mandate for this got in the way the Vice-President said. Some of them must have a memory of those two big meetings.  Surely they got all the information about them and they probably have access to the Fianna Fáil resolution book.  The last point I want to deal with is the <Col N="440" /> statement that Archbishop Walsh and those who fought for University representation in 1917 and 1918 only did so as a counter to Trinity College.  I read the letter the last day.  The only phrase in which there was a reference to Trinity College is at the end of the letter in which the Archbishop in a sort of way adverted to the fact that it might be thought he was arguing that if they could not get representation why should Trinity College.  He went on to say distinctly that he did not want to take it from any institution. What is the whole object of the letter?  He referred to the growing numbers and to the history of the University and the University systems which preceded it, and the privileges and status which had been carried forward from one system to the other. It was the numbers that he counted on; not the numbers in comparison with Trinity numbers, but the numbers as entitling them to vote and have separate representation.  He said further that not merely had they the growing numbers from the National University, which was a recently established institution, but there was the inflow of the graduates of the other university systems.  He stated further that there was an educational interest and he wrote specially about it.  He also talked of the interests of the country and how the interests of the country would be furthered by representation of the universities.</P>

      <P>Certainly.  There was no question of answering the point that it was supposed to be a side-wipe at Trinity&mdash;nothing of the sort.

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That was not the argument.  Taking the National University as covering the Royal University and the others which preceded it, the argument was that the graduates who had come through these systems were a representative body, numerically strong, educationally of a particular type, and in all a valuable electoral body.  The argument was distinct and clear.  There was a phrase brought in at the end with regard to Trinity because, naturally, the Archbishop must have adverted to the fact that anybody reading the letter would possibly think that he was making a case for the representation of a certain University group with the object, not so much of getting representation for them, but of being able to say eventually: &ldquo;If we do not get it, why should the others.&rdquo;  He does say at the end that he is making no claim that Trinity College should have its representation taken from it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Leave the letter alone and read the account in the newspapers of the meeting of graduates which took place afterwards.  Trinity was introduced as a comparison, and introduced as a comparison for this reason.  One speaker, I think it was Dr. Hyde, said that Trinity College had undoubtedly a body of men coming forth as graduates and that when you regarded them you had to say that, from their attainments and everything else, they formed a good constituency.  Having said that, Trinity College was put on one side.  This group of distinguished graduates of the National University and the Royal began to speak of the way they themselves and those whom they knew and who may have qualified in their time represented a valuable electoral body, and to prove to their own satisfaction that they did.  There was none of what is attempted to be read into it&mdash;the dog-in-the-manager system: that they wanted in a spirit of rivalry to say: &ldquo;If Trinity has it we must get it,&rdquo; or &ldquo;If we do not get it, they must lop off Trinity College representation.&rdquo;  Sinn Féin accepted it, the Irish Party accepted it, and, under the suasion of <Col N="442" /> the Irish Party in the British House of Commons, the British Parliament accepted it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnDonnelly" hpid="Mr. Donnelly Mr. Donnelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Was there no analogy shown at any time when the National was seeking this representation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the analogy was used.  One will use weak as well as strong arguments.  I am sure it was.  I do not know what arguments were used at the Speaker's conferences, as they were not made public. I did read, however, the speeches in the House of Commons.  The real solid argument advanced was not that.  It would have been a weak argument to say simply: &ldquo;Because another body has this we must have it.&rdquo;  That was probably alluded to in order to show the injustice.  Undoubtedly the other argument was used and pressed home, that the people who were coming out of the University, who had come out of it, and who had graduated, were, numerically and in every other way, a sufficiently strong body to be represented and were worthy of representation, and they got it as being worthy of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At any rate, I say again that Sinn Fein accepted it&mdash;definitely accepted it.  The argument was advanced there, as I say, through one of our most distinguished graduates of that time, a man distinguished in the life of this country, and it was definitely put forward. A group of three, that gentleman and two others, met another group and came back to us who sent them.  Those who might be called the actual leaders of Sinn Fein were mainly in jail at the time, but the people who were next down the line and who were standing as the authoritative body speaking for Sinn Fein were met by these people, and they brought back a statement to us that it had been accepted.  As far as I remember, even a letter passed to some of the people in the House of Commons saying that Sinn Fein as a body had accepted this.  I state that for what it is worth.  The letters can be looked up and they can be queried. There was that mass of opinion and there was no change that I know of. I heard of no vehement speeches made <Col N="443" /> about this.  I saw no resolutions passed.  I saw no statements from people parading themselves before the university constituency and saying that this ought to go and their endeavour would be to get it out.  The only thing we have is the reference to the couple of meetings by the Vice-President here and the resolution. We know what the Vice-President's opinion of a mandate is and the strength there is behind this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestHAlton" hpid="Professor Alton Professor Alton">
      <NameTxt>Professor Alton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to reinforce the arguments which the last speaker put forward, not that I have much hope that they will be listened to.  The Vice-President gives one the impression of being very impartial and judicial and trying to be fair-minded, but when one examines his arguments one finds that they have no substance or body.  Deputy McGilligan asked, and I think it was a fair question, what was the mandate for the abolition of University representation.  The Vice-President's answer was a half-admission that there was no mandate, but he claimed that the question of University representation was discussed and debated at two large and powerful meetings and thus, he argued, was brought before the country.  He did not tell us whether at this meeting any resolutions were passed or any decisions arrived at.  He simply told us that the question was bruited. Anything might be raised at a public meeting, and this was not a public meeting.  If I am not mistaken it was a Party meeting.  That can hardly be used as an argument for taking action on one side or another on a matter just discussed in that way.  I think I remember a reference to some such meeting.  I do not think it was fully reported in any paper and I do not think there was any decision arrived at.  The Vice-President can correct me if I am wrong.  But I do hold that even if a decision of that sort were arrived at&mdash;the decision of a Party meeting&mdash;action should not be taken on such a decision.  The question should have been put fully to the country.  Perhaps the Vice-President does not think that University constituents <Col N="444" /> are an important section of the community.  I admit I am prejudiced, but I think they are important. I think a country that used to pride itself on being a land of saints and scholars might get some consideration for the scholars.</P>

      <P>Oh, well, we are all saints.  It may be that the object is to wipe out the scholars here and leave the saints.  However, I cannot accept the Vice-President's argument that the Government are entitled to view a mere nebulous discussion as a direct mandate.  I do hold, in all decency and fairness to himself and to his Party as well as to the country, that the principle of University representation might be put fairly and plainly before the country.  It is the principle of University representation with which I am concerned.  The particular party leanings of the University representatives at the present moment do not concern me.  I should like to see the reasons for and against University representation put plainly and honestly to the country.  The Vice-President says he put forward decent reasons for the abolition of University representation. He put forward reasons that were not convincing to me.  I admit that on the Second Reading there were reasons put forward from the Government Benches which were not decent. Some Deputies there frankly admitted that it would operate as a gain to them to get rid of University representation, and one speaker on the Government side frankly stated that one of the reasons for getting rid of University representation was that it would teach the Universities a lesson.  I thought his words were rather vindictive and unworthy of the House.  I should like that the Vice-President himself would put the whole question and ask for a mandate fairly.  I think it is only fair to the country, fair to the Universities and fair to himself that he should do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SydneyBMinch" hpid="Mr. Minch Mr. Minch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Minch</NameTxt>
      <P>There was one part of the Vice-President's speech in which he <Col N="445" /> referred to representation generally, and said that University graduates had as much chance of getting elected in this country as had the ordinary candidates going forward for election to the Dáil.  I do not see that at all.  I cannot see a Trinity College graduate and a graduate of the National University on an equal plane in seeking representation down the country.  I cannot see a Trinity graduate being able to stand up and have an equal chance of election with a National University graduate.  I am taking up purely the Vice-President's own statement that a graduate from the University can proceed to the country and in the ordinary state of things have an equal chance of getting elected to this House.  It is too soon after the Treaty, far too soon, to abolish representation for Trinity College.  In all fairness that is my personal belief.  I can very well understand a Trinity graduate going down to the country and standing before the electorate with a view to coming to this House representing certain University interests, the interests that the Universities have at the present time, the right of representation here.  Such a candidate trying to establish that principle out in the country would not have a chance. We all know what would happen.  First of all he would be called an ex-Unionist, an Imperialist, a British henchman and the Union Jack would be tied around him.  He would get no chance whatever of being returned to this House.  It is far too soon after the Treaty to take representation away from Trinity College.  I think a few more decades should pass before that should be attempted.  I believe that more time should be allowed pass before we could be certain that the Dublin University candidate would get a fair hearing in the country. I have no hesitation in putting forward these views, and whenever I get an opportunity of speaking plainly on a subject like that I do so.  I am quite satisfied that the Vice-President is sincere in viewing it from his point of view, but I am equally sincere in viewing it from another point of view. A Bill like this should be avoided.  I want fair-play for every section of our community, fair-play for the minority <Col N="446" /> who are represented here through the members for Dublin University. That is an argument that should be listened to in some form or another.</P>
      <P>I know that Dublin University has had a past as far as the political aspirations of this country go.  Their views were sincere as far as they were concerned but we all know they were more or less opposed to the national outlook.  But since the Treaty was signed and since we have met here in the Dáil, our own Parliament, the representatives of Dublin University have done all that fair-minded people, intensely anxious to co-operate in every possible way for the good of the country, could have done.  They have done a lot of good work here in this House, work, I am quite certain, that is of great national benefit, though some of the members on the Fianna Fáil Benches may not think so.  On the general national view from outside the Party viewpoint, it will be admitted that the representatives of Dublin University have done credit to our country here.  I would be very sorry indeed to see, at this early stage in our parliamentary history, and at this early stage in our independence, the representation of Dublin University in the Dáil wiped out.  I know that was not the special aim of the Bill as introduced. The aim was to do away with University representation, but it would be mighty hard to convince a lot of people that Dublin University is not singled out to be shot at and that the shots are not directed at its gates.</P>

      <P>I would not have intervened at all but for the speech of Deputy Minch.  He seems to labour under the impression that anyone associated with Trinity College would not have a fair chance of getting elected in any constituency in the Saorstát. That is not so at all.  I would like anyone to go down to North Mayo and tackle the Minister for Justice at an election.  He is a graduate of Trinity College.  I am one of those who believe that a man who is a graduate of a University would stand a greater chance of being selected by any of the political Parties, and a greater chance of being returned than an ordinary candidate. It is graduates of Universities that <Col N="447" /> people want, not as representatives of the Universities, but as representatives of the urban and rural constituencies. They are the kind of people that appeal most to the electorate.  Constituencies are very glad to have such candidates and are very far from crushing them out.  The interest taken by the people in University representation was brought home very forcibly to me during the Leitrim-Sligo election.  I remember a letter coming to the Headquarters of our organisation asking for information on the question of proportional representation.  I am speaking now of the average elector and voter as the writer of this letter was and I say that the average elector and voter cannot understand why Trinity College, or the National University, with roughly 3,500 each, should have six representatives between them while it takes 8,000 voters, in a rural or urban constituency, to send one representative to this House.  I agree with Deputy McGilligan when he said that Sinn Fein accepted this; but I would like to hear from Deputy McGilligan some justification of why three representatives in each University should be returned by 3,000 voters.  That is what the ordinary people cannot understand.  I am speaking now of numbers alone.</P>

    <P>There are many critics of University representation in our own organisation and there are many Deputies in this House who are not convinced upon the question.  I remember the arguments that took place when this matter was under discussion.  It was pointed out that Trinity College had certain representation, while the National University had none.  That might be the weak end of the argument, but I would like to hear Deputy McGilligan's explanation as to why he is in favour of having six Deputies elected to this House by something over 6,000 voters while one Deputy for Kildare or Roscommon, or any other constituency, must have 8,000 voters.  That is the difficulty with the people generally.  Deputy Minch may put it out of his head that there is any grudge against the representatives of Trinity College as such.  That day is gone and gone for ever.  People desire to have representatives who are <Col N="448" /> graduates of Universities.  One of the most critical things in the selection of candidates at the present moment is this: A vote takes place between local interests and merits in the selection of candidates.</P>

      <P>Does the Deputy not know very well that in any constituency at the present moment if a candidate had any association in the past with institutions that were British, he is branded as an ex-Unionist or a British henchman, and that is worked against him for all it is worth?</P>

      <P>That cuts no ice at present.  As a matter of fact it would do a candidate good if he had been associated with a university.  People are much too far advanced for that kind of humbug that the Deputy talks of. But, perhaps, this is what he may be thinking of.  There are two types of candidates who come up for elections, whether they are university graduates or not.  One has a good national record, the other has not.  That arises and always will arise, and that is the kind of thing that determines voters how to vote on the day of the election. If a man has a good national record and has degrees from a university, then, in 99 cases out of 100, he will win the day, whether he is out of Trinity College or out of the National University, and <i>vice versa.</i>  If you put up a man, no matter what his ability, or no matter what his educational record, who bears a bad national record some delegate will rise and make objection to him.  If that is what the Deputy means I agree with him.</P>

      <P>Surely the last speaker has been dealing with the question, not whether university representation should be abolished, but whether it has over-representation or not.  I think the Vice-President led us astray in one direction: this is not a question whether a graduate of a particular university would or would not be likely to be elected by a particular constituency at all.  University graduates, I contend, will have quite a good chance if they choose to come out and contest constituencies. But the point I made on Second Reading, and which comes out here with great force, is that those are not the kind of people we are likely to get as specialised university representatives, and people who would be more likely to be more useful here in this Dáil in their special lines than those candidates who stand on general grounds for ordinary constituencies. The people I have in mind are people who have really to be led to come here, and to be induced to stand.  They are people who are amateur politicians rather than those that I think it would be very much to our good to try and get rid of, namely, the professional politicians.  You are more likely to get the university type through the university representation in a specialised way than by trying to encourage university men to stand for the ordinary constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I merely rose to try and bring back the discussion from the point where it is said University graduates have an equal chance with other candidates in ordinary constituencies.  I should like to support Deputy McGilligan very strongly in another matter, and that is as to the effect of the agitation raised for representation for the National University at the time the question was brought forward in the British House of Commons.  I am entirely in agreement with him, that the essence of the argument was in no way to take away representation from Trinity College.  I rather recollect advocacy of the National University's claim from the University representatives.  I think I am accurate in saying that the result was conclusively in favour of extending University representation there, because, <Col N="450" /> as a result of the agitation, not only did the National University get representation, but I believe Queen's University got its representative also. The result of the agitation was that instead of the principle of University representation going, its extent was widely increased, and that was largely due to Archbishop Walsh's advocacy of the principle of University representation. It very strongly comes out, as Deputy McGilligan has shown, in the Archbishop's phrase at the close of his letter, that it would not satisfy him to produce equality by removing representation from Trinity College, but that he most definitely required in the new University that he wished for, equal representation for the National University of Ireland, and I am very glad to say he succeeded in getting it. Despite what Deputy Donnelly said, I am afraid it does boil down to this: that my colleagues and I are the sinners. We have to take the responsibility on our shoulders.  We have voted too often against Fianna Fáil and we have got to go.</P>

      <P>The object of Deputy McGilligan's amendment, as I understand it, is to give time for consideration, and Deputy Donnelly has given a very excellent illustration of the good that might be done by taking time for consideration.  He has put forward the plea that University graduates are over-represented in this House.  He has not attempted, nor have many other Deputies who wandered back to rather Second Reading points, to show that there is anything injurious to democracy, or injurious to the country, in giving University graduates as a group representation, if that representation were not over-representation. He has just raised a point that might properly come up for consideration, if time for consideration were given, as this amendment suggests.  The difficulty of speaking in favour of this amendment <Col N="451" /> appears to me to be that the Vice-President has very largely given away his case, in so far as it depends on reason or argument, and falls back on the numbers which he can count on to vote with him.  He has admitted quite frankly&mdash;I would not say that it was a half-admission&mdash;that there is no mandate behind the Government for bringing forward this measure; that at no time was it put publicly before the country; that at no time was an expression of the country's will in the matter invited; that at no time had the country the matter before it when exercising the vote at any election in the history of this State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He has, it is true, quoted a resolution from Convocation of the National University of Ireland.  That is the only resolution of any representative body or any public body which he has been able to lay his hands on and to bring before the House.  Nothing would be further from my wish than to offer any criticism affecting the National University, but we have it stated by those who know better than I could know that it is a body which occasionally fails to conduct its business, because no quorum is present. It is within the knowledge of all that at public bodies of any sort, meetings of which cannot be counted upon, nothing is easier than to whip up a quorum for a particular purpose.  A whip goes around privately, a quorum is got, and a resolution can be carried by an overwhelming majority.  Surely the Vice-President is not serious in proposing that a decision of the Dáil should be governed by a resolution of Convocation of the National University, however representative such might be.  It must be admitted that the meeting is not likely to have been representative.  The Vice-President has abandoned the suggestion&mdash;I do not know if he ever put it forward, and I do not want to charge him with putting anything forward that he did not&mdash;and has not attempted to contend that he has a mandate in favour of this measure.  I suggest to him that it has been proved up to the hilt this evening that there is a definite mandate from the country going back for 20 years <Col N="452" /> against this mandate.  He has against him not only the authority of Archbishop Walsh and a distinguished group of university graduates, but he has against him the expressed opinion of the old organisation of Sinn Féin. There has been no propaganda in the country about it.  Some Deputies smile at my quoting Sinn Féin.  They need not.  Sinn Féin represented a very large body of opinion 20 years ago.</P>

      <P>I am in agreement with Deputy Donnelly again, that Sinn Féin represented a very large large and a very respectable body of opinion in this country 20 years ago.  That body of opinion was in favour of University representation, and that body of opinion has never expressed a change from that day to this. The Government which brings forward this measure has never put before the country the possibility of changing its opinion in relation to this principle of the Constitution.  I suggest, therefore, to the Vice-President that not only has he no mandate behind him but he has a mandate directly against him on the point. Supposing that mandate were not there, does the Vice-President claim, in regard to a matter affecting the Constitution of the country, that the Government is free to act without a mandate as in some ordinary matter of legislation?  The Vice-President made a statement with which I am in entire agreement, though I differ from his conclusions. He said it was a common procedure for governments to introduce such legislation as they thought good. Agreed.  Surely when legislation they think good conflicts with the existing Constitution, which has large support behind it, as the Constitution has with <Col N="453" /> regard to this measure, it is not a common procedure for Governments to introduce legislation dealing with such a point.  The Minister asked: Have the Government the right to do so? The Vice-President knows well the difference between having the right to do something and being right in doing it.  No one denies that the Government has the right to do anything in the Dáil which comes within the rules of the House.  It is an entirely different question, and one which requires deeper consideration, apart from political consideration, whether they are right in taking certain steps.  That they have the right to do it one admits.  That they have the power, and possibly the power to carry it, one admits, but is it right?  I should like the Vice-President to address his mind to this: that this Bill affects the Constitution of the country.  I am not going to discuss the general principles. I have no doubt I would be called to order if I did, but I suggest that where a measure affects the Constitution, it is only just to the country, and only fair to the minority, that that measure should receive more consideration, should receive more time, and that the country should have an opportunity of expressing its opinion before the Constitution is changed.  It is not as if the matter was one of urgency. I do not think the Vice-President's supporters will maintain that six representatives in this House are of grave danger to the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Vice-President has been kindly in his references to the representatives of universities in this House.  Other Deputies have been more than kindly in their references.  I do not think that it can be maintained that we constitute a great danger to the country such as was suggested in regard to other constitutional amendments which were declared to be urgent.  The Vice-President said that this Bill was a natural corollary or a natural sequence to the Electoral (Revision of Constituencies) Bill, but surely that is a hasty view.  That Bill had to be introduced into the House to comply with the provisions of the Constitution.  By virtue of the Constitution, the Government was bound <Col N="454" /> to introduce such a Bill.  They were bound to revise the number of Deputies in this House in the light of their knowledge of, and in accordance with, the population of the constituencies. They were acting according to the Constitution in introducing that measure.  They had no option but to do it if they were to obey the Constitution.  This Bill is on entirely different lines.  This Bill is altering the Constitution but it has no relation whatever to the other Bill.  The Constitution demands that the representatives of the ordinary constituencies throughout the country should be in proportion to the population of these constituencies and of the country, but it deliberately left out of consideration that there should be a reduction in the number of university representatives. I do not say that such reduction might not be advisable in certain circumstances.  Whether these circumstances have arisen so far, I am not prepared to say but there is no connection between these two measures.</P>
    <P>The Minister has brought in a Bill for the revision of constituencies according to what he thinks to be right and the House has expressed its approval of that Bill.  That obeys the Constitution in regard to the revision of constituencies as the population of the country changes, but there is no provision in the Constitution to deal with this question of the universities. Again, I say that I am not making an impossible demand.  All I am asking is that the measure should be considered, that the country, not merely this House and the Minister, should be asked to consider it.  The Minister used the phrase that the abolition of university representation was a measure which should be considered. Nobody has any objection to its being considered but has it been considered?  The country has been given no opportunity of considering it.  The Convocation of the National University, we are told, has considered it.  Some meetings of the Ard Fheis have considered it, and some public meetings in the City of Dublin have considered it.  We are told by the Vice-President that the Convocation <Col N="455" /> of National University adopted a resolution which was published in the Press, but until the Vice-President referred to it on Second Reading, none of us was aware, even though we read the papers, that it had been considered at meetings in Dublin and at Conventions of the Fianna Fáil Party.  The electors never considered it and the electors are surely entitled to consider a change in the Constitution of the country.</P>
    <P>If this measure passes without further consideration some anomalies seem bound to arise.  I do not know whether the Vice-President has yet considered that.  For instance, if this measure passes it is clear that the present university electors will be left without votes in any constituency. Further legislation will be necessary in order to provide these people with votes.</P>

      <P>I leave that matter to be settled between the Vice-President and the Deputy behind him.  I do not suggest that the Government has any intention of leaving these people without votes, but as the law stands at present, these people will be left without votes once this measure passes.  It is possible for the Government to remedy that grievance, but that is an argument that the matter requires further consideration and that time should be given for such relief as can be afforded by a further measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Members of the Government on the Front Bench and many Deputies behind them often make appeals across the <Col N="456" /> House for co-operation.  On the Second Reading debate on this Bill, I made a suggestion that the Government might take members from other parts of the House into consultation as to the best way of dealing with this question of University representation.  I do not think that suggestion received any attention from the Government Benches.  I would suggest to them still that this is a measure on which they might fairly ask, without any loss of principle on their side, co-operation from all sides of the House.  I am bold enough to believe in such a conference, at which opinions would be expressed and ideas promulgated which would show that there might be certain agreement as to, first of all, whether any measure is necessary to deal with University representation as it is at present, and, secondly, if it were the general opinion that such a measure was necessary, what lines that measure should take.  Even at this hour, I do not know whether it is the 10th or the 11th hour, I would appeal to the Vice-President and his colleagues that they might agree to such a proposal.  I am quite sure that they are honest in making their appeal for co-operation. I am quite honest in suggesting that such co-operation might be valuable, might be fruitful, might be for the benefit of the Dáil and of the country, might do a good deal to allay unpleasantness, to get rid of suspicion&mdash; which will sometimes arise no matter how one tries to drive it off&mdash;and leave the Dáil as representative an assembly as it has been in the past.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of a mandate has been emphasised.  I want to say that I do not claim or attempt to claim that we have any mandate for this.  I said, and I repeat, that a Government is entitled without having put the matter at a previous general election, or at any time before to the country, to bring in such legislation as it thinks right or proper to Parliament and seek to have it passed. Deputy Dr. Rowlette wishes to differentiate between legislation for the amendment of the Constitution and other legislation.  I am long enough in this House to know that some very important measures dealing with the <Col N="457" /> Constitution, and amending the Constitution in a very vital way, were brought in here for the last seven or eight years.  Appeals were then made to the Deputy's colleagues such as the Deputy has just now addressed to me. Were they listened to?  Was any attention paid to them?  I think these Bills were much more vital in the way in which they amended the Constitution than this amendment is likely to be considered by public opinion.  I am not saying that the Deputy's appeal is not a right and proper appeal or one that should not get consideration, but the Deputy and his colleagues evidently feel that this is a matter that touches them closely and that it brings home to them what a government may do and can do.  I suggest that it is something that Deputies Thrift and Alton ought to have thought of at an earlier date.  They ought not to have waited to have something come along here that strikes home to themselves in a particular way before these thoughts of further consideration and postponement entered their heads. When Deputy Dr. Rowlette speaks for his colleagues in their requests for co-operation, I do not say that these things are out of place now&mdash;not at all &mdash;and I welcome the type of speech made by Deputy Dr. Rowlette; but I say that it is a pity&mdash;and I am speaking now with particular reference to Deputy Thrift&mdash;that some thoughts of this kind did not enter his head before the Universities were touched.</P>

If the Deputy says that it did come up and that an answer was given, I do not say that it did not occur, but certainly I do not remember it.  I was a member of the third or fourth rank of the Executive&mdash;not the first&mdash;but I was one that was called upon when a number of the others were put into <Col N="458" /> prison.

Evidently it was not a very vital or live issue in 1921 or 1922.  They did not think very much about it, and there were very distinguished University men on the drafting of the Constitution. Some of the Deputy's own colleagues were concerned with it.  I mentioned on the Second Reading also that a Committee was set up by the Executive Council in 1926 to examine this question of University representation, <Col N="459" /> and some of the Deputy's own Front Bench colleagues were on that Executive.  The former Attorney-General, Mr. Costello, was a member of it.  I think Mr. Blythe was a member of it, also the former Ceann Comhairle and the late Mr. Kevin O'Higgins were members of it.  They recommended the abolition of Article 27 of the Constitution.</P>

      <P>It suits the Deputy to say so.  Does he mean that Deputy Costello, who was then Attorney-General, dare not talk for the Party? Does he suggest that the late Kevin O'Higgins dare not speak for the Party?  Individually and collectively they recommended that and they signed their names to that report.  It was not done, because the whole question was not brought up, but I take it that that would have been the opinion of the strongest men in the Party and that it would have been the opinion of the strongest man in the Cumann na nGaedheal Party at that time.  The late Kevin O'Higgins, Minister for Justice, was the strongest man in the Party at that time and would have got his way.  The others were strong men too.  I think that about that time Mr. J.J. Walsh was a Minister&mdash;whether for Posts and Telegraphs or not, I cannot say at the moment&mdash;and he was Chairman of the Party.  They were all leading lights of the Party and that was their decision&mdash;to abolish University representation&mdash;and it must have been a fairly live issue in their own Party at the time or they would not have come to that decision.</P>
      <P>Now, there is just one other point. Deputy McGilligan made light of the Convocation of the University.  He speaks for the University and is entitled, as he is its representative, to make light or otherwise of Convocation as he pleases.  That is his affair. But is it not true that a printed agenda of Convocation is sent out to every member?  My recollection is that it costs a good deal of money to do so.</P>

      <P>At last we have got some approach to argument in this matter, even though it is confused argument.  The strangest thing is the suggestion that, because a committee recommends a thing, it is, therefore, Party policy.  The argument is that the late Kevin O'Higgins recommended it and, since he was a strong man, it was, therefore, Party policy.  The records will show that the late Kevin O'Higgins, when introducing the Constitution and also at a later stage when this recommendation was brought in, said that he himself was personally against it, and said that if it was to be left to a free vote of the Executive Council it would be a free divided vote.  Where was there Party policy in the matter when the point of view of the late Kevin O'Higgins was stated there? Did that represent Party policy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.  The committee consisted of the late Kevin O'Higgins, Mr. Blythe, Mr. J.J. Walsh, Mr. John Costello, the ex-Attorney-General, the ex-Ceann Comhairle&mdash;did they not represent Party policy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring to the late Kevin O'Higgins speaking in the Constituent Assembly when the Constitution was being put through.  He then announced that he was against University representation.  Nevertheless, it was put in.  Why was it Party policy?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">

      <P>A free vote in the Dáil for representation in the Dáil as <Col N="462" /> against the Seanad?  The late Kevin O'Higgins was against it.  Apparently he did not rule Party policy in 1922.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>He did not rule Party policy, but because his signature is got to the recommendation of a committee, that is supposed to be Party policy.  Will the Minister tell us if his researches show that that report was ever considered by the Executive Council, and whether there was any division of opinion about it?  Will he tell us whether that report did not mainly concern a lot of the activities of the Seanad, whether there was not a view that the Seanad should be given more power and that, into that Assembly with more power, the University representatives should go? Is that a fair representation?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I read and debated the whole recommendation of the committee.  I know it was never brought before the Party.  It was discussed in the Executive Council and, there, there was a divided view.  The majority view was in favour of retaining University representation in the Dáil.  Again, the Minister has made the point that University representation was not provided for in the original Constitution.  It was in the original Constitution as it left the Dáil. It was not in it as the Constitution was introduced, and the Vice-President makes the point that it was put in by a free vote of the Dáil, and not by any Party.  Will the Vice-President revive his memory and ascertain how many persons spoke against University representation? Those who spoke against it, I think, were two Labour members, and one member of the Government Party. About three Deputies spoke against it, and one of these was a member of the Government Party.  Despite that, I do not think that the question was even put to a division.</P>

      <P>The principle of University representation was so definitely <Col N="463" /> accepted by the Dáil with a mixture of Parties, that there was no division. The Constitution was put to the country afterwards with that provision. Any argument I intended to use in this connection is, to a certain extent, useless because the Vice-President says frankly &ldquo;We have no mandate; we do not claim to have a mandate for this legislation.&rdquo;  He referred however, hesitatingly and rather lamely, to Convocation. We have this peculiar situation: there is a Constitution; there is an Article in that Constitution which permits changes to be made. Changes could be made by ordinary legislation within a specified period and, afterwards, by direct access to the people by way of Referendum.  Surely, if a mandate could ever be required it would be for a change of the Constitution. The Vice-President says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Not merely did we not ask the people anything about this but we are not pretending that we asked them anything about it.  We are not elevating this into a question on which we should seek a mandate.  We say distinctly and clearly that we have not got a mandate but that we are the Government and that we are going to do this without a mandate even though it is a Constitutional change.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>That is a different thing, but it is all the same from the Minister's point of view; it does not matter.  I am sorry Deputy Donnelly has left the House.  He made a serious contribution to the debate to-night. Does he really think that what he said <Col N="464" /> represents the facts?  I hold, again, that he admitted my contention that Sinn Féin had accepted this idea.  I am not trying to demean the Vice-President when I say that my memory never ran to the Vice-President's name in connection with the deputation which visited the men who, to our mind, as students, were supposed to represent Sinn Féin, but some people were visited.  Who they were, I cannot say at the moment.  A conversation with an individual would probably bring all the details back to memory.  Deputy Donnelly had no scruples about the matter.  He was ready to admit that that was the situation.  He purported to answer a point raised here arising out of this question.  He said that the old business of maligning people in respect to their past no longer cuts any ice.  The Minister for Finance left the House when the Deputy was speaking. I do not know whether that was deliberate or not.  Does he think that to liken people to Leonard McNally, Castlereagh, Pitt, Carey, and the Sham Squire cuts any ice?</P>

      <P>The particular type of scurrility to which Deputy Minch was referring comes best and most frequently from the Minister for Finance. Is it accepted here that that sort of thing does not cut any ice?  I have here the report of the Second Stage debate.  An argument was proceeding &mdash;and a good argument&mdash;on a particular point when Deputy Flinn thought fit to interrupt.  He intervened twice with the same comment.  The comment was: &ldquo;It is in the Lodge.&rdquo; That was addressed to Deputy Thrift.  Is not that the very thing that Deputy Minch was talking about?  That comment was made twice on 8th May, and Deputy Donnelly, with an air of sincerity, asked us to believe that that sort of thing was gone.  It dies hard in some people.  Those were the only two remarks Deputy Flinn contributed to <Col N="465" /> the whole debate.  He intervened twice with the same comment, reported on columns 599 and 600&mdash;&ldquo;It is in the Lodge.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Donnelly invited me to discuss the question of six votes and the number of persons behind them.  I do not think that could be made relevant to this discussion.  I hope that it will be possible to make it relevant on a later stage&mdash;the Fifth Stage.  I should be prepared to accept that challenge. There is a strong case to be made for six representatives in this House even on the register to which these six Deputies have to appeal to get returned.  I do not think that I would be allowed to put forward this argument now and I am going to reserve what I have to say until it will be relevant.  That matter was introduced and the answer came from Deputy Rowlette that that argument was not appropriate to a Bill to abolish University representation.  We could debate with great relevancy and cogency the cutting down of University representation but we are precluded from debating it now. <Col N="466" /> Although it is not relevant, they are driven back to that as an argument for the measure.  It was the only argument available&mdash;that University representation is over-loaded.  What we are at is a constitutional change to uproot the principle of university representation.  That is being done by a Government which, through the mouth of the Vice-President, says that they have no mandate for it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Thrift</NameTxt>
      <P>The most serious thing the Vice-President said, the thing that sticks in my mind&mdash;I do not think he fully meant it but it was said&mdash;was that it would have been a wise thing for us, in our generation, to have acted differently from what we did and not to vote as we did, regularly against Fianna Fáil.  I thank God that we did not do that, whatever we did.  We voted on each occasion as we thought best for the country and not for the good of any one Party.  That we stick to.  The Vice-President's words were a complete confirmation of the reason I put forward for the introduction of this Bill.</P>

      <P>The Unemployment Vote for this year consists of £350,000, of which £130,000 is a revote. The House will remember that last year there was a revote of £150,000.  In the previous year, somewhere about £2,000,000 was provided for the purpose of unemployment relief, and in working out the different uses to which that money could be put, we found that while there were certain uses to which it could be put immediately there were uses, and very valuable uses, such as Local Government work in drainage and sewerage, and water works and things of that kind, which required a very considerable amount of preparation, and that if any organised scheme of distribution as between different activities of the Unemployment Vote was to be carried on, it would be necessary to find a means of anticipating the inevitable time lag between the preparation of schemes and the carrying of them on, and anticipating in the sense of providing money in advance so that schemes could be started.  For instance, if you want to start a sewerage scheme, it is necessary for the Local Government Department, first, to have the scheme <Col N="469" /> and all its circumstances examined. Then it is necessary for them, having estimated the price of it, to make a definite and firm offer to the local authority as an inducement to the local authority to put up a certain considerable or inconsiderable proportion of the total amount required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For that reason, it is impossible to get local government sewerage and waterworks into a scheme on a definite time schedule unless you make financial preparation in advance and, therefore, in that year, when there was an amount like £2,000,000 for the purposes of unemployment relief, we decided to put aside in that form about £150,000 in works which had already been authorised but which could not be carried out.  The effect of that is that each year finances the preparation and time lag in the works of the next year and just as in the first year, it was financed to the extent of £150,000 which was not spent in the year for which it was originally voted but was spent in the succeeding year, so, too, in this and subsequent years, it will be necessary to use some of the actually voted money for the purpose of anticipating and making <Col N="470" /> preparation for the next year.  That had the defect in the first year of tying up £150,000 which otherwise might have been used upon works which could have been immediately done but which could not have been used, as I tell you, on more desirable works which did, in fact, require to be done, but as each year goes on you will see that the defect is only in the first year and that this carrying on of the re-voted money means that, in practice, in every year in the future, an amount equal to the amount actually voted will in fact be spent. This year it came down from £150,000 to £130,000 and next year we might become closer, to the extent that we might come to £100,000, but, in any case, it will be necessary for re-votes to be taken for the purpose of anticipating the necessary preparation.  I do not think that point has been understood and there has been some illusion as to the significance of that re-vote.  I move to report progress.</P>
    <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again to-morrow.</P>
