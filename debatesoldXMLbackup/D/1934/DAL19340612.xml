      <P>It is not the policy of the Department that workmen employed at State forests should lose a half day's pay or any pay if they attend Mass on Church holidays. At only a comparatively few forestry centres is any work done on Church holidays, and the instructions are that at those places where it is the custom to work on Church holidays reasonable time off is to be allowed for attendance at Mass, and that the men concerned are to arrange to make up the time taken, during the week or the preceding week.</P>
      <P>Some misunderstanding appears to have arisen at Kilworth Forest, to which centre I think the Deputy's question refers.  The men there preferred to abstain from work altogether for the day on the recent Church holidays. There was no reason why any pay should have been lost to them provided they were satisfied to work the extra time involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I to take it that the statement in the question is quite correct?  In view of the fact that these forestry workers are some distance from the churches, and having regard to the operation of this unpopular regulation, is it worth while stopping this half-day's pay from them?  Why not disregard the regulation?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Grady</NameTxt>
      <P>Where men are engaged on work of this kind the practice is that they are given reasonable facilities for attending Mass, on the understanding that they shall make up for the time lost at another period during the week.  The men at Kilworth have not been differently treated from those engaged in similar work all over the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The President, on this Estimate, has been charged with the complete mishandling of the work of his Department.  He has been charged with disturbing the general relations that existed between ourselves and Great Britain&mdash;a relationship arising out of which a very considerable amount of progress was being made, a relationship under which we had achieved, between this State and Great Britain, a position of absolute equality in status, one with another, and in no way subordinate one to another in any aspect of our external and internal affairs; the prejudicing and the making unsatisfactory of the economic arrangements between ourselves and Great Britain; the destruction of our farming industry; the stifling of our general industrial development and the burdening of this country with enormous sums of taxation. In reply to the general and detailed criticism directed against him during the discussion of this Estimate, the President simply states that he is a statesman, that he recognises the true aim of statesmanship, but that a statesman can only work in freedom, and the statesman at the head of our Government to-day has not a sufficient amount of freedom to enable him to work.  He stated on Friday last:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;...the true aim of statesmanship in this country or in any other country should be to secure for as many of the citizens as possible the highest standard of living, not material merely, but spiritual as well.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>And again:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;...that it is only in freedom, through the freedom of the nation, that it is possible for statesmanship to effect its aims in regard to the people.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies opposite, as well as the people of the country to whom the President <Col N="14" /> addressed himself, know very well the condition of affairs that existed in this country about 1918.  They know that the same tyranny that had dominated and practically destroyed both the material and the spiritual welfare of the people was so entrenched here that as recently as 1918 they threatened to take the whole manhood of this country by force to send them to the battlefields of Europe to fight.  Fight for what?  To fight for the material interests of the country that had been wiping its feet in this country for so many generations.  Not only that, but three years later I saw as big a machinery of tyranny as that Government had ever employed in this country trampling the men, the women and the children from one end to the other of the country in an attempt to destroy the spirit of its people and destroy any material interest they might have in order to crush out this nation.  Then a couple of years after that Deputies opposite, as well as the people of this country, saw pass from the face of the country every vestige of that tyranny.</P>

      <P>And they will not tell you to-day how it passed.  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs is not going to get up here and say that the people of Roscommon rose in their might and, with their arms, put the R.I.C. and the British military shipping out of the port of Dublin. Who took the English Government out of Dublin Castle and enabled the people to set up their own Parliament? Deputy Corry will not say the people of Cork did it.  They helped; young men in every part of this country helped to bring about the circumstances when the British military were shipped out of the port of Dublin and when our people had the opportunity put into their hands of <Col N="15" /> setting up their own legislature and taking over control of their own country.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>They are not gone out of it because the President wants some excuse for not being able to bring about the material wellbeing of this country, for not developing the spiritual welfare of the country that he talks so much about.  However it came about, there did pass providentially from this country the terror and the tyranny and the alien laws that our people had suffered under for generations until 1922.  The Minister for Local Government visited Canada in 1932 and when leaving Canada he said at the final meeting there:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Nothing can ever make us forget our debt to Canada and whatever changes the future may bring about one very certain result of the conferences as far as the delegation of the Irish Free State is concerned is a determination to do everything in our power to cement more closely the bonds of friendship between the Irish and the Canadian people.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>What was the debt that the Vice-President was thanking the Canadian people for?  Was it that they had stood him a couple of luncheons or dinners or had enabled him to attend at a few State functions or a few balls?  What was the debt?  Was it that he had made a satisfactory trade agreement with them?  We know it was not, because our trade with Canada has suffered since.  But we here on these benches have an appreciation of what our debt to Canada is and the Vice-President, if he were speaking his mind, would know something about it too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the time we had the old tyranny attempting to conscript our people in 1918, at the time when we had the old <Col N="16" /> tyranny trampling our people under the feet of the Black-and-Tans in 1920-1921, there was rising up in the world a spirit of nationality.  Young nations were growing up throughout the world, young nations, many of them having their foundations inspired by a spirit of freedom, a spirit of courage and a spirit of determination brought to these countries by the young men and women and the old men and old women who were forced out of our country by the tyranny that ruled in it up to then. Canada was rising as a young nation during the war years; so also were Australia, New Zealand and South Africa.  Part of the providential circumstances that enabled us to get rid of the tyranny that trampled this country under its feet for so many generations was the rise of these young nations.  When we swept from the face of this country the terror and the disgrace of war made upon it by Great Britain and when we sat down in council with Great Britain to argue out the problems that then remained between us, we found that, having been providentially assisted in our progress to the council table to argue out our problems with Britain, we had the representatives of the rising nation of Canada on our right hand side, South Africa on our left hand side, Australia in front and New Zealand beside them.  And when, as Collins truly foresaw and foretold, we were round that council table we were arguing their fight for nationality as well as our own and we had their assistance in arguing our fight.  So that after the few years of negotiation and argument had passed, we found that, together, we had reduced Great Britain to a state of declaring and administering her own laws; that we were co-equal in status with them, as there was also co-equality between them and ourselves&mdash;Canada, Australia, South Africa and New Zealand. There was no subordination in any one towards any other in the aspect of their internal affairs.</P>
    <P>Then came a time to discuss our economics when the Vice-President and the Minister for Industry and Commerce went to Canada.  When they came home from Canada the Vice-President told us that they had laid <Col N="17" /> the foundations of an agreement with Great Britain, but nothing has been raised upon these foundations; he praised Canada for the debt we owed Canada.  So well he might, but the only tragedy is that he did not praise Canada for the debt that we owed them in different circumstances.  The people of this country, by their efforts, and by the efforts and the work of their leaders, put the President into the position in which he is, as head of the Executive Council here, with sovereign powers over all this State of the Twenty-Six Counties.  It would be better still if we had more intelligence shown on the part of other members of this House even this year in regard to these matters if not as long ago as 1922.  At any rate, such as it is, he has all the resources of this State of Twenty-Six Counties at his command as a result of their efforts and of their work.</P>
    <P>He sat as President over the League of Nations Assembly, a year or two ago, and he presided in that position in the name of this State.  It is an assembly consisting of all the biggest nations in the world.  Then he comes here, and when challenged to give details of his administration here, and the result of his policy here, he says: &ldquo;I am not a politician, I belong to the statesman class, and I can only work in a free state.&rdquo; It would have been a poor day for this country if its leaders in the past had been that class of statesman or politician. If they had been, he would not have been President of the Executive Council in this country to-day and he would not have been able to occupy the privileged and powerful position that this people placed him in as President of the League of Nations.  He would never have occupied that position if there had not been different leaders from him in the past.  He tells us now that our agriculture is destroyed and depression falling upon the whole spirit of our people.  But he tells us that what is really wrong is the absence of freedom.  He tells us that this country is threatened by invasion in the same way as it was in the past. He tells us that the British military <Col N="18" /> are in our ports, that threats of war are made against our people; that we are in danger of being dragged into foreign wars, and that we are not allowed to pursue our foreign development without Britain taking steps that will prevent our future agricultural or industrial development.  These bogeys are paraded before the eyes of our people for the purpose of blinding them exactly to what has happened in this country; for the purpose of preventing them raising their heads in the manner that the manhood of the Irish people did in the past when they followed leaders who would not be hindered from going ahead with their work by any bogeys or threat of trade interruption.  Some of our old stories contain many objects with morals for our people.  There was one thing enshrined in our country but historians never sought traces of it in our people.</P>
    <P>When Alexander was going into the East on one occasion on his campaigns he found occasion to terrorise people living near the rock of Narsinga. But when his policy necessitated it he withdrew his army but the people of the villages, hearing horns blowing in the Castle in the morning and in the evening, still hung their heads in terror.  They were afraid to look out on the mountains even when the horns did not blow lest they should start again.  When the young people did not understand why they could not look over their mountains and walk over them the people said to them: &ldquo;Alexander is on the mountains with his army.  The horns tell us he is there.&rdquo;  But the boys went up to the mountain and they found big stones with holes in them.  Birds' nests were built in the holes and when the nests were taken out and the wind blew through the holes they sounded like the blowing of horns.  That was the position of President de Valera in 1922, that there were bogeys on the mountains in our country.  But some of the birds' nests were taken out of the rocks since 1922, and it is an astounding thing that we should have young men in our country to-day and that, sitting behind the President and Vice-President, we should find Deputies <Col N="19" /> capable of listening to the particular kind of stuff that is preached to them about these bogeys.  What is the freedom that is lacking to a man who can sit as President of the Executive Council here, and who can take from the pockets of the people of this country the amount of additional money that he has taken out of their pockets? What is lacking in freedom to a man who can go and preside over an assembly like the League of Nations in Geneva, as President of this State, but who will come back and say that the reason why he cannot get on with the work in this country is because of the internal affairs of this country and talks of war and the British sitting round our shores, and says that until we get rid of them the people of this country are not capable of getting on with their work?  As I say, it is astounding that we have in this country, at this hour, people who can take that kind of stuff from the President in the way that Deputies opposite take it.  No wonder then that we have the situation that we have in this country, and that we have people who can be ruthless in the matter of taxation, but regardless of the interests of the people who provide the foundations of our prosperity, the farmers.  In these circumstances it is no wonder that we have the conditions we have.  But would the President forget his bogeys for a bit and tell us exactly what he wants to do in this country.  The position of the country is that we get generalities in philosophy from the President, descriptive of the dangers and difficulties that lie around our people, but not one clear scrap of description as to what he wants to do with the people of this country or how he wants to do it.</P>
    <P>We would have no progress in this country, no development of economic life and no development of social life if our leaders in the past talked airily of Irish freedom and did nothing to objectivise it in any way or took the steps which were from day to day necessary to progress along the path both to freedom and economic development here.  The President does not accept the step-by-step idea.  The person in our country's history, one <Col N="20" /> whose life has left the biggest tradition as builder and whose name is synonymous with building had as his motto &ldquo;cloch ar dha cloich agus dha cloich ar aon cloch,&rdquo; or &ldquo;one stone on two stones and two stones on one stone.&rdquo;  He was the man who had the reputation for shortening the road with song and story-telling.  That was the great builder, the Gobán Sáor. The President is providing the country with a long-drawn-out agony of waiting for one big leap to victory, and in the days while they are waiting he is talking about peace for the people of this country.  In October last he told a meeting at Ballaghaderreen, &ldquo;I do not say that the goal will be easily reached but we have already reached things that our forefathers thought difficult.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What is the goal?  The President is sitting in a position and occupying a position to-day in which he has acquired all the resources of men and all the resources of money and all the power of law in his own hands.  And what progress are we making?  His excuse is that the &ldquo;aim of the Opposition was to break down the morale of the people and that they wanted to organise so that they would be in a position to seize power by force if they got a chance.&rdquo;  Truth! Truth in the News! Truth in the President's mouth! Every line of this on its face shows that it is untrue. He cannot point to a single section of the people of this country except a bit of his own tail that would show that in working their salvation, political or economic or in any other way, there is anybody in this country who wants to seize from the people power by force, except, as I have already said, a small section amongst his own tail and in respect of that we know from the speech of the Minister for Justice the other day that that situation is well in hand.  Where does the President stand?  The President told us in his address to the Ard-Fheis at the Mansion House on the 9th November last &ldquo;some people say we have accepted the Treaty.  Like soldiers we have appreciated the position.  We have made our calculations as to how the nation, from the position in which <Col N="21" /> we are now is going to advance.  We have accepted nothing.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The President has accepted something. He has accepted the power.  He has accepted the control of the resources of the nation and he has accepted the emoluments of his position and of his office in Government Buildings.  He has accepted all that but he has not accepted the responsibilities of the position and, as behind his old wall of glass, he takes his ground on the position and has driven the unfortunate farmers into the fight in front without telling them in any way what they are to fight for and what is the goal.  &ldquo;In one of my first dispatches to Mr. Thomas,&rdquo; he tells us, &ldquo;I pointed out that the Treaty was forced upon the Irish people and could not be accepted as having any moral value.  According to the strength of the people we propose to advance so as to secure for our people everything that is theirs.&rdquo;  What are the things to which we are going to advance?  How are we going to advance to them?  The President gives his own answer.  He went on to refer to the economic war and said that &ldquo;&lsquo;war&rsquo; was an unfortunate word&rdquo; because it brought to the people's mind a line of action which was not going to win the fight.  Many people did not understand the line they were pursuing.  He put it to them that if a city were besieged with a strong besieging party outside with a policy of starving the people into surrender it might be a good policy to take the people from manning the walls to producing food.  The man who would help in winning this war would be the one who could show them how to change their economy.  If they meant to win this fight they had got to put petty things aside; to lose would be disaster to the nation.&rdquo;  The man who would help in winning this war would be the one who could show them how to change their economy!! And so the President is sitting down inside his screen protection wall and the people throughout the country are suffering in this economic war in which he tells them he fired the first shot and he tells them now &ldquo;no surrender.&rdquo;&ldquo;All we want&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;is the man who will <Col N="22" /> help in winning this war by changing their economy.&rdquo;  Are we then in the position that the President&mdash;standing as far as this State is concerned of being co-equal in status with Great Britain, in no way subordinate in any way or in any aspect of our internal or external affairs&mdash;knows well that he is not going to look the British straight in the eyes, and is not going to sit down around the Council table that others of our people have provided for him?  What are the difficulties with Great Britain and what agreements can be come to to secure a solution of those difficulties?  In facing up to a situation like that, not only has the President power, in terms of the man power of this country, but of the Truceliers of 1921, and he has even the people who threw their influence against us when we were arguing for constitutional co-equality with Britain in 1921.  He has people then on the British side to help in negotiations with Britain, people who were against us in 1921 and he has with him all the people who were with us&mdash;the representatives of the rising nations of Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa.</P>
    <P>Consider how progress was made in the past.  Standish O'Grady in one of his essays used to liken the position of the Irish in the struggle with Britain under the old régime to that of a chessplayer playing chess with a veiled player, and every time when the veiled player's king was in danger of being mated, his hand swept all the pieces off the board so that there could be no successful conclusion to his adversary's game.  The man whom the President repudiated in 1922 has provided a board that no hand can sweep the pieces off, and with sound argument, logical position and moral strength can find their true places there untouched by force.  Are we to have it that, with that provided, the President is not going to sit down to list our difficulties and to argue them out?  As I say, some of the British themselves who were against us when we were arguing towards constitutional co-equality are with the President and his colleagues now and tell them how the argument was carried on in the old days.  I think that the President and his associates <Col N="23" /> had something to do with the recent publication of a certain pamphlet dealing with the Anglo-Irish dispute, with an introduction by Henry Harrison and some letters by Mr. Berriedale Keith. On page 14 of the pamphlet Mr. Keith says in one of his letters:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In the Free State, Mr. Cosgrave, with the co-operation of successive British Governments, and most notably of Mr. Thomas, deprived the King of every vestige of legal influence and all legal power. There is not an act of external or internal affairs on which His Majesty can do otherwise than as bidden by the Executive Council of the State. He cannot refuse advice, he cannot dismiss a Ministry with a majority in the Dáil.  All his functions, now of the most limited kind in internal matters under the Constitution, are performed by a servant of the Ministry, who could not legally receive or obey an instruction from the King.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On page 16 of the same pamphlet Mr. Keith again writes:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Despite these facts, Mr. Thomas in his dispatch, of December 5, wrote: &lsquo;The period which elapsed between 1921 and 1932 was marked by the progressive development of friendly relations and co-operation between the two countries&rsquo;.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Mr. Keith on page 15 is of opinion that:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;What is urgently needed is an effort by all parties in the country, with the aid of the Dominions, to work out a position which may preserve unity in essentials with the gratification of Irish aspirations, however needless we here may think them.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We want to know from the President: does he accept the position that this State stands a co-equal in status with Great Britain, that we are in no way subordinate to Great Britain in any aspect of our affairs, and has he Irish manliness enough, with that ground under his feet, to go and argue out the position, or is he going to sulk behind the old wall of glass and leave the people to go down in the degradation of spirit and the material misery that <Col N="24" /> they are going down in day by day? The head of this State has to disseminate throughout the country a cloud of the most appalling falsehoods that it is possible to have uttered in order to cover up the situation that is here, to distract the attention of our people, and to serve out that kind of excuse for his inability not only to carry out the things he promised but to prevent the economic condition of the people worsening.</P>
    <P>You have an example of what the President's line is when he deals with the question of partition.  In August of last year, when speaking to a British journalist on the question of partition, he said that</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Any proposition must come from Britain or from Northern Ireland, but that we cannot take any practical steps ourselves.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Apparently in no matter can the President take any practical steps himself. He must sit down in the quiet and security of his own position and let the people outside suffer.  This country wants to have its economic condition improved.  With our own Legislature which Davis, whom the President now begins to quote, characterised as &ldquo;the foundation of all freedom and the foundation of all power,&rdquo; we want to use it to improve both the industrial and the agricultural condition of our people.  To discuss only the material side, the President knows that we found this country in this position: that the market we had of necessity in Great Britain for our agricultural produce was three times the market that our farmers had here.  The Minister for Finance rather corrects Deputy Fitzgerald for his exaggerating the importance of the agricultural position in this country.  He took him to task over certain figures of his the other night.  The Minister for Finance can find out for himself if he refers to the Official Reports, page 786 of volume 29, for April 24, 1929.  He will find that Fianna Fáil then held a different opinion with regard to the importance of the agricultural position of the country, because the President on that occasion said, when speaking in a debate on a Financial Resolution:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="25" />&ldquo;We know, of course, that agriculture is our principal industry and that seven out of every nine engaged on productive industries are engaged on the land; also that two-thirds of the wealth of the country is produced from agriculture, and, moreover, that the greater part of the remaining one-third is produced from industries ancillary to farming, such as baconcuring, butter-making, brewing, distilling, and so forth.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is to say, that seven out of nine were engaged on agriculture with an external market three times the market that we had here arising out of the historical circumstances affecting the country in which it was governed from Great Britain.  It was in circumstances like those that the President, again speaking to an English journalist, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We do not ask for any special advantages.  We do not expect them any more than any other country, France or Denmark for example, would.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We do demand more from Great Britain than Denmark or France or any other country in the world is entitled to demand, and we believe that the way that demand can be made effective is to talk straight into the faces of British Ministers and British representatives. It is utterly impossible to assume in any way the conception of his responsibilities that the President has when he would make a statement like that.</P>
    <P>The President, by his general action, has been driven to take up the attitude that there is not any longer a British market, while a very big publicity campaign is being developed by his Press around the position between New Zealand and Great Britain.  An attempt is being made to persuade the people of this country that even countries as dear to the heart of Great Britain as New Zealand cannot get their goods on to the British market to-day.  There is not a single country in the British Commonwealth that, as a result of the Ottawa Conference, has not increased the benefits it previously derived from the British market.  New Zealand, that the President is using as a subject for propaganda <Col N="26" /> to show that there is no British market, increased the value of its exports in the first four months of 1934, as compared with the first four months of 1932, between the Ottawa Conference year, from £11,530,000 to £12,536,000; increased the total amount of its exports to Great Britain by £1,000,000, and increased its favourable balance of trade when dealing with Great Britain by £1,866,000. Canada increased its exports to the British market from £8,359,000 to £10,673,000 in the same four months. The total increase of trade was £2,312,000 and the total increase in its favourable trade balance was £1,820,000.  Australia increased its exports to Great Britain for the same period of four months from £13,775,000 to £15,822,000.  Its total exports to Great Britain were increased in value by £1,647,000, and the increase in its favourable trade balance with Great Britain was £1,075,000.  In the case of South Africa that country increased its exports to Great Britain from £4,047,000 to £4,157,000.  Its trade in the reverse direction increased from £4,142,000 to £6,833,000.  As between the two the total trade was increased from £8,500,000 to £11,000,000.</P>
    <P>As far as one of the principal items in which this country is interested in the British market, is concerned, so far from the British market being gone, the imports of meat to that market for the first four months of 1932 were valued at £26,783,000; in 1933, £25,375,000; and in 1934, £26,846,000.  That was what the meat imports to Great Britain&mdash;into a vanishing market&mdash;represented in the first four months of this year&mdash;the market that has vanished for us.</P>

      <P>I know the Deputy would like me to tell him a lot now which would take me off this important subject.  If the Deputy has any question to ask me I will be very glad to meet him.  I will have a few little things to tell him about the land annuities.  This vanishing British market, in the first four months of this year, took meat value for £26,000,000. What did the imports from this great agricultural country, the Irish Free State, represent?  £620,000.  Why? Because the market had vanished! It was not there!</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnDonnelly" hpid="Mr. Donnelly Mr. Donnelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Fresh meat?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The tastes of the people had changed and there was no market! And because we are told a market for meat, value £26,000,000, is no market at all, we have to change our economy.  The change in economy that we want here is a change of understanding between ourselves and the British; a change to secure that we will send meat value for more than £620,000 to a market worth £26,000,000.  Where a fall has taken place has been in live animals.  If Deputy Donnelly has taken an interest in the British market, he will understand that, as far as meat is concerned, the fight which is going on in Great Britain is a fight to safeguard the fresh meat trade against the other meat trade.  Just as our fight for nationality and sovereign status was a fight for Canada, for Australia and for South Africa, the fight of British farmers for a decent market for their fresh meat is a fight that is our fight. There was no necessity in the world, if the Vice-President and the Ministers at Ottawa in a reasonable spirit had tucked their feet in under the same table with British Ministers, why the word &ldquo;quota&rdquo; should be mentioned either in connection with our live animal trade or our fresh meat trade. <Col N="28" /> I do not believe there was any necessity why it should be mentioned in trade between our people and Great Britain.</P>
      <P>If there is a falling off in our trade with Great Britain it is in our fresh meat trade.  Whereas the exports in 1932 were value for £4,286,000, in 1934 they were only value for £1,672,000. There is not a Fianna Fáil Deputy who could argue before any intelligent group of people that there was any necessity for that fall, or that there would be that fall if Irish Ministers had discussed their affairs with British Ministers in the proper way, and had fought the fight of the Irish farmers for their fresh meat trade, in the same way as we fought for our sovereign status; fighting thereby for Canada, Australia and South Africa, making them people to whom we owe a mutual debt.  At the end of this month the meat agreements made at Ottawa cease.  Will the President tell us what he is doing to restore the position by which we may get even £4,286,000 for our live animal trade or for our fresh meat trade with Great Britain, in the first four months of the year, as we got for the first four months of 1932?  Is it the position that he can do nothing practical?  Is it the position that he is not free?  He has all the freedom that any leader of his people could have, or could want, to discuss that question.  It is because he accepts an inferior position, in his own mind, because he will not step on the ground prepared for him by us, and by the people who went before us, the ground of absolute equality with Ministers in Great Britain, that he runs away from that position as the Vice-President and the Ministers ran away from Ottawa.  Meantime, our farmers must suffer loss of their capital, must suffer a loss of income with which to pay agricultural labourers, from which our towns also got their income, and from which Irish industries would get capital in the free and favourable circumstances that we now have, when a native Government could build up industry.  We want to know from the President what he is going to do about the meat agreements with Great Britain at the end of this month?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He tells us there is a threat of war <Col N="29" /> over us, that Britain may declare war on us if we develop our constitutional position, and that we may be dragged into war because the British hold certain maintenance parties in certain of our ports.  The President can do practically nothing about it.  He can sit down in his pleasant isolation behind his wall of glass and wait for the war to come.  What kind of attempt to prevent war, either with the British or to prevent our being dragged into war with other nations because Britain goes to war with them, is the preparation the President is making now?  The threat of war is the biggest bogey that the President has in his whole stock but if there is any threat of war, in other circumstances, arising out of our constitutional position or arising out of anything connected with the unity of our country&mdash;any threat of war on the part of Britain against us&mdash;is there any safer place to argue that than at a table where Ministers have representatives of Canada, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand all around them, a place where the position of absolute constitutional equality of status is definitely settled and agreed? If the President believed that there was the slightest threat of war, arising from our relations with Great Britain, he could have the matter discussed at such an assembly.  If circumstances compel him to leave that council chamber, is he not in a better position then to appeal to the world, if he wants to appeal to the world, when the other nations have seen that he has done his best to secure a settlement inside that council chamber?</P>
    <P>In the same way, if there is any danger of this country getting involved in an outside war by reason of Great Britain being involved in that war, has he any better method to fight that threat or, at any rate, to get more clear about it, than to sit in with the representatives of the other members of the Commonwealth and argue that under the Constitution that has been given him here, this country can only be brought into a war by the vote of its own Parliament?  If by any misfortune, absurd to think about, we were in danger of being entangled with any other country would the President's <Col N="30" /> voice be stronger or would the voice of any leader here be stronger, sitting here alone, than if he spoke at the council chamber of all the nations of the British Commonwealth saying: &ldquo;I am not with you in this&rdquo;?  If he thinks there is a single bit of danger in his bogey of war, the President is deserting and betraying the interests of his people in present circumstances by the attitude he has taken up with regard to Great Britain and the other members of the Commonwealth.</P>
    <P>We want to be freed from our financial burdens too and the President has adopted a line of his own.  He took that line against the advice of hundreds of thousands of his countrymen.  He embarked on that line in the dark and, because he finds himself in circumstances in which he would persuade us he never expected himself to be, and in which he says he never would have been but for the action of the Opposition, he endeavours to persuade his own followers, and people throughout the country, that Britain would never have minded at all his withholding the land annuities if they had not been encouraged by the Opposition to take an aggressive line.  At any rate, he has taken a certain line and that line is such that the British are getting every halfpenny out of our people that the President says he does not want to pay to them.  He is withholding the land annuities and he has entered the world arena and, as it were, championed the cause of the United States against Great Britain in connection with the war debts.  Instead of sitting in as a member of the Commonwealth, instead of sitting in his place in Geneva when he was President of the Assembly there or even as a member there arguing&mdash; because this is accepted throughout the world practically, that some radical change must be made in respect of international debts&mdash;instead of sitting in and arguing that in general world interests and ultimately in the interests of his own country, his Press and his voice have been thrown into the arena to argue that all nations must pay their debts and that Great Britain particularly must pay every halfpenny of the debt she owes to the United States. The President has played a most <Col N="31" /> unworthy part, as a member of the League of Nations, in the attitude he has taken up in this matter.  He has taken up a particular attitude as between Great Britain and the United States entirely in a party spirit.</P>
    <P>Our country again is a member of the Commonwealth of Nations.  Australia owes Great Britain about £79,000,000 war debts, and she has not paid a halfpenny in respect of it in the last few years.  New Zealand owes the British Government £26,000,000.  I do not think it matters to the British Government whether the money which Australia owes it is war debts or any other kind of debts, but if I were arguing that the amount which this country is asked to pay to Great Britain is too much, I would like to argue that round the kind of table that our Ministers found in Ottawa, with an Australian representative on my right and a New Zealand representative on my left.  I think it would be a more profitable way to argue the case than to argue it in the way in which the President is now arguing it&mdash;losing every halfpenny of the money that Britain is seeking to recover, and at the same time inflicting an appalling loss not only on our agriculturists but on the people of the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>Deputy Donnelly intervened, rather unnecessarily, I think, on the question of the land annuities, and I shall just digress for a moment to answer the point that the Deputy made.  The Deputy put forward the charge that Deputy Cosgrave was the first person to get the Dáil to agree to withholding the land annuities, and Deputy Cosgrave denied that.  On the 16th May last, the Deputy and Deputy Cosgrave had a certain amount of discussion, as reported in column 1003 of the Debates. The Deputy argued that clause 5 of these proposals, dealing with local government, was passed by the Dáil. &ldquo;The entire report,&rdquo; said Deputy Donnelly, &ldquo;went through the Dáil <i>nem. con.</i> proposed by you.&rdquo;  Deputy Cosgrave then stated:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I have here the Official Report of the minutes, and on page 223, as I have said, clause 5 was referred to <Col N="32" /> the Finance Department for consideration. The proposals were in clause 5.  That was the clause for the collection of revenue, and they were referred to the Finance Department for consideration.  They were not adopted.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>And the Deputy still held to his statement that they were adopted <i>nem. con.,</i> on the proposition of Deputy Cosgrave, and that Deputy Cosgrave now found himself in a tight corner.  Well, whatever has to be said about the land annuities ought to be said on the merits of the case.  To attempt, however, to go back to 1921 or 1920 in the matter is simply running away from the discussion of the Land Commission annuities question in 1934, but if we do go back to 1920 we ought not to make false statements.</P>

      <P>Then there was a certain discussion on the matter, and, coming down to page 221, we read:</P>

      <P>&ldquo;While the British were in occupation of this country and fighting against us very bitterly, a proposition was put up to me many times that we should retort by not paying land annuities.  I declined to agree to that policy on the plea that it was killing the credit of the nation, that even though the English were our enemies, the Irish people had contracted to borrow a certain sum of money on certain terms, and that they should fulfil the terms of that contract.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>That is, about five months after the Heads of the Working Arrangements for Implementing the Treaty had been signed by the representatives of the Provisional Government.  They were published afterwards in 1923, and on page 9, as part of the Agreement, it is stated:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That, pending a definite arrangement for capitalisation, the Irish Government be responsible for the recovery of payments due in respect of local loans and the collection of Land Purchase Annuities, and for paying over the proceeds to the British Exchequer, together with an amount equal to certain expenditure still borne on the British Votes or charged on the Consolidated Fund of the United Kingdom (e.g., pensions of civil servants, payments for any agency services and salaries of judges).&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Five months after that, we had the man who was Minister for Agriculture in the old Dáil Cabinet, and who was, no doubt, at that particular time, shadow Minister of the Opposition Cabinet, making the statement that I have quoted in respect of the old attitude of the Minister for Agriculture in the Dáil to the question of the land annuities.</P>

      <P>The Deputy already has dealt with this matter on three occasions in the House, and it is for the purpose of trying to get the Deputy to do things more consistently that I am refusing to give way to him at the present time.  I say that the thing of shreds and patches which the President held up here on Friday last is a thing which saved this country from what he considered was a debt that would cost this country £19,000,000 a year&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Again, the President has no practical proposals for settling our difficulties financially with Great Britain.  We tell him that we have built up the machinery for him and that he can sit down at a particular table, undisturbed by force or threats of any kind, and can have there the assistance of the representatives of Australia, who owe a similar debt, however contracted, to that which we owe ourselves, and of the representatives of New Zealand, who owe a debt of approximately one-third of the debt we owe at the present time.  If the integrity and the unity of the nation have to be re-established, how does the Minister think he is going to bring that about except by sitting down around the same council table?  As I said, the policy of the President with regard to the unity of our country is indicated in a statement made to the representative of a cross-Channel paper and reported on 3rd August, 1932.  In that statement the President said: &ldquo;We cannot take any practical steps ourselves.&rdquo; No practical steps can be taken to achieve unity.  No practical steps can be taken to settle our financial difficulties. No practical steps can be taken to deal with our trade difficulties with Great Britain.  Why?  Because we have leaders in Ireland to-day who will not lead.  They are not cast in the traditional mould of Irish leadership.  They are not cast in the mould to which I referred before as being the traditional mould, the mould indicated in Collins's statement on 19th December, 1921, when, dealing with his journey to England, he said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="37" />&ldquo;I knew, when I was going over there, that I was being placed in a position that I could not reconcile and that could not, in the public mind, be reconciled with what they thought I stood for, no matter what we brought back&mdash;and if we brought back the recognition of the Republic &mdash;but I knew that the English would make a greater effort if I were there than they would if I were not there, and I didn't care if my popularity was sacrificed or not.  I should have been unfair to my own country if I did not go there.  Members of the Dáil remember that I protested against being selected.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Collins led.  Being an Irish leader, he accepted the responsibility and incurred the danger of Irish leadership. So did O'Connell.  He left it open to any type of small boy to disparage his name as an Irish nationalist in his day. Redmond did the same in his time.  He pursued a line of policy that he thought was right and led, with his political reputation gone as far as a very considerable amount of propaganda and public opinion at that time went.  Pearse gave his life.  An Irish leader, with a particular line of thought, he was able to stand on a platform with John Redmond in 1912 and tell the people who did not want to accept the proposals Redmond was dealing with then, that it would be magnificent to refuse them but it would not be war.  Four years later, when Pearse saw that he was not achieving what he wanted to achieve in the way he was working, he gave his life.  He pursued the line of policy that he thought was right and the line of policy that he thought would, ultimately, bring freedom and material and spiritual betterment to his people.  He did not stick his heels in an office and say: &ldquo;I am a statesman and statesmanship can only bear fruit in freedom.&rdquo;  What would be our present political position if leaders in the past had taken up that attitude?  Griffith gave his life, working laboriously to the last moment.  He did not complain that he had not freedom to work.  Collins gave his life. Cosgrave was satisfied to pursue the <Col N="38" /> line of policy he pursued and to suffer any shattering of his political reputation which it might involve.  He acted the part of the traditional Irish leader, entered into danger and was prepared to sacrifice his life, his liberty or his political reputation doing what he thought was the right thing to do as an Irish leader.  That is why we have the President and his Ministers in the position in which they are.  That work was done in the past in the traditional spirit of Irish leadership.</P>
    <P>Our country is being destroyed to-day, both in spirit and materially, because it is looking to leaders to lead and the leaders are not leading.  Then we have the stirring up of every mob element in the country and the setting of every unintelligent element in the country against the political Opposition because they dare stand on platforms made free by the efforts of the Irish people, because they dare discuss Irish political matters and dare point out the dangers and disasters into which the country is running.  Surely, there is not a Deputy on the opposite side who expects the people to sit down quietly and watch their trade being ruined and their money robbed under the leadership that obtains to-day. Their country was given sovereign power over all its resources.  It has a Parliament here which is sovereign in respect of everything in which the people have a practical or spiritual interest.  Are the people expected to sit down and watch these resources being frittered away in the way in which the present Government are frittering them?  Deputies on the opposite side will have to make up their mind on this matter.  The responsibility is on top of every one of them.  If they are being led into chaos and disaster, both materially and spiritually, it is their own futility, their own blindness, their own cowardice that is responsible for it. The President may carry their political cross for a few more months, but the time will come when they themselves will have to carry their political cross. The cross they will have to carry will be a heavy one.  The sooner they get more closely into touch with conditions in their constituencies and the sooner <Col N="39" /> they tell the President they do not see that man on the horizon who is going to change our whole economic structure, the sooner the President will be driven to turn round and use the machinery, resources and opportunities which he has for doing good, materially and spiritually, for the people of this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.M. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am venturing to intervene for a few moments in this debate because, so far as I can observe, it is open to Deputies in this debate to discuss anything from China to Peru or from Greenland's icy mountains to India's coral strands. Therefore, I hope I may be able to say a few words without undergoing my ordinary experience of being pulled up for saying something out of order.  A supercilious, a cynical and an ultra-patriotic Parliamentary Secretary&mdash;I refer, in all humility, to Deputy Hugo Flinn&mdash;in the course of his remarks the other day suggested that anybody who did not see eye to eye with his supreme highness was cursed with an inferiority complex. At the risk of being charged with this great deficiency, I beg to express my disagreement with a great many of the things which he said in the course of his argument.  There are two things that seem to me to emerge from this debate and which indicate, to my untutored mind, the views of the Government.  One is that anybody who, no matter how honestly or sincerely, disagrees with or attempts to criticise the President or any of his works, pomps or miracles is a traitor who deserves to be sent to Siberia or consigned to a felon's grave.  The second view of the Government reminds me of Cromwell's famous, or infamous, if you wish, letter to the people of New Ross in the course of which he said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;As for liberty of conscience, I meddle with no man's conscience but if by liberty of conscience you mean the right to exercise the Mass, be assured that where the Parliament of England has power that will not be allowed.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The attitude of the Government is similar.  They declare that they do <Col N="40" /> not interfere with freedom of speech or liberty of action within the law, but if anybody has the temerity, in any district in which they have power, to tell some home truths about the Government, we know what happens. We know how meetings have been interfered with; we know how they have been broken up; and we know how disorder and disturbance have been allowed to stalk the land unchallenged and unchecked.  I do not say that the policy of the present Government has been barren of some good results.  I do not even aver that it is the first Government that secured or stole into office by false promises, but I do assert that its policy has been marked and marred by foolish and fatuous experiments and by wild and uneconomic expedients and I further assert that it has shamelessly and signally failed to carry out its unambiguous promises to the people, not only at the last election but at the election previously.  I am not going to discuss the various matters which already have been debated at full length and in all their phases by several members of the House&mdash;the annuities question, the bounties, the tariff policy, unemployment, doles, and other questions which are, undoubtedly, of supreme importance to the people, but which, as I have said, have been already threshed out fully in this House.</P>
    <P>With regard to the establishment of a republic, which seems to be the dream of some idealists in this House, let me say that, personally, on a number of logical grounds, I am in favour of the republican form of government if anybody will tell me how it is going to be established in the country.  I think it has been pointed out again and again by Deputy MacDermot that there is nothing to prevent the present Government from declaring a republic at the present moment if they wish to do so and if they honestly believe in their own professions, but there is no good in anybody in this House appealing to Gaelic history for any sanction for a republic, because it is an ideal totally foreign to the Gael and entirely alien from their thoughts and from their aspirations.  Any republicanism there is has filtered or been <Col N="41" /> imported from external sources into this country and it is just as much of foreign growth as the very presence of the English here hundreds of years ago.  What I am really interested in and which is the subject about which I got up to say a few words, is the administration of justice in this country.  Will anybody tell me that for the past two years there has been an impartial and even-handed administration of justice in the Free State? I see by the paper this morning that Deputy Hugo Flinn, in the course of his speech in Bantry, on Sunday, said that never within the memory of living man has there been so much respect for law and order in the Free State as for the past two years.</P>
    <P>I put it seriously to anybody in the House, is that true?  Is it evidenced, for instance, by the murder of O'Reilly in West Cork, whose assassin has not yet been traced?  Is it evidenced by the slaying on Christmas morning of Con Daly of Dunmanway, whose assailants are still untraced and undetected? Is it evidenced by the hurling of missiles at passing trains and omnibuses, by the felling of trees and the placing of obstructions across public roads? Is it evidenced by the burning of platforms and the firing of shots in the public streets?  Is it evidenced by the unlawful interference which is going on, Sunday after Sunday, with legitimate public meetings?  I do not for one moment wish to lay all the blame on the Minister for Justice and I do not lay all the blame on the Attorney-General. I certainly attribute no blame to the Civic Guards, or the Gárda Síochána, if you wish to call them so, who have been placed in a position of great delicacy and great difficulty, but I do charge the Executive Council who are <i>in solidum</i> responsible for this shocking and lamentable state of affairs which brings no credit to and reflects no glory on the Free State.  In the course of his speech last Friday the President complained of the want of loyalty to and the lack of co-operation with the Government from the Opposition.  Does he remember that some months ago Coroner Rice of Fermoy, who is and has been a professed and a prominent supporter of the <Col N="42" /> Fianna Fáil Party, suggested the holding of a conference between the representatives of the various Parties in this House?  Does he remember that his Eminence Cardinal MacRory was prepared to preside over that conference? By whom was the conference turned down?  By the President himself, who publicly stated that probably no good would come of such a conference.  Why, in those circumstances, he should complain of wilful opposition to the Government and the malicious withholding of co-operation with it, is a thing that, to me at all events, is a mystery.</P>
    <P>On the relations between Ireland and England I will only say one word.  The Creator, and as a famous Englishman once said, the ground-plan of the would, have made England and Ireland neighbours.  They are next-door neighbours. They carry on extensive dealings with each other.  It is to their mutual advantage that they should be on friendly terms, and that they should continue to carry on those dealings. Anybody who attempts to put asunder those whom God has joined together is certain to meet with failure and disaster.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasPatrickDowdall" hpid="Mr. Dowdall Mr. Dowdall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowdall</NameTxt>
      <P>I had no intention of intervening in this debate, and as I am not at all prepared with any data to do so, I will not occupy the time of the House except for a few moments. I came into the House when Deputy Mulcahy was talking about the increasing trade that was being done with England by Australia, Canada and New Zealand.  He seemed to take a great deal of consolation from the fact that the market was still there for those countries for meat and other agricultural products.  Deputy Mulcahy quoted figures of increasing trade, <Col N="43" /> but you can have a very large trade run at a loss.  As I said, I am not going to occupy your time very long, but I should like to call attention to the one matter on which, perhaps, I can speak with some little knowledge, and that is butter.  In January of this present year, 1934, we bought Australian creamery butter for 60/- a cwt.  I have already repeated this in the House, but it does not seem to matter how many times facts are put before the Deputies.  They are like water running off a duck's back.  They come in here and repeat the same old slanders and misrepresentations as if they had never heard them refuted.  As I said, this butter was bought at 60/- a cwt. I said that it took 10/- to bring it from Australia to England.  I further added that the cost of bringing that butter from the creamery to the boat in Australia, loading it on the steamer, paying bankers' charges and brokers' charges was approximately 6/- a cwt. I further added&mdash;giving Australia a great deal of credit for the advantage over this country in turning milk into butter; it costs 22/- a cwt. here&mdash;10/- a cwt. as the cost of turning milk into butter.  I brought the price down to 33/6 as the net price which the Australian farmer got.  I suppose there are some farmers on the opposite side of the House.  They can see what price for milk that would mean to the Australian farmers.  The present price of Australian butter in England is 8d. per lb. or 74/8 per cwt.; that would allow a price of 3d. a gallon to be paid for milk.  The farmers here say they cannot do anything on 3d. per gallon. They are being paid over 4d. per gallon for milk at the present moment, and they say that is not sufficient.  If they were only getting 3d., what would the position be?  We will take that 60/- a cwt., which allows two and two-fifth pence per gallon for their milk, and they cannot afford to produce milk at that figure.  I am only just instanceing the price of butter for the simple reason that I want to come to the question of meat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the question of meat, I know nothing at all about it, but I am absolutely certain that if the price is taken in 1931, and the price in 1933 <Col N="44" /> and 1934, the average price of meat will have gone down to a figure that will not pay.  The Australians and the others have no opportunity of sending their goods to other markets.  The markets are not there.  We were assured by Deputy Mulcahy that if this Government, when they were in Ottawa, took advantage of the proposals put before them we could have this market.  Perhaps I am not quoting him correctly, but at all events he indicated that the market was there for us.  The market is not going to be there for us, or for anybody else if the English people want it for themselves. Charity commences at home, and it is at home that the English are going to look after it.  We were told we would have no quotas, and that would not apply to the others.  As a matter of fact it is going to apply to them, for the simple reason that the English are already engaged in strenuously endeavouring to supply their requirements by home products as far as they possibly can.  The outlook for Australia, Canada, Argentine, and the other countries which have been supplying England with food is going to be a very dark one indeed, if they do not get on to something else; if they do not get on to exactly what the President here is attempting to do, making this a self-contained country so far as it can be self-contained.  I want to emphasise this, because so far as I can see, no matter how often it is repeated, and no matter where it is repeated, in this House or outside, the same old story is told here over and over again about the English market.  I am not disputing that there is an English market, and that it is going to continue for a certain time, but that time is gradually drawing to a close, and there will be no market there for either this country or any other country.  The sooner Deputies of the Opposition get the cobwebs out of their brains and do some hard thinking the sooner they will realise that.</P>
    <P>We were told by Deputy Mulcahy that they prepared the way for this Government to carry on and build up a state of prosperity in this country.  The exact opposite is what has been the case.  It is the case that when they were the Government they <Col N="45" /> refused to prepare the ground, as they could have done, in such a way that when this economic war came on this Government and the people of the Free State could practically snap their fingers at it.  They neglected to do everything that Arthur Griffith stood for&mdash;that Arthur Griffith preached. They tell us that they put on tariffs. They put on tariffs for revenue purposes.</P>

      <P>No, it is not.  We put on tariffs to support the people.  You put on tariffs for revenue purposes, not for protecting or building up industries. There is no use making statements of that kind.  You could not prevent the importation of boots or shoes by a 10 per cent. or 15 per cent. tariff.  The English could jump over that tariff wall easily.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowdall</NameTxt>
      <P>They are doing it still. We do not want these interruptions, as they do not lead to anything.  The late Government neglected everything that any responsible, thoughtful man would have done in view of the world position and what was coming on.  Deputy Burke talked about what takes place at the meetings every Sunday.  He said that they cannot hold perfectly legitimate meetings without interruptions. People say, and I know it is absolutely true, that for the first 12 months this Government was in office there was practically no trouble of any sort or kind in the country.  There may have been some trifling matters, and even some serious matters, but they were few and far between.  But when this Government came back a second time, the people opposite realised definitely that their day was gone, and they came back to make things as difficult as possible for the present Government. They have been at it all the time, both inside and outside the House.  They have never ceased to do it.  They do not care what sort of statements they make and what misrepresentations they put forward as to the policy of the Government so long as they think that these will get out to the public and <Col N="46" /> convince the public that this Government are doing things in a wrong way.</P>
      <P>I hope that some of the honest, honourable Deputies on that side will begin to examine their consciences and see whether they are not contributing to a condition of things which is going to make it so difficult that the people are going to suffer.  The fact is that Deputies on that side, whether they be farmers or Deputies of other kinds, cannot get it out of their heads that they and the classes they represent have been in more or less privileged positions in this country, not for generations, but for centuries.  They and their supporters, and some of our supporters, have got into such bad habits by reason of our contact and association with, and the rather easy transport to the other side, that they have ideas of living far beyond the means of production as they are at present in this country.  I do not care what it costs to run a country so long as you get it out of the land&mdash;the only place you can get it out of&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputies can say &ldquo;Hear, hear,&rdquo; but it is the same all over the world.  Though England, Germany and many other countries may have prospered industrially, they never could have done it had it not first come out of the land.  As to the uproar which is talked about, read the papers any day, and go from China to Peru, as Deputy Burke said, and what do you find?  Just consult those papers and see what is happening in Spain, what is happening in Austria, what is happening in Germany, what is happening in America, and even what is happening in England.  Can we show anything half so bad, notwithstanding all the efforts of the gentlemen on that side of the House to create a position in which it would be worse or as bad?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only other point I wish to refer to is Deputy Mulcahy's statement about the statesman that sits in his office.  I read the President's speech in the papers on Saturday.  I never heard the President make any claim to be a statesman.  He spoke about the Opposition talking about statesmanship as something that occurred often <Col N="47" /> here in the debates.  The President never made any claim to be a statesman. So far as the Opposition are concerned, they have shown very little statesmanship in anything they have done.  They have done a horrible amount of bungling in connection with several matters committed to their care, even at the conference tables that they talk about.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make a few remarks on the economic war. While we have had a number of speeches on that question it seems to me that there is a definite progress being made along a certain course. Nobody, however, seems exactly to see where we are getting and we have not had much light, I am sorry to say, from the Government.  We were told at the start of the economic war that the English would not retaliate.  If they did not retaliate, I suppose it would be the first war in which some show was not made by both parties. The next argument that we heard was that our goods could not be done without in the English market.  Unfortutunately, other goods seem to have crept in, and things seem to be going on very much the same in that market. The next argument we hear is that the English wanted the market for their own farmers.  I think that if we made a present of all the arable land in this country to English farmers and planted it down in England they could not raise sufficient foodstuffs to feed the people of England.  That seems to dispose of that argument.  In fact, I think somebody stated here that the combined efforts of English and Irish farmers to supply that market only resulted in a very small percentage of what was being consumed being provided.  The next argument that we hear is that the prices were not worth anything. Deputy Dowdall's remarks were directed along these lines.  But, bad as the prices were, they seem to have been reduced to a still lower level as a result of the economic war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next milestone that we seem to pass is represented by the remark that the market is gone for ever.  I hope it is not gone for ever from this country, but somebody else seems to have got <Col N="48" /> it meanwhile.  If you compare the first quarter of 1931 with the first quarter of 1934, you will find that Ireland has lost practically £5,000,000 in trade, and Canada, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa have gained over £10,000,000.  They have gained twice what we have lost.  Our total trade has fallen from £87,000,000 in 1931 to £55,000,000 in 1933.  Our live stock trade has fallen from £18,000,000 in 1931 to £7,000,000 in 1933.  What had caused that fall?  People on the opposite benches say: &ldquo;Oh, it is brought about by world conditions.&rdquo; Other people have benefited while we have lost ground.  Why was that condition of things brought about? Because we are engaged in an economic war which the Government think it necessary to pursue.  The next argument that has been used in this struggle is what I might describe as the hush-hush argument.  In other words, if you make any criticism at all somebody across the water may hear it and make use of it, and it will show that the whole country is not solidly behind the Government as to the way in which this war is being waged.  We are even told that the people who criticise are knaves and traitors.  There is no doubt that posterity will describe as knaves and traitors people who kept silent even though they could see the end towards which we are drifting.</P>
    <P>The speeches of Deputies on this side of the House amount to this.  The Government have started to wage an economic war, and they certainly mentioned to the electors at the last election that they were going to raise the question of paying annuities to the British.  From that they have argued that they received a mandate to raise this question with the British.  I suggest the Government have not got a mandate to cease paying £5,000,000, thereby costing the country over £10,000,000.  That is the position, broadly speaking.  We have heard remarks from Deputies opposite to the effect that of course the English are suffering too.  Undoubtedly they are. During the course of Friday's debate coal was referred to.  Let us examine what is happening in the case of some commodities upon which we put an <Col N="49" /> emergency duty.  We put such a duty on coal, and undoubtedly English coal imports have decreased.  Coal is sold in the international market at a very keen price.  A few pence a ton make a very big difference.  In the case of large boats that come here from the continent laden with foreign coal, what happens is they deposit their large cargoes of coal here, then leave for Cardiff and load English coal there for the Baltic.  That means that we are paying an artificial price for coal purchased in the world market.  We bring a ship over here at a paying freight, and, in order to get a return freight, that ship is prepared to cut the price to the very minimum.  In effect, while we are keeping out English coal, we are really providing a bounty for the export of English coal in another direction.</P>
    <P>I would like to examine in detail the circumstances connected with the importation of cement.  In 1932 there were 88,000 tons of British cement imported here, together with 10,000 tons of Danish cement.  We put an emergency duty on British cement and reduced the imports of that commodity in 1933 to 52,000 tons.  The net result is that we have reduced the import of British cement by 36,000 tons as between 1932 and 1933.  Danish cement imports, which came to 10,000 tons in 1932, were 48,000 in 1933.  We reduced British cement imports by 36,000 tons and increased Danish cement imports by 38,000 tons.  I would like to suggest to the Government that the Danes made a very good commercial bargain. What we are, in effect, doing is taking in Danish cement instead of British and the Danes are taking back British coal for their State railways instead of foreign coal.  I do not know whether the Government are quite satisfied with that position.  I would not like to suggest to them that they have any extraordinary affection for the Danes.  They are our chief competitors in the market, which is described as one we could not have done without.  They want now to get prices for their own farmers, we are told; and that that market has gone forever.  It seems to me an extraordinary position that we are merely swapping British cement for Danish <Col N="50" /> cement.  I do not propose to go over any of the other commodities that we are importing.</P>
    <P>I was very much struck, on Friday, by some of the President's remarks. It seemed to me that the case put forward, from this side of the House, that the economic war was costing us more than twice the original sum in dispute, was not answered.  What did the President say in reply to that? By inference he accepted the position and told us that it did not matter, and could not be helped.  He told us we were going in for a republic, that he believed that that was the ultimate goal to which we were tending and that we were preparing our economy along lines that would suit that position, that our cattle trade, whether it was paying or not, would have to be done away with because it was not suited to the economic position of this country.  He went on to make some further remarks; I hope I took a right meaning from them.  They certainly were news to me, namely, that the economic war which, as I have said, we pointed out we were losing, every day we were waging it, was dependent upon a whole lot of other items which would have to be settled with England, namely, the presence of English soldiers down in Cork and the presence of English troops in Lough Swilly and the question of partition.</P>
    <P>Now, apparently, the question of partition is bound up with the economic war and will have to be settled with the economic war.  I inferred that from the President's remarks, and I would like to be corrected, if I am wrong, I would have liked the President to go a little further and state whether, when the question of partition is to be settled with England, it is to be settled in the presence of the Northern Government or not.  The President made some further remarks about our not being free.  He said we were not free like Belgium and Holland and Switzerland.  Supposing we did set up a Republic would that Republic and its status be guaranteed by anybody? Would it be an insult to say to the President that the status of the <Col N="51" /> Republic should be guaranteed by England?  I would like him to think about that.  You could not set up a Republic within a few miles of England, and if they tried to buy off the other nations of the earth so as to command their neutrality, unless you have some one to guarantee the status of the Republic.  Belgium is concerned, according to the extent of her neutrality as guaranteed by England, and I think Deputies on the other side will remember a row about the neutrality of Belgium.  In fact, we all remember the talk about the scrap of paper.  I do not think we have really heard enough from the President as to where this economic war is going to end.  He appears to have acknowledged the case made from this side of the House, namely, that we are losing far more each year than the original sum at issue and he appears to await offers from England and possibly from the North of Ireland&mdash;I do not know whether they are probably included, probably they are when the question of partition has been raised&mdash;he appears to await offers from them as to how the question will be settled.  I suppose some of us have had experience of negotiations.  I do not think I ever saw any delicate question of negotiations settled along these lines.  I would certainly hope that the President when closing the debate would give us some further light as to where we stand at present in the economic war.  Apparently, the pure economic war of the £5,000,000 has now become entangled in a number of other issues which must be settled at the same time and, presumably in the same circumstances, as the question of the annuities.</P>
    <P>A great deal of play has been made from the Government Benches as to the want of co-operation from this side of the House.  Certainly, we never had been told what the Government's case was or what it was they were relying on.  Possibly in negotiations it might be just as well not to disclose all the situation.  But at least the Opposition are entitled to know what is the general trend of the position and when the Government hope to bring its <Col N="52" /> struggle to a happy ending.  I can only ask that the President, when he is summing up this debate, will give us some further information along the lines that he did on Friday last, information that would enable us to see how far this economic war has proceeded and what hope there is of its termination.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGovern</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dowdall, speaking here on the Government side, has made as remarkable a speech as has been delivered in this House since I came into it.  The Deputy has stated that it has been the policy of the Government to remove the farmer from the privileged position he occupied.  I would like the President to declare clearly that that is really the policy, and if Deputy Dowdall has been stating with authority the Fianna Fáil policy. It is the first time that what Deputy Dowdall has given us this evening has been stated publicly in the House, or indeed in the country to my knowledge. Instead, the Fianna Fáil Party in seeking for the votes of the farmers, stated they regarded them as a downtrodden class, and they would relieve them.  They promised them that they would be relieved of overhead charges.  They were going to derate them and make them prosperous in many other ways. But now the truth is out, at any rate, and it is up to the President to state whether Deputy Dowdall has not given the Government policy correctly&mdash;that is, that the Government were going to make a change from the privileged position that the farmers occupied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dowdall referred to other matters which were hardly worth discussing as they have been already discussed very fully.  One is the question with regard to the British market.  We were told by the President it was gone for ever.  A few days ago the Minister for Agriculture denied that it was.  The Minister for Finance since denied that it is gone.  He added that this economic war must inevitably be settled, for the agricultural industry is being crippled and the cattle industry is being destroyed.  These are the words of the Minister for Finance, and now Deputy Dowdall <Col N="53" /> comes along and repeats here to-day what the President stated on several occasions.  The Minister for Agriculture went to some pains last week to explain that the President did not mean what he said when he stated the British market was gone.  He stated that what the President meant was that it was not what it used to be.  Of course, everybody knows that the British market is not what it used to be.  That is what we have been told now.  But we all know that since the Fianna Fáil Government came into office and power the British market is not what it used to be.  We, on these benches, have been criticised because we have said that very thing, but now the Minister for Agriculture agrees that what we have been saying to the people is the truth.</P>
    <P>We have been told over and over again that there is a mandate for this agricultural policy of the present Government. They tell us they are now doing a thing that they got a mandate for at the General Election.  What is their justification for the things they have been arguing about here?  I have been endeavouring to study carefully and impartially the President's speeches in this House and in the country, as well as the speeches of other members of the Executive Council.  I have been at great trouble to ascertain what really is their policy. I say that because it never was stated clearly and definitely by them, and I do not believe that the average citizen knows what the policy of the present Government is.  However, I have not myself the slightest doubt as to what their policy is now.  I have got a clear conception of it.  The policy, as the President has explained on many occasions, is to go forward towards something that he admits is unattainable. He is sacrificing those things that are attainable and that are actually in our possession, for what he admits is unattainable.  There is no need to sacrifice those rights that we have.  The President is out for a Thirty-Two County Republic.  He says it is the right of the people to have a Thirty-Two County Republic if they want it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGovern</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I agree with him.  If they want it it is their right. The Vice-President, speaking last Sunday week, I think it was in Mayo, stated that in a generation, or perhaps two generations, we may get a Republic. The Minister for Agriculture, on the same day, speaking in Sligo, said that he and his Party stood for a Republic for the Thirty-Two Counties if that were possible.  But if it is not possible what does he stand for?  Of course, it is quite possible.  What trouble can there be about it?  There is nothing between them and a Thirty-Two County Republic only a Power sixty-six times as great as their own.  If they are able to destroy forces sixty-six times as great as their own, they can have a Thirty-Two County Republic.  All the attainable advantages that our country has secured under the Treaty are being thrown away.  This country has been deprived of all these advantages without any reference at all to the Treaty of 1921 and without any reference at all to the will of the people as expressed in 1922, 1923, 1925&mdash; that is every time that this Treaty was made an issue at an election in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>And this is the Government who say that they are speaking in the name of the will of the people.  Can anybody say that the policy of the present Government is other than in opposition to the will of the people as expressed in these three elections?  The will of the people as expressed at the two last elections was not the issue of a Republic, and it was not an issue as to the smashing of the Treaty.  Therefore, the President and his Government have no authority from the people to interfere with the Treaty.  Yet his speech the other day and every speech he is making in the country at the present time makes it absolutely clear that his policy is to march step by step to a Republic and to destroy the Treaty step by step.  It may be that he could give us a Republic if he possibly can.  It is the right of the people as he conceives it to have a Republic.  But then it seems he is not able to do that.  The only thing he is able to do is to destroy what we have got in order that in a generation, or two generations or three <Col N="55" /> generations, we may achieve his ideal.</P>
    <P>It is easy to imagine what would be thought of a man who, let us suppose, was looking at an estate of which his father or grandfather or forefathers had been deprived many generations ago, say in Cromwell's time.  Let us suppose that in those far-off days his ancestors had been deprived of this fine place.  You might imagine that man living in a place of his own in the neighbourhood saying: &ldquo;That fine place belongs to me all right.  I hope to have it.  The first thing I propose to do is to burn this place that I have. I will destroy it first and go out in the wilderness.  I will stay there until I get that place.&rdquo;  What do you think would happen that man?  Of course, the police would be sent for.  They would send for a doctor to examine the man to see if he was all right.  The doctor would give a certificate to send him off to some institution, if not to jail then to a mental hospital.  What difference is there, I wonder, in the attitude of that man and that of the President?  The President is quite correct, of course, if he says that this country is absolutely entitled to its rights.  But why should he destroy the rights that the people enjoy under the Treaty for rights which he himself admits he cannot achieve, which, according to the Vice-President, cannot be achieved in this generation, and which, according to the Minister for Agriculture, are in all probability impossible?</P>
    <P>That is the position.  Now it would be quite natural to imagine that the Vice-President might adopt an attitude like that: that the Vice-President would decide to take his gun on his shoulder in the martial spirit of the Republicans.  I believe that he did state some time ago in Dublin that he was prepared to fight and to lead them against the enemy.  It would be quite natural to expect a man of his spirit to adopt that attitude: that he would order his rearguard to blow up all the bridges so that there could be no retreat.  But, I think that the President, who is so cautious, is not justified in adopting the policy of burning his nets before he sees any hope of getting <Col N="56" /> anything better.  The President says that he stands for a Republic, but he has not the courage of the Vice-President to go and take it.  His method of getting a Republic is to appeal to Mr. Thomas, asking aim what he will do: whether he should declare a Republic or make it an issue at the next or some other general election. He wants Mr. Thomas, in playing this game, to play the first card. Mr. Thomas says, &ldquo;No, it is your play.&rdquo;&ldquo;Well, then, show me your hand,&rdquo; the President says.  Of course, Mr. Thomas would not show his hand. He only shakes his head, and so the President will not play the game.  The President has not the courage to go forward, and yet he destroys the position that the people of this country won in 1921 and have since held under the Treaty, while he has no hope of getting towards the object he has in view, an object which he is entitled to win.  But I hold that he should go right about it.</P>
    <P>We are told that the President has got a mandate for this policy.  I question very much whether he has or not. We know how that mandate was secured.  It was secured by promises, and when the Government were challenged about those promises one of their supporters, Deputy Dowdall, said that those promises were only statements. It is on the strength of those statements that the mandate for this step-by-step policy, a policy that is destroying the security and the independence that the people had, is being pursued.  If the promises are only statements, what do the statements amount to?  The President has made the statement on many occasions that the British market is gone, but the Minister for Agriculture has said that this statement means nothing: that it only means that the British market was not as good as it used to be, so that we find this position: that the promises are only statements and the statements are nothing at all.  They filter through and they amount to nothing.  Yet it is on the strength of a mandate secured by promises of that kind that this country is being ruined and that the farmers who are the backbone of the country are being ruined.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="57" /> Deputy Dowdall said that the farmers were regarded as holding a privileged position, and that it was the policy of the Government to change that: to destroy their privileged position. Well, if that is the Government's policy they are certainly carrying it out, but when the President was seeking the votes of the people he did not tell them it was his intention to destroy the farmers and to deprive them of their privileged position.  I hope that, when the President comes to reply, he will deal with that question. It is a good job at any rate that the truth is out.  We will see whether the President will deny what Deputy Dowdall has stated.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, at the last general election, said that the economic war was won.  That was one of the statements on which the Government were returned to power.  Yet, last week we had the Minister for Finance stating in this House that the economic war must be settled.  According to him, in January 1933 the economic war was won by this country, but in May, 1934, we find him saying that it must inevitably be settled.  Can any mandate, secured on such promises or statements as those, justify a Government in going forward with such a reckless policy as they are pursuing at the present time: a policy that is inflicting such terrible hardships upon the main body of the people, the people who are the backbone of the nation and who are engaged in its principal industry, a policy, too, that will affect every individual in the State sooner or later?  Such a mandate as that is not one that would justify a Government in taking the strong measures that have been taken by the present Government.</P>
    <P>We were told, too, by the Government Party at the last two general elections that the Army and the Police force were to be reduced, and that taxation was to be reduced by £2,000,000 a year.  How have those promises been kept?  Does the manner in which they are being kept justify a continuance of the Government in office?  I do not think so.  Another of their promises was that unemployment was to be wiped out.  We were told that we <Col N="58" /> were to be provided with alternative markets.  Would the President, when he is replying, tell us the value of these alternative markets?  He also told the people that the economic war was to be settled: that if they were returned to power again and could say that the majority of the people were behind them the economic war was to be settled almost immediately.</P>

      <P>The people were led to believe&mdash;and I do not think the President can deny it&mdash;that if we were to get a good settlement of the economic war there was one way, and one way only, and that was to return the President to power.  He never told the country that the war was to be fought for all time; he never told it that it was his policy to destroy the cattle trade; he never told it that it was his policy to deprive farmers of the privileged position that they had so long occupied.  No.  I never heard that until Deputy Dowdall told us to-day. The country was told by the President that he would bring peace; that coercion was to be abolished for all time. Did he abolish coercion?  If he did not, had he any mandate for it?  He asked for a mandate to secure that coercion would be abolished and that peace and good will would be restored.  It is idle <Col N="59" /> for the President, or anyone else, to charge the Opposition with being the cause of creating trouble.  He told us that the Blueshirts were doing something to bring about trouble.  The fact is that things are a little quieter since the Blueshirts were started.  People had to submit to things until the Blueshirts were started and stood out for the rights of the people.  Before the Blueshirts were started people were afraid to go to public meetings.  Unless they were going to meetings of one Party they were afraid they would be molested and their speakers shouted down.  At the last general election speakers at a meeting in the town I live near could not be heard.</P>

      <P>I listened to some statements made by Deputy Flinn the other day with regard to the economic war.  He said that we were not in a position to settle the economic war unless we came down to the same moral standard as Great Britain.  The Deputy persisted in asking if the Party on this side of the House wanted this State to descend to the same moral standard.  We do not want Deputy Flinn to descend to a lower moral standard than God or nature intended, and neither do we ask him to ascend to any other standard.  I suggest that Deputy Flinn should cultivate his own moral sense, and try to develop rather than to descend to any moral standard lower than the one he has naturally. In his speech Deputy MacDermot referred to the bargaining possibilities the President had at his hand.  The failure of Britain to pay her debts might be used as a further bargaining asset if properly handled.  I doubt if the method adopted by Deputy Flinn is the way to make most of bargaining possibilities.  We are all anxious for the welfare of this country, for its honour, for the best and most honourable settlement of the economic war, and for the largest measure of freedom, whatever brand or label may be attached to it.  The Opposition will be only too glad to co-operate with the President if he makes an honest effort to bring the present trouble to an end. I appeal strongly to the President not to destroy such rights as the people have, for rights that he and his colleagues admit are not possible of <Col N="61" /> achievement in this generation, or perhaps in the next generation, or maybe never.  I ask the President to consider the position carefully and to make an honest effort to get this country out of its difficulties.  I am quite sure, if he does, he will have the whole-hearted support and sympathy of everyone on this side of the House.</P>

      <P>One would imagine that as the economic war drags along slowly, at least the issues involved in the dispute would become more clear.  The opposite seems to be the case.  Instead of the issues becoming more clear, we find, as we go along, that there are at least three different points of view expressed from the Government Benches with regard to the economic war.  There are people who would give a lot to be able to read the mind of the President on the question of the economic war.  The President must not take it as coming from a mere back-bencher when I say that a number of people regard the President, rightly or wrongly, as a man who is absolutely incapable of arriving at a settlement of this dispute.  He must not blame these people for having that point of view, because the history of the President is one which suggests that for him to settle this dispute with England is practically impossible. There is no need to cite instances. We are aware of the part played by the President at the time of the Treaty with England.  Since he came into office we are aware of his attempts to negotiate with England. We are aware of the type of case he put up when he went to England.  All these things lead us inevitably to believe that the President of the Executive Council is a man who, at least, will never settle this dispute whatever chance there is for whoever he may send to negotiate.  That is the history of the President&mdash;a man absolutely incapable of making any bargain with the English people, a man who seems, to me at least, to be incapable of understanding the word &ldquo;negotiation&rdquo; or &ldquo;settlement&rdquo; as it is understood in ordinary lay and legal circles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Get all and give nothing&rdquo; is the President's point of view.  That is a great mentality to have from the point <Col N="62" /> of view of the Irish people if it could be achieved in practice.  If we could get everything from England and give nothing, so much the better, but who ever heard of a settlement being arrived at on those lines? Who ever heard of litigants in a dispute coming to a settlement on the basis that one party takes all and the other gets nothing? I heard the Minister for Agriculture, who apparently models himself on the President, state here in the Dáil one day, or rather ask the rhetorical question: &ldquo;What are we to do?  How is this thing to be settled?  If we give anything to England we have lost.&rdquo; That is a mentality which I, at least, find it almost impossible to understand because while this hard-headed attitude is being persevered in, the trade of this country, both import and export, is being ruined.  I had sincerely believed, when the Fianna Fáil Party first came into office and when they started this economic war, that no more than about a year could pass without its proving disastrous to the country and I must confess that I was absolutely wrong, in company with many others, in that belief.  But I would like the President, as I see him laughing&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to give me and other ignorant people like me some enlightenment as to when this economic war is likely to finish or, if it is not likely to finish, what its results are likely to be, because, as I have said a moment ago, we do not seem to be able to judge for ourselves what it is leading to.  Does the President want to settle this, or is the economic war or the continuance of it, the instrument whereby the President is going to create self-sufficiency for this country? Is that really the position?  We want to know one way or another.  We want to know what to look forward to because, at the moment, this position of unrest, of doubt, of anxiety is not doing the country any good.  It is difficult for business people in this country to make plans at the present moment.  It is difficult to know what you can do, what outlay you can involve yourself in, if you do not know <Col N="63" /> what the attitude of the Government is in regard to the economic war.</P>
      <P>Is it the President's deliberate policy to reduce the standard of living in this country?  That seems to be what is happening.  The standard is, undoubtedly, going to come down.  There is less money circulating in this country now by far than there was a couple of years ago, certainly far less than there was three years ago.  If there is less money circulating in the country it is absolutely certain the standard of living must go down, because, as I understand, it is a principle of economics that the more money circulating in the country the higher the standard of living.  I know for an absolute certainty that in this country at least £10,000,000 less money is now in circulation than was in circulation three years ago.  I should like if the President would give us some clear indication of what he thinks the future of the country is going to be, say, within the next three years.  He must know, as we all believe, that the idea of getting a court to settle this dispute with England, or to settle the issues in this dispute with England, is absolutely impossible.  People on this side of the House&mdash;I, at any rate&mdash;are not altogether lacking in sympathy with the President in his attitude on the question of a tribunal.  It seems obvious to me, for one, that it would be difficult for the people of this country to accept a tribunal the composition of which is such that its members are drawn from people whose motherland is England.</P>

      <P>I think, without going into that question, that the day of the tribunal is dead.  What we want is a business-like attitude on the part of the Government, an attitude of men who will make up their minds that they are going to compromise, that compromise is not weakness, that in order to settle this question with England compromise <Col N="64" /> will have to be entered into and that some offer will have to be made to them.  I understand that when he President last went across, instead of offering them something, he claimed some sum like £200,000,000 from England, based his whole case on that, and would not give way one pound in his claim.  We know that if you start off with that sort of mentality you are never going to settle this dispute.  We here in this country by our representatives, our Government, agreed to give a payment of £5,000,000 per annum to England.  Then a new Government came into office and they put up the proposition that they are not alone going to stop the payment of that £5,000,000 but they are also claiming £200,000,000 or some such fantastic sum as a counter-claim.</P>
      <P>I should like the President to say just a few words, if I am in order in raising this point on his Vote, with regard to the prospects of reviving, or rather creating, industrial activity in this country.  So far as I understand it, last year's Budget proves one thing, if it proves nothing else, and that is that protective tariffs as protective tariffs were an entire failure.  The Minister for Finance, as I understand the position, got £1,200,000 from these tariffs more than he estimated for. That is, roughly, the figure.  Now, that clearly demonstrates that protection, at least for last year, has been a failure, and if I read the accounts of the Minister for Finance correctly, this year I think he is counting again on the same thing occurring.  Otherwise, how could he possibly give sixpence off the income tax and the other remittances he gave in his Budget?  I should like the President to tell us something on that point &mdash;as to what he thinks are the chances of a real industrial revival in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Above all, however, and before concluding, I would ask the President not to throw away too hurriedly that which has proved to be a good financial success in this country.  I refer to agriculture&mdash;the agricultural industry as it has been worked in this country for a great number of years.  I do not profess to be a farmer or to know anything much about farming, but I know this: that <Col N="65" /> the agricultural industry has proved itself to be a success in this country for a number of years.  I have always thought it wrong that politicians&mdash;men who know nothing whatever about the inner workings of farming&mdash;should try to teach farmers what they should do and what sort of products they should produce in order to make a living for themselves.  I think that the farming community should be left to themselves. They are the best judges of what the land produces best for them, and it seems to me to be the height of absurdity for a medical doctor to come along and tell farmers how they are to run their farms.</P>

      <P>The Estimate which we have before us is, to my mind, relatively the most important Estimate of all.  It is the Estimate for the Department of the President, and, after all is said and done, the whole policy carried out by other Departments really starts, I take it, from the President himself. The present economic condition of the country and the economic policy of the present Government are really two matters of vital importance.  The other night, when I was speaking on the Agricultural Estimate, I alluded to the necessity, in my mind, that no matter whether speeches were made from the Front Bench of the Opposition or the <Col N="66" /> Front Bench of the Government, those who made those speeches should be particularly careful as to what they said. After all is said and done, the country, anyhow, has a right to expect, from leaders and from the Front Bench of the Opposition and of the Government, statements which they would stand over; that there would be no misleading of the people in any way.  Personally, I attach very great importance to any speeches made, whether in the Dáil or in the country.  Statements that are absolutely true should be made, and there should be nothing misleading about them.</P>
      <P>In volume 29 of the Official Debates, column 2, page 786, Deputy de Valera, as he then was, spoke as follows&mdash;he was alluding to the then Minister for Finance, Mr. Blythe:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Minister spoke of derating, and stated that if adopted here it would be at a cost which would practically make it prohibitive, but he has closed his ears to those who pointed out that a sum which would far more than cover the cost of derating is unwarrantably exported every year.  We believe that the sum paid to England is not due, and that if the greater portion of it were retained here in the Exchequer there would be no need to put on extra taxation to relieve the present burden on agriculture.  We know, of course, that agriculture is our principal industry, and that seven out of every nine engaged on productive industries are engaged on the land; also that two-thirds of the wealth of the country is produced from agriculture, and, moreover, that the greater part of the remaining one-third is produced from industries ancillary to farming, such as bacon-curing, butter-making, brewing, distilling, and so forth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The pressure of rates is particularly severe on our farming community. If we take into account the fact that they have to compete with rivals in Great Britain itself and in Northern Ireland, who are relieved of that burden of rates, we realise what a severe handicap there exists and will remain on the farming community. As we say, we agree with <Col N="67" /> the Minister that it is very difficult to say how that can be done by imposing alternative forms of taxation, but we say that there is a way which was open to a determined Minister.  If the present Ministry is not prepared to take it, then we say it is the duty of members of the House who see expenditure steadily fixed at the figure given in the Estimates, about £24,000,000 &mdash; members who are interested in finding some relief where taxation is too burdensome and in providing means of employment for those who are unemployed &mdash;to get a Ministry who will see that that money is not exported.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Those are the President's words on 24th April, 1929, when he was Leader of the Opposition.  Now, what has happened?  Those land annuities have been held and that money has not been exported, but the equivalent amount of money has been collected by England.  Then, take the rates. In that speech the President stated definitely and clearly that agriculture in this country could not compete with England unless we had full derating. That was the meaning of his speech.  But what does he do?  He cuts down the agricultural grant.  As everybody knows, the rates in every county, at the present time, have gone up enormously.  I know that there is a tremendous amount of talk about conspiracies not to pay rates.  All I can say is that, going around my own county, I have never come across a single instance of any man refusing to pay his rates.  My own feeling, from mixing amongst the people, is that they would gladly pay their rates if they could only make the money with which to do so.  That is the trouble.  We have the declaration from the President that certain things should be done.  All would be well as long as the land annuities were retained.  He has retained them and the result is that an equivalent sum is collected by Great Britain.  The President does not apply the money he kept back to derating, as he said ought to be done.</P>
    <P>In the latter portion of his speech, the President seemed to think that <Col N="68" /> £24,000,000 was beyond the limit in the way of the burden which this country should have to bear.  What does the burden amount to now?  It is nearer to £38,000,000 than £24,000,000.  I have said in the country and in this House that the greatest necessity at present is that people who get up to speak should face facts.  That is what we want public men to do.  I do not think that it is asking too much to request the President to face facts.  Reading reports of speeches made by the President and other Ministers and listening to their speeches here, it is almost impossible for anybody to understand what they really mean.  They all contradict one another.  One Minister says that the British market is gone. Another Minister says it is not gone. A third Minister says &ldquo;Thank God it is gone.&rdquo;  One does not know what the position is owing to the speeches of Ministers.  It is very plain, however, that until that market is restored in full to the people there is no earthly hope for agriculture.</P>
    <P>We have heard the argument used regarding the quotas put up against other members of the British Commonwealth. As I said here the other night, we can do what no other member of the Commonwealth can do&mdash;we can send across fresh food to England. The other colonies cannot do that. Their produce has to be frozen before it can be sent to England.  All the British Minister of Agriculture is doing is trying to preserve that particular market for the English farmer. Nobody can deny that if no food of that nature were allowed into England, England could not exist on the produce of her own farms.  To go a step farther, if the only food of that nature allowed into England were the surplus we have to send, England could not exist on her own production plus our surplus.  We have a better chance of reaping the full benefit of that market than any other country in the world. It is our just right because we are so situated that we can deliver the goods fresh.  Ottawa, which should have been the crowning of all our hopes with regard to the agricultural community of this country, became the tomb of the farmers' hopes.  Why?  Simply because <Col N="69" /> those who went over there had not the courage to face up to facts and thresh the whole matter out in a manly, straightforward way.  If we had to-morrow as leader of the Government a man with sufficient courage to go over and thresh this matter out in England, the whole difficulty could be settled.  There is no question about that. We have got the brains in this country. We have got the materials which England requires and it is only a question of making a decent, straightforward bargain.  As I have said before, there is a table on the other side of the Channel with empty seats waiting for men of courage to go and thresh this matter out.  Until that is done, I can see no earthly hope for the farming community here.</P>
    <P>The President cannot get away from the statement he made that the agricultural community is the most important community in this country.  I do not say that because I happen to be a farmer myself.  It is simply a question of looking facts in the face.  Go into any town in the Free State and you will soon realise how the very existence of the people is dependent on the prosperity of the farming community around them.  There is hardly a person outside the big cities who has not got some interest in some way in agriculture.  When that industry is hit, everyone is hit and the injury works its way down into the towns and even into the cities.  One man is responsible for the present deplorable position&mdash;the President.  I lay the full responsibility at his door.  One man&mdash; the President himself&mdash;could, if he wished, settle the whole matter tomorrow. No other member of his Government could do it.  However, he could do it.  I ask him to sacrifice some of his pride and some of the statements he made, to throw his chest out and do the right thing even though people say he is going back on other statements.  I ask him to go over there and discuss this matter as man to man.  He can make a good bargain. If he does that, he will never regret it and this country will never regret it.  If he does not, this country will pay for the omission and some day he will pay for it in bitter remorse.</P>

      <P>There are really two methods by which one can judge a Government.  One can judge its success or its failure by considering how the methods it adopts make for the wealth of the State, and one can judge it, also, by the way in which its actions show themselves in the preservation of the peace of the State.  As a Government, looking after the material prosperity of this State, it is, in my judgment, at any rate, unquestionable that this administration must be put amongst the greatest failures of all administrations that have failed in any country in modern times.  When I turn in another direction and see how justice is being administered in this State, I am driven to the conclusion that seldom, indeed, if ever, has justice been administered in a more partial&mdash; and I will go further and say a more disgraceful&mdash;manner than the manner in which this present Executive is dealing with the matter of the administration of justice in this country.  Let me take that latter because, after all, it is the more important.  You can have no material prosperity, you can have no wealth in this country if you have no sense of security, and you can have no sense of security unless every single person in this State is satisfied that there is a Government in office which is going to administer the law, which is going to administer it impartially, which is going to administer it without fear, favour or affection, and which is going to see that every citizen of the State is able to live his own life in his own way, free from let or hindrance by any evil-doer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Within the last few weeks I had occasion to make many remarks of a grave nature about the administration of the Guards by the Minister for Justice, and certainly I do not believe that, even with Fianna Fáil, the attempted defence of the Minister for Justice carried the slightest bit of conviction.  I am not going over the same ground again; I have left it there, but I am coming right down to what the Executive Council themselves do to prevent the fair and impartial <Col N="71" /> administration of the law.  I am coming down to where the Executive Council itself is deliberately leaning itself against the fair and impartial administration of justice, and where the Executive Council itself is giving examples, and the greatest of examples, of injustice done to citizens of this State.  Let me take one great example.  The Executive Council, under its own hand, placed its name to a shocking lie, when the Executive Council declared that an association&mdash;in its own nature, in every single one of its aims and in every single one of its objects, a perfectly lawful association; an organisation which, as a matter of fact, does credit to the young men and girls of this country who belong to it&mdash;was unlawful.  You find men who have not broken the law; you find men who have lived within the law; you find men who are splendid examples to the young men of Ireland in the observation of the law, sent to prison because they are members of a lawful association which, in the teeth of all truth, in the teeth of all justice, and in the teeth of all morality, has been condemned by an unjust&mdash;and I will not hesitate to use the words&mdash;an immoral Executive Council.</P>
    <P>Are you going to have anywhere in this country a respect for law?  How can you ever expect justice to thrive in this country if you are going to have, at the very top, false declarations made against law-abiding citizens of this State because they happen to be political opponents of the Government in office?  Let me pass on.  Under the Constitution (Amendment No. 17) Act, certain duties are imposed on the Executive Council.  Under Section 12 of that statute, the Executive Council is, in fact, made a Court of Appeal over the Military Tribunal and it is the duty of the Executive Council carefully to see that no miscarriage of justice takes place before the Military Tribunal. If a plainly wrong verdict has been arrived at, it is the duty of the Executive Council to investigate and to quash the finding.</P>

I am going to deal now with two specific cases, neither of which has been made the subject matter of <i>habeas corpus.</i> One case came from County Tipperary. Two revolvers were found in an open shed in a man's yard, to which any single person who liked could have access.  There was not one scintilla of evidence to connect the owner of that shed with possession of those revolvers. Anybody might have gone through the shed which, as a matter of fact, had three openings, two of which were not even covered by a door.  That case came before the Military Tribunal and there was a conviction, in the teeth of a long series of decisions as to what constitutes &ldquo;possession,&rdquo; according to the criminal law.  That matter was brought to the attention of the Attorney-General and, I presume, by the Attorney-General to the Executive Council, but that sentence has not been quashed by the Executive Council. A case which no judge in this country would have left to a jury has been&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>On the point you have raised from the Chair, might I bring to your memory that on one occasion I raised here the matter of a county court case in which a man was charged and convicted of an indecent assault.  Despite that fact, he was released by the then Minister for Justice, now Deputy Geoghegan.  I raised that matter in Parliamentary questions, and afterwards on the adjournment.  In the course of his reply the Minister said, and was allowed to say, referring to certain expressions used by the judge, that they were shocking, that they should not have been used by him and were contrary to the office he held.  I do not know whether or not you desire to continue that precedent, but at any rate there is the precedent.  On the second point there is, in the Constitution Amendment (No. 17) Act, power given to the Executive Council to review decisions.  If it is ever allowed to ask the Executive Council are they going to review decisions, where does the opportunity better arise than on the Vote of the head of the Government, to discuss by what method the Government in this matter should review the decisions and discharge the findings of the Military Tribunal?  When that point has to be raised, it is not necessary that the facts and circumstances of the case should be disclosed to the House?</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;between the courts and the Military Tribunal.  I make a distinction, because we have specifically precluded members of the House from dealing with the courts in the ordinary way.  Judges' salaries are not on an annual Vote.  There is nobody answerable for their conduct.  They are free and independent.  The Military Tribunal is tied up with the Government. Their actions are reviewable only by the Government.  The salaries <Col N="76" /> of its members are paid by the Government, and borne here on an annual Vote.  Surely there is a plain distinction?</P>

      <P>Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney was not allowed to continue his argument, so I do not quite know what line he was going on.  You will remember that this court is not bound by the ordinary rules or laws of evidence which govern other courts.  It did seem to me that what the Deputy was going to point out was that a judge, controlled by laws of evidence, would perforce have found in a certain way; that the Military Tribunal, not being tied by laws of evidence, there is still protection for the prisoner brought before it in that the Executive Council &mdash;which should be the fountain head of justice&mdash;can review his sentence. Although the Deputy was not allowed to continue his argument, I understand that he was going to point out that this, pre-eminently, was a case for the Executive Council to take cognisance of, because it arose from the circumstance that the Military Tribunal was created to act in a different way from an ordinary court, and that arising out of that fact there was a miscarriage of justice which should have been rectified by the Executive Council.</P>

      <P>I cannot say off-hand what precedents have been established here.  Deputy McGilligan has quoted something which has happened, and which I daresay is on record.  The practice, as far as I remember, and every member of the House remembers, is that decisions of courts are not reviewable here.  If we allow decisions of one court to be reviewed it will be very difficult to keep decisions of other courts from being reviewed also, and that would certainly be highly injurious to the administration of justice.</P>

If persons are unjustly imprisoned, and it is the duty of the Executive Council to <Col N="77" /> release those persons, surely it is the duty of a Deputy in the Dáil&mdash;and in consequence of its being his duty it ought to be within the rights of a Deputy in the Dáil&mdash;to bring those facts to the public notice, and to the notice of every member of this House.</P>

      <P>I pass for the moment from that case.  Let me come to another one.  Here is a case which arose only last week.  It was alleged that certain persons made statements to the Guards.  I do not know whether they did or did not, but they were examined before the Military Tribunal.  They denied on oath having made those statements, and, in consequence, there was not before the Military Tribunal any evidence.  Men were tried and convicted, not on the evidence before the Tribunal, but on statements made, or alleged to have been made, in the presence of the Guards.  Have the Executive Council reviewed that case, as they ought to have done, under Section 12 (1), and annulled that finding? Not at all.  Is there any chance of the Executive Council doing it? The men are political opponents of the Executive Council and, therefore, it is quite easy to know the answer we will get from the Executive Council who have prostituted the powers given to them by the Constitution Amendment Act in declaring a lawful association unlawful and refused to act when they should act and when it was their plain duty to act under Section 12 of the Constitution Amendment Act.  These persons are their political opponents. They have their law officers to put them right, and there can be no other reason.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How can you find in any part of the country the same respect and admiration for the law as you found two years ago?  When the Executive Council start bringing the law into discredit at the very top, how can you expect to find the same respect for the law as there was two years ago?  You find the same thing all over the country.  Every single thing that the Executive Council do seems almost to be dictated by a desire to demoralise the people of this State. They brought this country into great poverty.  They are bringing this <Col N="79" /> country further than into poverty&mdash; they are bringing it into absolute destitution.  But the Executive Council have been doing a worse thing &mdash;they have been demoralising the people of this country.  It is no longer a credit for a man to work.  At one time, an ordinary workman, certainly in the West of Ireland which I know very well&mdash;and I believe it is the same all over the Free State&mdash; regarded it as a very discreditable thing if he had to seek for charity anywhere.  But, at the present moment, there are men so demoralised in this country, many of them not in need of charity, that they are now coming along to get public charity. The manhood of the country, the self-respect of the country is being attacked in a very insidious and dangerous way by the Executive Council.  As I said, if they wished to degrade the manhood of this country they could hardly set about it in a better fashion than they are doing.</P>
    <P>Let me turn for a moment to their economic policy.  It is admitted on every side that the main source of wealth in this country is agriculture. Deputy The O'Mahony quoted some words from President de Valera admitting that the bulk of the wealth of this country comes from agriculture, that seven out of nine persons engaged in productive work in this country are engaged in agriculture. I do not know whether these figures are correct or not.  It does not lie, however, in the President's mouth to contradict them, because they come out of his own mouth.  What is the position of agriculture?  Is there a single branch of agriculture at present which can be said to be self-supporting? You say, &ldquo;Grow wheat.&rdquo; Wheat is not self-supporting; you have to subsidise it.  You say, &ldquo;Grow beet.&rdquo;  Beet is not self-supporting; it wants a subsidy.  Dairying wants a subsidy; everything wants a subsidy.  Cattle, sheep and eggs have to be subsidised; everything has to be subsidised.  Where is the money coming from for the subsidies?  Three-fourths of it comes out of the farmer's pocket.  How are you to keep on subsidising <Col N="80" /> people out of their own pockets and at the same time do them any good?  Is it not a cynical attitude to say: &ldquo;We have been awfully good to the farmers; we have given so much money for this and so much money for that and such a bounty for this and such a bounty for that?&rdquo; Where does that money come from? Are you not in the most vicious of vicious circles?  You take money out of the farmer's pocket with one hand and then put a little back into his other pocket with your other hand and then you gravely say: &ldquo;We have been very kind to you and you are getting rich upon our kindness.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Look round the country, go to any farming community you like and see the condition to which that community is reduced.  There is one part of the country which I know very well&mdash;the West of Ireland.  The small farmers of the West of Ireland are my constituents. It is the area in which I have lived all my life and I know the condition in which the people have been for many years.  My memory goes back at least 40 years in which I was able to judge of the condition of the country and I have not seen the condition of the people there as bad as it is at present.</P>
    <P>Let me mention one little story which I heard a few weeks ago from a doctor which possibly, because the concrete is sometimes useful, may bring home to the Deputies opposite the conditions there.  This doctor told me that he was speaking to a man holding an important Government position.  This official told him that he saw a small girl of eight or nine going to school.  She looked to be in a very unhealthy condition.  He asked her what she had for breakfast and she said, &ldquo;potatoes.&rdquo;&ldquo;What food will you get when you go home this evening?&rdquo; he asked her, and she replied, &ldquo;potatoes.&rdquo;&ldquo;Do you get anything but potatoes?&rdquo; he asked her. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the child; &ldquo;for the last three months we have had nothing but potatoes and the potatoes are nearly all out now.&rdquo; Just consider what that means.  That child is only one of many who are in a similar position. They may not actually feel the pangs of hunger as long as they have sufficient <Col N="81" /> potatoes to take the edge off their appetites, but there is not a single person on the Government Benches who is ignorant of the fact that these children are slowly starving to death. Ask the Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan) if you like and he will tell you that they are.  Ask any Doctor in the House or outside and he will tell you so.  Potatoes do not provide a food that will keep people alive.  They are insufficient.  Potatoes are wanting in albuminoid which is necessary for human vitality.  That is the position in which many an unfortunate child and many an adult is in my constituency at present and it was not so before.  There is nothing to supplement the potatoes.</P>
    <P>Through your economic policy and your deliberate refusal to act in a commonsense way you are playing with the lives of these young children.  These children are starving to death, and it is your fault, and bear that in mind. Every single child that dies of malnutrition, its death is at your door. Every single child who goes through life undeveloped, a wretched delicate creature, and who ought to be a healthy creature, the responsibility is at your door.  You can restore this country, at any rate, to a position of comparative prosperity; you can put agriculture on its feet again; you can return to this country the British market, the loss of which has brought us into our present deplorable condition. It is all through your vanity and all through your obstinacy that this is happening.  What is all this nonsense that is talked about surrender, about fighting on, suffering on, inducing little children to suffer and to starve?  You create all these troubles and you describe, as the alternative for that, surrender.  You know perfectly well that is not the alternative.  You know that there is the other alternative, the alternative which any sane, sensible person would take, the alternative of peace by negotiation, with the surrender of neither side.  Peace by negotiation is what any sensible person would indulge in.  But, of course, we know your mentality; it is nothing new to us.  Long before this Government <Col N="82" /> got into power, long before President de Valera was made head of the Executive Council, he preached his doctrine of non-co-operation with England. It was his desire, if there was any trouble about the Treaty, to have non-co-operation with England.  He has not secured his non-co-operation to the fullest extent, but he has to a considerable extent, and he has not succeeded in breaking off, as he said he would, all trading relations with Great Britain.  He has done it to a certain extent, and the country is suffering very much in consequence.  It was, I believe, in the carrying out of his avowed policy of non-co-operation that he fired the first shot in this economic war, the shot which has cost this country so much.</P>
    <P>What is the use of going around the country saying there is no possibility of negotiations?  Any person who reads and thinks knows well that is not true. Any person who thinks for himself realises that by the simplest negotiations and with the greatest ease, if there were commonsense negotiators, the whole of this quota system could be swept away.  It is an unnatural system.  In a few years' time it must fall by its own weight.  Quotas always do.  If we had sensible negotiators it could be swept away in the shortest time.  There may be people who say that they do not believe that, but the person who does not believe it ought to be in a lunatic asylum or in a home for idiots.  There is no earthly reason why it could not be done.  Where it is to the advantage of both sides to have an end to such a foolish struggle, there is no reason why that struggle should not be terminated.  But the Government's avowed policy is that they will not bring it to an end.  You want it to go on; you will not have peace by negotiation; you will not have a settlement by arbitration or otherwise.  Your avowed policy is to let this struggle be carried on, to let the people suffer, to let the children starve.  It can only result in a few years' time in having a third-rate population where you now have a first-rate population.  But the hour of retribution must come when the people will have an opportunity of expressing their views upon this Executive Council.  I have not the slightest <Col N="83" /> doubt what is the view they will express. I have not the slightest doubt that when the history of this country comes to be written no Executive Council will go down in its annals covered with greater shame than the present Executive Council.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Minch</NameTxt>
      <P>The discussions which have taken place on the President's Estimate have circled almost entirely around the economic war, or, as it is called, the trade dispute with England. When this trouble started we were told that it was a dispute as regards the legality or otherwise of paying land annuities.  Then it developed into a trade dispute, and it is now come to be recognised as a piece of first-class ballyhoo.  Everything in this country has been affected by this co-called trade dispute.  Everybody recognises the impacts, the repercussions of this so-called war and the most pathetic thing about it is the condition of our unemployed.  This economic war has caused us to put into operation in the country a form of legalised pauperism. There are unfortunate men who have to walk long distances seeking for a mere pittance from the taxpayers.  In my opinion there is nothing so calculated to crush a man's heart, to break his spirit, than the Government's latest Maintenance Act.  Of course, it is the direct result of the desperate economic conditions which exist in every home in the country because of this Government's systematic blundering.  Thousands of men in this State are vainly seeking work, and I cannot understand how their case is going to be made any better unless the President makes up his mind to end the dispute which is reacting so disastrously on the people. I think it is time we had a definite statement from the President indicating an effort on his part to alleviate existing distress.  We find that the farming community are pressed to pay their debts, their rents, rates and taxes when the fact of the matter is they are unable to meet their liabilities. Some of the payments the farmers are called upon to make are almost incomprehensible. In one instance you find the taxpayer paying for premium <Col N="84" /> bulls, and in another instance he is paying for the destruction of calves. The farmer is paying his full quota towards the land annuities in one manner and, as well as that, he has to bear an extra 50 per cent. land tax for ever.  The incomes of industrious farmers have dwindled almost to vanishing point.  With their land devalued and their incomes so low, they have to pay on their old rateable valuations as if times were good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is it any wonder we have this unemployment, this disaster and chaos in the country?  If Deputies in this House would, in a clear way, give some indication that there was a possibility of a business-like deal emanating, ultimately, from what happens in this House these debates would have some value.  But what do we find: the more these debates go on the more confusion is created.  It would seem, to the ordinary mind, that this dispute is not an economic dispute, or a trade dispute, but a first-class political show-down, and is going to be carried on in that line.  It would seem that the economic war brings us back to the days when Collins and Griffith went over to London and came back with a settlement, but immediately we were told that it was accepted under threat.  President de Valera told us the other day that a Republic would be established were it not for the so-called threat of the other country.  That is, we are told that the people of this country have gone down on their knees before the threat of the British.  Is that the position we have come to?  I hold the economic war has developed into nothing more nor less than a political dispute between this country and Great Britain.  It is on that basis evidently it is going to be considered.  If it is to have a political basis and not a trade basis, well then let us understand it.  If we are going to go on until we have a Republic for the whole of Ireland, it is as well to know that that is not going to happen in our lifetime.  That is what is exercising the minds of the ordinary people. There is no necessity for going back to history or to what happened in the past.  That is the object of Deputies opposite always, and from that point of view the whole question will have to <Col N="85" /> be watched, and the statements which emanate from those in authority will have to be watched.  If Irish aspirations are to be sacrificed for a particular settlement it is well to know what that particular settlement is to be.</P>
    <P>The English people must have learned, from the past, that they cannot force anything upon this country and that they never will get a settlement by coercion.  If it came to this, that the President asked that this dispute should be settled in an ordinary commonsense way, and that an ordinary businesslike deal should be made, and if we got it clear that that was the President's view, I can assure him that this House will have something to say.  No one would expect the President or any Government in this country to bend the knee to England.  We are not asking for that.  The Tribunal for settlement was refused by Great Britain unless those composing it came from the associated nations of the Commonwealth. But the Minister for Finance made the wild and reckless statement that we read in the newspapers of yesterday, that the Government had made up their mind that they have no intention of accepting an ultimate decision no matter what way it is brought about.  That would seem to be a position, judging it from any point of view, whether from the point of view across the water or within the shores of this country, that would seem to lead to confusion, more confusion, and still more confusion.  Everything seems to be leading to confusion.  There seems to be no one proposing what might be called an honest-to-God question to be answered.  There seems to be a new question every week, leading to more and more confusion.  If there is any intention of having a business talk let us have a business discussion.  If it is merely to be a political talk, let it be a complete show-down on politics.  Then we will know what this problem is or what it pretends to be.  I ask the President to get up and say whether in his view this economic war is no longer a question of cash or land annuities, or a dispute about trade or anything associated with ordinary commerce, or whether it is an absolute <Col N="86" /> political dispute between Great Britain and this country.  England looks upon it as a question of collecting cash.  But we have said it is not a question of cash but is a question of a great deal more.</P>
    <P>On this side of the House we are told we are traitors and British henchmen. But we are prepared to stand for Irish national aspirations and not to sacrifice one iota if it is to be a question between our handling of the economic war on our side and the British handling of it on their side.  But we have not been told what the position is.  There is a lot of verbiage and phraseology and smoke-screens and camouflage until no one knows whether it is an economic war or a political war purely for the purpose of hiding from the country the things that the Fianna Fáil Party promised at the first general election and which they know now cannot be carried through. That is the way they put forward their excuses by creating confusion and still more confusion.  It is up to the President to make it clear and straight to the people of the country that he and his Party have failed in the plan that they intended to carry out, and that the economic war is responsible for that.  If the economic war is responsible, let that fact be known to the people, instead of having politics introduced up and down the country making everyone dissatisfied.  If the country is to go on, and if Irish national affairs are to be advanced, better advance them by fair and square means, and let the people decide afterwards.  The Party opposite are pretending that the economic war has ceased, and they are going all out on the political side and nothing else.  It is all right to have a grand soul and a noble spirit, but when people are hard pressed and struggling to live, and shrivelled flesh, it is not of much use having a grand soul.  The people feel the hardships of the day, and the hard times they are going through.  Many Fianna Fáil supporters, and those who support Labour, must have a correct realisation of the true situation.  After all, discussions in this House have no meaning whatever unless we are able to get from them something in the <Col N="87" /> nature and substance and not mere shadows.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Last Friday the President interrupted the speech he was making on his own Department, and, for the week-end, projected himself to Ennis.  He left this House listening to first-class matters in the region of politics, matters of first-class importance.  He went to Ennis to deal with the local elections.  He could not get even out of Friday's discussion here&mdash;even though it was not at an end&mdash;and again he talked about secret agreements and again the atmosphere of treachery had to be renewed.  We again had at Ennis the old familiar performance to which we have got so accustomed.  Since Fianna Fáil became a Government they have consistently pursued one policy not in relation to economics, not in relation to finance, not in relation to nationalism, but in relation to the blackening of the reputation of their opponents.  They were barely in when they fired the charge of &ldquo;manifestations of treason in the face of the enemy which,&rdquo; according to the Minister for Finance. &ldquo;had to be dealt with speedily and promptly.&rdquo; It was not a question of political opponents, it was not a question of an Opposition Party regularly constituted but, &ldquo;a manifestation of treason in the face of the enemy which had to be speedily and promptly dealt with.&rdquo; That same Minister also said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;While we have the support of every thinking Irishman, there are unfortunately reactionary and Imperialist elements in the community which with the help of a reactionary and Imperialist Press spread the spirit of faction amongst us,&rdquo;</P>
      <P>and after rising to a crescendo of abuse he says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Ireland's cause has often been betrayed before; but never except when public life in Ireland has been as degraded as in the days of Castlereagh has Irish treachery flaunted itself in the public eye.  In the past we have had Sham Squires, Leonard McNallys, and Captain O'Sheas, and a host of other furtive, secret hypocrites posing as patriots, but <Col N="88" /> until Cumann na nGaedheal gave the lead such men did not dare to come out into the open.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was not enough.  The campaign of vilification and slander had to go further, and was continued in Ennis by the President at the week-end.  There were further quotations.  The Minister had referred to their opponents as</P>
    <P>&ldquo;old Whigs, Castle Cawtholics, puppy dogs, men who were arm in arm, breast high for England&mdash;every one of them thereby hoping to get into the good graces of England.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance talked of Deputy Cosgrave&mdash;the man who had been for ten years President of this State, and said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That man challenges us to put him into jail.  Well, we are asking the Irish people to jail him in the pages of Irish history.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>And this sort of thing continued for the delicate ears of the President, who has such an objection to any critical language against himself.  Anything becomes personal when it is only language contradicting and exposing the President's falsehoods.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We will have his name (the name of Deputy Cosgrave) spat upon as the names of Carey, Nagle, Leonard McNally, Pitt and Castlereagh, and every other man who betrayed the Irish people.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the language that is used of a man who had been President of this country for ten years.  That is how he was described by that foul tongue.</P>
    <P>And then there is the great rhetorical question asked at the end of that stream of abuse:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Would the people have faith in the oath of a Judas?  Would they be misled by the pledge of a Pitt or the promise of a Castlereagh?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the game.  That is the kind of argument on economics or finance, call your opponents traitors and bring in all that scurrility, scurrility on which was wasted many hours in going through the pages of Irish history in order to drag that together and to make these foul comparisons.</P>
    <P>That is the policy, and we got it repeated when the President went to Ennis on Saturday and Sunday, after <Col N="89" /> his great speech on Friday here, about first-class matters to which the House should give its attention.  His speech was not directed to matters of urgent first-class importance.  The local elections were the theme.  Did we have the local elections discussed with reference to the kind of people who should be preferred by the ratepayers, the kind of persons they should have before their minds in going to vote for local candidates, and the sort of services they must render as representatives of the ratepayers?  No. The British, we were told, are looking to the local elections, hoping that the Government will be dealt a mortal blow.  The British are looking to the local elections hoping that the Government will be dealt a mortal blow! When one remembers the Hailsham incident and the atrocious charge against General Mulcahy, one can appreciate these statements.  The President described Mr. Thomas's attitude at Ottawa when the news of the establishment of the Blueshirts reached him. &ldquo;We need not settle with you,&rdquo; Mr. Thomas said: &ldquo;You will be settled when the Blueshirts get under way.&rdquo; Mr. Thomas has often been spoken of here, credited with all sorts of feelings hostile to this country.  He has never been credited with having such gifts of prevision as that revealed by him at Ottawa in the autumn of 1932, when the news of the establishment of the Blueshirts reached him:&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>We will give the President his record.  There are too many of these slips.  Does the President remember the scurrilous story he circulated to the House about the meeting between General Mulcahy and Lord Hailsham in Glasgow?  The House will remember how he paraded that and preened himself that General Mulcahy could not deny it.  We remember then the President's lamentations that it was false.  The President himself used in the House here a quotation from the greatest imperialist poet in England about &ldquo;phrases that are twisted by knaves to make traps for fools.&rdquo; Which of these was the President about that time, a knave or a fool, or both?  Did he test the <i>bona fides</i> of the man who told him that story?  The man would give no evidence afterwards.  Did the President put him to the test as to whether he would give evidence before? Was it his hope, simply to throw the statement broadcast and to hope on?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is hypocrisy marking every line of the phrase that was supposed to envelop the hope that the story, now that he denied it, would no longer be <Col N="91" /> believed.  It was not mere rumour. The story was particularised.  Deputy Mulcahy had been to Scotland and had met the Minister for War.  The President could not tell us afterwards who his informant was.  He was given every chance to declare that he had made some examination; that he knew who that man's associates were; that he knew if he had ever given any stories of this kind before and found them either true or false.  He was asked to state whether the story that reached him was that Deputy Mulcahy had met Lord Hailsham in the street, had talked to him in a hotel or had met him in a private house.  He was asked did he know who were the associates of the man who had told the story, and could he say whether that man was likely to know either Deputy Mulcahy or Lord Hailsham. Did he apply any test that any fair-minded person would have subjected a scandalous story of that kind to before he gave it publicity in this House?  Did it not emerge from all that the President did not say that he was glad to get the rumour&mdash;the story of a wit&mdash; and that he did not make even the ordinary inquiries that a half-wit would have made before such a scandalous story was given lodgment in his head?</P>
    <P>That was part of the campaign. Deputy Cosgrave was a Judas&mdash; unclean, a Castlereagh in the company of the Leonard McNallys and Co. Deputy Mulcahy had to be defamed, too, and so we had the yarn: the story that was then told to the President, possibly by the knave who took him as the fool, the story which the President decided like a knave to give out here to the people&mdash;like the fools he deluded at Ennis with the tale of the Blueshirts at Ottawa.</P>
    <P>The President astonished this House on an occasion inside this year of office by telling us that he had been the victim of conspiracies all through his life, and in particular that he had been done out of a post for which his educational qualifications fitted him because of the conspiracies and stories that had been spread around about him as to his Jewish parentage.  I think it is an axiom amongst scientific <Col N="92" /> men that if there is a simple explanation for a particular thing you do not go looking for an abstruse explanation. There is a very obvious explanation as to why the President did not get this job.  It was not that he was a Jew and that somebody else was a Christian, but that he was a mathematician and that somebody else was a better one.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Part of my stock in trade?  I am applying this against the man who gave out that nonsensical statement about Mr. Thomas and the Blueshirts at Ottawa: the man who gave utterance and publicity to that foul slander about Deputy Mulcahy in this House, and who tried to get sympathy for himself in this House, in the course of a debate, by the nonsensical business that he was defeated for some post because of what I have said. The President has a habit of doing this thing.  There was a Bill introduced here to limit the powers of the Seanad. The President waited until the Fifth Stage before he made a certain statement with regard to it, and then he said that in the original draft of the Constitution the Seanad had less power than it had now.  Again, there was the usual innuendo that it was the British who forced the new clause about the Seanad: that it was the British who gave the Seanad powers which the Irish people, speaking through their Constitution Committee, never intended them to have.  He walked out of this House, having spoken on a late stage of the Bill when he could not be answered, and went to the Seanad.  He was confronted there by a member of the Constitution Committee who produced to him the draft of the Constitution and we never heard that argument since.  The scheme was there all the time&mdash;the scheme that is here&mdash; that if you cannot argue against a thing on the merits hint that the British did it and, in the tumult that will arise over that, you will not be asked to argue, you will not be asked to debate, you <Col N="93" /> will not be asked to put reason against reason or convince people by argument.</P>
      <P>The President made another attempt recently in a debate here on a Bill to abolish the Seanad.  The President came in with a simple proposal to abolish it.  As the debate wore on we dragged from him the admission that there were many valuable things in the Constitution which should be protected and secured.  We got him to accept two amendments&mdash;two ineffectual ones. But, again, the President adopted what has now become his favourite trick.  He concluded on the Fifth Stage when he could not be answered here.  He posed as a man who had read deeply into political philosophy, into the history of political thought and he had quotations from many people whose names he felt would carry weight for the doctrines they were supposed to be attached to.  The President walked out of this place and went to the Seanad. On the Second Stage of the Bill there he was met with this speech of his.  It was analysed.  He got in the Seanad a skinning that no calf in this country would envy him.  He found there were perversions in that speech: that men who in phrases distinct and clear had announced themselves to be in favour of bicameral government were put down by the President as being in favour of a Single Chamber: men who had merely collected the arguments of what other people said in favour of a Single Chamber Government have been presented to this House as if they were in favour only of Single Chamber Government.  When the Seanad was being discussed here, what was the most frequent argument used against them until the Fifth Stage when this laboured attempt&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am speaking of the President's line of activity.  If I may not make my remarks concrete by giving instances, I will have to do what the President himself does: throw out hints and let people read into them whatever meaning they may.  Apart from quotations from debates in this House, is it not notorious that the great weapon of the President, in his attempts to get public sympathy behind him in the economic war that he is waging at the moment, is to represent all his opponents as being imbued with only one anxiety, and that is the anxiety to help the people of another country?  Have not names been brought into such a wrangle as that?  Have not the names of certain Senators been brought into such an atmosphere?  Was the President, who is so fond of talking about secret agreements, able to deny the challenge thrown down here, that certain Senators who were maligned in this House because they were supposed to be in favour of England, had been approached by him or some of his Ministers to enter upon secret negotiations about Christmas time, 1932?  The President is puzzled. Let me relieve him.  There was a phrase used here about two named Senators.  I asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he would relieve from any honourable obligations as to secrecy any member of the Seanad with whom he, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, had been in negotiation and, through those people, in negotiation with England round about Christmas, 1932, with a view to settling the economic war?  The President knows nothing of that! The President does know that he used these men before, that he described them as single-hearted Irishmen, good Irishmen, having only the single-hearted idea of doing good to their country. I do not believe the President is unaware of what happened round about Christmas, 1932.  If the President professes not to know, will he, in the absence of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, say that if anyone believes that he has information on the <Col N="95" /> subject, and who feels that he is bound by any obligation of honourable secrecy, he will absolve him, and leave him free to speak and to state the details of these negotiations?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not a secret. I got it from exactly the same source as the Minister for Industry and Commerce. Will the President answer? Will he say if he knew anything of such negotiations?  Will the President say openly, here, that if any man feels bound by any obligation of secrecy in relation to anything that happened about negotiations with England round about Christmas, 1932, that that man can speak?  Apparently, he will not. According to him, Mr. Thomas had his eyes on the Blueshirts; the British have their eyes on the local elections, and are terribly concerned about this country.  President de Valera is always at arm's length, but Ministers may connive and plot and may have engaged in negotiations that the people of this country so long for.  What was suggested? What reply was given?  Was there any modification of the former British terms?  To what details did these negotiations go, how finally broken off, or are there still feelers out?  Better not speak of these things. A man could hardly go to Ennis&mdash;at least an ordinary man&mdash;to talk that sort of rubbish about what Mr. Thomas said at Ottawa about the establishment of the Blueshirts&mdash;&ldquo;We do not care,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Wait until the Blueshirts get on their way&rdquo;&mdash;without a great deal of brazenness.  At any rate, he knows now that Ministers at the time I am speaking of, did try to get terms from Britain.  That is a subject we must keep quiet about, because there may be further queries, whether these attempts have been ever renewed or whether anything came of them.  What is there behind all the bluff of getting this country completely free; making excuses about getting Britain and everyone else we do not like out of Ulster, and making ourselves so self-sufficient and so strong that we can declare that republic that no one at <Col N="96" /> the moment seems anxious to say a word about?  The President, in the course of a manifesto to the electors, promised, in addition to all the savings of money, new economic policies, and better times for everybody, also this:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We pledge ourselves further not to use our majority to pursue a vindictive course against any minority, but to govern fairly in the interests of every section of the community.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;All citizens will be treated as equal before the law, and the individual will be protected in his property and in his person with all the resources at the Government's command.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;All citizens will be treated as equal before the law!&rdquo; The President has a Minister for Justice who spoke during the week-end and indicated what I presume is the line of policy that the President of the Executive Council approves of in relation to law and order in the country.  He said, when speaking either at Bonniconlon, Attymass, Culleens, Lacken or Ballycastle:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;He had as much sympathy and probably more understanding about the I.R.A. than most people, and he wanted to tell any members of the I.R.A. present that if there was a change of Government in the morning, and the present Government was defeated, in 24 hours the whole of the I.R.A. would be mopped up.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is not his old form.  The shoe would be on the other foot four years ago, and it would be quite a fair chance that the I.R.A. would have mopped up everyone, even Deputy Donnelly.  If it was not for the Minister for Justice the I.R.A. could be mopped up in 24 hours.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;He was appealing to them to realise that position.  There was not a thing that happened at an I.R.A. meeting that he was not informed of before 24 hours.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I don't act on it.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister is in a Government which in its manifeste to the people declared:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;All citizens will be treated equal before the law, and the individual <Col N="97" /> will be protected in his property and in his person with all the resources at the Government's command.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice has resources at his command which would mop up the whole of the I.R.A. in 24 hours. He knows everything that happens at I.R.A. meetings within 24 hours.  He does not act on it.  I hope he will explain where he stands.  He went on:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I hope you will understand the spirit in which this is said...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>And I suppose this was intended for some of the Fianna Fáil Deputies who were standing beside him:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;He would love to see an organisation built up standing loyally for a Republican ideal and standing for a disciplined objective.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We know of the incident at Drogheda. We have even discussed it here.  We know also of the meeting in Parnell Square.  We have even been told that the meeting in Parnell Square was called, that the Government had information that certain I.R.A. officers discussed meeting there or discussed the making of a land mine and that that meeting&mdash;which has not been denied&mdash; had a connection with an explosion which took place the Sunday after at Dundalk.  We have never had any denial that the meeting took place, and we have never got anyone to deny that the meeting was called for the construction of, to get instruction in how to construct, a land mine.  Only one point was denied, and that was that the meeting had anything to do with the explosion that took place in Dundalk.  A woman was killed, a boy lost his eye, and another boy was in hospital for some time.  The Minister for Justice says he knows everything the I.R.A. are doing within 24 hours. The Minister for Justice, who was prepared to protect everyone in his person and in his property, with all the resources at the disposal of the Government&mdash;that is an example of equal administration of the law towards all the people of the country.  The Minister went on to reassure the I.R.A.:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;He wished to tell them, if there were people there interested in the I.R.A., that they were pursuing a <Col N="98" /> hopeless line of attack in the manner they were pursuing it at the present time.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Let us assume that he addressed the men who met in Parnell Square to construct the land mine.  Is that what equal administration of the law means &mdash;that if a circular is sent out asking people to meet for a particular purpose and that purpose is known, the Minister thinks that situation is met by that mild word of reproof&mdash;that &ldquo;they are pursuing a hopeless line of attack in the manner in which they are pursuing it at the present time&rdquo;?  Is that all that the people's sense of justice demands?  Is that what is offered to them to satisfy it?  Is that what is given to them instead of the retribution which is one of the aims of the law in punishing malefactors, that it does satisfy the desire for justice in the community, that if one man commits a criminal act which causes an old woman's death, that that man should be hanged if he can be got, and not that the Minister for Justice should merely say to him: &ldquo;I think you are pursuing a hopeless line of attack in the manner in which you are pursuing it at the present time&rdquo;?  Is that what, say, the parents of the little boy who lost his eye would expect from the President's equal administration of the law, if they ever envisaged such a thing happening?</P>
    <P>Analyse that speech.  It is not that the Minister is failing to get information. He knows everything they do, and he has sufficient power at his control.  A new Government coming in presumably would have the same resources the present Government has, and they &ldquo;could mop up the I.R.A. in 24 hours.&rdquo;</P>

That is not being done, and it is not for <Col N="99" /> lack of information.  The Minister does not want to be amongst the renegades. He is not going to be amongst the Castlereaghs, the Leonard McNallys or the Judases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I can deny it in respect of that; it is the one place the Deputy was not in.  There is the policy of equal justice.  We have seen that exemplified in several cases that were brought along.  We had the case of the men who had guns that they got form an illegal source and which they gave back to the people from whom they got them.  They have been tried for having arms without a permit, and counsel, acting on the advice of the Attorney-General, suggested that the prosecution should not go on, and the whole case has been adjourned for 12 months.  There was no allegation that these rifles were not lethal weapons, that they could not fire bullets, and that they could not kill people.  A member of another organisation was brought up, charged with having a gun which a military expert, who was brought in to give his view about it, pronounced as obsolete.  The President of the Military Tribunal declared that it was obsolete in his view and that it could not have injured anybody. Was there any attempt by the man who appeared for the Attorney-General to get that prosecution adjourned or the sentence remitted?  The same prosecutor, who asked that the other case should be adjourned for 12 months, said in this case that it was not for the prisoner to determine whether the rifle was useful or obsolete.  He pressed the <Col N="100" /> charge and the man was adjudged guilty.  That is another example of the equal administration, another example of the way in which, under the President's sway, law and order have been preserved in this country.</P>
      <P>These two speeches definitely give the keynote to everything.  The members of the Government must be allowed to say: &ldquo;We never reneged from the I.R.A. policy.  We are as good as you are; we are going to declare an independent Republic as soon as we can, but we are going to be the judges of the time.  We know everything you are doing, but we think that you are pursuing a hopeless line of policy.&rdquo; It would not be more brazen if the Minister for Justice were to say: &ldquo;We knew everything that happened at Parnell Square but we prosecuted none of you.&rdquo; When the President at the same time, at Ennis, tells the fools there that Mr. Thomas said something at Ottawa in 1932 about an organisation that was not founded for twelve months afterwards, he expects to be believed in the same way as he expected to be believed in his fantasy about the meeting between Deputy Mulcahy and Lord Hailsham, and in his researches into history in relation to political thinkers, and even in his researches into the Constitution of this country in the matter of the powers which the Seanad had.</P>
      <P>The President indicated his view towards the people of this country on many occasions.  He said that</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;During the ten years since the Treaty was forced upon us, there have been put on the Statute Book of the Free State no less than six Public Safety Acts, three Firearms Acts, three Infringement of Law Acts, four Jury Acts, one Treasonable Offences Act, one Protection of the Community Act, and the Perpetual Coercion Act recently passed entitled the Constitution (Amendment No. 17) Act.  Like the British Acts, these Acts have brought only trouble&mdash;confusion, turmoil, disorder. We propose to try the experiment of ruling by ordinary law instead of these extraordinary expedients.  Our people are law-abiding, law-loving people once they recognise the lawmen <Col N="101" /> making authority is legitimate and that the laws are fundamentally just. Nothing is more valuable to us than internal peace and the stable conditions which it can bring.  We must secure it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It was a good line of propaganda to condemn these six Public Safety Acts, the three Infringement of Law Acts and the four Jury Acts, but how many has the President repealed? How many has the President, on his own initiative, removed from the Statute Book?  How many of them has he not recently brought in as the foundation for charges against members of a political Party opposed to him?  Is his proposal to try the experiment of ruling by the ordinary law instead of by these &ldquo;extraordinary expedients?&rdquo; Is that what his Minister for Justice was talking about in Mayo during the week-end?  Does he now believe that our people are a law-abiding, law-loving people or is he convinced in the end that they do not recognise that the law-making authority is legitimate or that the laws themselves are fundamentally just?  Does the Minister for Justice appeal to the I.R.A. as a law-abiding, law-loving people, about whose activities he knows everything and against whom he can move such powers as would wipe them out in 24 hours? Are they the only section of the community that would be regarded as law-loving and law-abiding?  Are they the only people who would be allowed to have these meetings in Parnell Square and elsewhere and have their victims, and the law not have its retribution?</P>
    <P>The President said at New Ross in the early part of 1934:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;They did not believe that in this country they were so vicious minded that there was a large section of the people that had to be governed by Coercion Acts.  That was the British attitude to the country.  Was it to be their fate in this country that they were always to have Irish Governments like that?  Could they not hope to have a Government of their own that would be regardful of the Irish people and give fair <Col N="102" /> play to all sections?  He believed that there was no hope for the country until the day came when an Irish Government could govern by ordinary laws and not by extraordinary laws and Coercion Acts.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Is that in line with this scandalous speech that was made by the Minister for Justice during the last week-end? The Minister for Justice had not reneged on his old I.R.A. feelings. He warned them that he knew everything about them.  He told them that he did not act on his information, but that if other people did come into office who had the same information that he had, the whole I.R.A. could be mopped up in 24 hours.  While that is being done the President is down at Ennis, trying again to get the last ounce out of this campaign of scurrility that his Ministers indulged in a half-year ago&mdash;with his talk about the British people having their eyes on the local elections and giving them the specific instance, in the popular language or slang attributed to Mr. Thomas, in order to give the appearance of truthfulness to a piece of blatant humbug that he is supposed to have said: &ldquo;We need not settle with you; you will be settled with when the Blueshirts get under way.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Strangely enough, the Minister for Justice decides to tell the people that, after all, the Blueshirts are not so strong; that there are only 22,000 of them, and that he had that information from official sources.  The man who led, and who leads the Blueshirts, was referred to by the President as an outsider. At least, he has been inside as long as the President in national matters in this country.</P>

      <P>Certainly.  Let us count the men who stayed here all the time.  We might value that a bit higher, with some deviations, but what did he do to merit the term &ldquo;outsider?&rdquo; The present Minister for <Col N="103" /> Finance referred to the same individual as &ldquo;the menace.&rdquo; He said that the Ministry ought to be allowed to settle down to their job of carrying out their economic policy instead of having to deal with this menace of General O'Duffy.  Yet we are told that there are only about 22,000 Blueshirts, that General O'Duffy is an outsider&mdash;that the Ministry know all about it and have it as official information.  There never was a Government of such strength in theory and such weakness in practice.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Justice says: &ldquo;We have not reneged an ounce in our policy.&rdquo; What is the policy?  He says: &ldquo;We are going to declare an independent republic for the whole of Ireland as quickly as we can achieve it.&rdquo; The Vice-President had a plan for that earlier.  He was going to shoot Ulster out.  That was an official statement, although the Vice-President can smile at it now.</P>

      <P>Extremely so.  The Minister for Justice says that they are going to declare an independent republic for the whole of Ireland as quickly as they can achieve it.  The President told us on Friday that: &ldquo;We had freedom with shackles, and the shackles were being struck off one by one.&rdquo; The Vice-President and his colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, parading down the country like brothers (of some type) in arms, said that we had knocked off a great many of the shackles.  We must be bursting out into some sort of freedom.  Would it not be better to tell the I.R.A. that?</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;is in having contempt for the present Government. We hear that some of the shackles have been lopped off.  We had one remarkable change this year.  A new Minister came to our shores and presented his credentials to the President and not to the Governor-General.  To whom was he accredited?  Is it that the President has at last taken delight in representing His Majesty personally? Did he get a foreign Minister, who is accredited to the King, to go to the President instead of putting him at least one remove and sending him out to Blackrock to the Governor-General? Is that the shackle that has been lopped off this year?  Is that what we are going to dangle before the noses of the I.R.A.?  The shackles are to be lopped off one by one, we are told. The President then, in a burst of anxiety to let the people know the worst, tells us on Friday that the two big things that count are that British troops are in some of our ports in this country and that the Six Counties are cut off from us.  Can we make a gloss on the statement of the Minister for Justice in Mayo last Sunday, where he said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We stand for an independent republic for the whole of Ireland as quickly as we can achieve it,&rdquo;</P>
      <P>and say that that date will come only when all foreign troops and hostile people are removed from our boundaries and the Six Counties restored to us?  Is that the date?  How many shackles have we lopped off this year that are leading us speedily towards the achievement of those two things?</P>
      <P>The President says further:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;One of the things that the present Government was doing by its present economic policy was to get into a position of strength before the final cutting off would take place as, <Col N="105" /> he was sure, it ultimately would, whatever the relationship entered into afterwards.  It was becoming easier as time went on.  The ultimate cutting would take place, to his mind, ... and the Government, in developing a policy of self-sufficiency and independence of the British market, was preparing the country so that when the time came for the snapping of the connection they would have less reactions and the nation would suffer less.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is what we are at now.  That could be cynically expressed this way: that we are getting the people reduced to such a point of impoverishment that they will not care what happens&mdash;Republic or not&mdash;that the people will be so stripped that no political situation can be worse than what they will find themselves in, and that with a few more flauntings of the Blueshirts and of the alleged statements of Mr. Thomas and all the rest of it, we can get them to believe that the British are responsible for everything.  How is the country getting on towards this self-sufficiency?  Where is the great strength that is developing in us to such an extent that when the cutting-off from Britain comes we will feel it less?</P>
    <P>Are there any external marks or any objective signs to which we can point to show that we are stronger than we were a year or two years ago? I notice that the President, at Ennis, put another twist on the question regarding the British market and its exact position in relation to us&mdash; whether it is only going or whether it has gone.  The President said: &ldquo;It is not as good as it used to be and it never will.&rdquo; That is the new phrase.  It is an improvement.  There was, at any rate, a note of regret in the Ennis speech.  The President, when he spoke here ten or 11 months ago, thanked God the British market was gone.  Some of his Ministers went so far as to say that the thing that was sapping our economic strength was the fact that we were so orientated that we always looked to Britain to buy our goods instead of being sturdy <Col N="106" /> and self-reliant and having our eyes fixed on the home market.  The President does believe that the British market will never be as good as it used to be.  That may be, but it is still as good as we want it to be.  It has not yet been absorbed by the surplus products of other countries. In the old days, of which the President now a little regretfully speaks, when the British were consuming £330,000,000 worth of meat, they produced at home less than half.  Of the odd £160,000,000 worth of that type of goods which they had to import, we sent in only £30,000,000 worth. That market could have wasted, relative to us, by £130,000,000 a year and yet be good enough for us.  That wasting could have occurred either because the British people were producing at home or British consuming and purchasing powers had gone.  So long as there is still room for £30,000,000 worth of exports from this country and we have the goods to supply, so long is that market a good one for us.  We may deny ourselves the value of that market.  We may do that in order to make them regret some sort of separation from us, but we are not harming them.  Many countries are scrambling to get into that market.  Many countries are willing to make trade treaties to get into that market.  There is, certainly, going to be no famine in England because Irish goods no longer go in there.  There may be something approaching famine in Irish houses if we cannot get rid of that type of exportable surplus by selling it to England, if we cannot send it anywhere else and cannot get any alternative method of production to give these people the return that used to come from the export of that surplus to Great Britain.</P>
    <P>Where are the signs of this growing strength?  Our trade has collapsed. The President has his 8d. per cow argument, which will probably be trotted out again.  Whatever be the force of that argument, it has this effect in the present circumstances: The British boast&mdash;we cannot deny it &mdash;that they allow into their country so much live stock of ours as will bring in the full tot of the annuities <Col N="107" /> and withheld moneys and, after that, they have a quota system.  The Minister for Defence announced the truth, as it hit him, the week-end before last, when he said that Britain must continue to get this money from us as long as we continue to send her any of our produce.  We can only beat Britain when we get to the point that we are not exporting anything to her, so that she cannot put on a tariff and cannot make any levy on the price of our produce.  Is that what we are aiming at&mdash;to have no export from this country&mdash;or is the economic statement of the Minister for Defence denied&mdash;that as long as we continue to send our products to England, so long will England be able, by tariffs or by penal fines upon our produce, to collect all this money previously taken from her?  Have we gained any new economy?  We have had tariffs, subsidies, quotas, prohibitions and Government credit.  We have had fostering of industry by every means by which the Government finds that possible.  Even then, the Minister for Industry and Commerce could only boast&mdash;I do not accept his figures&mdash; that in two years he had put into employment in industry the same number of people as, in its last year, the Cosgrave Government put into industry without the help of these terrifically high tariffs, quotas, and prohibitions.  Even if we accept the boast of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, it only establishes that if he keeps up the proportion that he achieved in the first two years, when the numbers ought to be greater, he can get people into industry at the rate of 10,000 a year.  We are told that the people who used to emigrate and who have now to stay at home number 30,000 a year.  So that, with all our tariffs, if we accept the figures of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, which he has not yet fortified by the stamp account which he promised to produce, he gets about 10,000 into employment each year&mdash;if that continues&mdash;and he has an extra 30,000 per annum to provide for.  So we had an unemployment assistance measure.  So we had, for the first <Col N="108" /> time in this country, except for a period just after the British left, the system of dole.  We have workers being given money in lieu of work by a Government which promised them work&mdash;work at good trade union wages without any nonsense about evaluating a man's means, deducting whatever he got from 15/- and giving him the residue.  It was to be work at trade union wages.  84,000 people per annum were promised employment and that only in some of the industries in which employment could be got. In two years, even accepting the boast of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, less than a fourth of these have got employment.  If we believe the same Minister's figures, over 60,000 who used to emigrate remain at home.  Where is the advantage in the changed economy?</P>
    <P>We have lost our trade, so far as agricultural products are concerned. We have got no great increase in business or industry.  We have people being carried on the dole for the first time in the history of the State and we have got the definite realisation by the Ministry this year that certain taxes had approached saturation point.  Sixpence has been taken off income tax, not for love of the people who pay that tax, but because the Ministry had to confess that the extra money they put on&mdash;three sixpences the year before&mdash;had failed, by £800,000 a year, to produce the amount that used to be produced by the tax on incomes.  We are going to make the people so strong economically, so self-sufficient that when the day comes for getting the British out of our ports&mdash;however that is going to be done&mdash;and for getting those hostile to our ideas out of Ulster&mdash;however that is going to be done&mdash;we will not mind any hardship that may be imposed upon us by our efforts to achieve these two objects.  The President has given us a way for getting this tested.  The President, as a mathematician, spoke here in March, 1931, when the Vote on Account for that year was being taken and he gave us a criterion by which to judge the effects of certain taxation on the people of the country and, for the third time, I want to <Col N="109" /> recall it to his memory.  In that year, the actual increase shown in the Estimates was somewhere in the region of £150,000 and the President complained that the Estimate which showed that figure on its face was a misleading misrepresentation of the facts to the people.  Speaking in the Dáil on 18th March, 1931, as reported in Column 1652 onwards of the Official Debates, he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;With reference to all these indices we find that the actual increase is very much greater, and the burden on the community is very much greater than is indicated by that increase.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He prefaced that by saying:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We find, as I have said at the outset, that the Estimates, as introduced this year, show an actual increase of £138,646.  That is not a fair picture of the situation at all, because in the interval we know that the value of money as shown by the cost of living indices, or the wholesale prices which the farmer gets for his produce, has appreciated.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then, applying this, he says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;So that instead of coming down, the fact is that the cost of all these services has gone up, and, with increased cost in other directions, one would have expected that the Minister for Finance would not ignore directions in which substantial savings could be made.</P>
    <P>Then, we have the mathematics of the situation:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Between January, 1930, and January, 1931, there was a 7.3 per cent. fall in the cost of living.  If we take that into account and make a corresponding reduction in the Estimate as introduced last year the reduction would amount to £1,728,000, or, in other words, this year's Estimate&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>that which showed an increase of only £138,000 on its face&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;represents an increase of that amount.  There was a 19.6 per cent. fall in wholesale prices between January, 1930 and January, 1931.  If we make a corresponding reduction in the Estimate as introduced last <Col N="110" /> year we find that this year's Estimate represents an increase of £4,460,000 odd.  There is a 16.2 per cent reduction in the index of wholesale food prices.  Taking that figure we find that the Estimate represents an advance of £3,667,000 odd.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This was the gem of it:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If we take into account the decrease in the price of the produce which the farmer, who is our largest taxpayer, has to dispose of&mdash;take the fall in the price of fat cattle in the Dublin market between March, 1930, and March, 1931&mdash;we find that it represents to him&mdash;the person who has to sell cattle in order to provide for taxation&mdash;an increase of £3,362,000.  If we take fat sheep similarly this year as compared with March, 1930, we find there is a fall of 27.5 per cent., and it would represent a total increase to him of over £6,000,000.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That should be pondered on.  The Estimate shows an increase of £138,000. The President took as his test of the accuracy of that which appears on the face of the Estimate, the price got in the Dublin market for fat cattle.  He took that because, he said, the men who are producing fat cattle were our biggest taxpayers and produced cattle to help to pay taxation.  The prices they got had gone down in the meantime to such a point that this £138,000 increase in fact meant, in actual weight, on the man who was selling his cattle for so much less, an increase of £3,362,000.  If we take the price of fat cattle to-day, as compared with what they were, say, about this time in 1931, there is at least a drop of 50 per cent. Has our Estimate been reduced?  It is up by over £4,000,000.  If we take the President's test of the prices which our main producers&mdash;the men who produce cattle to help to pay the taxation of this country&mdash;get for those cattle, that supposed increase of £4,000,000 represents an increase of £8,000,000. We could run through all the other figures in the same way, but it is notable that, in the month of March, 1931, the President looked on the men who produce cattle <Col N="111" /> for the British market as the mainstay of this population, the people who help to pay the taxation, the people who help to provide the Government services.  His heart bled for them then.  The prices they were getting were not comparable with the prices they used to get, and we had this mind of his let loose upon the problem and a supposed increase of £138,000 was worked out to be an increase of £3,362,000.</P>
    <P>Let us apply that test, not for the sake of arguing further about taxation and about the amount by which the people are overtaxed at the moment, but simply as coming to this: Are the people, represented by these cattle people, now becoming so strong that when we cut ourselves adrift from England they will not feel the pinch?  Have they become better off financially? Have they some new type of agricultural economy to which they can turn?  Is it a gainful occupation? Is it gainful in the sense that the prices got in the open market in competition, as these used to be got, are giving a return over the cost of production, or are they something subsidised, something they will pay for in part themselves?  How many people are turning to the new economy?  Out of every thousand employed in this country, there used to be 530 employed in agriculture and about 130 in industry.  Have the proportions changed?  Are we getting anything like to a position, say, in which there are 300 in each and in which we are having fewer employed in agriculture and there are more on the dole? How many more have we in industry? Does it raise appreciably the figure of 153 per 1,000 occupied?  How many, in addition, are there on the dole who were never in any occupation whatever, agricultural or industrial, and how many of these have any hope of getting an occupation in this country under the new economy?</P>
    <P>The President would rather have from Mr. Thomas than from Deputy MacDermot the statement that if we did break loose there would be no military action, and in order to find out where the truth was in that matter, <Col N="112" /> about the time when the Fourth National Loan was launched, he wrote a blundering despatch and sent it across the water.  It was published during the week in which the Fourth National Loan was being looked for, and the Fourth National Loan was a failure. It was subscribed to the extent of only 50 per cent., and that was after the fire-eating Minister for Finance had gone to the Chamber of Commerce and wrapt himself in all the folds of any Commonwealth flag.  The President, at that time, decided to ask Mr. Thomas whether &ldquo;they have decided not treat as a cause of war or other aggressive action the decision of the Irish people to sever their connection with the Commonwealth.&rdquo; The next time the Minister for Justice wants to talk at a meeting about and to the I.R.A., will he go and tell them that he is not reneging an ounce of the old time policy about freedom and independence in this country; that the men in 1916 only stood where the Minister for Justice now stands; that their action in going into the Post Office and flaunting out in rebellion had, in fact, behind it something corresponding to what President de Valera tried to hide behind in December of last year; and that the men of 1916, before they decided to take aggressive action, wrote a letter to a Secretary of State in Britain, asking him, &ldquo;supposing there was a rebellion in this country against British authority and force, would it be treated as hostile, and would there be aggressive action following it?&rdquo;</P>

      <P>&ldquo;We stand for independence&mdash;an independent republic for the whole of Ireland as quickly as we can achieve it.&rdquo; So said the Minister for Justice in Mayo during the last week-end.  In December of last year President de Valera wrote to the Secretary of State for the Dominions: &ldquo;We infer from your statement that the British Government have decided not to treat as a cause of war or other aggressive action the decision of the Irish people to sever their connection with the Commonwealth.&rdquo; President de Valera, speaking here in this House the other day, said:</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Are these three statements reconcilable? Are these three statements in line?  Is there the same spirit behind all three of them?  There is about as much truth in that as there is in this business about Mr. Thomas at Ottawa saying: &ldquo;The Blueshirts will settle you people when they get under way.&rdquo; This is as reported in the President's own paper.  He described Mr. Thomas's attitude at Ottawa, when the news of the establishment of the Blueshirts reached him: &ldquo;We need not settle with you.  You will be settled when the Blueshirts get under way.&rdquo; I do not know whether it was in the same context, but the following is given underneath <Col N="114" /> that heading: &ldquo;Referring to the local elections, he said the British were looking to them to give the Government a mortal blow.&rdquo; Is that honest politics?

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should go back to that.  I am glad the Deputy did not let me sit down without reciting it. The manifesto did say this: &ldquo;We believe in decentralisation of Government and in leaving to the local authorities as much power as possible.&rdquo; And we have dismissed how many?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Four only! We believe in giving them as much power as possible, even so far as striking a mortal blow at the Government by turning out their adherents, but we think they are not doing their duty and we will, therefore, abolish them if we fancy that is the way to sweep out of a county anti-Government feeling, disgust, nausea and, possibly, depression! People cannot see their calves skinned and laugh the whole day.  &ldquo;We believe in decentralisation of Government and leaving to the local authorities as much power as possible&rdquo;&mdash;even the power to conduct local affairs according to their lights. I have a quotation here from the President, which is appropriate to this matter.  In September of last year certain farmers were tried for&mdash;may I put it generally?&mdash;indulging in a no-rent campaign.  I think some of those councils are supposed to have been dissolved because of a no-rent campaign. The Attorney-General, speaking down the country, I think, during the week-end, said he knew people who were openly, as well as those who were secretly, encouraging a no-rate campaign. Now there was one trial about that.  There was only one trial about the encouragement of a campaign for the non-payment of rates.  Certain <Col N="115" /> Waterford farmers were tried before the Military Tribunal, and while their trial was on the President made a speech at Dundalk on September 10th in which he said that there was &ldquo;an illegal conspiracy and an endeavour to intimidate farmers into signing a pledge to pay no rent or rates.&rdquo; He gave the way in which that campaign was being organised&mdash;&ldquo;by circulating a list of boycotted persons to owners of threshing machines.&rdquo; It is an unfortunate coincidence that the nine Waterford farmers were charged with being parties to a campaign for the non-payment of rates, and that it was alleged against them that they had circulated to owners of threshing machines a list of boycotted persons. Despite that very serious attempt by the President on September 10th to distort the views of the Military Tribunal who were trying those men, the Tribunal still found the nine farmers not guilty.  There has been no charge since made and no other man paraded for such a conspiracy.  Remember that the charge against them was bound up with the very particulars which the President stated in Dundalk, yet the President could tell us that his words were of general import and had no reference to the trial of the nine Waterford farmers.  We asked him were there other cases pending and he said &ldquo;No.&rdquo; We asked him were there other cases being investigated in which lists of boycotted persons were circulated to owners of threshing machines, and he said there were not.  It was not possible, therefore, to get cases, and despite the President's attempt&mdash; which amounted to contempt of the Military Tribunal&mdash;to interfere with the case that was pending before them, the men were found not guilty and no further charges of that type have been brought.  The Minister has another way&mdash;a local inquiry within a fortnight of an election, in which his Party might not fare too well, and then dissolution of the local authority.  That is in line with the promise of decentralisation of Government and giving to the local authorities as much power as possible!</P>

      <P>This is part of the administration of a Government that promised to give as much power as possible to the local authorities.  I will take the facts of any one of those councils if the Vice-President will have the matter argued.  An inquiry was held.  Has the inspector's report been produced?  Will the inspector's report be made public?  Will we be told what the inspector found?  Will we get a statement from the inspector, based upon evidence given at the inquiry, in the phrase used here so frequently, that it was because they were encouraging a campaign in relation to the non-payment of rates?  Is that a finding of fact by the inspector in those cases and about whom has he so found?  Was there any likelihood, if those people had been behaving in that way, that the elections on the 26th June would have cleared them out?  In any event, should not people who prate so much about democracy have given the electorate a fortnight hence a chance to have their say?  Supposing there had been a case as black as night proved against those councils, they were within three weeks of dissolution in the ordinary course of events.  If it was for sins that had been committed by them, say, in the last six or eight months, should not the electorate be the first body allowed to pronounce upon them? Whatever a Conservative or Tory might think of that doctrine, surely a democrat would agree that if a council were to be dissolved for not attending to their duty the people who have elected them to do their duty should be <Col N="117" /> the first to have a say in condemnation of them, and they should not be protected from the people's anger, to be shown by the casting of a vote against them, by the Minister's action, taken on the report of an inspector which is not produced to the public, or the evidence backing it, and where whatever was made public in the newspapers certainly does not back up the contention that these men failed in their duty in respect to the collection of rates.  It is all on a par with the rest of this.</P>

      <P>Possibly.  There may be an accident with an umbrella, but nothing with a gun.  Is it not time that this rubbish of Blueshirts at Ottawa, which is only a tail to the other campaign that everybody who opposes the Government is a traitor and is actuated by hostility to his own country and by liking for another country, was stopped?  Is it not time that the President, on his own Vote, if he is going to speak of secret agreements or going to raise more bogies about secret agreements, and if people talk about Blueshirts and the British having their eye on the local elections, should give us the other side of it and tell us whether on any occasion, and how often, Ministers of his have tried to get into communication with members <Col N="118" /> of the British Government with a view to a settlement of this business; and whether, on each and all of these occasions, they have stated that there would be no settlement until this country was a free and independent republic and that the sway of the republic was over Thirty-Two Counties?  If Ministers are not prepared to tell us that themselves, will they say that, if there is any man who finds his freedom of speech hampered by the thought that he is bound to secrecy over certain matters, that man need no longer regard these obligations, but may speak freely as to what he knows?  Let us get definitely before the people, before the elections come on, so that they may have some view of theirs expressed through that electorate, whether or not there was an attempt to get in touch with the British Government, what were the terms asked, and the terms offered.  If we are not told that, I certainly am not going to indulge in any argument with anybody who talks about secret documents.  As long as there are secret negotiations going on, or completed, or about to be resumed, so long can we disregard any of those statements about documents which were debated in this House on six occasions, and in the Seanad on five more; so long can we neglect any agreement about the land annuities which, as has been stated here to-day, was embodied in a Command Paper and presented to the British House of Commons in July, 1923.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the President wants any more dramatic gestures with documents, will he produce from its hiding place, with all the glosses and the re-writings and the blank pages, Document No. 2, which will make as good a showing as any document he has pigeon-holed?  It may have ragged edges or dirty, soiled pages, but it would be interesting to the people again to see that what the President, who now speaks about our ports being occupied by English troops, offered at the time of the Treaty settlement as an alternative included that very thing.  When the President goes on to tell us, as I am sure he will tell us, of the great advance made in our freedom this year, when he got the <Col N="119" /> representative of a foreign country to come to himself, the President, as the King's representative, instead of going to his Governor-General, will he produce for us his copy of Document No. 2, and underline in blue pencil that proposal of his to pay from the finances of the Irish Free State, gathered from the Irish taxpayer, a certain sum into to the King's Privy Purse, for his support and maintenance I suppose? It might not be a very good document to produce at this time.  I do not know whether the President has ever thought of it, but certainly at the end of 1921 and the beginning of 1922 it went through a variety of changes and, in the end, I think it was metaphorically torn up, but it had been produced as an alternative.  The President, when he talks about secret documents, must often wish that that could have been kept secret.  He did his best to keep it secret.</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>It might be as well if we did start with these secret documents. <Col N="120" /> One of the things that have been brought against the Government is that we proclaimed, if you please, an economic war against Great Britain. All the responsibility for this so-called war has been laid on the shoulders of this Government.  On Friday I brought along the document which was made by Mr. Thomas the basis of this war.  At the moment of adjournment I was about to go over the history of this famous document.  It was signed, I think, on 12th February, 1923, and we first heard of it, or saw it as a whole, nine years afterwards when, as the result of a communication from Mr. Thomas, we were told that this, as well as a later document of 1926, was the formal and explicit undertaking which he held committed us to the payment of these moneys in dispute. The first document which I showed here is a monument to the efficiency of the people who are criticising us for our inefficiency, a monument to the care of an Executive Council that, now in opposition, wants to pretend that it was possible for a worse Executive Council to come into existence.  This document which was going to commit us to these annual payments was a thing that any Executive Council should be ashamed of, as regards its manner, its appearance, the way in which the commitments which we are supposed to meet are contained in it, and, generally, the way in which its terms were withheld from the Irish people for over a period of nine years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If, as one of the Deputies on the opposite benches wanted to pretend, this was of such a value to our country that it relieved us of a huge annual payment, why be so modest about it?  Why hide your light under a bushel for nine years?  Does not the very fact that you did not communicate it to the Irish people prove in itself that you were ashamed of it, that you had done something that you knew public opinion would not support you in doing?  It was withheld from the public.  It was asked for by the British, who wanted it in a certain connection.  They asked might they publish it.  Oh, no, it would be politically inconvenient, they were told, to publish it even two years <Col N="121" /> afterwards, in 1925.  It would not suit the political book of the Executive then in office here to tell the Irish people that this engagement had been entered into.  No, it was much easier to go around the country at that time and pretend that these payments made to England were due on another basis altogether; that this was merely a payment by tenant farmers over to the bond holders; that it was a private debt and that this document on which Mr. Thomas now relies and on the basis of which he has launched this economic war was simply a matter of supererogation altogether; in fact, that it had nothing to do with the case.  This famous document, also, was not referred to the counsel who had been briefed at the time of the election in order to try to make it appear to the Irish people that there was a good legal case for the payment of these moneys to Britain, when, after a period of years, we had explained the position to the people and had shown it was not a private debt but a payment from one Government to another. That document, which Mr. Thomas says is fundamental, was not given at all to the counsel who were briefed to give an opinion which might be spread at the election which was imminent as an indication of their policy.</P>
    <P>Mr. Thomas relies on another document. Remember that document was not given to these counsel at all, whose opinion was to be put as against the opinion which we put forward. Our opinion was paid for out of our Party funds&mdash;the cost of it&mdash; but the opinion of the Executive then in office, when they wanted a political document, was paid for out of public funds.  This political document did not contain any reference to this basic document of 1923 on which Mr. Thomas relies.  There was another document which he says confirms the first document.  What is the history of that document?  It was signed, I think, in March, 1926, and was kept secret for as many months as the other was kept secret for years.  It was revealed only after nine months. I would like you to consider the conditions <Col N="122" /> under which this other secret document was signed.  It was signed after the Dáil had passed a resolution which did not establish a new practice, but which affirmed the practice that agreements involving payments of money and all agreements with other Governments&mdash;agreements entered into by the Executive of the day&mdash;had to get the approval and sanction of the Dáil.  That was not establishing a new practice.  It was referring to what was understood to be the existing position, which was that agreements made and entered into by the Executive should get the sanction and approval of the Dáil before they could be held to be binding.  There was no approval of the Dáil sought in regard to either of these agreements.  Both of them were withheld from the Irish people.  If they were things of which the Executive could be proud, why were they kept secret?  Is not the very fact that they were kept secret proof in itself that the Executive were conscious that they were doing something of which the Irish people would not approve?</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan says we need never again speak of secret documents if there were some approaches made to the British and if we do not publish them.  Ever since we got into office we have been endeavouring to get a solution, an ending, of this dispute.  It is not we who have mixed up politics or the political problem with it.  We have met the British directly and indirectly, and it is quite clear that the two accusations cannot be true; one, that we are so proud that we will have no dealings with the British, that we will not have negotiations or consultations with them, and the other that we are going by some backstair methods and making agreements or making some treaties or arrangements with them. Any agreement we make with the British will be brought to this House and will have to get the approval of this House before it can bind the Irish people.  That is the position.  What about the people who are accusing us of that? The colleagues of the Deputy who talks about secret negotiations, not merely did they have their secret negotiations, but they pretended, or pretend now, <Col N="123" /> that the Irish people could be bound by such agreements without the Parliament assenting and approving.  We hold that they cannot.  We hold it is our practice here; we hold it as an almost universal international practice &mdash; a practice that, particularly since the war, has obtained generally&mdash;that agreements involving payments of public money cannot be binding unless the Parliament of the country involved approves of them.  That is the almost universal practice.  We told Mr. Thomas, and the British Government, that we would not recognise that document because its terms were not brought here, and expressly approved by our people.  We think that we have in every sense a case that is legal, and, as I have more than once pointed out, a moral case also.  And until this thing is approved of by the Irish people are we to put ourselves in the position that Deputy MacDermot and others would have us put ourselves in?  Are we to say we accept the position that these moneys are due, that we are defaulters, and go on our knees and ask to be let off some of it?  I do not think that is a right position at all for our country to get into.  It is not the true position anyhow.</P>
    <P>We said, more than once, suppose we put aside the legal question, we are prepared to test the matter by an impartial tribunal.  Of course, Deputy MacDermot and those who take his view think we ought to be quite satisfied if the tribunal answers the description of the tribunal that the British want.  We refuse; because there is a big fundamental question involved, and it is: Whether we are a full international personality or not.  We are not going to allow the British to have their view of that situation prevail. We claim we are, and we are going to maintain that right.  If it is a matter of principle with them, if they regard it as a matter of principle that the tribunal set up must be a Commonwealth tribunal, we do not hold that view.  That is not the only dispute we have now with Britain that may need arbitration.  It is not the only dispute we may have in the future that <Col N="124" /> may need arbitration, and we are not going to accept the principle that these arbitration bodies should be composed of people who are citizens within the States of the British Commonwealth. That is not a partisan attitude.  It is an attitude that Deputies opposite should well understand.  It was the attitude that they themselves pursued and that we are right in pursuing.  One Feetham Commission ought to be enough for this nation in its lifetime, apart from everything else but a stand on our rights.</P>
    <P>There was a case in Geneva where there was an extremely difficult question to be settled, and upon which we had to get a definite decision. We stood upon our rights and we held to our position.  We hold in this country that no payments of any kind ought to be made to Great Britain. If there is a dissolution of partnership it is not to be all &ldquo;give&rdquo; and no &ldquo;take.&rdquo; All the &ldquo;take&rdquo; has been on the British side up to the present and there has been very little &ldquo;give.&rdquo; That is their attitude all the time.  When there was this dissolution of partnership, have we to put it this way&mdash;that the British are to take all the assets?  We had Deputy MacDermot the other day talking of the British Empire built up on blood shed by Irishmen.  In the Commonwealth the Dominions have grown from Colonies, and we have evidence that to the building up of that Commonwealth our people have contributed.</P>
    <P>If we were in the United Kingdom, in legal partnership, then, at the dissolving of that partnership, is Britain to get all the assets?  Or was the concern bankrupt?  Would it be wrong to segregate one portion&mdash;the land annuities, for instance&mdash;and say we will take them and the British can get away with the rest?  That is the British position.  In the interests of moral right and fair play we hold that it is not right that this part of Ireland should be compelled to make any contribution to Great Britain.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy, I am told, made some statement about the £19,000,000 a year saved by this document of which they were so much ashamed that they kept it hidden from the Irish people, <Col N="125" /> or else that they were so ignorant that they did not see that the British would establish a claim upon it&mdash;I do not know which it was.  If it was going to do this wonderful thing of saving the Twenty-Six Counties this £19,000,000 they would have come out with it and would not have hidden it away in the cupboard.  What is all this nonsense about the £19,000,000?  If you go back and see where that statement was made by me, when I went to Ennis, you will see I deliberately went down to warn the Irish people that not merely was there going to be a boundary settlement, on which they had no check, but that, also, that there was a money settlement in view.  I told them to look out.  I told them that the British, in the regulations of 1921, had circulated a memorandum and put down a claim.  I told them that the British were putting in a claim on the basis of the 1921 memorandum&mdash;a claim for £19,000,000.</P>
    <P>Because the British put in a claim I told the Irish people to look out.  I told them that the British, notwithstanding the fact that they are going to take all the assets, and that there has been over-taxation, which has been admitted even by British officials in this country, to the amount of hundreds of millions, notwithstanding all that they had circulated a document which shows their mind, for the payment forthwith, of a claim for £19,000,000. That was to be divided between two parts of Ireland.  I think it was in the ratio of 56 to 44 or something like that, and the share that was claimed upon that basis from the Saorstát can be calculated from that ratio.  But was it not fair to tell the people to look out, and to warn them that the British had put forward that claim?  Is there any honesty in pretending, and saying, that I said that the British were entitled to get a sum of £19,000,000 a year.  I hope in future, when we hear a repetition of that statement, that the circumstances, and the statement as made, will be given, and that there will not be this pretence, that a statement was made that we accepted that demand for £19,000,000, and that we should now be glad to get off with a payment of £5,000,000.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="126" /> Our position as a Government is this: We hold that in justice and fair play this country ought not be required to make any payments to Britain, that the offsets more than counterbalance any claim that Britain could put forward. That is going back fundamentally to the justice of the position.  That is fair play.  We pointed out that these documents did not commit our people and should not be held to commit our people by the fact that our predecessors had, foolishly or wrongly, made these payments, and that they should not be held to bind their successors.  There is nothing in that that should, as our opponents have termed it, deserve the talk of the misappropriation of money.</P>
    <P>Evidently Deputy McGilligan did not like the things I said in Clare when I contrasted the attitude of our political opponents in this country with the attitude of the British people in the matter of the American debts. He was hurt because I contrasted their attitude.  Well he might, because even in this House some time ago he used the words &ldquo;pilfering of the land annuities.&rdquo; He used the words &ldquo;pilfering&rdquo; and &ldquo;petty larceny.&rdquo; A double accusation, first that we were robbing and, secondly, that it was a small matter, one which did not affect our people at all.  The truth is that both are false.  We are not robbing anybody.  We are standing by our legal rights.  It is a big amount.  I have time and again tried to get Deputies to realise the magnitude of that sum and compare the amount with the annual revenue&mdash;compare it with our export trade.  Let us take the official figures of our opponents in this matter and what do we find?  We find in the matter of the British debts to the United States&mdash;the payments that Britain has refused to make on the grounds that it would be unfair to ask her people to make these sums available&mdash;that these sums in comparison with the British revenue, are very much less than are the payments that Britain is demanding from us. If we take the standard which Mr. Baldwin himself took with regard to these payments and the ratio, <Col N="127" /> 66 to 1, which Deputy McGilligan is so fond of referring to here, what do we find?  Mr. Baldwin, advised by his officials in the Treasury, made the calculation and gave the ratio of taxable capacity as 66 to 1.  The payments we are asked to make on the head of that secret agreement are actually ten times the amount that Britain says she cannot pay to the United States.  Therefore, when Deputy McGilligan used the word &ldquo;pilfering&rdquo; and when he rather suggests &ldquo;petty larceny&rdquo; he is misrepresenting the amount of the burden that would be upon our people.  He is also misrepresenting its magnitude by the suggestion of &ldquo;petty larceny,&rdquo; inasmuch as the suggestion is that we are taking something that does not legally belong to us.  If Deputy McGilligan himself goes about using phrases like that, he cannot come along and pretend to be unaware of the fact that those on the opposite side of the water will take advantage of that.  I asked him to look at what the British Press has been doing recently.  I spoke about our opponents having made a statement about John Bull being waylaid. There was a suggestion there of highway robbery.  Will any member of the opposite Party find, on looking through the British Press, the suggestion that Uncle Sam has been waylaid and robbed?  They will not.  You will find that every possible excuse that can be offered to support the British Government in not paying that money to America is being sought for and used.  There is no question of &ldquo;pilfering&rdquo; there, although the amount is very much less relatively to resources than the amount we have been asked to pay, that is on the ratio of 66 to 1.  Are we to keep silent in face of that?  Is there any sensible person who does not believe that, in fact, statements like that do assist those who are trying to secure this money from us, no matter what damage it may do to us?  I know is is very hard to plead a case, if you think the Government is wrong, in a matter of this sort.  It is hard to plead that case and not be open to <Col N="128" /> the suggestion that you are acting from unpatriotic motives in that pleading. But I do say, objectively, that such statements, particularly when not true, are damaging and that it ought to be the duty of every person who is in any way representing our people in this matter not to make the position harder for our country.</P>
    <P>After the late Government were defeated, when we were charged with the responsibility of trying to defend our country's interest in that matter, should they not at least have given us the benefit of silence or the benefit of the doubt where there was a doubt? That is all we ask.  We do not ask them to go around making speeches and pleading the case as we did, although in other matters they do not mind eating their words.  Perhaps it would be better that I should not go into these other matters now.  But in other matters they do not mind at all going around and saying that the things they thought were right and that they were prepared to enforce when in office are completely wrong now and altogether unwarranted.  We do not ask them to do that or to eat anything they have said in the past.  But we do ask them not to make the position of our people, which is a difficult position&mdash;and it is a difficult position precisely because of their act&mdash;more difficult. At least when the people had relieved them of responsibility and put the responsibility on other shoulders, surely I am entitled to ask them not to make our position more difficult.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan said I was misleading the people when I said that the local elections are being looked forward to by the British.  Of course they are.  Is there anybody in this country who knows the position who does not believe that the one hope of the British is to see this Government put out of office and defeated.  They are hoping that the defeat of this Government will mean that another Government will be in office, a Government that will take up a very different attitude, people who are suggesting that we settle for half or so and make a good bargain&mdash;make a good bargain &ldquo;as business people would make.&rdquo; Is not the suggestion to get this Government <Col N="129" /> out?  This Government is hardheaded. It is on the side of the people and is not going to compromise in what it imagines to be right.  Get this Government out and put in another Government.  That Government will be prepared to meet the British Government in the way of compromise and make this good bargain with them. We see where these bargains were made, bargains which nobody who stood for this country could honestly make.  I have suggested time after time that we are prepared, for instance, on the basis of trade, to meet the British.  We heard a good deal to-day about the value of the British market and I should imagine that people who are trying to help us and help their country would some time advert to the fact that the British have a mighty good market here.</P>

      <P>I did not hear it, to-day, at any rate.  I am going to admit that Deputy MacDermot and Deputy Cosgrave on the last day made two speeches to which I, for one, could not find any reasonable objection. I acknowledge that.  I was anxious to deal with the points as raised.  Deputy Cosgrave showed for the third time that his instincts are right but as surely as he starts on that point he allows himself to be forced off it by other people within a day or two.  It is bad politics, he is told.  His speech here from the political point of view and from his own party point of view was good politics.  Though I do not agree with Deputy MacDermot I have no complaint to make of these two speeches. But I am defending the Government against charges that we are wantonly going out attacking and trying to get political feelings raised against our political opponents on the grounds that they are helping the British in the matter of this dispute between us. I think that in so far as there has been anything of that sort it has been done simply because we want to show them&mdash;objectively if you like and <Col N="130" /> leaving out the subjective side of it&mdash; that the doing of that is hurting the interests of this country just the same as if some newspapers in Great Britain went out of their way to say as regards the debts to America: &ldquo;This money was given to us when our backs were to the wall.  It was given to us by a friendly people to save us from the greatest disaster that could have befallen our nation.  We solemnly promised to make that payment.  Are we going to dishonour our word now and not make it?&rdquo; That is a statement that you might have expected, but show me any British paper in which such a statement is made. There may be people in England who feel that way but they are not going out at the present time and providing ammunition for those who, in other countries, are opposed to Britain. They are not going out and saying that Uncle Sam is being knocked down by the roadside and robbed. They are trying to find excuses.  They say that they cannot pay or that in any case it is not fair to ask other nations, to whom they lent that money, to pay.  You have not any British paper coming out and stating that it is not fair for them to refuse to pay the United States simply because they cannot themselves easily get money or take the responsibility of forcing payment from other people.  You have no one coming out and saying, &ldquo;It is all very well for you to be generous at the expense of the Americans.&rdquo; You have nobody coming out and saying on behalf of America, for example, that if the British do not pay these debts to America the American taxpayers and the American bondholders will have to pay.  But is not that the basis on which Mr. Thomas says that he has to collect payments, whether in the way of bounties or tariffs, from our people.  His excuse is, &ldquo;Oh, if we do not collect these moneys the British taxpayer will have to pay.&rdquo; Do you find any British newspaper reminding Mr. Thomas that he has said that he has to get this money from the Irish Free State; that otherwise the British taxpayer would have to pay?  You do not, but I feel pretty certain if we were in such a position <Col N="131" /> that we would be reminded of it by the Opposition.</P>
      <P>We have people here talking about our fat cattle and getting a market for them.  When we were making this payment of £5,000,000 a year we were simply making a present to Britain of the fat cattle we exported.  We were doing that as a nation, because when that payment of £5,000,000 was made to Britain all that this community had left was a sum that was equivalent to 8d. a head of the fat cattle exported.  I know, of course, that to the individual farmer it was not 8d., but as far as the community is concerned that was the position.  The Deputies on the other side tell us to go on making these payments and to send our cattle over. You cannot pay&mdash;that is what it amounts to&mdash;at that disastrous loss.  I can imagine people on the Opposition Benches, for instance&mdash;on their conception of what was just and right but not exercising the restraint apparently that those who are opposed to the British Government are exercising at the present time&mdash;if we were in a case like that, coming in and saying that we had the West Indies and that they were a valuable property that the Americans might be willing to take in payment of the debt.  We would have suggestions of that sort thrown out by our political opponents, but you do not find any suggestions on that score in the British papers.</P>
      <P>In the speech that I made at Ennis I was simply pointing out the contrast. I said that here, because of our antipathies and our recent conflicts, we were behaving towards each other as no Government and no Opposition in any country in the world would behave: that there was no desire to work as a team.  The Opposition, I believe, has a very important part in the government of a country.  The business of an Opposition is to criticise, to expose weaknesses and so on in the administration. Nobody can have any objection to an Opposition doing that.  The idea is that they are charged as public representatives, as a sort of corporate body, to work with the Government to secure the best interests of the people as a whole.  That is my conception of it anyhow.</P>

      <P>I hold that I did.  Is there anything in the speech that was read here dealing with the agricultural position that anyone need be ashamed of?  If there were any fallacies in that speech why were they not exposed at the time?  As I conceive it, that was a very proper statement for the Opposition to make, looking to the future and seeing what was predicted by people competent to make predictions with regard to agricultural prices.</P>
      <P>The next charge is that at Ennis I said that Mr. Thomas had stated to our representatives over there that they need not bother very much about us: that the new organisation that was being built up was going to settle us. Deputy McGilligan tried to make out that the Blueshirts were not in existence at that time.  I will admit that my description of the colour was wrong: the organisation was known as the White Army at that time.  To be verbally accurate, what I should have said was the White Army.  That is what it was called in the newspapers at the time.  Later, of course, it was referred to as the Fascists, a dictatorship, and all the rest of it which the world Press was so anxious to write up, but the writing up at that time was about the White Army.  I did characterise the organisation by one of its names&mdash;by its latest name.  Perhaps I should have called it by the name it was first christened, but it has changed its name a number of times.  I have not followed up these vagaries of change of name, which was an obvious device.  It did not change its fundamental character, and it was as the White Army that it was written up in the Canadian newspapers at that period.  Deputy McGilligan can have it that it was the White Army was to settle it.  He can have it that I was wrong in saying it was the Blueshirts. I spoke to the people in terms that they understood.  The people know as well as I do that all the changes of name have meant very little as regards fundamentals.</P>

      <P>The Deputy cannot tell the President very much about these things that he does not know. With regard to these two charges, I did not try to deceive the people.  I said this fact, that the British are anxious for the overthrow of this Government. Why would they not?  Is it not obvious from the statements on the other side?  We had Deputy Cosgrave saying that he was prepared to settle in a few days&mdash;it is suggested, at any rate &mdash;with an offer of half the annuities. We are still asking for the basis of that statement, which was made on the eve of an election, to deceive the electorate into believing that there was some basis of agreement with the British, or that he had a basis.  We have never been able to know whether he had or not.  I say in either case there is something to be explained.  At any rate, is it not quite clear that there was a disposition to settle on one-half? Are Deputies opposite prepared to go on stating that we are to continue making payments?  We are told that payment is being extracted from us in any case.  That is, unfortunately, true.  A person struggling with one better armed and better equipped may be compelled, as I said at Ennis, to <Col N="134" /> surrender his watch.  But that is very different from making a present of the watch.  If a person is going to take my watch, in spite of me, without being stigmatised as a robber, I will do everything in my power to defend my property.  Responsible, as we are, for the interests of this country, we have to take whatever steps we can to defend our interests.  It is true, of course, that a stronger power is able to extract those payments in spite of us.  We are prepared, as we have said, to sit down to consider a trade agreement by itself.  We are prepared to deal either with a financial or with a trade question.  We are prepared to treat with the political question, if there is any disposition to treat, on the only basis that we think a real settlement between this country and Great Britain can be obtained.  We are prepared to take them all together or separately.  If there is any difficulty with Britain we have said that we will take these matters separately.  It is not we have been interested all the time in mixing the political with the financial dispute.  Look at the statement of Mr. Thomas.  Their position from the start has been rather to try to mix them up.  Why?  Is it not clear what the aim of British policy was? The idea again is by means of pressure &mdash;this time economic pressure&mdash;to try to compel us to enter into an agreement which would forego national rights. Clearly, is not that the object the British have?  They are trying to compel us, by means of the pressure being put on our people, to give up our national claim.  We are not going to do it.  They have no right to demand that we should do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question has been asked, what progress have we made?  I am quite prepared to admit that we have been tied up by other agreements which were made, to which we were not a party, and which we in the past opposed to the best of our ability.  At the time the people were told that these agreements did not matter.  I remember one Deputy saying: &ldquo;I will take an oath for every gun I can get.&rdquo; That was the position then.  We were trying to get our countrymen to realise that international agreements entered <Col N="135" /> into like that, no matter what the conditions, will be held by the other party, at any rate, to be binding; that they will try to make us observe them, and before the world they will talk of such things as the sanctity of treaties and the sanctity of international compacts. That was the position we tried to save our people from several years ago.  Our people, in their wisdom or otherwise, did not follow our advice, and we have come to the position in which we have the phrase that Deputy MacDermot finds so much difficulty in understanding.  I said that we were heirs to a certain position, and that all we could do, realising the position in which we found ourselves, was our utmost to try to get the nation to the objective which we believe the majority of our people have.  We spoke in the past about these things as barriers. The present Opposition say that we are free.  We never denied that there was a certain amount of freedom.  I used to compare it all that time to the freedom that a prisoner gets when allowed out of a cell.  It is certainly additional freedom if a prisoner is allowed to roam around; or if there is a group of prisoners within the prison walls and if they are free to govern themselves inside the walls.</P>
    <P>We might be asked, can you not rule yourselves; can you not govern yourselves?  I have not denied that. I did not at any time deny that there was within the Treaty some of the freedom which it was reasonable to expect at that particular period.  There have been developments.  I have taken pains to give credit to our opponents for certain advances that were made.  On one occasion I said that advances were made.  I pointed out last week limitations on our freedom, as I might point to the walls surrounding the imaginary group of prisoners.  I did not mean it to be taken that I did not realise the extent of freedom there was within, but I pointed to the retention of our ports.  I said the retention of our ports did detract from our position, and compared the position occupied by Canada and Australia.  I pointed to the partition of our country, and the presence of <Col N="136" /> foreign troops, as a denial to this island&mdash;and even to this part of the island&mdash;of the practical freedom which they have in Canada, in Australia and in South Africa.  If there was a war to-morrow, theoretically it might be argued that Canada would be at war if Britain was at war, or that South Africa would be at war.  On that theoretical basis a power at war with Britain might possibly not invade these countries, unless there was a special reason for doing it, because they would bring actively against them a people not so effectively against them in a purely passive way.  Our position is different.  They have a sort of neutrality that may, in certain circumstances, be really effective and valuable neutrality.  We are denied that by the possession of our ports, and certainly by the position of the Six Counties.  There is, therefore, a concrete case where the freedom this country would have is limited.  I pointed these things out because they are facts.  I am ready to be equally frank by saying that, excluding these, we are debarred from being completely free.  The majority of our people realise that for this country freedom would be expressed in the form of a republic. I am quite willing to admit and to recognise that this Executive Council, and the previous Executive Council, so far as I have had any opportunity of looking into the records, have been in the position, particularly in later years, that their will as regards things not affected by the Treaty became law. The first really most important advance was when the position of the Governor-General was changed.  When I was opposing the Treaty I used to point to the fact that the chief executive person in this country was the Governor-General, according to the old position, and that he was at that time, as he was, the direct agent of the British Cabinet.</P>
    <P>That position was changed, I think, about 1926.  I was one of the first to admit that it was a tremendous change and I am quite willing to admit that any advice this Executive Council gives, in a matter which comes within the constitutional position, goes.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacDermot in speaking the <Col N="137" /> other day about the position with regard to our Constitution used words &mdash;I do not know whether he deliberately chose them but he certainly used them, which he would not for a moment defend if they were put up to him.  The word &ldquo;permission&rdquo; was the word he used.  He said that we had to seek the King's permission.  He knows perfectly well that is not the constitutional position and that when he is given advice of that sort, it would not be possible for a constitutional monarch to refuse to accept it. Therefore, the position was that the Executive Council considered that a certain procedure should be adopted, that that procedure was adopted and there was no question of hiding it from anybody.  Would the Deputy here now say that it was hidden?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">

      <P>Certainly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Deputy speak for himself?  I am asking Deputy MacDermot will he stand up and defend the word &ldquo;permission&rdquo; as a fair word to describe the position? Will he suggest now in cold blood that we deliberately, as was suggested in his speech, hid that fact in the constitutional position that had been changed&mdash;that we deliberately hid that fact from the people as long as we could?  As a matter of fact I was making no point particularly about the change.  If the Deputy will look up the papers he will see that what happened was, that certain publicists considered the change such that they thought it could be made the occasion of trouble with the Government of the United States.  The American papers were full of it, the suggestion being, however it was inspired, that somehow or other we were trying to involve the United States of America in some difficult constitutional question between ourselves and Great Britain.  The fact was that the British Government could not come into it.  The King logically and constitutionally came into it but the British Government were not concerned in the matter.  There is no denying that is one of the things we <Col N="138" /> had to do.  We had to accept the position that at the moment constitutionally this is a kingdom and until we are able to change that&mdash;I hope we shall be able to change it by consent and peaceably&mdash;by whatever method the Irish people may support, we are a kingdom.  I have not denied that to the Irish people, not for one moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are in the position to-day&mdash;and here again I do not want for one moment to deny the part played in the evolution by our predecessors&mdash;that the Government of this country has control of the Executive of this country, that we are the effective Government and the Government in fact, and we can blame no outside Government as far as internal administration and the things which we can control, are concerned.  I have not denied it.  I think it is right that our people should know the facts and I agree that we ought to face the facts, but let it not be that we want to face one set of facts and ignore others. Let us take the whole situation into account.  It is on our recognition of the whole situation that we have based our policy.  If the Irish people are not prepared to support us in the way we consider necessary in order to put that policy into effect, then the Irish people will have to get another Government or the people of this part of Ireland will have to get another Government. I do believe that the Irish people do want our policy to succeed and are prepared to make reasonable sacrifices in order to achieve its success.  Nobody would expect unreasonable sacrifices. I do not take up the attitude, nor this Government does not take up the attitude, the very free and easy attitude of people such as Deputy MacDermot, who described us as being held up at the top of a rope and afraid to cut the rope when it was put to us.  We do not say to the Irish people, &ldquo;Oh, hang the consequences, cut the cord anyhow.&rdquo; We, being responsible, are trying in the interests of our people to get a situation in which our objective can be really achieved.  There is no use in a person freeing himself when he is held 100 feet high in mid-air on a rope, if he is aware <Col N="139" /> of his position.  Fortunately, it is not as bad as that, but I am trying to illustrate the abandon with which advice is given to us by Deputies opposite.  It is said that because we will not take the desperate steps that other people would like us to take in the matter&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>What desperate steps?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;we are a disgrace to the people of the past.  It is said that we should ignore all these things and that we should not take the practical steps that people who really want to achieve their objective try to take.  I have never at any time in any of my statements minimised the difficulties of the task of a small nation that in face of an Empire wants to get its freedom&mdash;never.  It would be wrong for the Irish people to believe that.  It is a difficult task, a task that can only be achieved by persistent effort.  This nation has shown itself capable of that effort over all these series of years. What we say to the people is this: &ldquo;Do not surrender the rights that are essential to further progress.  Do not make the moral position of other people who want to advance further any more difficult.  If you do not want to advance, at least have the hope that to-morrow an advance can be made and do not put up barriers that would stop progress in the future.&rdquo; We have Deputies of the opposite Party suggesting that they would be behind us if we declared a republic.  Our memories are long enough and we remember that when there was a change like that, they considered another policy better. I will put it in that way.  They believed that another policy was the better one for the country.  They considered that it was time to consolidate certain advances.  That was their argument at the time.  My objection to that was simply this: a step-by-step programme is all right provided you have two things&mdash;first of all, that you are satisfied that that is the most you can do and, secondly, provided you do not in consolidating the position you have attained, put up barriers which will <Col N="140" /> make it difficult for those who come after you to go further.  These are the tests, the practical, commonsense tests that should be applied to a task such as our task is.</P>
      <P>Deputy MacDermot again with the same abandon, said that if we were slaves, we should have the courage to go and emancipate ourselves.  I do not think that is an unfair representation of what he said; that is my memory of what he said.  My answer to him is this: let us not at any rate save ourselves from that imputation by blinding ourselves and pretending to ourselves that we are not slaves.  Of course the word &ldquo;slaves&rdquo; is an exaggeration but the exaggeration is not mine.  The exaggeration I suggest is that of Deputy MacDermot.  He used it first and I am merely repeating what he said.  That can be disproved quite easily.  I suggest to him that it was not I used that exaggeration. I suggest that he wanted very definitely to produce a certain effect by that statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are people in this country who take a different view of the position from what we take.  They think it would be possible at this moment to declare a Republic without any serious consequences following it, or without anything happening that might bring about a situation in which we would have a repetition of the situation which we had to face at the end of 1921, when a large section were prepared to abandon the struggle and make some sort of peace, whatever it would be, which, whatever its advantages, does impose before the future advance of the nation a definite barrier.  There are people like that, and, of course, it is good politics for Deputy MacDermot to try to get at least that amount of agreement between him and that particular group.  They will have, at least, this much in common&mdash;that they will both be attacking the Government. The Government will be exposed to attack both from the Right and the Left.  Those phrases of Deputy MacDermot are intended definitely to suggest that to those who think that more rapid progress should be made than we are capable of at the moment. Our answer to those who differ from <Col N="141" /> us, whether on the Right or the Left, is that we are doing the best we think can be done, and the most for which our people will give us the support which is essential in order to achieve our objective.  We are doing the best we can as rapidly as we can, taking advantage of the position as we find it.</P>
    <P>If there are people in this part of Ireland who think that we are going too slowly or too rapidly, there is one court to which they can go&mdash;the court of the people, and the decision can be given, freely and without any test, by the elected representatives of the people.  That is one shackle that we claim to have removed.  It does not appear to Deputy MacDermot and others on the opposite benches to be a bond or barrier, or a shackle at all.  To a large section of the people, however, it did appear to be so, and after a long period the people agreed that that barrier should be removed&mdash;the barrier of the Oath&mdash;and the position to-day is that any person or group in the country that has a national policy and that hopes&mdash;and without that hope it is vain, I think, to think of their ultimately succeeding&mdash;to get the support of the majority of the people behind it in any programme, is free to go to the people.  I say that any group or person that tries to deny freedom of speech to any people in this country on any ground is doing a bad day's work for the country and is preventing that organised advance that will be taken.  Those who deny that freedom &mdash;I do not care whether they are the White Army, the Blueshirts, Fianna Fáil, or whoever it may be, show by their actions that they have no faith in the Irish people.  If they have not faith in this nation it means that they do not think that this nation can get its independence, and it is vain for any little group to think that they can secure it unless they are going to be backed up by the majority of the people.  Our strength in the struggle in 1920 and 1921 was that the Government had got the sanction of the majority of the people.  That was the position then and that is the position that we have striven to get for the people again.  It is vain and foolish for anybody to think that they can secure <Col N="142" /> it without that support.  That was one of the things the Treaty did&mdash;a thing which I tried to explain to the people at the time.  Just as the Treaty put up a barrier in certain directions, a barrier of a certain agreement that would be held up as a national contract and binding on us, so also, by establishing a Government here that could point to having been elected by the Irish people and to have responsibilities drawn from the Irish people, that Government, naturally, would defend its rights and would put itself in conflict with any group that tried, independently of that Government, to secure independence.</P>
    <P>During the Civil War there was a different position.  There was an attempt being made then to maintain the existing State.  That was on quite a different basis.  It was an attempt to undo the Treaty there and then, never to let it come into operation. Deputy Belton and others accused us here of being outside this House during the period when certain agreements were being entered into and tried to make it appear that, because we did not at that time oppose certain payments, we ourselves had in some way or other sanctioned those payments.  The fact was that until, I might say, the elections of 1927, the position was still in a fluid state.  Even in 1927 the Government that was here on these benches did not have the votes of 50 per cent. of the elected representatives. They did not have a majority. Even in this House there was an occasion on which it was only the vote of the Ceann Comhairle that saved the Government.  There was a position then in which it was quite possible that the people would have reversed their previous decision and given a vote for the maintenance of the Republic.  The position was completely changed when the Government of the day brought in an Act and passed it here which would prevent anybody from going up for election again on the old basis.  It was that that necessitated an immediate change on the part of anybody who had hoped by parliamentary action to try to get the position back in which we could make peaceful progress.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="143" /> During all that period on the outside, the one case in which I intervened&mdash; I forget whether representing Sinn Féin or Fianna Fáil, or whether Fianna Fáil had been founded at the time, but I think it was before Fianna Fáil was founded&mdash;I went down the country, when I saw that this question of the Boundary Settlement was coming about, to tell the then Executive that if they stood fast by the rights which they had under the Treaty, there was one thing on which there could be concerted action.  One thing which the Treaty left us was this Boundary question and the other was the question of money payments.  I wanted to tell them that there was, at the same time, this danger of the financial settlement and I wanted to warn the people.  I felt that I was doing my duty as an Opposition leader in calling the people's attention to it.  That is the thing that we heard called up to-day and completely misrepresented with the hope that the people will believe that I accepted at any time that a debt was due from this country to Britain.</P>
    <P>Now, it is nearly impossible on a Vote like this to cover the whole ground, because the various speakers take every Department in turn and the Ministers in those Departments have taken their individual Votes and met each one of the arguments&mdash;the Minister for Justice and the Ministers for the other Departments have met the charges that Deputies could bring against the Administration.</P>

      <P>I know that these matters are being raised on this Vote because of the collective responsibility which is said to rest on this Department. Yes, the Executive has collective responsibility and there is that excuse for making attacks and representations about the general position when the Vote for the President of the Executive Council is being considered.  I am sure, however, that nobody could reasonably expect me to go over the whole of the ground.  Things were mentioned <Col N="144" /> here to-day which meant a retrying of things.  There was the question of the impartial administration of the law.  I was quoted with regard to statements that I hoped that the Government of this country could be carried on without resort to exceptional measures.  I do say, now, as I said then, that this country will not be in a really sound position until we are able to carry on without Acts like the Constitution (Amendment No. 17) Act.  We tried to carry on without them.  We tried the experiment here for a whole year and one of our first acts was to immediately put that particular Act out of operation. Why did we not bring in amending Acts, we are asked?  One of the difficulties we had in that connection was that we had a Seanad which was very far from being disposed to facilitate the Government in its policy for the maintenance of order.  We are the people who must ultimately bear the responsibility and the brunt in connection with the maintenance of order, but the steps we should desire to take did not and would not commend themselves to them.  We had tried for a long period to go along the line I indicated but we were accused of not going out after the I.R.A.  We were depending on commonsense and reason to effect more than laws could effect. We had every hope that they would. Here was a movement with traditions. Members on both sides of the House had, at one time or another, been members of the I.R.A.  There were breaks at various periods.  These breaks were made according to the views held by different Parties as to what the national interest demanded. One of the principal barriers before us was the Oath.  We had hoped, by removal of that, to make clear to any persons who had national aspirations that they had only to get the support of the people to get into the position of a Government and to give effect to them.  That was the only way in which some preliminary fight among ourselves could be avoided.  If the freedom of this country is to be secured in future by force, it must be by force at the disposal and under the command of those elected by the people.  There is <Col N="145" /> no other way in which it can be successful. On the last occasion when it was used whatever measure of success it attained was largely due to that fact. The support of the people did play a most important part because it put us in an unassailable moral position.  We were the elected Government.  If Deputy MacDermot doubts that the majority to-day would be in favour of a republic, he can go back to 1918 and see what the returns then were. I think they were 79 to 24.  That was the proportion at that time for the whole of Ireland.  There was then a world-call, so to speak.  The war was supposed to have been fought for the freedom of small nations and there was a definite challenge to our people as to what they wanted.  Our people, answering that challenge, by that majority voted for complete freedom. Their representatives declared for independence and the elected Government led the people in the resistance put up to interference from outside during that period.  Commonsense was working on our side.  The natural forces were working on our side.  All we had to do was to have a reasonable amount of patience.  Remember that a current like that cannot be suddenly changed.</P>
      <P>That was our policy.  We were attacked because we would not use Coercion Acts, because we did not go out with the hatchet after that organisation.  Our policy as a whole in that regard was well known to the people.  A new situation developed later.  We had people going out and founding an organisation which, although they say it is different to-day, was intended, so far as anybody could give credence to what was said, to get into a position in which force would be used, in which a form of Government was going to be established, if necessary, by a minority using force.</P>

They are changing from day to day and I do not know under which thimble the pea is.  Is it Deputy MacDermot's, Deputy Cosgrave's or General O'Duffy's policy that is being operated?  Do they agree as to policy? What is the common policy?  What is all the pretence about?  What is the meaning of the uniform?

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>We had to judge from our knowledge of the situation. We acted in that belief, rightly or wrongly.  We considered that we had a duty imposed upon us to take whatever steps were necessary to save our people from having blood shed in the capital city.  We took those steps and I think that everybody at the time believed that we were doing the right thing.  Why have we continued as we have done?  One of the difficulties in a case like this is that when you start, it is very difficult to withdraw.  That was one of the reasons why we would not accept the policy pressed upon us from the opposite benches.  We realised that, once methods of that kind are adopted, it is very difficult to get rid of them without involving the State and the people in very serious danger.  We had to maintain free institutions.  It was as defenders of free institutions we took the action we did.  We are anxious to have local courts functioning. We are anxious to have trial by jury.  At the same time, we have an immediate responsibility to see that order is kept.  Our belief at the moment is that methods are being used which would seriously damage the administration of justice.  As evidence that there was no suggestion of attack on political opponents, we selected the same tribunal which the previous Government had chosen.  That tribunal has, so far as we can see, behaved properly.  It has been suggested <Col N="147" /> that the members of the tribunal are removables.  We have shown, as far as it was possible for us to do so, that we did not regard them as removables, that, so long as they did their duty without fear or favour, they would have our support as being the only instrument that could secure in certain cases that order would be kept.</P>
      <P>I was asked some time ago why we had republicans in jail.  We are asked from the opposite benches why we have Blueshirts in jail.  We do not want to have anybody in jail.  It would appear that our opponents do, because they think it will embarrass us politically. I do not want to have anybody in jail and, from the point of view of the benefit of the country, it would be better if there were no people in jail. What would I answer if somebody asked: &ldquo;Why have you republicans in jail.&rdquo; My only answer is that in every community there must be some authority to enforce order if we are to live as a civilized community at all, that there must be some authority regarded as the governing authority. There must be some laws to regulate the actions of citizen towards citizen. It is because it is necessary to establish that position here, because there are people who will not respect the rights of other citizens&mdash;whatever side that conduct comes from&mdash;we have to enforce the acceptance of these principles by means of detention and imprisonment. It is a blot&mdash;a serious blot&mdash;on our Administration that that has to be done.  All we can say about it is that we are not able to carry our fundamental responsibility of maintaining order and government without resorting to these methods.  We tried for a whole long year to have it so, notwithstanding the taunts from the opposite benches and now the position is that anybody who offends against the law, whether he be from the right or left, is dealt with in accordance with the law.</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I have long ago given up any hope of being able to get Deputy Fitzgerald to consider any argument or any sense.  I am talking not to Deputy Fitzgerald, because I know it is hopeless to talk to him, but to the people who are as interested as I am and as every member of the Executive Council is&mdash;and I hope they are amongst the members of the Opposition on the benches opposite&mdash; to see this country prosperous and happy and to see peace and order in the country.  I am appealing to them for their support in a task which is not a pleasant task to us.  We were getting on nicely until this other position arose, and then what had we?  We had two Parties with two extreme views, each going out in its own way, and the Party who a short time before talked about democracy and about taking the most extreme actions in the name of democracy and majority rule and who, when they were on these benches, spoke as if there was no limitation, moral or, almost, physical, to the authority they were entitled to exercise, when they went to the opposite benches as an Opposition began to decry democracy.  It was no longer anything since it had served their purpose. It was like the ladder by which they had ascended&mdash;it could be kicked away and was no longer a thing to be prized.  It was something to be despised.  They even tried to bring the Assembly of the representatives of the people into disrepute.  Parliamentary methods were no longer right, and we had people like Senator Blythe coming along and attacking the foundations and saying that this thing is worn out altogether.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What would the ordinary people in <Col N="149" /> the country think but that it was worn out simply when he was finished with it?  When he was finished with it it was a question of getting military forms and getting a military group&mdash; organising them, as a first step, and giving them a uniform in order that their solidarity might be recognised and that they might be regarded as a special unit.  We had all the fundamental things in military discipline which people recognise as of value to the morale of an army and the giving to them of a uniform and a position in which they are worth more than equal numbers of the opposite side.  All that was being done and being done deliberately. There were people who were not going to stand aside and see that being done with impunity, as it appeared, and who were prepared to take action of a similar sort against them.  We were thus going to have here conflicts which would injure the country's name and which were going seriously to injure all the chances of our country.  Could we, as a Government, stand aside and see that situation develop?  It was clear that we could not, and we tried to get the ordinary legal powers for dealing with such a situation by coming in here and getting passed an Act&mdash;which was nothing extraordinary&mdash;which would forbid any group arraying themselves in political uniform.  That was found necessary in other countries to prevent the sort of clashes which we have here, and it was found necessary in countries which had not, as we had, passed recently through a violent civil conflict in which just these two Parties were arrayed against each other.</P>
    <P>We, as the responsible Government here, had to take some steps and had to use such instruments as were at our disposal and such legal powers as we had.  The only legal powers we had were contained in this particular amendment of the Constitution which does give powers to the Tribunal which are, without a doubt, of extraordinary dimensions.  We opposed them originally as being beyond the needs of the time, and certain of them are, I hope, beyond anything that will be required by our Government, but the situation was that we had either <Col N="150" /> to let these things happen here or to take the necessary steps to prevent them.  The alternative was to come in and put a Bill through.  Having a majority of the members here, we were able to get our Bill through the Dáil, but then we had to face a hostile Seanad, and that Seanad, quite regardless of the seriousness of the situation and what it might have meant, refused to give this Executive very simple powers and refused to put on the Statute Book laws of a very limited character.  Are our opponents, after all, going to say that they have no programme and cannot go ahead politically unless they wear blue shirts? They want to have something spectacular. I suggested many a time that if they have anything solid in their programme they ought to have confidence enough in it to go to the people with it and not try to cover up the whole thing in this uniform.</P>
    <P>And, of course, it is not the uniform. What is behind it all is the appeal there is to a certain section who think that by banding themselves together they can be put in a position of domination. It is that has done it on the Continent.  Listen to the speeches and see what is the meaning of some of them.  What is the meaning of that &ldquo;By God&rdquo;&mdash;or whatever it was&mdash;&ldquo;if we get in, we will know how to govern&rdquo;?  Do we want that sort of thing?  Is that what Deputy MacDermot and the people who preach democracy and the rights of free speech and who complain that they have not got freedom of speech want? There are sections of the people who will not stand for that, and if people are going to have a régime like that, let those who stand for it put their programme before the people and get their sanction for it.  They are not, however, entitled to organise themselves in semi-military fashion in order to secure it.  That is what they are doing.  I quoted in the Seanad somebody who was talking about the situation in Britain.  He pointed out what it means.  He said that the shirt has a knack of attracting a Sam Browne belt and the Sam Browne belt has a knack of attracting to it the automatic pistol and so on.  That <Col N="151" /> is the first step and the fact that a large number of these people had, as we knew, arms at their disposal meant that you are going to have here a political army supporting one Party, an armed force supporting another group and the Government in here with the recognised forces at its command as the third body.  Out of Bedlam you could not conceive such a disastrous suggestion in the country's interests.  Whatever excuse might be made for anybody else or for any group or Party, there is no excuse whatever to be offered for the people, who, when they were sitting on these benches, took the action they took in order to maintain, as they said, the rule of the majority of the people and their very actions when they went into Opposition threw doubt on everything they had stood for before.  Some of them had the commonsense to recognise it and have, in so far as they could, repudiated the whole thing; they have recognised that the one thing they could decently stand behind, on their record, the one thing they could have saved from the disaster of the whole of these years and the one thing they could have said is: &ldquo;At any rate, we were the apostles of individual liberty; we were the apostles of the right of the majority to rule.  We made that rule absolute and did not make any exceptions.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>But Deputy Fitzgerald when he goes to the opposite benches begins to find out for the first time what the limitations are.  There are conditions, according to him, now in which a Government might not be entitled to enforce its will and in which the majority might not be entitled to enforce their will.  It would have been better for this country if he had learned that some time before.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>He did not practise it then, or let anybody know about it, because when I was on those benches he spoke in quite a different tone.  I say that whatever excuse there is for any other section of the community organising themselves in a semi-military fashion, acting as if they wished to set aside the vote of the majority of the people, and use force for the accomplishment of their aims, the Party opposite cannot be excused for so doing.  So long as they have this semi-military organisation in the background they are presenting a problem to the Government&mdash;whatever Government may be in office&mdash;which will necessitate extreme caution, care and watchfulness on the part of that Government, and will, unfortunately, necessitate that that Government should have at its disposal more than the ordinary powers for dealing with ordinary offences.  That is the position. We regret that that should be the position.  We regret the necessity to have anybody&mdash;right or left&mdash;in jail, Republicans or Blueshirts.  We regret that the hope which we had entertained that the Government could be carried on here, relying solely on the law-abiding character of our people, has not been realised.  I repeat that, fundamentally, there is less crime&mdash; what is known as crime in other countries&mdash;in this country than in any country in the world that I know of. If you had this political situation cleared up, if you moved it aside, and if the offences that have political foundations were moved aside, there is not a country in the whole world&mdash; I say it here from these benches, as I said it from the ones opposite&mdash;that would be as free from crime as this country.  It is unfortunate that those crimes have a political character.  We must have rules; after all, laws are only rules by which the members of the community regulate their conduct, one towards another.  It is unfortunate that we have offences in this country which would not be heard of in other countries, because they are not in the same political position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There you come again to our external position.  Unfortunately, Irish politics for generations have been <Col N="153" /> dominated by the fact that our people are not completely free to rule themselves in their own way.  That is the fundamental difficulty.  That difficulty is one which is the making of a neighbouring country, which is and has been stronger militarily and economically than we are.  They came into this country generations ago. The battle for freedom in this country has flowed and ebbed over generation after generation.  Centuries after the Normans came in here there were only a few miles around Dublin which they could say they dominated.  Then they got possession of a larger expanse of country, but were driven back again. To-day they have established a new Pale in part of our territory.  That is what it amounts to.  Those who know well the continuous struggle of our people over all those centuries now ask us to provide a cut and dried solution by which that Pale can be removed.  We do not pretend to give a definite solution.  I said when I was speaking in 1921 that the Government of that day did not contemplate the use of force against the Six Counties.  I say the same of this Government, because we think the use of force, apart from any question of right, would lead to no result; at least, it would not lead to the beneficial result which we want.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCurran" hpid="Mr. Curran Mr. Curran">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I do, at any rate.  Others may differ.  Everybody is free to have his own opinions.  I state here definitely as part of our policy that the use of force is not contemplated. Mind you, I am not dealing with the moral question as to whether it would or would not be justified.  They had in America a great Civil War on a less solid foundation than exists here, but civil war in this country would be absolutely disastrous in its nature and consequences.  No responsible person who would go to the trouble of trying to discover how his ideals could be achieved would consider that the unity of Ireland, under <Col N="154" /> present circumstances, or any circumstances that we have any right to visualise in the future, could be achieved by the use of force.  I have said that; I say it again and again, but that does not deny our right.  It is the same position exactly as the position with regard to the annuities. My watch might be taken from me.  If a stronger power takes it against my will, and I cannot prevent it from so doing, all I can say is that I am not going to put that power in a position to say that I made it a present of it. This country has, in fact, been divided and partitioned against the will of the majority of the people, and without any justification.  That is the fact&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so.  I did.  I said that this dispute with Britain at present had been made a political dispute, but not by us.  We clearly showed that we were quite prepared to deal with the trade matter by itself.  I agree with Deputy Cosgrave or anybody on the other side in the statement with regard to the trade position; there is no use in any agreement unless there is a trade agreement, because it is quite obvious that if we started on any agreement we were going to have to face a position in the morning in which they could put up the tariffs against us again. The very thing that was mentioned by some speaker on the opposite side as a great point in our favour, namely, that we were the only people who <Col N="155" /> could supply the British market with certain types of goods, puts us also in a very vulnerable position, because it would enable the British to put tariffs on our goods and then say that they were punitive tariffs, because they were used universally; they could put them against all, but they would, in fact, only hit us.  It is, therefore, obvious to anybody that an agreement of any value to this country, economical, financial or otherwise, must involve a trade agreement of some sort.  I will answer the Deputy's question.  I did answer it before, but I will answer it again.  It is not we who have brought in the political matter and involved it in this financial dispute.  It is Mr. Thomas who has done so.  Before I sit down I want to again remind you that I have on more than one occasion sat down at this table that is pictured to us. What has been the attitude?  My attitude has been that in fair play this <Col N="156" /> country ought not to be asked to make any of those payments; that we are not bound, legally or morally, to make them.  The British attitude, as far as I have been able to discover it, has been simply this: &ldquo;Acknowledge that the Secret Agreement is binding, even though your Parliament never ratified it.  Acknowledge it to be binding, even though we will not listen to your statement about being willing to submit it to an international tribunal. Acknowledge it to be binding; give away your case; come to us, and then we may consider some mitigation.&rdquo; The only word I have ever heard from the British about coming to meet our suggestion was contained in the phrase &ldquo;some mitigation.&rdquo; As I said before, the attitude was: &ldquo;Acknowledge that the account is binding and the shillings and pence may be knocked off the account.&rdquo; That is the position.</P>
