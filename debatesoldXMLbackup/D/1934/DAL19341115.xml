    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the President if he is aware that Deputies are only notified of Emergency Duties Orders two days after they are published in the public Press, and if he will arrange in future that Deputies receive notice of these orders before publication in the public Press.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Minister for Local Government and Public Health (for The President) Minister for Local Government and Public Health (for The President)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (for The President)</NameTxt>
      <P>Copies of all orders made by the Executive Council under the Emergency Imposition of Duties Act, 1932, are made available simultaneously for issue to the Press and for distribution to members of the Oireachtas. Having regard to the nature of these orders, and the necessity for bringing their terms to the early notice of persons likely to be concerned, it is not considered desirable to delay their publication as suggested by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, I should like to point out that the result is they reach Deputies two days after they have appeared in the Press, and possibly three days after being broadcast. While I quite agree with what the Minister says, I think it is not in keeping with what ought to be the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there ought to be such delay as that. I do not see any reason for it if they are issued simultaneously to the Press and to Deputies.  Certainly there ought not to be two days between the date on which the documents are <Col N="202" /> received by Deputies and publication in the Press.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Take the last four Orders issued.  They were broadcast on Friday, they appeared in the Press on Saturday, but Deputies did not receive them until Monday.</P>

      <NameTxt>Risteárd Ua Maolchatha</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he will state whether any part of the sum of £256,003 17s. 1d. withheld from the Agricultural Grant to local authorities for the year ended 31st March, 1934, in respect of unpaid annuities has been made good to the local authorities; and if he will state the total amount of this sum now outstanding to each local authority; and whether he proposes to make good to these local authorities the whole, or any part of, the amounts during the current financial year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>The reply to the first part of the question is in the negative.  As regards the second part, the particulars are being prepared, and will be sent to the Deputy.  As regards the third part, the Deputy is no doubt <Col N="203" /> aware that the issue of the amount out of the Guarantee Fund is dependent upon the recovery of the arrears of annuities for the November-December, 1933 gale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister say whether it is the intention, if any part of the arrears of that gale have been paid, say by June of this year, and if they amount to so much, that they will be made available to the local authorities during the year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not promise that they would be made available during the year.  A promise was made long ago that these amounts would be made good to local authorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Risteárd Ua Maolchatha</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he will state, in view of the fact that in respect of unpaid land annuities, there was withheld from the Estate Duty Grant payable to County Councils the sum of £78,256 in respect of the year ended 31st March, 1932; £89,064 1s. 11d. in respect of the year ended 31st March, 1933; and £78,489 13s. 9d. in respect of the year ended 31st March, 1934, whether any of this money has since been made good to the local authorities; and, if so, how much; and if he will state the total amount of these moneys still outstanding to each county council; and whether he proposes to make good the whole or any part of these sums outstanding during the current year; and, if so, if he will state how much money he proposes to provide for this purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the first and second parts of the question, a portion of the sum of £300,000 issued to local bodies in respect of local taxation grants absorbed in the Guarantee Fund that were funded under the Land Act, 1933, was in repayment of the amounts absorbed in the Guarantee <Col N="204" /> Fund on account of the Estate Duty grant for the years ended 31st March, 1932 and 1933.  It is not possible to segregate the amount repaid as between these two years and previous periods.  There has been no repayment in respect of the year ended 31st March, 1934.</P>
      <P>As regards the third part of the question, I am not in a position to give to the Deputy any information at present.  The Deputy is no doubt aware as regards the financial year ended 31st March, 1934, that the issue of the amount of the Guarantee Fund is dependent upon the recovery of the arrears of annuities for the November-December, 1933 gale.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he will state whether he has received a report that on the night of Saturday, 1st September, a band of men visited a number of houses in Charleville, County Cork, and demanded that the occupiers hand over some blue shirts belonging to members of the household; and if he will state whether the persons guilty of this offence have been identified and charged.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Ruttledge)</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <Col N="207" /> I received no report upon this affair until after I had been given notice of the Deputy's question; nor has the matter been reported to the Gárda Síochána by the aggrieved persons. Statements, however, were made to the police by two members of the League of Youth in Charleville which throw some light on what occurred and these I propose to read to the House.</P>
      <P>The first statement is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I reside at Carroll's Lane, Charleville.  On Saturday morning after 12 o'clock I had some drink taken, and as a joke I went to several houses in the town of Charleville where Blueshirts were residing. I knocked at the doors and asked for the shirts.  At the house of William Deasey I got a shirt.  At the other houses I was refused.  I intended the whole thing as a joke.  I did not use any violence or threats of violence and I did not intend to frighten or annoy anyone.  I won't give the name of the man who was with me.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The second statement is:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I remember Friday night, 31st August.  I worked in my office as usual that day.  I left the office at 6 p.m., the usual hour.  I cannot recall where I spent the remainder of the evening.  I usually retire about 9.30 or 10 p.m. but on the night referred to I have no recollection of retiring.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Will the Minister see that, in view of the fact that actions of this kind are catching and that what happens in one part of the country tends to spread to other parts, the same diligence is exercised by the police in following up some of the other cases of this kind in the country?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he is aware that handbills were distributed in the Dublin streets on the 20th and 21st <Col N="208" /> of October, inciting persons to acts of violence against persons engaged on a flag day collection for the United Ireland Party funds; and if he will state what steps were taken by the police to prevent this unlawful incitement to violence; and whether the persons guilty of the offence of distributing these handbills, or of the offence of organising their distribution, have been charged with these offences; and, if so, with what result.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice whether he will state if he has made inquiry as to the number of persons who took part in the organised violence directed against the flag-sellers for the United Ireland Party on Sunday, the 21st October, and if he will state how many persons took part in this violence, and how many of them have been charged with these offences, and with what result.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice whether he has received a report that violent attacks were made in Dublin on 21st October on persons engaged on a flag day collection for the United Ireland Party funds, which had been duly authorised by the police authorities, and if he will state what police measures were taken to secure the flag day workers against this organised violence.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7, 8, and 9 together.  I am aware that the holding of the recent United Ireland Party flag days gave rise to certain disorders in the City of Dublin.  These disturbances took the form of isolated street scuffles which were never serious and which were prevented from developing by the police.  Patrols were trebled in the centre of the city while special motor patrols were detailed to cover the outlying areas.  Two persons were arrested and charged with assaulting collectors and they are at present awaiting trial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister proposing to ignore the question in No. 7 as to incitements on Saturday and Sunday to attack the flag sellers being circulated freely by persons throughout the city, who were not interfered with by the police and does the Minister <Col N="209" /> think that incidents in the city which resulted in injuries to nine men and 10 women are incidents which are not to be regarded as serious?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>I said there were no serious injuries.  That is my information&mdash;that nobody was seriously injured.  There were isolated attacks here and there but the police did their best to deal with the situation.  With regard to the other matter which the Deputy raises, I do not think that any useful purpose would be served by instituting prosecutions in regard to those people, because I do not think they have any effect on anybody.  We have been in the position that we have had to ignore incitements all over the country by people who belonged to the Deputy's Party.  I do not think they had much effect.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Risteárd Ua Maolchatha</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state whether he is aware that grave concern is caused by the fact that trade returns for the twelve months ended August, 1934, disclose an adverse balance of £19,016,576, and if he will state the value of such machinery or other capital goods imported during the twelve months ended the 31st August as may be expected to mitigate in time the effects of this trading loss; and where it is anticipated that such mitigation will take place by the development of existing industries or the creation of new ones; if he will state the industries in which such development is expected to take place and the value of the imports of machinery or other capital goods imported during the twelve months ended August, 1934, in respect of each such industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am unaware of the existence of any grave concern about the so-called adverse balance.  The Deputy will, no doubt, bear in mind that an adverse balance on visible trade may be offset by a credit balance on invisible items, and that although it is not yet possible to formulate an accurate estimate of our invisible items it is well known that there is a very substantial favourable balance on such items.  The statistics of visible trade are not compiled in such a way that the value of imports of capital goods can readily be ascertained and, accordingly, information is not available with reference to the last part of the question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">

      <P>Is the Minister aware that the adverse trade balance has increased by about £6,000,000 in the last couple of years, and can he assure us that there is an offset to that in any other way?  The Minister should be aware that there is disquiet with regard to this matter, and so much disquiet that he has to be explaining through his Party that capital-producing imports are being brought into this country.  Is the House to understand that the Minister is making this statement without being able to tell the House what these imports are and what the effect is likely to be on the developing and setting up of industry in the country?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that the weekly allowances granted under the Unemployment Assistance Act, 1933, are inadequate to meet the needs of families of two children and upwards and that there is general dissatisfaction regarding the operation of the &ldquo;means test&rdquo; and the &ldquo;waiting period,&rdquo; and whether it is his intention to amend the Unemployment Assistance Act by increasing the scales of payment to meet the present contingency, so that poor law assistance under the Poor Relief (Dublin) Act, 1929, can be dispensed with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>An increase in the rates of unemployment assistance or a reduction of the statutory &ldquo;waiting period&rdquo; would increase expenditure under the Unemployment Assistance Act, 1933, and I do not at present propose to introduce any amending legislation which would have this effect.  The things which constitute the means of a person under the Unemployment Assistance Act, 1933, are defined in Section 13 of that Act, and persons who have such means cannot be treated under the Act as if they had no such means. The powers and responsibilities conferred on local authorities by those enactments under which relief by way of home assistance is provided are not <Col N="212" /> affected by the Unemployment Assistance Act, 1933.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarSeanDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask the Minister if it is possible to speed up the time within which appeals are considered so that the waiting period will not be so long, because, during that time, such applicants have to be relieved under the Poor Relief (Dublin) Act, 1929?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The waiting period referred to in the Deputy's question has nothing to do with the consideration of appeals.  It is a statutory waiting period provided for under the Act.  I am not aware that there is any delay in considering appeals against refusal of unemployment assistance, nor do I think there is any considerable number of appeals outstanding against refusal of certificates in the City of Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarSeanDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that there are many factories and laundries where steam boilers are installed; that persons having no experience of the operation or application of steam are employed and given charge of boilers and whether having regard to the dangers involved it is his intention to amend the regulations of the Factory Act to provide that only competent persons are engaged at such skilled employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that steam boilers are used in many factories for the purpose of generating steam.  The existing Factory and Workshops Acts oblige the &ldquo;occupiers&rdquo; of such factories to comply with certain safety requirements.  Such boilers must be examined thoroughly by a competent person at least once in every fourteen months and must be provided with proper safety valves and steam and water gauges.</P>

      <P>The compilation of the particulars asked for in the first part of the question would involve a great deal of time and labour which, in my opinion, would not in present circumstances <Col N="214" /> be justified.  The information asked for in the second part is not available, but the Deputy may take it that every agricultural labourer is entitled, like other labourers, to receive a qualification certificate under the Unemployment Assistance Act, 1933, if he fulfils the conditions for the receipt of such certificate.  The conditions are:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  that the applicant is a national of Saorstát Eireann within the meaning of the definition, laid down in the Act;</P>
      <P>(2)  that the applicant has attained the age of 18 years and has not attained the age of 70 years; and</P>
      <P>(3)  that the applicant's means, calculated in accordance with the Act, do not exceed, in case he is resident in a county borough or the Borough of Dun Laoghaire, £52 or, in case he is resident elsewhere in Saorstát Eireann, £39 per annum.</P>

It was never more needed than to-day.  The benefits of the alternative markets with which Fianna Fáil has provided us; the benefits of the revised agriculture under the administration of Dr. James Ryan, Minister for Agriculture; the benefits of the hundreds of factories, which Deputy Norton aptly described as being carried on under conditions which would disgrace ancient Babylon&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I leave it to Deputy Tom Kelly to find out whether the conditions were true or not.  These benefits, with this half million which will be poured out now for the purpose of counteracting potential starvation, will be very welcome.  I want to make special representation to the responsible Minister that the claims of small farmers &mdash; particularly married men with families&mdash;should receive prior consideration when work is being allotted on the various schemes that are undertaken by the Board of Works in connection with the expenditure of this money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I was just going to refer to the detail that induces me to make that representation here to-day.  Let me say at once that, in my opinion, from my experience of the administration of relief schemes in the past, the central administration of relief schemes was never better than at present.  I have put forward a number of schemes myself, and I know of a number of persons not acquainted with the Fianna Fáil Party who have put forward schemes, and, to the best of my knowledge, they have all been considered on their merits.  I have also found that when I have approached the Board, either directly or by letter, any representations I had to make to it received fair and reasonable consideration. I think it is only right that that tribute should be paid to the central <Col N="218" /> organisation of this relief scheme administration.</P>
      <P>The reason I have mentioned the necessity for extending a preference to married men in connection with these schemes is that the central administration is in no sense reproduced down on the site of the works in the country. I fully appreciate the difficulty of controlling these schemes right from the central office down to the actual place where the work is being carried out; but my experience is that gangers charged with the carrying out of the work in remote rural areas have practically placed an embargo on any individual who is not prepared to join a Fianna Fáil club.  The Parliamentary Secretary will remember that 12 months ago I said that there was not at that time very much substance in promiscuous charges of gross favouritism in the employment of individual workers.  I am obliged to amend that statement now, and, in my opinion, the abuse to which I refer has grown up in the course of the last 12 months.  I have heard, from any number of districts, that men have been told&mdash;not officially, but nevertheless, effectively&mdash;that if they join the local Fianna Fáil Cumann and pay their shilling, they will get work, and that if they do not join they will not get work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I may say, as I have said on previous occasions, that the Parliamentary Secretary, when dealing with his own Department, usually sheds the weapon of insolence.  I strongly appeal to him now to do the same thing.  I have not hesitated in public to pay a tribute to the administration of his Department.  I am now drawing his attention to an existing evil which I fully understand is very difficult to correct, but I would not mention it unless I was absolutely satisfied of its existence.  I would not bring his attention to it if I had not a kind of idea that he must really exert himself to make an end of it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask a question? I am going to take it that the Deputy is speaking in good faith, as I am speaking in good faith, and that the common purpose of the whole House is to see that these things are honestly administered.  It is agreed that the intention of the central administration, by every influence it can exert, is in the direction of that fair play.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is my impression.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of carrying it out depends on whether or not that spirit is carried right down through.  It is recognised that it is difficult for us at the centre to know everything that is going on at the extreme ends.  The Deputy has knowledge of actual evils. Has he communicated them to me?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The explanation is quite simple and the Parliamentary Secretary, in his own experience, must know the difficulty that is involved in these cases.  It is impossible for me to charge an individual ganger with having refused to employ an individual man because he is not a member of a Fianna Fáil club.  The ganger will say: &ldquo;Here is John Murphy and there is Pat Coughlan&mdash;what is there between these two men?&rdquo; All I know is that Pat Coughlan is a supporter of Fine Gael and John Murphy is a supporter of Fianna Fáil and that no matter how often that comparison is made John Murphy will get the work every time. But if I went to the Parliamentary Secretary and said: &ldquo;Here is a clear <Col N="220" /> case of victimisation&rdquo; he will say: &ldquo;What is there to choose between these two men?  They are both single men or they are both married men. Was not John Murphy just as much entitled as Pat Coughlan?&rdquo; I would be obliged to say, &ldquo;I must admit that is true.&rdquo;  But the outcome of it is that they are all John Murphys.  Is it not a very strange thing that when the claims were equal in all these cases the scale never came down on that side, but always came down on the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I put another question? We employed somewhere about 20,000 or 30,000 last year on about 2,000 or 3,000 works.  These were known to all Deputies.  Is the Deputy aware of any particular case in which he has the names of the men who were employed upon a job which can, on investigation, be shown to fall into the category which he declares to be universal?  I want one case.  I will investigate it.  I will go further&mdash;I will ask the Deputy to sit beside me and do the investigating with me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary asked me if I know any relief work where favouritism was shown to supporters of the Fianna Fáil Party.  He further invites me if, in future, a case is brought to my attention where a ganger is showing an undue discrimination, that is a discrimination not based on the material needs of the people wanting work, to communicate the case to him and he will undertake to investigate it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Undoubtedly.  He will be extremely grateful to that Deputy or any other Deputy who will share with him the responsibility of carrying out this work by doing that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate and accept the undertaking of the Parliamentary Secretary.  Many people will say that to seek such undertakings or to accept them is the merest folly because they will not work.  I am of opinion that they are worth seeking; that they are worth trying to work; and I fully appreciate that, no matter how conscientiously they are worked, it will be impossible to eradicate the thing <Col N="221" /> entirely.  I have no doubt whatever that the concrete offer made by the Parliamentary Secretary to all Deputies will be of material assistance in checking what was developing into a very serious evil all through the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will, I think, agree that he ought not to say that now.  He is now assuming that that is the case because he says that there is a definite evil.  We have asked him, out of 2,000 cases, with the aid and assistance of his whole Party organisation, to provide us with one case for examination.  I have offered him that not merely will I fully investigate it but I will go further and allow him as a representative of his Party to come and examine some of the records and see how we did try to examine any report made.  I repudiate absolutely the suggestion that there is any widespread evil of this kind.  If it is there, I am going to be downright grateful to any Deputy who will give me the evidence that it is there in any single case.  We have had dozens of debates and we have had these vague allegations. All the time I have tried to treat the House as being as honest in the matter as I am myself, but never yet have I succeeded in getting from those who made these vague accusations any evidence which I could examine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Parliamentary Secretary is bearing fully in mind the very difficult element that enters into it&mdash;that very frequently it is impossible to demonstrate beyond doubt that the preference has been exercised on political grounds and not by mere chance.  That accounts very largely for the difficulty in bringing concrete cases under his notice heretofore and will complicate the situation in future.  I have no doubt, however, that some useful work may be done along the lines he is suggesting.  He asked from time to time that suggestions should be sent to him of new kinds of work on which money might be profitably spent. I have made suggestions from time to time and on each occasion I have found them adequately and reasonably considered. I want to make a further <Col N="222" /> suggestion now.  There are certain parts of the country, notably in the congested areas, where main roads or country roads that ought to have been maintained have fallen into such a state of disrepair that the money which is available for their maintenance is barely keeping them in a passable condition; in fact, the gradual tendency for them is to become worse and worse. I am particularly familiar with the situation which obtains in Gweedore in the Lower Rosses, and I have no doubt also obtains in parts of Connemara and West Kerry.  There we have a situation in which the roads leading down to Burtonport and in the neighbourhood of Kincasslagh are becoming almost impassable.  Recently the county surveyor pointed out the difficulty under which he found himself labouring&mdash;that without a substantial sum to restore those roads to a really proper condition it was almost waste of money to try to maintain them.  There does not seem to be any fund from which the local authority could get a lump sum in order to put a road of that character in repair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am going to suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that it would be money well spent over a wide and necessitous area if a road of that character was taken in hand and put into really tourist condition.  It is of scenic value; it is a part of the country to which tourists would ordinarily be drawn.  Unless a road over which a motor can conveniently travel is provided in that area, the tourist traffic will be absolutely destroyed.  I suggest that he should consider ways and means of making a substantial grant to a local authority where he was clearly satisfied that exceptional conditions obtained and that it was worth while to put the road in real repair, provided also he was satisfied that, having put it in repair, the local authority would appropriate sufficient money from the rates to keep it in the condition in which he would have left it.  Inevitably with the expenditure of money for relief purposes there is bound to be a certain substantial loss, inasmuch as there will be no economic return for some of the money <Col N="223" /> laid out.  It is the object of us all, while endeavouring to relieve unemployment by the expenditure of public money, to secure as large economic returns as can be got out of the expenditure. The Parliamentary Secretary will have noticed in travelling around the country over the schemes he has in operation for a considerable time that there is a lot of land which badly requires drainage.  I do not mean arterial drainage or that kind of thing in connection with the rivers.  I refer to land that has gone to rushes and flaggers which ought to be drained. That land is very largely in the holding of tenants in the congested district areas.  These tenants would be very glad to be able to drain that land and to hire the sons of their neighbours to do so.  But they cannot do that.  They cannot afford it.</P>
    <P>I know there is a prejudice in the minds of members of the House against the using of public money for the improvement of private property. Nevertheless exceptional circumstances require exceptional treatment.  I think there are schemes operating in other countries under which the tenants of small holdings are allowed to carry out certain works in accordance with regulations laid down by the central authority, and on their satisfying the inspectors of the central authority that the work has been done in accordance with their regulations they are paid by the central authority the money spent on the work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>£10,000 was spent on that last year.  What we do is we practically employ people to do their own improvement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an extremely valuable kind of work.  I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to advise the House in what form applications should go forward to him with a view to having that sort of work carried out. I know there is a certain difficulty in suggesting that the Board of Works go into Pat Martin's land in order to have this work done, while his neighbour's land is just as much in need of being drained.  Therefore, I suggest to the <Col N="224" /> Minister that applications be invited from the people in a particular area who want their lands drained in accordance with the scheme laid down by the Board of Works and that in April or May, or at whatever particular time the Board of Works have to be satisfied the work should be carried out, these people would receive so much money for draining the land.  There are some people who may have exaggerated ideas as to the carrying out of the instructions of the Board of Works and it may be found when these people have carried out the work to the best of their ability that they may not get any grant at all.  How this side of the question is to be got over I cannot now suggest.  But if we could get the individual holder&mdash;small tenant purchaser &mdash;to drain his land by means of this assistance, the eradication of rushes and flaggers, which are a very considerable menace to small holders in rural areas, would be a work which would give the country a considerable advantage out of the money spent in the relief of unemployment.  I do not know that there is any other comment on this matter that I can profitably make here to the House.  Such other schemes I propose to communicate to the Parliamentary Secretary in the way I have done in the past.</P>

      <P>Everybody who knows the serious unemployment problem which exists in the country will welcome the introduction of this Relief Scheme Vote.  The Parliamentary Secretary last night in a very discursive discourse on the unemployment problem and after a very lucid display of the extent of that problem by means of curved graphs told us that we had a certain unemployment problem to meet.  I was rather disappointed in the line the Parliamentary Secretary took last night; for, while his speech was interesting, from the point of view of portraying <Col N="225" /> the problem, he sat down without telling the House of one single proposal for dealing with it.  I rather think that the graphs were used more for the purpose of minimising the serious unemployment problem than for enabling the House or the Government to realise its responsibilities in the way of providing a solution for that problem.  The outstanding fact that emerges was that the extent of unemployment is greater than it was before.  As a matter of fact according to the figures published by the Department of Industry and Commerce there were 52,000 people in receipt of unemployment assistance benefit on the 1st October, 1934.  On the same day there were approximately 18,000 people in receipt of unemployment insurance benefit.  We find, therefore, that there were 70,000 unemployed people who satisfied the rather rigorous and curtailed form of test applied in order to secure benefit under the Unemployment Insurance Act and under the Unemployment Assistance Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every Deputy in the House knows that a large number of people might be added to the number who are eligible for unemployment assistance benefit because there are thousands of appeals against the rejection of the claims at present awaiting decision and there are large numbers of people who are also unemployed and whose means calculated under the peculiar formula used in the Unemployment Assistance Act is such as to bring them slightly outside the scope of the Act.  Consequently, while those people are unemployed they are not shown as unemployed on the register of those receiving benefit.  That is a very serious problem to be dealt with and no graphs and no disputes or dialectics between one Party and another can possibly minimise the gravity of the unemployment problem which I should suggest to-day is in the vicinity of 100,000 persons.  The contribution of £150,000 will make a very small impression on so widespread an evil of that kind.  I am rather doubtful as to whether the Ministry are wise in imagining that relief schemes of this character are likely to make any <Col N="226" /> impression on a problem of that kind. In my view it is necessary that the Government should look much deeper for a solution of that problem.  They should look much more deeply and much more courageously for a solution than they are apparently disposed to do to-day.</P>
    <P>This Relief Vote will, I rather gather, be used mainly in rural areas; will be used probably for making bog roads, accommodation roads, drainage into turbary and other schemes of that kind, much of the character indicated by Deputy Dillon.  But there is a very real problem which is not being met at all and that is the problem of dealing with the people in the cities and the large and small towns.  What is the Government's proposal in that respect?  I know towns in my own constituency where destitution stalks naked, where people cannot secure employment.  There are no industries there and there is no hope of industries being established.  What are the proposals of the Ministry for dealing with the large numbers of unemployed in those places?  At one time the Government hoped that its policy of decentralised industry would absorb large numbers of these people into employment, but I think that by now the Minister for Industry and Commerce must have lost a good deal of enthusiasm for his scheme of decentralised industry because it is almost impossible, except to a very limited extent, to have decentralised industry on the basis of competition in industry.  You can have decentralised industry, as in the case of flour milling where you allocate to each factory a quota and where you ensure it will be a guaranteed quota.  But where you have unrestrained, unrestricted competition in industry there is no hope of the rural industries surviving. They cannot do so in competition with the highly organised and highly capitalised industries of the same character established in cities and towns.</P>
    <P>While on the subject of decentralised industry, let me give an example to the House of just the kind of industry we are getting under this form of decentralisation which the Minister <Col N="227" /> advocated.  Deputy T. Kelly is behind me and I hope he will take special notice of this in view of the statement he made a few minutes ago that certain remarks made by me in connection with conditions in the new industries were proved to be untrue. They were not proved to be untrue to my satisfaction, and if they were proved to be untrue to Deputy Kelly's satisfaction, he has not the sagacity for which I always gave him credit. Let me take a case that was brought to my notice recently.  A certain person desired to establish a new industry in a certain town and he proposed to manufacture a commodity protected by a heavy tariff.  He acquired a factory building and he proceeded to employ about ten people to adapt that factory building for the purpose of the proposed new industry.  The people whom he engaged in adapting that building, to do work that was really proper to builders' labourers and for which one shilling per hour ought to be paid, were put on a totally different basis altogether.  As I say, work of this sort should be paid for at the rate of one shilling an hour, although that is less, as a matter of fact, than the local rate. Instead of paying one shilling an hour for building work of that kind this particular industrialist employed ten people for nine and a half hours a day and paid them 18/11 for that work.  It was a condition of their employment that they signed a declaration to the effect that they were satisfied with the 18/11.  If Deputy Kelly disputes that or if the Minister for Industry and Commerce disputes it, I will take them to this particular town and get the workers there to produce their wage dockets and I will get hundreds of others to declare that they knew the conditions under which they were invited to do this work.</P>

      <P>Deputy Traynor suggested that this is a matter that should be dealt with by the trade union.  It is because employers of that kind exist that it is necessary to have trade unions in order to defend the workers.  Deputy Traynor, who is a trade unionist himself, knows well the difficulty in relation to the workers in rural areas.  He knows it is impossible to establish branches of trade unions in rural areas where there are only 12 or 20 people. Deputy Traynor, with his knowledge of the trade union movement, would not, I feel sure, suggest that you can establish <Col N="229" /> branches of unions all over the rural areas, and this particular place was a rural area.  What has Deputy Traynor's Party to say with reference to the continuance of an industrial system which enables workers to be exploited, to work so hard for a very low rate of wages, and which gets facilities under the Trade Loans Guarantee Act to carry on that form of exploitation? I know that Deputy Traynor does not agree with that, and he has no use for the type of mentality which advocates that kind of a scheme.  But there is a definite obligation on the Ministry to deal with cases of sweating of that kind. Unfortunately that is altogether too common a feature in many of the industries that are growing up.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to get back to the Government's policy for helping to relieve unemployment in the cities and the large and small towns.  Relief schemes find their way into the rural areas, but in the cities and the large and small towns there is a very serious unemployment problem to be faced.  It is perhaps a more acute problem than that existing in the rural areas.  One is compelled to admit in the rural areas there is a very serious situation.  The last thing I would like to do would be to put the rural areas in competition with the cities and towns over relief <Col N="230" /> moneys.  There is an obvious obligation on the Ministry to formulate proposals which will provide work of a constructive character in the towns, where there is abundant work to be done and where unemployed men and women are craving for an opportunity to do something.  In some respects this Estimate looks like planning the disposition of furniture in a house already on fire.  If the Government would take its courage in its hands and if the Minister for Industry and Commerce, in particular, would give effect to some of these fine, industrial sentiments which he expresses outside the House, we would be nearer to a solution of the unemployment problem. The Minister, in the course of a very fine speech recently at a Fianna Fáil assembly, told the audience that he rather believed that a reduction of working hours would produce some impression on the problem of unemployment. Does the Minister still believe that?  If he does, there is an obvious obligation on him, charged as he is with dealing with industrial matters, to formulate some proposal to this House for reducing the working hours in industry.  I know of no way in which it would be possible to make a more effective and a more immediate impression on the problem of unemployment than by the reduction of working hours in industry.  If the Ministry would take its courage in its hands and reduce working hours so as to ensure the absorption of additional workers in employment, I believe a greater impression would be made on the unemployment problem than can possibly be made by a relief vote of this kind.  Deputy Dillon, when here, referred to the fact that I said that certain industries employed an undue proportion of youthful and female labour.  That is perfectly true.  If the Minister does not know that, or if his Department does not know it, I shall give him a list of trade unions which will produce absolutely undeniable evidence that an excessive proportion of youthful and female labour is being employed in many industries.  If investigations are made into that matter, there will be no hesitation whatever <Col N="231" /> in producing the most convincing evidence that a large number of industries are being carried on by exploiting young girls, young boys and adolescents at rates of wages which nobody could possibly stand over as Christian rates of wages.  Here again I suggest to the Minister to accelerate the introduction of legislation designed to get rid of that undue proportion of female and youthful labour in industry.  If legislation of that kind were introduced, I believe it would help to provide employment for many fathers of families and many breadwinners who are to-day being maintained on the small pittance received by their children in many of these factories where they are being exploited.  I do not deny, and nobody but a certified fool would deny, that there are good industries in the country where decent rates of wages are paid, where trade union conditions of labour are observed and where the relationship between the trade unions and the employers has been, and continues to be, of a harmonious character. But these new industries which are exploiting juvenile and female labour are a menace to the old-established industries, a menace to the rates of wages paid in these industries, and a menace to anything approaching a civilised standard of life.  If the Ministry are anxious to get a short-cut to the relief of the unemployment problem, I suggest that that short-cut can be found, not by introducing relief schemes of this kind, though they are good in their own way, but by taking steps to reduce the working hours in industry and to eliminate unnecessary and economically unwanted youthful and female labour in industry.  If the Ministry have the courage to do that, I believe it will make a greater and more lasting impression on the problem of unemployment than if this estimate were for £1,000,000 instead of for £150,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that large portions of this problem are international in character, but, at the same <Col N="232" /> time, Deputy Moore will realise that many of our industries are being protected by prohibitive tariffs from the blast of international competition. We are protecting these industries from foreign competition, but we are not doing anything as a legislature to protect the human material in these industries from exploitation and competition, which is ever worse than the foreign competition which these industries have to face.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Firms with an export trade have, of course, to meet keen competition elsewhere, but the industry I gave as an illustration, which pays 18/11 for a week of nine and a half hours per day, has not to meet any export competition in the matter of adapting a factory for use. Yet this legislature stands hopelessly by while that form of exploitation is permitted to continue.  It is all right to tell the House and the country that we are animated by the best possible intentions towards these people and that, ultimately, it is hoped to evolve a social system in which that form of exploitation will be unknown, or will be dealt with drastically if it should appear.  However, the ordinary unemployed man or woman in the country, or the unemployed people in the towns and cities who are compelled to pay fancy rents for insanitary hovels, cannot wait for ever for a solution of that problem.  They want a solution with the utmost possible expedition, and I should wish that, instead of debating an estimate for £150,000, which will not touch even the uttermost fringe of the problem of unemployment, the Ministry would take up the time of the House in dealing with proposals for legislation to eliminate child and female labour from industry and to reduce the working week of those employed so as to enable those who are idle to find a proper and constructive place in industry.</P>

      <P>I intend only to intervene for a short period in this debate in order to give Deputies information <Col N="233" /> which, I think, they should have when discussing any proposal having a bearing upon the unemployment problem. I do so more particularly because, quite recently, I came upon evidence that certain wild statements made by members of this House&mdash;members of the Party opposite&mdash;and in the columns of certain of our daily newspapers were doing definite damage to the credit of the country.  On that occasion I published, in the form of an interview with certain newspaper representatives, information which had come to me officially concerning employment and unemployment here. I regret that one particular newspaper &mdash;the <i>Irish Independent</i>&mdash;only published that statement in a garbled form and, in leading articles subsequently, and in an associated newspaper on Sunday, actually misquoted the statement in order to maintain their campaign against the credit of the country.  I take this opportunity of giving the information at first hand to Deputies so that they will not be misled by the reckless misrepresentations which that particular newspaper has indulged in concerning the position in respect of unemployment here. That paper represented me on Sunday last as having endeavoured to excuse an increase in unemployment on the ground that population had also increased, whereas, in fact, I had proved by figures that there had been, despite an increase in population, a decided decrease in unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Each week I have published the figures showing the number of persons on the live register at the employment exchanges.  The publication of these figures was undertaken by the present Government. Previous to this Government coming into office these figures were not published. Misunderstandings concerning the position have been created by attempts to compare the present-day figures with the figures for last year, and for earlier years, without any recognition of the fact that there have been very substantial changes both in the administration of the employment exchanges and in the legislation affecting employment exchanges <Col N="234" /> in the interval.  The first of these changes was, of course, the regulation requiring that all employment under schemes financed, in whole or in part, out of State funds should be offered through the employment exchanges; that administrative regulation necessitates every person in the country, hoping to get employment, to register with the employment exchanges.  And there was, of course, a very substantial rise in the number of persons on the register&mdash;a rise which was reflected in the fact that the number of persons placed in employment was increased from 17,000 in 1931 to 100,000 in the following year.</P>
    <P>This year there was a new factor, which also had a bearing upon the registered figures, and that is the coming into operation of the Unemployment Assistance Act, which has created the position that there are now registered at the employment exchanges, not merely those persons unemployed but also persons who are owners of farms or businesses which are conducted by themselves but which yield an annual income, calculated in accordance with the terms of the Act, of less than the maximum stated in the Act.  I have said that not merely has unemployment not increased in the Free State in the past two years, but it has decreased.  I make that assertion despite the change in the unemployment register figures, which are frequently referred to when this matter is under discussion. The difficulty in proving that assertion arises out of the fact that there are no statistics at all relating to unemployment in the years between 1926 and 1931.  Any comparison that is to be made for the purpose of comparing the present-day position with the earlier years, must be made with the position in the year 1926&mdash;that is, the year in which the census was taken and from which fairly extensive information concerning the position in respect to employment and unemployment in the country was obtained.</P>
    <P>The census of 1926 showed that 78,000 people described themselves as <Col N="235" /> out of work.  It was contended, and I think rightly contended, that that figure was inflated for various reasons. But any of the causes which operated to inflate that figure are still operating to inflate the live register figure and operating with much more definite effect.  For example, it was contended that a certain number of farmers and farmers' sons described themselves as out of work on the occasion of the census for some reason not quite clear. It is quite possible that some of them did so although there was no particular advantage to be gained by such misdescription in that year, whereas in subsequent years and last year there was a very definite advantage to be gained in so far as a man made himself eligible to receive employment and eligible to receive unemployment assistance.  An examination of the live register figures, carried out by my Department, showed that 10 per cent. of those on the live register admitted that they were landowners. It was contended in 1926 that 10 per cent. of those who described themselves as out of work were farmers or farmers' sons. I think that was an overestimate; but when we come to the year 1933, 10 per cent. of the live register admitted that they were farmers and that 10 per cent. does not include farmers' sons at all.</P>
    <P>In addition to the 78,000 that described themselves as out of work in 1926, there was, roughly, 75,000 persons returned as land holders of the class that are qualified now to receive unemployment assistance under the Act. These holders of small farms had an average income from them which, if calculated in accordance with the Insurance Assistance Act, would work out at £39 a year or less.  If the same procedure for the registration of the unemployed operated in 1926, as in 1934, if there was the same administrative requirements in respect of the employment of labour through the exchanges, and if the Unemployment Assistance Act was in operation, bringing into registration all those persons claiming, and entitled to claim, unemployment <Col N="236" /> assistance the live register of the census of 1926 would be something over 150,000 persons, and would be something in the neighbourhood of 154,000 or 155,000 persons.  At the present time, which is, of course, the time of the year at which unemployment is normally greater than in April when the census was taken, the number of persons on the live register is 118,000 and the number of those claiming unemployment assistance, or unemployment insurance benefit is about 108,000. The number actually receiving payment of assistance or benefit is only about 78,000.  There is always, of course, a considerable difference between the number claiming and the number actually receiving benefit because of the operation of the waiting week.</P>
    <P>As I explained, one must not take the figure of registered unemployed as representing the number of persons permanently out of employment.  It also represents a large number of people passing from one job to another.  Our investigations show that about 16 per cent. of those on the register, at one particular time, have been unemployed for less than a week and 25 per cent. for less than two weeks; and that fact, together with the waiting period which a person must undergo between claiming and receiving benefit, means that there is always a larger number of claims than there is of persons receiving assistance and benefit.  It is clear, therefore, that even allowing for the abnormal registrations now taking place, in so far as every person who considers he can make a claim to unemployment assistance is doing so, and that those people will disappear off the live register when they find they are not entitled to unemployment assistance, nevertheless there is in that figure an indication that the unemployment situation is less serious now than it was in 1926.  It is, I think, commonly admitted, and all the available figures appear to substantiate the fact, that in 1930 and 1931 the situation was much more serious than in 1926.  The world depression had begun.  The slump in prices had begun to operate, and the effects of these on the situation were <Col N="237" /> being felt here, so that if we are satisfied that the situation now in 1934 is less serious than in 1926, then it is obviously much less serious than in 1931.</P>

      <P>It is necessary to make things very plain so that the Deputy may understand them.  However, it is not necessary to rely upon these deductions from the unemployment register figures in order to prove how preposterous was Deputy Dillon's statement that relief schemes were never more urgently needed in the Saorstát. There is other evidence to show that they were never less urgently needed although I agree that they are needed. The best means of sizing up the unemployment situation is to size up the employment situation.  There is fairly reliable data upon which to base assertions concerning the number of persons in employment.  There is on the one hand the contribution income of the Unemployment Insurance Fund.  Everybody employed for wages, other than those employed in agriculture or domestic service, is required to be insured under the Unemployment Insurance Act.  For every week's work such a person does, a stamp has to be purchased and affixed to his card so that the income of the Unemployment Insurance Fund from the sale of stamps is a reliable index of the number of weeks worked by all persons in such occupations in any one year.  The contribution income of the Unemployment Insurance Fund in the year 1931 was £497,000.  That represented, on the average, 178,000 stamps per week.  If every person was fully employed for 52 weeks there would have been 178,000 people so employed in the year 1931. In the year 1933 the contribution income was £553,000, representing average weekly contribution of 198,000.</P>

      <P>No.  There is another index by which we can check up on that and that is the contributions under the National Health Insurance Acts.  All persons in employment, not merely in the same occupations as are covered by the Unemployment Insurance Acts but also persons employed in agriculture and in domestic service, are required to be insured under the National Health Insurance Acts.  For every week's work done by such persons, a stamp has to be purchased and affixed to his or her card so that we can get from the number of National Health stamps purchased a fairly accurate indication of the number of persons in employment in all occupations and any changes in that number.  The contribution <Col N="239" /> income of the National Health scheme in the year 1926 was £485,000 representing average weekly contributions of 279,000.  In the year 1931 the income was £554,000, representing average weekly contributions of 320,000. In the year 1933 the income was £605,000 representing average weekly contributions of 349,000.  It is clear, therefore, that employment in such occupations, calculated on the basis of the average number of persons employed weekly, was 29,000 greater in 1933 than in 1931 and 70,000 greater than in 1926.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite.  Deputies, I think, know that it has been revealed in statistics from time to time that a change has taken place in the nature of employment given in agriculture. There has been for a number of years a steady increase in the number of persons working for wages offset by a decrease in the number of farmers' sons assisting their fathers on the farms. That is a change which has been going on for a number of years, and it is, of course, reflected in these figures.  That increase in employment took place between 1931 and 1933, despite the fact that in the same period there was an increase in population.  The funny leader writer of the <i>Independent</i>, of course, assumes that the increasing population was represented by a number of additional babies.  That is the type of argument that one expects in a leading article of the <i>Independent.</i>  In fact, the birth rate decreased during these two years.  The increase in population was due entirely to the stoppage of overseas emigration and represented an addition to the number of people in this country between the ages of 18 and 25: that is, of people who would be most energetic in seeking employment. The increase in population, however, was less than the increase in employment, and on that account, unless a number of people have come from outside to take up employment here, there must have been, in 1933, a decrease in unemployment as compared with the year 1931.  I will admit that the figures I am quoting relate to the year 1933. The figures for the year 1934 are not available, but when they are, then from the indications which have come in already, they are going to show an even greater increase in employment between 1934 and 1933 than between 1933 and the previous year.  For example, it has been estimated that the number of persons engaged in house construction at the beginning of August, 1934, was 11,000 greater than at the beginning of August, 1933.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister giving the total figure?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously, the figure is an estimate.  The estimate of <Col N="241" /> employment in house building is calculated in relation to the number of houses actually under construction at a particular time.  It is assumed, I think, that each house gives employment to a man and a half every year. Consequently, the estimate is based on that assumption&mdash;the actual number of houses under construction.  That relates, of course, to direct employment in the construction of houses and does not take into account the employment given in slate quarries, in brickyards, in foundry works, in paint shops or anything of that kind, and I may say that all that class of employment has shown a corresponding increase.  I have this unemployment situation under continuous review by experts in my Department: by representatives of the Statistics and the Employment and Trade branches.  The information which they make available in their periodic reports indicates that unemployment is decreasing, not decreasing very rapidly, but, nevertheless, decreasing, and that employment is substantially increasing, increasing sufficiently not merely to absorb the increase in population, but also to effect the decrease in unemployment to which I have referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The figures relating to the live register are entirely misleading and, in fact, an analysis of them shows quite clearly that what has happened between October, 1933, and October, 1934, is that there is going on to the register for the first time all the small landholders of the western and southern counties.  In fact, the number of persons registered has hardly increased at all in the cities or in certain of the eastern counties despite the coming into operation of the Unemployment Assistance Act. The whole increase has taken place in the western, northern, and in certain southern counties, and it indicates that the Unemployment Assistance Act has brought into contact with the employment labour exchanges, for the first time, a very large number of persons who, ordinarily, did not regard themselves, and were not regarded, as unemployed.  They were persons occupying small holdings of land which, <Col N="242" /> at certain seasons of the year, were sufficient to provide them with a livelihood, a livelihood occasionally supplemented by the earnings which these landholders were able to secure by work on the roads, work at harvest time for other farmers or something of that kind.  These people never had occasion to register before.  It is, indeed, a rather startling fact that from the 98 branch employment exchanges situated away from the larger towns over 60 per cent. of the payments of unemployment assistance are made by postal order.  Deputies, who are familiar with the working of the Act, will realise the significance of that.  Persons residing within a radius of six miles of any of these 98 branch employment exchanges must attend personally at the exchange for the purpose of signing the register and receiving payment.  It is only persons living in remote districts who enjoy the privilege of receiving payment by postal order.  They are exempt from the obligation of attending personally at the exchanges, but the fact is that over 60 per cent. of the total payments of unemployment assistance made from these branch offices are made by postal order.</P>
    <P>There is one other fact, arising out of some of the things that were said, that I want to bring to the notice of the Dáil.  It was stated that there were thousands of appeals against the rejection of claims to unemployment assistance, and that the unemployment register would be further inflated if these appeals were dealt with.  That, of course, is entirely incorrect.  Every person who has an appeal pending must, in fact, be on the register, and it is on that precise account that I believe there are now registering a number of persons who will cease to register when their appeals are rejected, because they are not entitled to unemployment assistance.  Of the 225,000 people who have applied for qualification certificates, over 200,000, or 91 per cent., have had their applications disposed of one way or the other.  I do not want Deputies or others to get confused about that figure.  Everyone is entitled to a <Col N="243" /> qualification certificate, whether employed or unemployed.  That figure is no indication of the number of persons unemployed or of the number of persons employed.  Everybody is entitled to have a qualification certificate. The certificate is only of value when a person becomes unemployed and makes a claim for assistance.  But of those who applied for certificates 91 per cent. have had their applications disposed of.  A number of these were granted and a number rejected.  The position is that 91 per cent. have been disposed of, and only 9 per cent. are outstanding.  These are being disposed at the rate of 2,000 a week.  Of the 20,000 people whose applications were rejected, appeals are pending before the Unemployment Appeals Committee. Some four thousand have had their appeals dealt with and the remainder are being dealt with as expeditiously as possible.</P>
    <P>As I am on my feet I will take advantage of the opportunity to deal with some remarks made by Deputy Norton.  My resentment of the type of statement that Deputy Norton occasionally makes and that Deputy Mulcahy occasionally makes about Irish factories being centres of juvenile employment, centres where bad conditions operate and children are employed&mdash;child farms is, I think, the common phrase&mdash;is that such statements, when applied to Irish industry as a whole, are grotesquely untrue.  It may be that here and there there is a factory owner who is dealing in an unsatisfactory way with his employees: either compelling them to work under bad conditions or paying them unduly low wages, but such factory owners are the exception and not the rule. Deputy Norton, I think, proved that himself in the manner in which he presented the one example that he gave of a certain factory owner.  I will admit that before he raised it here that he brought the case to my notice personally.  He said that a certain factory owner was paying men what appeared to be an extremely low rate of wages for doing construction work &mdash;a rate of wages, he said, which is <Col N="244" /> substantially lower than the district rate.  When he used that phrase he immediately indicated that the case he was referring to was an exceptional case, and could not be advanced as indicative of the situation in respect of the industrial movement generally. Deputy Norton having referred to his one case, and having in my opinion rightly denounced the person who paid such a low rate of wages, if Deputy Norton's information is correct, then proceeded to make the statement which I object to.  He said that type of thing is all too common.  I submit that it is not all too common, and that in fact those individual cases are very much individual cases indeed.  It is true that there are certain industries where employment is given in the main to juveniles, and that there are other industries where employment is given in the main to women, but it is necessary to emphasise that that position is not peculiar to this country.  The industries in which those juveniles or women are employed are industries in which juveniles or women are employed all over the world.  I make this statement without the slightest fear of contradiction&mdash;that in every one of those industries, and particularly in those of them which are subject to Trade Board regulations, the standard rate of wages prevailing here is higher than the standard rate of wages prevailing in Great Britain.  I am not saying that it is too high.  In some cases I might even think it is too low, but if we are to judge Irish industry by comparison with industry in other countries, then I think we can stand that comparison. If we were to judge it by some other standards then we might have something to say.  It is, I think, necessary and desirable that the State should have power to regulate employment in industries where there is a growing tendency to substitute adult labour by juvenile labour, or male labour by female labour, but I should not like it to be thought that the conditions here in any industry are substantially worse, or even slightly worse, than in industry anywhere else, where in fact in most cases they are better, even if Deputies may not think they are good <Col N="245" /> enough.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton urged that the employment situation could be remedied by a reduction of the hours of work in industry.  Deputy Norton is very foolish, I think, to rush in with a positive assertion of that kind on to ground which has been fully explored without anything being discovered, at a number of international conferences recently. There are people&mdash;people not unfriendly to the Labour movement&mdash; who have expressed their opinion as to their ability to prove beyond question that reduction of the hours of work in industry would not merely not produce an increase in employment, but would operate to decrease employment, in so far as it would produce an increased tendency amongst employers to adopt labour-saving devices.  When the labour item in production costs increases there is always a tendency on the part of employers to substitute human labour by machines, if machines are going to produce the same article cheaper.  By reducing the hours of work and consequently producing an automatic increase in labour costs, the tendency to adopt labour-saving devices will be strengthened, and you might well have in some industries a reduction rather than an increase in employment.  On general grounds it might be contended that the increase in labour costs resulting from a reduction in the hours of work would produce an increase in prices; that the increase in prices would depress consumption; that the decrease in consumption would in turn reduce employment, and that in fact you would be merely, as it were, turning a wheel fixed to a stationary axle, which would simply alter the situation slightly but mean that no progress has been made. On the whole, however, I am inclined to think that a reduction in the hours of work is something which we should strive to secure, not because we believe it is going to mean, as Deputy Norton believes, an immediate and effective improvement in the employment situation, but because the benefits of technical improvement in equipment and machinery should be reflected in increased leisure for the workers without <Col N="246" /> increased unemployment.  If the reduction of the hours of work merely operates to reduce unemployment resulting from those technical improvements it will have been justified, but even in that regard we have to remember that our country is in a peculiar position, dependent still to a considerable extent upon an export trade, and we cannot afford to embark upon changes of that kind on our own without taking the risk of certain adverse consequences.  It was noticeable that the great majority of the countries represented at the Geneva Conference this year who were prepared to agree to legislate to reduce the hours of work in industry as a whole made their agreement conditional on all other countries agreeing to do the same thing, because it was felt that unless there was international action it was not possible for any single country to make a move of this nature.</P>
    <P>There is one other point which I wish to deal with and then I will stop. Deputy Norton, when recording the circumstances of the employment given by the individual whom he mentioned&mdash; the person who was paying less than the standard rate on construction work, said: &ldquo;That is something which the Government should deal with.&rdquo;  I am not going to quarrel with that particular statement at the moment, but I want to put to Deputy Norton, through Deputy Norton to the members of the Labour Party, and through the Labour Party to the members of the Trade Union Congress and the trade union movement generally, that if they want the Government to take powers to regulate wages the Government is prepared to consider it, but when we have got that power I cannot see what room there is going to be left for trade unions.  Both of us cannot set out to regulate wages without producing all the elements of a conflict.</P>
    <P>At the present time the trade unions obviously prefer to do that themselves. They profess to be capable of doing it, although they probably admit that here and there difficulties arise which prevent their effective operation.  In my opinion under present circumstances, <Col N="247" /> at any rate, the rates of wages in industry as a whole, or any particular occupation, should be regulated by trade union action&mdash;by agreements made between trade unions on the one hand, and organisations representative of employers on the other.  But if the trade unions feel they cannot do that effectively, or if they have got tired and want to pass on the job to the Department of Industry and Commerce, the Department of Industry and Commerce is quite willing to consider undertaking it, but only on condition that they are left alone to do the job, and that there is not going to be another organisation behind it claiming to do the same thing in a somewhat different manner, because that situation would be obviously ridiculous. If Deputy Norton was speaking the mind of the Labour Party, and of the trade union movement, when he said that the regulation of wages was something which the Government should deal with, then we have a situation which is, I think, a new situation, in so far as that opinion has not been expressed authoritatively on the part of a trade union movement before, but possibly Deputy Norton was merely trying to link up the particular case which he was referring to with his general criticism of the administration of the Department of Industry and Commerce.  If that is so, well and good; we know where we stand; but if he really means that he wants to see the Government undertaking wage regulation generally, then I should like him to make his proposal much more definite, and to tell us precisely where those trade unions would stand if the Government undertook to do what he asks.</P>

      <P>Like the Minister for Industry and Commerce I am tempted to intervene for a moment in this debate, but unlike him, my moment will be really a moment.  It is all very well for the Minister to brush <Col N="248" /> aside the case quoted by Deputy Norton as so singular as to be of no importance.  But the disquieting fact is that, according to what Deputy Norton said, that is a case in which a Government loan was made to the individual in question.  I would like to remind the Minister that when we last had under discussion here the Trades Loans Act, which empowered him to make such Loans and guarantees, I put down amendments, one providing that the progress of any concern getting such a loan should be brought under review in this House from time to time; and another amendment providing that such loans should not be made to men of straw, but to men or concerns with adequate capital for the enterprise they were trying to start: capital corresponding to the importance of the enterprise, and corresponding to the importance of the loan going to be made to them.  Where very bad wages are paid to workmen it is nearly always the case that the persons and the concerns that pay them are poverty stricken and inadequately supplied with capital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was not here when Deputy Keyes was speaking on the unemployment debate last night, but I believe he said that a number of persons in this country showed lack of patriotism, by not bringing back capital from investments in other countries and investing it in Irish concerns.  So far as I am aware, that reproach is completely unfounded, because when an issue of capital is made here for any Irish business of any promise, the capital is immediately available, and if everybody who at present possesses investments in Great Britain or America were to sell them and to bring the money back to Ireland, and seek to invest it, they simply could not find new concerns to invest it in.  I do not believe there is any backwardness at all amongst citizens of this country, of any political complexion, in investing their money in promising Irish businesses, and, therefore, it is all the more unnecessary and undesirable that the Government should encourage men of straw, who are not properly equipped with capital, and probably not properly equipped with <Col N="249" /> experience and intelligence, to start new industries, and to bring about such results as Deputy Norton described here to-day.</P>
    <P>A Deputy on the Fianna Fáil Benches interrupted Deputy Norton to say that the Labour Party had a certain responsibility in the matter.  I agree with that Deputy, though the responsibility I am thinking of is slightly different from what he was thinking of.  I remember when Deputy Norton introduced a motion here with regard to the imposition of tariffs, calling upon the Government to accompany every proposition for a new tariffs, with measures designed to secure proper conditions for the people employed by businesses benefiting from the tariffs.  He very weakly agreed to drop his motion because the Minister for Industry and Commerce assured him that he accepted it in spirit.  Furthermore, the Leader of the Labour Party has frequently announced to the country that he is in constant conference with the Government, and, if so, he is surely in a position to take preventive measures behind the scenes, without having to denounce the Government after the mischief is done.  The Labour Party are surely in a position to make sure, especially in tariffed industries, and where the Government is going to give loans and guarantees, that proper conditions for working people shall prevail.  Finally, in connection with the whole question of unemployment and poverty, they have got a more serious responsibility still in that they are as much to blame as the Government are for the economic war which has created most of our economic difficulties here.</P>
    <P>With regard to the speech of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, I am only going to say one word.  I have been absent for a considerable time from the political arena and so I am not qualified to deal with the mass of statistics which he presented to us, but, at any rate, I am enough in touch with things to say this&mdash;that the ordinary man up and down the country has not the impression that this Government has met with the success in dealing with the unemployment question that the Minister says it has.  We had some discussion here about the Milk <Col N="250" /> Bill yesterday, and we were told that there was some difficulty about defining &ldquo;dirty milk.&rdquo;  We were told that no milk could be considered as &ldquo;dirty&rdquo; unless the dirt was actually visible. One rather has the feeling, especially in view of all the Government's promises and predictions, that we have a right to expect an improvement in the unemployment situation that is visible to the naked eye of the average unprejudiced citizen up and down the country; that it does not have to be proved by means of doubtful and highly contested statistics.</P>
    <P>Certainly, to the eyes of most people, poverty appears to stalk through the country even now, and it seems almost miraculous, with the immense expenditure that has taken place since the Fianna Fáil Government came into office, that so little impression had been made&mdash;even accepting everything the Minister for Industry and Commerce has said&mdash;on the unemployment question. Before they came into office they held the belief that merely by tariffs they could conquer unemployment.  So far as financial policy was concerned, they were committed not to an inflationary policy but to a deflationary policy.  They were going enormously to reduce expenditure.  Instead of that, they have followed an inflationary policy, immense Government expenditure, grants for housing and all the rest, great activity in every sort of employment dependent on or operated by the Government, and tariffs that have gone I am sure at least as far and as fast as anyone expected them to go, in protecting our industries.  In spite of all that, the impression made on the unemployment problem here can only be described as pitiable&mdash;even assuming that any impression has been made upon it at all.</P>
    <P>I am not going to tire Deputies by traversing old ground, but I suggest to them that they might reflect upon that fact and might consider once again whether there is not something fundamentally wrong with their policy of creating ill will between ourselves and other nations, and in creating ill will between various classes in this country, and with their policy of apparently <Col N="251" /> deliberately impoverishing certain classes in this country.  I suppose from their point of view the destruction of the medium-sized farmer or the large farmer should have no effect on employment, because we are told that none of these people give any employment, that they are ranchers, who run their farms with a stick and a dog; and therefore the economic war ought really to have had no effect at all in making the unemployment question more difficult.  Yet it has.  Surely they must admit it has, when they see that all the measures they relied upon have had so little effect.</P>

The Minister for Industry and Commerce said it had never been less needed than it is at present.  Anyhow, we are all agreed that it is needed, and I hope we are all agreed on this, too&mdash;I am very glad to find Deputy Hugo Flinn has been emphasising it a good deal in more speeches than one&mdash;that there are large tracts of country in Ireland where, from time immemorial, poverty has been intolerable and almost inconceivable.  I come from such a part myself, one of the very poorest parts of Ireland, and it has always struck me that the people of more favoured parts of the country have shown much greater ignorance and much more lack of imagination than one would have expected about the condition of their fellow countrymen living in these poorer districts and certainly the Government have my very warmest good wishes in so far as they devote themselves to unremitting war on the sort of poverty to which I refer.</P>

      <P>I am glad that this £150,000 Vote has been introduced, for there is undoubtedly a large amount of unemployment still existing in the country.  Taking the argument put up a few minutes ago by Deputy Dillon, I would urge against this money being <Col N="252" /> spent on roads as he mentioned, because it is placing a premium on local authorities refusing to put up sufficient money for the proper maintenance of roads.  I was rather amused at the old story he brought out about preferential treatment being given to particular individuals on account of politics.  I have found it working the other way round, and so far as the Parliamentary Secretary is concerned, it is enough for him to know that a man is a member of the Fianna Fáil organisation for him to kick him out the door without any work at all.  That has been my experience at any rate.  What I have found operating in districts in which these relief works are being carried out is that the men are drawn from the Labour Exchanges, which are manned absolutely by ex-officers of the National Army and British Army who differ completely in politics from the present Government, and surely those people are going to show fair play to their own.  I know that in the town of Midleton, in the town of Cobh, and in the town of Youghal, the Labour Exchanges are manned by ex-members of the National Army&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If he has not, I would invite him to come down to Cork and have a look, and he will see the <Col N="253" /> manner in which a local authority in Cork County is working to ensure that no Fianna Fáil supporter gets any employment whatever and has even gone so far as to wipe out the one thing that was always the pride of Cork County local authorities&mdash;competitive examination. Competitive examination for rate collectors and everybody else has now gone by the board in Cork County, and when Deputy Dillon gets up to tell us about what the old woman told the other old woman, as the Parliamentary Secretary so very aptly described it, I would invite him to come down to Cork and see the full machine in operation.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon need only look at the position and read the statements made here last night and to-day by Deputy Kent to realise the situation and to have it brought home forcibly to him what the actual situation is.  Deputy O'Leary last night told how one man left his employment in order to draw unemployment assistance.  Deputy Kent made a complaint here to-day that certain individuals will not work because they will get unemployment assistance. Unemployment assistance would usually work out at some 12/- to 14/- a week at the outside.  I have known labourers working for 5/- and 6/- in my district for Blueshirt farmers who have cut them five times since the economic war started; and when we hear the statement here of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, in connection with that particular matter, as to men <Col N="254" /> being offered work, we wonder at what wage.  Is there any limit to the wage at which a man can be offered work? If, for instance, a man is unemployed&mdash; suppose it is a local Blueshirt&mdash;and I want fairly good satisfaction out of him and I tell him: &ldquo;I will give you three bob a week, and you can work for me,&rdquo; is he then deprived of unemployment assistance, because I am offering him employment?  I know local farmers in my district whose wage at present is 4/6 per week.</P>

      <P>I know what colour his shirt would be if I had my way.  There is one other matter I would like to impress on the Parliamentary Secretary. It is the condition of affairs in the town of Cobh.  I am sorry to say that it contains at present practically the largest population of unemployed relative to population of any town in the Free State.  Circumstances, unfortunately, have brought that about.  I would also point out to him that the economic position in the town of Cobh is so bad that recently the ground-rent landlords gave a reduction of 40 per cent. in the ground-rents, which is very definite proof of what the actual situation is there.  I would tell the Parliamentary Secretary also that he should make some fairly adequate provision for substantial relief for that town for this winter.  The same condition, practically, exists in the town of Midleton.  Those two places in particular are very badly hit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as the rural areas of the constituency are concerned&mdash;and I was rather amused at Deputy MacDermot's statement here about unemployment on the land&mdash;anybody taking up the <Col N="255" /> local papers down in Cork in the last few weeks will see any amount of advertisements there at the present time for ploughmen, inserted by the type of farmer who never ploughed before.  They are looking for ploughmen now.  The land is getting reddened up.  I admit that, owing to the very complicated and antiquated machine that was handed over in the Land Commission, the division of the ranches in that particular area is not being speeded up; but we hope to oil the cogs of it in the next few weeks and to get a move on.  I could show both Deputy MacDermot and Deputy Dillon cases down in that particular area where four so-called farmers hold between them 1,800 acres of land and give employment to five men on the 1,800 acres.  I admit that they employed some men cutting trees recently, which may help to employ more of them, and that through their activities they gave employment to the Ministry of Posts and Telegraphs which I hope will give some relief in putting up the telegraph wires and posts that were knocked down.  All these things will help, but I hope within the next few months to get down a few inspectors from the Land Commission into those ranches and see that they are split up and some employment given so that the sons of small farmers in this country will get some of the land they fought for and be enabled to earn a livelihood out of it.  And I will guarantee that these men will work the land and pay the annuities out of it.</P>
    <P>I regret that the antiquated machinery of the Land Commission is preventing the abolition of the unemployment problem in that district.  I do not wish to infringe further on the time of the House.  I think I have dealt with all I wish to deal with, except one matter, and that was the matter raised by Deputy Norton.  I think that the Government should definitely interfere in that.  I think that where it is proved that an individual who has got a loan by guarantee from the Government starts paying 18/11 a week, as Deputy Norton stated, to labourers engaged in construction <Col N="256" /> work, the Government should immediately step in and withdraw the guarantee from that individual.  The Minister has stated that they are only isolated cases, but, unfortunately, they are isolated cases that leave a very bad impression on the whole.  We have had industries started in Cork recently and I was more than pleased to see the wages paid in those particular industries.  I have been in there frequently&mdash;once in a fortnight or three weeks&mdash;and have visited these factories, and when I am there I make it a special point to inquire what the workers are getting.  I have seen young girls there&mdash;and with regard to juvenile labour, a large proportion of the work which has to be done in some of those factories is skilled work and, naturally, it is far easier to train a young person in work of that description than a person of from 25 to 30.  I admit that, on that account, there is a fairly large amount of juvenile labour employed.  By juvenile labour, I mean anything from 16 years of age upwards. But I can say this much: that I have seen the girls who have been in that factory for a year and a half and the lowest wages they are earning are from 35/- to £2 16s. 0d. per week.  These are not bad wages.  It reflects great credit on those who started the factory and started it after being refused a Government loan.</P>

      <P>The case made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce is one that I would like to see analysed and tackled in order to see what substance there really is in the claim made by the Minister that employment is not only on a sufficient increase in this country, but that, in addition to effecting a reduction of the figures representing the unemployment figures of 1931, according to the case made by the Minister, the increase in population has been absorbed into employment.  It was news to me to hear that, and I should like to have challenged and tackled the Minister on it, but that is hardly my job at the present time in the altered circumstances. I hope, however, to see it tackled and properly analysed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has given figures from the stamp revenue of Unemployment Insurance and National Health Insurance. I take it that he did not come in here to quote official figures from the Stamp Revenue Department&mdash;his own Department&mdash;without being sure of his figures and quoting them accurately or substantially accurately. Having done so, that case made by him should be tackled directly and refuted, and I hope to see it so tackled.  I do not want to go into the wider aspects of employment and unemployment on this Vote.  We have in office a Government that claimed, out of office and in office, to accept responsibility for providing employment for the workers of this country or full maintenance.  The workers of this country who are unemployed cannot get work.  The Government is not providing them with full maintenance. I wonder if the Government are going to admit that they have failed, after two and a half years, to carry out that essential plank of their social and economic policy.  If they do come forward now with a grant for the relief of unemployment how far will that grant go to bridge the gap between the unemployment assistance provided <Col N="258" /> by the Government and full maintenance? That is a matter of first rate importance to the ratepayers and the local authorities, particularly the county councils.</P>
    <P>I listened yesterday to a debate between the members on the Opposition Benches and the Government Benches on the condition of the farmers and to the boast that was made, punctuated with applause from the Government Benches, that they are able to put rebellious farmers in jail and that they consider that a victory.  We have now a depleted Government Front Bench with no Minister in the House; but there were many Minister here yesterday to announce triumphantly to the House that&mdash;to quote a Dublin humorist&mdash;&ldquo;The felons of our land are in hand.&rdquo;  I look upon this £150,000 as a little retribution or conscience money on the part of the Government to relieve the unemployment that their policy has created in rural Ireland&mdash;to relieve the agricultural ratepayer by reducing the amount paid in home assistance, which has reached such alarming proportions.  It is a little conscience money given back to these people for the £2,000,000 a year plundered from them by the Government. If we have not a Minister present, we have the very enterprising Parliamentary Secretary in charge of the Board of Works.  He knows that he receives from local authorities over £600,000 a year for local loans which he keeps. He does not transmit that money to its former destination.  I am not finding fault with him for that; I am not saying whether he is right or wrong.  I will say that he has got a mandate from the electors to hold it.  He has also got a mandate from the electors to give the citizens protection.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is his trouble, I will try and do it.  I was on the point that the Parliamentary Secretary's Department collects £600,000 a year from local authorities and private individuals which heretofore was paid to the British Government.  I am not saying whether it should or should not be paid; but it is paid to the appropriate Government Department here.  The British Government, which heretofore got the money, are not satisfied that it is not still transmitted, and the British Government have collected that £600,000 from the agricultural ratepayers of this country.  I wonder the Parliamentary Secretary did not get a bigger jab of conscience and hand at least that £600,000 over to agriculture through the county councils to help the unemployment that exists.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept your ruling, though I do not know whether to appreciate the compliment about ingenuity. However, we will pass away from it. I should like to know if the Government are going to honour their bond to provide full maintenance; if this £150,000 completes that contract and provides for the unemployed in rural Ireland full maintenance or full employment. I do not think it does.  I suggest that it would be far more in keeping with the popularly elected Government to provide full maintenance from central funds that have been so augmented in the manner I have described but which I dare not describe again owing to the Ceann Comhairle's ruling.  They should provide sufficient to give whole-time employment to the <Col N="260" /> unemployed in each county area or provide them with full maintenance.</P>
      <P>I am sorry the Minister for Industry and Commerce is not here, because we in County Dublin find a very much increased number of unemployed there. This is contrary to the case made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce. Before the Minister is a requisition to give us the figures in the County Dublin, so as to help the unemployed in the county to get a Christmas dinner.  We in the County Council will go 50-50 with the Minister.  The Minister stated that in October of this year there were 11,000 more employed in the building trade than in October of last year.  I accept those figures for the building trade.  I accept the statement that the building trade is more flourishing than it was last year, and that more people are employed in it.  Feeling that way, we must accept the Minister's figures, and we are glad of it.  But that effort is not due to any spending of money or any administrative achievement on the part of the Government.  It is an administrative achievement by the local authorities; and outstanding amongst them is the Dublin Corporation. The operation of the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act in Dublin City and County is not only responsible for that activity, but it is responsible for practically the entire building trade of Dublin City and County.  I would like if possible to get some indication as to what way the Government intends to spend this money, or whether they would be inclined to help generously local authorities who are prepared to co-operate in this matter themselves, For instance, if a local authority is prepared to put up £3,000 or £5,000, that shows their interest, and it shows the determination of that local authority to help to relieve unemployment. I would suggest to the Government that such local authority should be met by them in the same spirit, so as to help unemployment, especially around Christmas, as our local authority is taking up the matter.  I would like an expression of opinion on that from the Government Benches.</P>

      <P>We have the same hardy annuals again this year.  A considerable sum of money is being passed in the House for the relief of the unemployed in this country.  Undoubtedly the solution of the unemployment question is a serious problem for this, or any other, Government.  I must admit that there is a great number of unemployed in the towns and cities of the Saorstát who are unemployed through no fault of their own.  I know that a lot of deserving cases have been helped under the Unemployment Assistance Act, but to my own knowledge there are cases in the rural areas where men are drawing unemployment assistance who could be very usefully employed at agricultural work.  I heard a remark passed here this morning: &ldquo;What is the wage which a farmer would give to an agricultural labourer?&rdquo; I must say that under the agricultural policy of the Minister for Agriculture farmers have considerably improved their position this year, and they are paying wages far greater than what the unemployed would get through the Unemployment Assistance officers.  But the position is that you <Col N="262" /> have a certain class of men in the country, and it is not wages that would satisfy those workshys.  It is a question of idleness, the drawing of unemployment benefit, and having the easiest time they possibly can.</P>
      <P>Coming to this Estimate, I would like to put up a few concrete proposals to the Parliamentary Secretary.  I hope when this money will have been spent in the relief of unemployment in the country that we will find it has been spent in reproductive works.  I would like to see a considerable part of this money spent on re-afforestation, a thing that would add greatly to the health of the people in the country and that would, at the same time, beautiful the country.  In addition, it would be the means of bringing tourists into the country.  Planting the country with trees and shrubs would add greatly to its scenic beauty.  A lot of money has been spent on useless works for which there has been no return while we badly need waterwork schemes throughout the country&mdash;</P>

I can give the Parliamentary Secretary several instances where schools are in a very insanitary condition.  I think if money were expended on remedying that state of affairs it would be well spent from the point of view of the health of the children.  When it comes to employing the unemployed I hope the genuine unemployed will get work in preference to workshys whom we find here and there in the rural areas.  Deputy Corry stated that farmers had disemployed workmen because they belonged to a political organisation.  I do not know of any such case in my part of the county; I know of no case where a labourer was disemployed because he belonged to a political organisation.</P>

As regards the reference to <Col N="264" /> agricultural wages of 3/6 or 5/- a week, I may say there is no such wage paid in any part of the constituency to an agricultural labourer.  In fact, he gets twice the amount in wages and diet as he would draw under the Unemployment Assistance Act.  I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to give us an indication of how he intends to spend the £150,000.  I hope it will be spent in reproductive work which will be an asset to the State in years to come.</P>

He quoted from it the promises which he said were made by Fianna Fáil to the electors at the last General Election, on the strength of which we came back as a Government, and on the strength of which we are here now.  This afternoon Deputy Belton made a remarkable suggestion. He actually invited the Parliamentary Secretary, or anybody else on these benches, to admit failure as regards the Government's attitude towards unemployment and the finding of work for people who had no work before we came into office.  We are not going to admit failure on the question of housing, of industrial development; we are not going to admit failure on the question of peat development.  I invited the Deputy on the first big occasion, when peat development commenced in the Bog of Allen, to come down to see it.  There is no politics in these things.  We will admit no failure in the matter of afforestation; we admit no failure in connection with the <Col N="265" /> drainage of land; we admit no failure in the matter of land division or in relation to the beet industry.  We admit no failure as regards finding work for unemployed people, as regards providing factories, let them be big or small; as regards the provision of rubber factories, boot factories and all the incidentals. The only support we ever got from the Opposition, and the only support we are ever likely to get, is to be taunted across the floor of this House that we sabotaged the greatest industry that was in the country, the agricultural industry, and that that was the cause of all the unemployment and poverty.  The only thing we ever sabotaged was one export and that was the export of the money of this country to the tune of £5,000,000 a year going to England.  We have kept that at home to carry through the economic and industrial programme in which we are engaged.</P>

      <P>We were taunted, as Deputy McGilligan knows, that we sabotaged the agricultural industry. The only thing we have sabotaged was the exportation of money.  That has ceased and the money is now being used for schemes such as was introduced here this afternoon.  Last night Deputy Anthony made a speech which was, to some extent, interesting and, from another aspect, amusing.  He said the economic war was the cause of the unemployment and poverty. Here is one of the answers this afternoon&mdash;the introduction of this relief grant.  I agree with Deputy Belton; I would like to see the amount twice as big.  The amount is £150,000, and I will be as much concerned as Deputy Belton as to how that cash is going to be distributed.  I am not one of those who said that there is no poverty.  I <Col N="266" /> am not going to say it to-night.  I am aware that in Leix-Offaly there has been poverty and, in order to do something for the people there and to relieve their poverty, I would like to see a substantial amount of this grant going to Leix-Offaly.  What is the alternative of the Opposition to the introduction of this relief grant?</P>

      <P>This grant is made for the provision of work.  A moment ago the Deputy asked if a local authority earmarked, say, £3,000, would the Government cover that with another £3,000, and the Parliamentary Secretary replied that that was one of the strongest points that would be considered in the allocation of relief grants.  This money is for the provision of work.  The Deputy mentioned something about the provision of food for the people so as to give them at least their Christmas dinner.  I am glad to see the mentality changing, and I am glad to see that the question of food is being considered.  Let us realise that there are many people who have no land, that there are many people who have no resources and who are obliged to live in the towns. When there is talk about these people getting food, Deputy Belton should remember that there are people paying as much rent for two rooms in a slum district in Dublin and, possibly, in Cork, as would pay the rent of a very substantial farm in some of the rural districts of Ireland.</P>

      <P>I was struck also by certain remarks of Deputy MacDermot. I do admire the spirit he displayed when he congratulated the Government in coming along with these schemes.  I think he intends to give whole-heated support and help in the allocation of this money, and he is prepared to help the Parliamentary Secretary in the carrying out of his work.  That is the spirit in which I should like to see this matter <Col N="267" /> approached.  Unemployment will never be remedied in the Free State unless we have the co-operation of every Party in the House.  One of the things we did say when in opposition, and when criticism was being hurled at us, was: &ldquo;We do not care who does good for the country provided good be done.&rdquo;  Is not that the main thing that matters?  It is easy to come into this House and score a debating point. It is easy to score off a Parliamentary Secretary or a Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is easy to come into this House, cull figures from the statistics issued by the Department of Industry and Commerce, and say that unemployment has gone up.  Certainly, the registered list of unemployed has gone up.  Shortly after he left office, Deputy McGilligan pointed to the returns of unemployed for one town&mdash; Ballina, I think&mdash;and explained that the registered number of unemployed in that town exceeded the entire population. There was a change of Government, and people had come in from the big hinterland and registered wholesale, because they saw a ray of hope. This explained the huge figures coming from the labour exchanges.  The Parliamentary Secretary dealt with this matter last night.  The increase in the number of registrations is due to the fact that people who did not bother before are registering now, because they see that there is a chance of getting employment.  There was no chance previously.  Under all these schemes we have set out to establish employment will increase and, as the cash comes in, the Government will spend, I trust, not £150,000 but double that amount.  I hope the money will be spent freely.  As regards wages, there is not a solitary individual in our Party whether on the front bench or on the back bench who stands for anything else than the trade union rate of wages.</P>

      <P>There is no question about it.  I will put it to a Party vote <Col N="268" /> to-morrow morning.  We have never voted for or advocated low wages.  The main thing we promised the people was to cure unemployment and to cure poverty.  In the economic programme we tried to put into operation, we sought to bring about a blend of agriculture with industry, so that the two could go ahead and put money into circulation.  In the distribution of this money, I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will give attention to the places where it is most needed.  I agree with Deputy Kent to that extent. I hope that counties which contain districts like Luggacurran, a mountainous district inhabited by people who were evicted from their farms, will receive special attention.  There is considerable poverty along the southern portion of Laoighis and, in the allocation of this money for the making of roads or the construction of public works, very sympathetic consideration should be given to that area.  I have been among the people of that district and I know the conditions.  I know that poverty is so rampant that men who work in the fields during the day have not a change of clothes at night, and that they sleep in their working clothes by the fireside.  Our programme has been a programme to provide work for the people.  I am glad to see Deputy McGilligan in the House, and I hope he will take the opportunity of saying that we do not stand for the possibility of people dying from starvation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is helpful to have had from the different sides of the House admissions both to-night and last night that the unemployment problem is very serious.  I am not for the moment concerned with one set of figures or another set of figures. Apart from the figures supplied by the Parliamentary Secretary and the figures quoted by Deputy Anthony, a lot of factors have to be taken into consideration.  I was interested in the good description of one problem contained in the statement of the Parliamentary Secretary&mdash;the problem of chronic poverty.  That is a very serious problem the discussion of which would take a great deal of time. To-night, I prefer to confine my remarks to the problem represented by the 80,000 or 90,000 people who would normally be in employment and who are not&mdash;to that section of the population referred to in portion of the Parliamentary Secretary's statement. I heard only portion of the speech made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  If the Minister is anything, he is an optimist.  His optimism is of a very cheery kind sometimes but it does not always fit in with the facts.  The Minister's statement this evening went very wide of the facts in many respects.  The Minister seemed to think that in only one or two isolated cases were bad wages&mdash;I use the term deliberately&mdash; and bad working conditions a feature of the new industries.  The Minister will find on examination that his estimate was altogether too conservative. I have been told that in industries in Cork which were boosted to a considerable extent girls are employed at 5/- per week.  The fathers of some of these girls are unemployed at present.  I know that in Cork City&mdash;I cannot speak with knowledge of Dublin because I do not know the conditions&mdash;the practice obtains of taking on juveniles for a <Col N="270" /> year or two and, when they grow up, sending them away and employing other juveniles.  I heard recently from a very responsible clergyman in Cork City who is, certainly, not unfriendly to the Government, that this practice was constituting one of the greatest evils arising out of the new industrial position in that city.  I ask the Minister to examine this whole matter with a good deal more diligence than he appears to have done up to the present.</P>
      <P>During the last two years, there has been a great shortage of Irish slate, and slate quarries have been opened in various places.  The working conditions and wages in a great many slate quarries are extremely bad. The working conditions in some of the quarries are, to my own knowledge, dangerous and the wages are very low. Again, the practice of introducing boy labour at nominal wages has grown up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to draw an unduly pessimistic picture of what is occurring, but I think enough has happened to strengthen our demand to the Government that they should give directions in certain industries, and that they ought to see that industries that were started with the aid of the conditions imposed by the Government are worked under fair conditions.  In a short time when things have been in full working order, and when there has been an opportunity of examining the whole position, I think the Minister will find that the trade unions will not require his Department to do their work.  But the working class people are entitled to this: that if substantial concessions are given to any industry by the State, as has happened in a number of industries in this country&mdash;and many of these industries are very creditable and the Government deserves a great deal of congratulation in connection with the policy that resulted in the origination of them&mdash;the working conditions in these places should be such as would be approved by the Government.  I do not think that should be challenged.  I do not think it was Deputy Norton's intention to convey that the responsibility <Col N="271" /> of the trade unions should be handed over to the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  That is not desirable, and the trade unions would not wish it.</P>
    <P>I did not hear the whole of the speech made by Deputy Kent, but I heard enough of it to know that many of his statements were not accurate.  I know agricultural areas where labourers get three shillings per week.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillianRKent" hpid="Mr. Kent Mr. Kent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kent</NameTxt>
      <P>In what areas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>In West Cork, and I can verify the cases.  Deputy Kent says that that is not correct, but I reply that it is quite correct.  I know of cases where people were applying for unemployment assistance because they were getting no wages at all and were only getting food and shelter for the work they did.  Deputy Kent talked about agricultural labourers who would not accept the wages that the farmers were prepared to pay them.  I know there is no condition of labour worse than the condition of agricultural labourers in some parts of the country. So bad is their condition that not alone have they been prepared to work for no wages, but they allowed themselves to be coerced into going out at night to commit acts of destruction on behalf of people that would not keep them in their employment unless they did these things.  That statement admits of no contradiction.  It was admitted in open court when counsel appealed for clemency for some agricultural labourers who had been sent out to do these things, and who did them rather than lose their jobs.  That is a state of things which may well become intolerable.  The House should revise any opinion it may have formed with reference to the agricultural industry and labourers getting good wages but refusing to take employment and preferring to go in for home assistance, as was stated by Deputy Kent.  I think Deputy Kent would realise that if he had all the facts in his possession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to draw the Parliamentary Secretary's attention to one regulation that might easily constitute a very great hardship in connection with the <Col N="272" /> execution of unemployed relief schemes. I understand an order was issued to county surveyors engaged in the execution of minor relief schemes this year to the effect that preference must be given to people in receipt of unemployment assistance.  If that is carried out strictly there are thousands of people whose cases are subject to appeal, on the means test in connection with their application, that would be debarred from employment.  I do not think that that could be the intention of the Department.  So long as their cases are pending they ought to be entitled to the same benefit as their more fortunate neighbours, who had been in receipt of unemployment assistance.  I submit that specific instructions as clearly as possible in that respect ought to be issued in order to see that no hardship from a position of that kind takes place.</P>
    <P>My complaint about this whole position is that while it is indisputable that we are going through an economic revolution, we do not seem to have equipped ourselves in the way we ought to with the means of fighting it or the great dislocation that that economic revolution has caused.  We talk of fighting an economic war.  The consequences of any economic revolution mean a complete change of our whole national economy, and not merely such as would be necessary to meet the change involved in a dislocation arising out of a momentary difficulty. I do not think that we have set ourselves to the task of meeting the difficulties arising out of a situation of that kind in the way we ought to do. I think in a situation of this kind we must resolve to frame different regulations from those surrounding or governing schemes of unemployment in normal situations.  This is not a normal situation and, therefore, the ordinary inter-departmental regulations in regard to schemes of that kind should be completely shelved for the time being.  I heard from the Parliamentary Secretary the statement that he would be glad to get schemes that would afford a greater labour content.  I do not want to think of some scheme for obtaining work, or of <Col N="273" /> the making of new rules and so on, that in their nature would have only temporary effect.  It occurred to me that the whole method of private employment on public works in the country ought to be reviewed.  A great deal of the money spent on public employment in this country at the present time is given to contractors. I do not think that the Parliamentary Secretary, if aware of the facts, would agree that there is a fair labour content in public works at the present time, when there is a very substantial profit for one or two individuals. Speaking of certain kinds of work, I find that in order to make sure that the profit is a good one, there is a tendency to limit the amount of labour that could be absorbed on that particular work.  I suggest, first of all, that the Parliamentary Secretary, who is, I presume, responsible for schemes of employment generally, would consider a few of the matters I have noted down for his consideration. I suggest the Department of Local Government should be asked to consider issuing instructions to all county councils in the State asking that all roads under their control should be worked by direct labour.  That would provide additional employment of a permanent nature.  Hundreds of miles of roads in some counties are worked by contract at the present time.  That affords employment for one family. If that work were determined more equitably, as under a direct labour scheme, the position would be improved considerably.</P>
    <P>It may be answered that the county councils have full power to do things of this kind if they so desire, but the county councils may not so desire in some cases and there may be very obvious reasons from their point of view why they would not so desire. There are some county councils at the present time&mdash;some of them are not very far away from where some of us live&mdash;that are not very keen on promoting employment.  Rather is it their general policy to bring to a standstill the collection of the revenues by which employment could be maintained so that they may be enabled to say <Col N="274" />&ldquo;I told you so; that is where your policy has brought us.&rdquo;  I think that the Government should take up a strong attitude on this question and insist on the employment of direct labour by notifying the county councils that, in the event of their refusal to obey the instructions of the Department, the grants for the maintenance of the roads out of the road funds will not be payable.  I make that suggestion for their consideration.</P>
    <P>I would suggest also that the Department of Public Works which is responsible for the erection of many public buildings&mdash;schools, barracks and preparatory colleges&mdash;there is a work of that kind going on at present in Ballyvourney in North Cork about which I shall have something to say later&mdash; might also initiate this direct labour policy and get all works of this kind carried out under the control of a competent clerk of works or an engineer and see that the maximum amount of labour is provided and that the working conditions are fair and reasonable. I am reminded of this proposal by the erection of the preparatory college at Ballyvourney which is going on at present.  I understand that that building is to cost £70,000 but the contractor thought that he was going to get the work carried out at a very small rate of wages.  The result was that in spite of the fair wages clause which the Office of Public Works has enshrined in the contract, there was no intention to honour that fair wages clause.  The trade union in the district had to compel the withdrawal of labour on that particular job and the suspension of the work for five weeks, when the matter was adjusted by the payment of the rate of wages recognised and demanded by the trade union in the district.  That suspension of work could not occur if the suggestion I make were carried out.</P>
    <P>I do suggest that a good deal of extra employment could be afforded in this way and a good deal of the money that is just private property at the present time in the matter of building work, would be made available for the provision of additional employment and additional wages in the homes and pockets of a good many of the workers. <Col N="275" /> I suggest that the Department of Local Government should also instruct boards of health that all schemes of housing in the country, the erection of labourers' cottages and work of that kind, should also be carried out by direct labour, and that there should be a fair estimate provided.  The engineer or a few clerks of works in the different areas would see that the work was carried out with a consequent increase in employment. The same could apply to housing schemes in the urban areas.  There is no reason whatever why the Government could not have a word with the Hospitals' Committee people in connection with the large schemes of improvement in the hospitals that are projected at the present time and intimate to them that the giving of grants for the improvement of hospitals, county homes and other such institutions, which the Hospitals' Committee intend to help, should be conditional on the work being carried out by direct labour in order that the maximum amount of labour could be absorbed on the work.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear Deputy Donnelly say that the Government would make no admission of failure in the matter of forestry but I should like to see more done in that connection.  I know that a good deal of data has been collected and that schemes are under consideration but I should like if the projected schemes of forestry were speeded up very considerably.  On the question of land that is declared to be unsuitable for the timber that the Forestry Department would think best, I would suggest as an alternative that such land might be suitable for another less valuable type of timber and that the Department should consider, if certain lands are unsuitable for the growing of valuable timber, whether they might not be quite suitable for another class of timber that would not be so valuable but that would be an asset to the country also.  I think it would be very advantageous if a big push in that direction could be made as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="276" /> It occurs to me also that in a number of small towns in the country there are people who have money to put into little industries if they could see a favourable opportunity.  I know some such cases myself.  I think that the difficulty is the selection of suitable industries for such little towns.  Small towns in rural districts, a very considerable distance away from a port, are at a disadvantage in a matter of that kind, and I think the Department of Industry and Commerce could help in that direction. I would suggest that the Parliamentary Secretary should take it up with his colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and indicate his view as to the value of a general survey of the small towns in the country and that something could be done in this connection in pursuance of the policy of decentralising industry.  I know of a few places where substantial sums of money could be got for the purpose if suitable schemes could be put up.  I am afraid that a great many people have not the industrial knowledge that would enable them to select suitable industries.  I know some small towns where employment of a permanent or semi-permanent character could be provided for 30 or 40 people by industries of this nature.  I think that that should be well worth considering. I wish I could make a more helpful suggestion in that direction, but I must confess that my knowledge in that connection is much more limited than I should like it to be.</P>
    <P>I feel also that in breaking new ground and in trying to provide new employment, the Parliamentary Secretary will have to cut across the policy of the local authorities in many respects. It is, of course, one of the principles under which unemployment schemes are carried out by the Department of Public Works that they do not interfere with the roads maintained by the county councils or the normal activities of local authorities in that direction, but I feel that they will have to get away from that position, in view of the fact that no ordinary methods will give the best results in fighting the difficulty.  A great many of our small little villages, notably at the seaside, <Col N="277" /> are very neglected at the present time. One can see at every turn small seaside places that have got no attention&mdash;very beautiful places, but there is great need for improvement, the making of pathways, small little marine conveniences, etc.  People would visit these centres in large numbers if they had proper facilities.  Furthermore, there was some provision of this kind made by local authorities in the past, but lately I know that in our own county of Cork schemes put up for new works each year were totally rejected by the county council, and the possibility of improvements in these and other directions was impeded and obstructed by the rejection of proposals for new works.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary will have to take a hand as a result of his own knowledge of the position, and, if necessary, cut across the regulations that preclude the Office of Public Works from interfering with the activities of the county councils in matters of this kind.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton suggested that one of the most advantageous ways to relieve unemployment in the country at the present time would be to reduce the working hours.  I have another suggestion to make, and I think it is one that is worthy of consideration.  In this connection, complaint arises from the fact that juveniles are at work.  In a great many cases it is clear that instead of being at work they ought, in the ordinary way, if it were possible at all, to be at school.  I think that in this we might be helped if attention were paid to the demand so often made by the national teachers of the country, that the school-going age should be raised two years.  For the wages they receive it is hardly worth while having boys employed between the age of 14 and 16. For their own benefit later in life, as well as for the relief of unemployment by affording an opportunity for the absorption of adult labour in industry, I think it would be much better if both boys and girls had to remain at school until they had reached the age of 16. In fact, I think it would be good for the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>In the course of the discussion on this Vote I was reminded of the fact <Col N="278" /> that local authorities, if they so desired might be encouraged to contribute to the relief of this problem. Where a local authority showed a desire to help I think that the Department of Local Government should be in a position to make loans available for them for the initiation of public works.  I remember reading in the newspapers some time ago that a county council in some part of the Midlands made application for a loan or a grant for the purpose of initiating schemes to relieve unemployment. The application was refused.  I think that the Department of Local Government should be encouraged to make advances out of, say, the Road Fund to local authorities which showed a desire to promote such schemes. Despite what has been said by Deputy Kent in a misguided moment I am satisfied that the bulk of our people are anxious for work.  As a test of a view that I hold, I would like to see the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Parliamentary Secretary give some consideration to this suggestion as an experiment to be tried in country districts: that they should take a number of people who are on unemployment assistance and amalgamate their assistance with a grant into a standard wage, and prepare schemes of public works that would absorb 200 or 300 such people.  I think if that were tried it would be found to have very good results.  In the present situation in the country there would be no difficulty in finding suitable and useful schemes.  For instance, traffic on the roads has changed very considerably in recent years.  It is a fact that in many parts of the country at the present time the grass margins on either side, taken together, are much wider than the road itself.  I do not see why a lot of useful work could not be done in the way of widening and levelling the roads.  Work of that kind would not only help to make the roads safer for traffic, but would, I suggest, add considerably to their appearance.</P>
    <P>I feel that the suggestions I have made, if carried out, would help considerably to relieve the unemployment problem.  I do not see any big <Col N="279" /> difficulty in the way.  I offer them to the Parliamentary Secretary as an evidence of my desire to help.  We are going through an economic revolution that has brought about very considerable changes.  Ordinary methods are not sufficient to deal with the difficulties that arise where you have a situation of that kind.  I emphasise what has been so often said from these benches, that this whole question of unemployment has got to be tackled in a big way.  Schemes of national reconstruction should be thought out and devised for that purpose because, as I have said, ordinary methods will not suffice.  In time the position will right itself, but at the moment it presents very considerable difficulties, and I suggest that some big effort must be made to meet it.</P>

      <P>Deputy Donnelly has thrown himself into the arena as the man who wanted to be convinced as to whether there was unemployment in this country now to any greater extent than ever before, or whether there was employment to a greater extent than ever before.  He also, I think, wanted some satisfaction by way of an affirmative answer from me, that all his individual political promises had been carried out.  I suggest he said that by way of countering anything I might say, as appearing to score over the Parliamentary Secretary or Ministers in this House.  I do not know whether they approve of that statement.  The Deputy also made play with, and talked of, debating society points.  I want to talk seriously on this subject. He can correct me when he thinks I am making debating society points which have no substance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to ask: Is it possible to get this unemployment matter considered accurately and precisely when the people who are in charge of the figures cannot for the same period give us the same figure twice?  I do not mind different explanations.  When people put up one argument and it is knocked down it is only human nature that they should run off to another, but, at any rate, it should be possible to have from the statistics branch and from the <Col N="280" /> Department of Industry and Commerce, which is in charge of that branch, precise figures for past years. I want precise figures for past years in relation to unemployment.  Let me take one or two arguments first.  I understand that the Parliamentary Secretary, in his attempt to explain the enormous increase in the unemployment register figures&mdash;an enormous increase which disturbs everybody, including Deputy Donnelly's Party&mdash; said that there were several things to be adverted to.  One was&mdash;and this was in the forefront of his statement &mdash;that when registration was requested in the old days people had to walk 15 and 20 miles to register.  I do not know if there is, within the rules of parliamentary debate, language strong enough to describe that statement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnDonnelly" hpid="Mr. Donnelly Mr. Donnelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnelly</NameTxt>
      <P>What about Ballina?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me take this point: that in my time people had to walk 15 and 20 miles to register.  I say they had not.  Here is what they had to do, and I offer the information to the Deputy who, apparently, has not got it.  Any man who lived as far away as 15 or 20 miles from an employment exchange in my time had only to do this in order to register.  He had to get a piece of paper and a pen.  He had to put his name on that piece of paper, and if he was not able to do it himself to get somebody to do it for him.  He had to describe himself.  He had then to walk to the nearest post box&mdash;if he met the rural postman he could hand the letter to him&mdash;and without any expense to himself, without even the cost of a stamp, it was conveyed to headquarters.  In face of that, the Parliamentary Secretary, who is supposed to know the conditions, said last night that a man, in order to register in the old days, had to walk 15 or 20 miles.  The thing is flatly wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnDonnelly" hpid="Mr. Donnelly Mr. Donnelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not accept that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Possibly not.  That means that the Deputy is contradicting my statement.  If it is true it is not a debating society point.  The <Col N="281" /> explanation of the big drive now is that people can register in places where they were not previously authorised to register, but had to walk 15 or 20 miles to do so.  I say that they had not to do that.  In order to register in the old days all a man had to do was to send an unstamped letter, as I have described, through the post, and that was conveyed to headquarters.  He need not even go to the nearest post box to post it because, if he met the rural postman, he could hand the letter to him and it was sent on.  That is the first thing.  The Parliamentary Secretary again said last night in his attempt to describe the difference between the old maximum of 30,000 that used to register and the present maximum of nearly 120,000&mdash;some 500 short of 120,000 on November 5th&mdash; that there was a second reason, after giving that first wrong reason, and that was that in the old days the purpose of the exchanges was to provide willing labour for commercial employers.  I do not know that anybody, even the Parliamentary Secretary with his past, is so far removed from conditions in this country as to believe that statement.  Relief Votes of this type that we are discussing became a feature of life in the Free State since its establishment.  Apart from the fact that people were taken from the labour exchanges for vacancies that occurred anywhere, under relief schemes or anything else, it was well-known that when there was relief going Deputies in this House made an appeal&mdash;I even saw those appeals being made in writing, and members of the Labour Party agreed that they did make them in writing&mdash; to their constituents, who were poor, to register for the sake of getting whatever relief money was going.  Yet we are calmly told that the old purpose of the exchanges was merely to provide for commercial employers labour which was of value to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a third thing I want to ask in connection with those figures.  Supposing even that those two statements of the Parliamentary Secretary were absolutely true, which in fact they <Col N="282" /> were not, there is at any rate a lot of 120,000 people at the moment.  We were told that there were new people registering and that those new people twice reacted to a fresh stimulus.  The funny thing is that there has been no improvement made even in those fresh registrations.  I would not mind the statement being made that at one time people used to register for particular purposes; that a new set of purposes came along, and that new people came in, but what about the improvement that we are told has been taking place in the country?  Why has it not made some impression on those figures? Supposing the 30,000 should have been 80,000, why has it gone up to 120,000 while we have had relief schemes, quotas, subsidies and Government helps in every possible way?  There is another point which has to be referred to, and it is not a debating point in this matter.  Take this amazing increase in the numbers registered.  Supposing you find that coincident with that there has been a change in the economics of the country, and that you are, <i>prima facie</i> at any rate, entitled to say that that change and the increase in unemployment have some relation one to the other; have you not something more than a <i>prima facie</i> case&mdash;almost a concluded case&mdash; when you find that the change in the economic life of the country has brought about a lower productivity, to an extent, as far as the farmers are concerned, of at least £20,000,000?  At any rate, we are getting somewhere near the point when we can get figures which we can argue about, and not fantastic explanations about walking ten or 15 miles.  Supposing it is a fact that there has been a change.  It is also a fact that the figures have risen. Is there any relation between the two? If the farming community has lost money as far as their production is concerned, is there not immediately a relation between the decrease in production, the downward trend in the economic life of the country, and the increased unemployment figures?</P>
    <P>Deputy Donnelly was very anxious about the old threadbare document so often quoted here about promises.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="283" /> The document bears some relation to the promises, if it is threadbare and worn.  Let us allow for enthusiasm in promising.  Let us allow for the fact that it was necessary to put some sugar on the pill of the Republic.  Let us allow for all those things.  Still there were promises.  Was it those things the Deputy talked about to-night? Was it beet, afforestation, drainage and land division?  I thought the Deputy would have shuddered when he said land division.  We will get precise figures one of these days for land acquired and distributed.  I should like to see the figures.  What about the figure of 86,000 people that were to be employed?  It was not in housing, afforestation, land division or beet.  It was to have been in factories. It was to have been on work of a permanent type; not merely work of a permanent type, but work from which, once you got the wheels of industry started to the extent that you employed 86,000, the outflow was going to be enormous.  It was for the 86,000 employed to think of the huge wages fund and of its purchasing power.  I might even become lyrical and enthusiastic enough to prove as my own the document which referred to more and more money, and why did it ever stop? There were to be 86,000 in industrial occupation of a permanent type, and, of course, with the growth of industry there were going to be other subsidiary industries.  Here is the order in which they come&mdash;factories were thrown in&mdash; housing, beet, afforestation, drainage, land division, and factories.  We have queried those factories over and over again.  We want to know about them. We know that the Deputy and the Ministers believe that there is an enormous number of new industries started in the country, and that there is big employment in them.  We know that Deputy Norton believes that it is only the demoralisation of children is taking place in the country.  I do not think Deputy Norton is any nearer the truth than the Minister who talks about the number of factories.</P>
    <P>We should at any rate be able to get from the Minister in charge of the <Col N="284" /> figures a statement as to how many people, say, in the years 1929, 1930, 1931, 1932 and 1933 paid money into the Unemployment Insurance Fund.  What did we get?  The Minister for Industry and Commerce made a bad mistake one night, and has been trying to get out of it ever since.  On the 4th October he took a jump in the dark.  Here was the basis of calculation that he took, and, of course, if the figures can be got correctly it is a very good basis; he took the test of the income from the sale of unemployment insurance stamps.  Let us leave out unemployment. Let us concentrate only on employment. It is quite true that every person in insurable occupation, who is a week in employment of that nature, has to have a stamp put upon a card for him.  That represents 1/7.  It used to be 1/1, but more recently it was 1/7.  Therefore, if you can get the fund income, and if you can see the change in that income, you have some indication as to the number of people extra or less employed as between the different years.</P>
    <P>With that as the correct basis of calculation, here is what results.  The income from the sale of insurance stamps in 1928 was £655,000, in 1930, £703,000.  If the old rates of contribution had continued, the income in 1933 would be £760,000, an increase of £60,000 which represented 15,000 men getting employment for 50 weeks.  The calculation is easy.  At the rate of 1/7 for 50 weeks the contribution would be £4.  Divide by four whatever the increase in pounds is and you get the number of men.  The amount in 1930 was £703,000, in 1933, £760,000.  The Minister takes credit for an increase of £60,000, and for 15,000 men.  Of course he had nothing to do with the difference between 1930 and 1931.  I asked for and got these figures.  Here is where I complain and I think properly and rightly complain.  Surely there must be some reliability about figures or we will begin to believe there is none, when this sort of nonsense can be carried on.  I asked a question before 1933 was complete, so that is had to be an estimate and the Minister agreed that what was given in a group <Col N="285" /> of years for the first nine months did represent accurately and for each year the percentage of the final total.  The figures for 1930 were £703,000; for 1931, £744,000&mdash;that is my year&mdash;for 1932, £767,000 and for 1933, £773,000.  That is an estimate and an adjustment.  It showed no possibility of error.</P>
    <P>In my last year, my decaying year, in which nothing was done for industry and no work provided the fund went up by £40,000 representing 11,000 new people in insurable occupations in the country, between 1930 and 1931.  In two years, on that calculation, the Minister had got an increase of less than £30,000, or less than 7,500 people.  He made two bad mistakes there.  He claimed for a year that was not his, and when found out on that, that what he had done bore such a bad relationship to my last year, something had to be done, and something was speedily done.  The next time the matter was debated&mdash;and it was only a few months later&mdash;the figure for 1933 was found to have risen to £785,000.  Still we had this, that in 1931, my last year, it was £744,000 I was given credit for £41,000.  In one year the amount was raised from £744,000 to £785,000.  That was not bad.  The Minister equalled in two years what I did in one.  It was not too bad.  To-day of course we have to do better.  We have done better.  I got figures given to me by the Minister showing that in 1931 the exact income was £497,000. These are exact figures, no longer adjusted, and in 1933 they were £553,000.  That is £56,000 of a difference. Where was the mistake?  Why was I told the difference was only £40,000?  I was told about March, 1934 when the figures for the whole year were in.  There was no question of an estimate, I was told the difference between the two years was £40,000 and now I get figures which show £56,000. The position is even better than those figures show, for this reason, that when £40,000 was the difference, you had to divide to get that adjusted with 1/7. When four is divided into 40,000 it only gave 10,000 new entrants into new industries in two years, whereas I put 11,000 into industry in one year.  Now, <Col N="286" /> when we divide the figure which is based on the 1/1 rate, for 50 weeks it comes to about £2 16s. 0d.  It will be found that it represents £56,000 or 18,000 men.  That is something to boast about in the Fianna Fáil Ard Fheis. It was a good figure to get at this time.  Why was the other figure given? What reliance can be put on the figures of men in control of a Department if such serious errors are made? Is it a debating point to say that one is entitled to look with the gravest suspicion on figures produced for these relief schemes.  How can we ever get anywhere in relation to this problem if the statistics can be so mishandled as that?  Where is the truth?  Where are the new entrants to industry?  If they are new entrants are they in the sort of industries that Deputy Donnelly speaks of?</P>
    <P>Supposing there are 10,000 or 18,000 entrants in two years, are they in industries of the type promised in the old election promises, or are the people engaged in peat, afforestation, drainage, beet or housing.  What are they in?  It is surely serious enough to ask this question quite properly.  In the old promises of employment, the industries were named and the totals given, even down to the tens of the people to be employed.  There was no question as far as the 86,000 was concerned about peat, afforestation, drainage or land division.  Does Deputy Donnelly think, in face of these figures, that they can claim that the promises about industrial activity have been carried out?  I think it was recognised that relief schemes were only a temporary device.  Speeches were delivered by those who were in charge of afforestation&mdash;which has come under many Ministers&mdash;and Senator Connolly told us that it was a method of absorbing the unemployed.  He did not talk of it in relation to permanent occupancy.  There is another side to be considered, as I was told when defending the unemployment figures. Of course I emigrated a certain number every year.  There were no emigrations in my last year.  I was told that the average number of people who looked <Col N="287" /> forward to the day when they could leave the country was 30,000.  Supposing there are 30,000 who used to, but who cannot leave now, is there not a very serious situation developing? Because the best that this exaggerated figure can show is&mdash;let us make the 18,500 into 20,000&mdash;that 10,000 new people have gone into some sort of occupation&mdash;housing, drainage, peat or factories.  That is 10,000 per year for two years.  The Government complain that we left them a heritage of unemployed. I do not know what the number which they have fixed to that finally is, but, whatever it was, it is still there, because there are 30,000 being added every year, according to the Government's arguments&mdash;that is those who used to leave the country&mdash;and there ought to be, if even the old figure is to be kept steady, employment found for a new 30,000 each year, instead of which we have this exaggerated figure of close on 10,000 in each of two years. If the 30,000 are being bred in this country and have no outlet to America, or elsewhere, as they used to have, and the people who are looking for employment are going to remain in the country in numbers which increase at the rate of 30,000 per annum, and if, after two years of a hectic performance of tariffs and subsidies and quotas and closing down of imports and prohibitions and credits and loans, we can only get 18,500 at best into some sort of work, when are we ever going to provide for the 30,000, who, according to that statement, come on our hands? Are we not piling up an enormous surplus?  Is it any wonder, if these statements are correct, that the unemployed registered figure has risen to 120,000, and where is the prospect of eating into it?</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce got perturbed towards the end of last month about the situation, or, at least, about the figures and about what he called the misconceptions there were as to the unemployment situation in the country, and he issued a statement.  He issued that <Col N="288" /> statement, remember, after he had received a report from a special committee of experts from the statistical branch, the employment branch and the trade branch of his Department, &ldquo;which has had the whole employment and unemployment position under detailed examination.&rdquo;  Now, get the atmosphere.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce, who is going to establish an industrial community here, gets perturbed about the figures and he tells us, as I think the Parliamentary Secretary said last night, and as Deputy Donnelly more or less hinted at to-day: &ldquo;You need not bother about these unemployment figures; they do not matter.  The higher they go, really the less unemployment there is.  It is the employment side we have to look at,&rdquo; but the best the Minister for Industry and Commerce&mdash;not the Minister for relief schemes, and not the Minister for temporary occupation, but the Minister for Industry and Commerce&mdash;after receiving the experts' reports, can do is to tell us that there is substantially increased employment in this country. Deputy Donnelly to-night claims housing, peat, afforestation, drainage, land division and beet.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>You might as well; they will not matter in either case. But what does the Minister for Industry and Commerce talk of?  House construction and relief schemes.  He throws this into the forefront: &ldquo;The evidence of substantially increased employment is, of course,&rdquo;&mdash;no figures given&mdash;&ldquo;fully supported by evidence from other sources&mdash;the Census of Production returns of employment in tariffed industries and, notably, by the following&rdquo;&mdash;so he reverses Deputy Donnelly's method of procedure and says that we have tariffed industries, but, remember the big thing, and then we come to it&mdash;&ldquo;house building and relief schemes.&rdquo;  That is what is claimed by a Minister for Industry and Commerce <Col N="289" /> who promised 86,000 people permanent occupancy of industrial employment in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnDonnelly" hpid="Mr. Donnelly Mr. Donnelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnelly</NameTxt>
      <P>We promised them the houses, too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Maybe, but they were both promised, and it is no return to say that while we promised 86,000 people in industrial activity in the country, all we have now got to say in our defence is that we have given notable engagement in house building and we have £150,000 for relief schemes from time to time.  Is that a debating point?  I think that what the Government promised was not a continuance of subsidies and reliefs, although subsidies and reliefs were going to be used partly to get over a bad period and to help industries to get on their feet, but surely the aim, and surely apart from these fantastic election promises, what every Fianna Fáil Deputy in his heart believed to be possible was the development of manufacturing industries and not reclamation, drainage, afforestation and these things which are aids and temporary aids only? What was promised was industrial development and the best we can get, if we take the best exaggeration of the Minister's own figures, is somewhere about 18,000 people put into employment, and Deputy Donnelly claims that that is due, in part, to factories.  The things he stressed, however, were housing, beet, afforestation, drainage, land division and peat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is, at any rate, the situation.  I am stressing these figures because I want the accurate figures.  Once we get the accurate figures we have ground to stand on, and we can argue why they are at such a point; whether there is a seasonal peak; what the figures mean; and how they are going to be reduced. I want to get questions asked immediately about this land division on which Deputy Donnelly laid so much stress as being one of the points at which employment is given.  We can take off this figure of 18,000 something for land division and something for beet and peat.  We want to get from that to industry, and then we will get at Deputy Norton's side of it.  Even if we have so many in industry, are they <Col N="290" /> adults or children?  Is there a wages fund being created?  Is there more purchasing power going through the community, and is it permanent or likely to be?  Surely it is only when these figures can be answered&mdash;I think, all of them, affirmatively&mdash;that the Fianna Fáil Party can claim that their promises have been carried out.</P>
    <P>I notice that the President recently went to Limerick and confessed that he knew then more about employment and unemployment than he had ever known before.  This is in the region of debating points, if Deputy Donnelly likes, but these things were said, and said to excite and dope an audience.  The President said we had a permanent cure for unemployment here staring us in the face which no other country had. He said that at a time when he was aggravated by an advertisement we produced which set out that Hindenburg and Hoover had failed to solve the unemployment problem but that he claimed he could, and, being aggravated, he said that he could, and also said that comparisons with Germany and America were futile because&mdash;and I am quoting his own words&mdash;&ldquo;we have a permanent cure for unemployment staring us in the face that none of those other countries have.&rdquo;  I am here definitely in the region of debating points.  He said that the country can support 17,000,000 of population.  Thank goodness, he did not put any time for getting those 17,000,000, but 17,000,000 population is the aim, and his Minister for Industry and Commerce, who gives us these outrageously magnified and outrageously varied figures, said that if we went about providing, as we should do for our own people, for the manufacture at home of clothing, boots and shoes and housing materials&mdash;I think those were the three things he referred to&mdash;there would not be enough idle hands in the country to do all the work and that we should have to send away to the countries to which they had emigrated and get back some of our people who had gone.  Those are debating points, if you like, but they were debating points used with great effect to the mob.  That is what got the votes.  It was not any nonsense about Republics; this was the stuff&mdash;the <Col N="291" /> 86,000 people placed out according to industrial groups, the 17,000,000 population that we are aiming at, the permanent cure for unemployment that no other nation had.  Men said that soberly, or, at least, men who are reputed sober said that, and that we would have to send abroad to bring back men to occupy themselves at home because there would be so much work that we would not have enough idle hands to do all the work.</P>
    <P>We have, at any rate, got some sense of reality at least.  The President says, as he did say in Limerick, that there had to be, even if this country was industrially developed, a fringe of unemployment, and then they were going to be occupied for some time until the fringe was shorn from us in these relief schemes and afforestation and so on.  I could deal with this Vote. Deputy Donnelly has asked to-night&mdash; and I am glad that somebody did put it&mdash;for co-operation.  He said that they want co-operation, and rather sheered off by saying&mdash;I think the hint was thrown&mdash;that the co-operation they wanted was the sort of co-operation that they as a Party gave when in opposition.  I remember a Vote of £250,000 being introduced about this time of the year in 1929.  What was the method of dealing with it then? The present President said that this idea of giving three weeks' occupation about the Christmas time to starving men was trifling with the subject.  The present Minister for Finance did not want to go so high as that.  He cut down the three weeks' occupation to a fortnight.  It represented about a fortnight's work about the Christmas time, according to him.  The present Minister for Justice&mdash;probably coached in the meantime by the mathematical President&mdash;divided that amount by the number of constituencies and said that it represented so much per constituency. As to the present Minister for Industry and Commerce, his variation of it was that he took the figure of those in the live register and trebled it, which, he said, was his estimation of what was the correct number we <Col N="292" /> should be registering, and he divided that into the sum that was to be given and said: &ldquo;Here it is&mdash;a few pounds into the hands of every man on the live register.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I will make that calculation now&mdash; 25/- and the 125,000 on the register looking for work for themselves and unable to get it.  Of course, I know that that is a fantastical way of dealing with it, but it is the way that Deputy Donnelly and the members of his Party dealt with it when they were in opposition.  We had an idea of the extent of the problem of the unemployed in these days and of the scanty resources we had to deal with it.  It is a good thing that the present Government are learning that, too, and it would be a bad thing, in view of the extent of the problem, to criticise these relief schemes too severely. Surely, however, it is possible for somebody, who is not considering the points he is going to make in the debate or who is not remembering the mistakes he made previously and trying to cover them up, to sit down and find out and tell us what was the increase in the unemployment insurance fund arising from the sale of stamps in the years, year by year, from 1929 to last year.  Then we would have some test of the extra money going into that fund, and we would be able to divide that money into what I call proper industrial activity and these other things.</P>

      <P>Yes, 1929, 1930, 1931, 1932 and 1933.  I suppose it is a credit to the Minister that they have not proved each time to his favour, but there ought to be something to show besides the mere manipulation of figures.  There is one other side to it. I notice that Deputy Donnelly is taking notes and I hope that the Deputy is not taking notes with a view to getting these figures cooked.  There is one other thing, as I say I tried to get it for various years and I got it for one comparative period&mdash;when you are speaking of the money that goes into the fund, that is one thing.  That gives you the number of people going into insurable occupations&mdash;it may be intermittently. <Col N="293" /> But supposing they are going in very intermittently, indeed. That will be shown by another side of the account.  What is the draw on the fund?  This is a matter about which Deputy Donnelly might enquire and get the figures accurately for us.  At least, if we are not going to get them accurately Deputy Donnelly might be able to see that they will be cooked accurately. In the first year in which the Deputy's Party became a Government, the draw on the fund&mdash;that is, those who had been in insurable occupation and left it&mdash;increased by over £100,000.  That has got to be taken into account when discussing this matter, because you may have a fictitious increase&mdash;a certain number of people going in and more people going out irregularly than ever before.  In the end, I think that the Minister ought to get away from this test of the sale of unemployment insurance stamps and get a proper test, and that is what is the surplus income of the fund year by year since 1929.  In my time&mdash;1929 and 1930&mdash;the surplus was so big that I found I was clearing off a debt that had accumulated mainly in the British days.  I was writing it off at a certain sum per annum, but I considered that that was not a good idea in the condition in which industry then was.  Accordingly, I said that we would fund it and pay it out over a period of ten years.  That enabled me to reduce the contributions from 1/7 to 1/1.  Now, the State gained a little by that, but, in the main, industry gained in, I think, equal proportions as between employer and employed person, £250,000 per annum.  That was a fairly healthy condition to have got that fund to, because of increased industrial activity and because of decreasing draws upon the fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This year we went back to the 1/7. I had reduced it to 1/1, thereby saving that much to the employers of industry and the employed, but this year the present Government have gone back to the 1/7 rate.  They take again the £250,000 from those employers who were keeping people in occupation and from those employees in occupation and hand it over to the Unemployment <Col N="294" /> Assistance Fund.  That, surely, does not show any tendency towards a bettering of the industrial economic conditions in the country.</P>
    <P>I hope that Deputy Donnelly will agree that those are not debating points.  I suggest that they are matters to which a serious-minded man like Deputy Donnelly might apply himself, and about which he could excogitate and get the accurate figures for us.  Then we can refine upon them and argue about them.  We can see where they have dropped and in what periods of the year they have improved and so on.  Can anyone believe in the seriousness of the Minister for Industry and Commerce when he presents us on three separate occasions with three distinct sets of figures? Can anyone believe in the seriousness of the Parliamentary Secretary's arguments, when presenting his case, when his main argument as to the increase in the numbers depends on the thing to which I have previously referred&mdash;that in the old days a man had to walk 10 or 15 miles to register &mdash;which is a complete mis-statement&mdash; and that more recently he had greater facilities for registering?</P>
    <P>I do not think that this will end with this debate, but, possibly, it will mean that when we next come to debate on unemployment we will know clearly what were the figures on which improvement was calculated, say, in 1934.  If we are now in the dark as to the figures, there is no reason to argue from this that we cannot get the figures for a single year.  How can the people believe in any of the Government's figures if they cannot give us a single figure for that one year?  I think that it is a statutory obligation to give the figure.  It should not be capable of change.  Let us get the truth about it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesPatrickKelly" hpid="Mr. J.P. Kelly Mr. J.P. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.P. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy McGilligan did not seem perturbed about the question of unemployment; but he was perturbed evidently that there were no figures available to prove how many unemployed were registered during his term as Minister for Industry and Commerce.  If the figures were not available, the crowds that were to be <Col N="295" /> met with in the country districts were evidence enough to prove that unemployment was much greater during his term of office than at present. Although people might be asked to sign a paper and put it into the nearest post office during Deputy McGilligan's period of office; although that practice continued for a long time, that registering of their names in the local exchanges through the medium of the post office did not bring any employment in its train.  People now realise that when they register they have a chance of getting employment; that they stand a fair chance with every other person registered. The relief schemes are not now confined to ex-members of any army. They are for the benefit of the people who need them most.  When preference was given to ex-members of the Army starvation in other homes meant nothing to these people who now seek for figures with which to taunt the members of the Government, if they can get them.  They do not care how these figures are made up or what inducements are held out to the people to register.  They want them for the purpose of debating; for the purpose of arguing, as Deputy McGilligan tells us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although we ask for these relief schemes we know that when land division is speeded up we will not have the same amount of unemployment in rural areas.  We have the statement of the Minister for Lands that he expects that 100,000 acres will be divided before 31st March next.  We have at present a start being made in the County Meath and 90 men who were unemployed this time 12 months are now in employment there making roads and building houses.  Although land division has not been speeded up as much as we would like to see it, we realise the difficulties and the delay consequent on waiting for the Land Bill and the Land Bond Bill to be put through.  Now, when a start is being made and when the Minister expects 100,000 acres to be divided before March, I think we may safely conclude that something is being done in <Col N="296" /> a Department where nothing was being done for a number of years past.</P>
    <P>It would appear to me that Deputy McGilligan was more concerned with convincing himself that no unemployment existed when he was in office than with suggesting a scheme for the Parliamentary Secretary that would be likely to solve unemployment.  The electors, however, will be the best judges as to whether we are keeping our promises or not.  The result of the last county council elections is ample proof that the electors believe we are carrying out our promises, if members of the Opposition need any further proof of that.  We know that our industries have not been established to the full extent of which they are capable.  We know that we will have still further expansion.  We know that there are mills which had been idle during the régime of the last Government now being opened, and further ones being inquired for.  We know all these things, and we believe that the development of the home market is the permanent cure for unemployment.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan and his Party would, of course, believe, as the <i>Evening Mail</i> of this evening states, that the economic war has ruined the farmers.  That paper states that they have not a shilling's worth of credit now, &ldquo;because land, once a valuable asset, has become a liability that nobody wants.&rdquo;  I wonder does Deputy McGilligan subscribe to that view&mdash;that nobody wants land?  If nobody wants land, why is it that there are so many appeals lodged with the Land Commission against the acquisition of land?  If nobody wants it, why do not the supporters of the Opposition hand it over to the supporters of Fianna Fáil, who are willing to take it and to till it and to give the people themselves and their families and the people in the neighbourhood a decent living out of it?  We want a straightforward tackling of this problem; we do not merely want figures.  We in the country, who are in close touch with the people, going into their homes and knowing their difficulties, realise that a great deal has been done by this Government.  We know that the <Col N="297" /> people are satisfied that a great deal more will be done by the Government in the effort to provide work for the people.</P>
    <P>We, in Meath, are asking for a relief grant now, because of the chronic state of unemployment we found there; unemployment that we are tackling, unemployment that we are reducing. If I wanted to make a debating point, and to paint a very black picture of County Meath, I would only have to refer to the leading article in the <i>Evening Mail</i>, where it says that the wolf is at every man's door in the County Meath; that wage-earners of every class and grade are now worse off as a result of the economic war, and that sort of thing.  In asking for a portion of the relief grant for County Meath, I do not feel that I am at liberty to paint the conditions in County Meath as black as all that. The wolf is not at every man's door. We have the Unemployment Assistance Act.  Although the giving of unemployment assistance is good in itself, it is not sufficient to meet all the needs of the working man's family.  We need relief schemes until we are able to place these people in permanent employment. We know that we have schemes almost ready, and I expect that by this time 12 months, when the relief grant comes up for discussion again, we will not be applying for as much money as we are at present.</P>
    <P>The County Council of Meath has requested a loan, probably to be supplemented by a relief grant, for the doing of permanent work; for the taking down of corners on our main and county roads; for the improvement of county roads, and the making of horse tracks along the main roads where the surfaces are so slippery that the carting of agricultural produce is a problem in itself.</P>
    <P>We are asking for that grant so that we may be able to give employment to a number of people who are unemployed at the present time.  The system that was in operation in the greater part of the County Meath was a system of raising bullocks for the English market.  As a result of that <Col N="298" /> system we in Meath know the conditions of poverty that existed there.  I can safely state here to-day that the poverty that existed in Meath during those ten years was on a par with the worst poverty in any county in Ireland. Any Deputy who wishes to come down there can see the conditions under which some of the people were living. If they examined the condition of their houses, for instance, they would realise the terrible conditions to which the people had been reduced.  Even though we are looking for a relief grant I am glad to say to-day that the conditions have been improved, and I say that even though men were cast upon the roadside and turned out of their employment during the past year because of their political faith. Despite this we are in a position to state to-day that the conditions have been improved, and with the opening up of industries and the division of land we are satisfied that in the very near future these relief schemes will not be required.</P>
    <P>In asking that the Parliamentary Secretary would give some of the relief to Meath, I would like to remind him that the mussel fishing industry in Mornington needs relief badly at the present moment.  Owing to circumstances that have been stated here on many occasions, the mussel fishing industry in Mornington is not providing employment.  The erection of the mussel cleansing tank has not been pushed forward as it should.  I would now ask the Parliamentary Secretary to keep in mind the great need for giving a grant from this Vote to the fishermen in Mornington.  I would say that any fishing grants received there have given a great deal of necessary employment.  I hope that in the very near future such grants will not be required.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>In connection with this grant I would like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary one question, and that is, whether a very large portion of the sum of £250,000 is already earmarked for works in operation or works contemplated.  My experience in calling to the Office of Public Works <Col N="299" /> in connection with certain minor schemes is that most of the money given by way of these grants had been already spent.  I ask that question because I would like to make sure, before going to the trouble of preparing any schemes, that the money was not already spent.</P>
      <P>The next question I would like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary is this: What procedure does he intend to adopt in the preparation of these schemes?  It was a well-known fact that last year the schemes which had been put into operation in the county I represent found their initiative, in nine cases out of ten, in one or two people who were supporters of the Government.  I presume the same applies to every county in the Free State.  I do not say this by way of criticism, but I would like a change in regard to that matter on the present occasion.  I would like to suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that he should consult with the county surveyor who, by virtue of the position he holds as well as the experience he has had in the different counties, is a man who is in a position to advise the Parliamentary Secretary as to the nature of the works, the largest amount of employment that can be given, and also in regard to that very important factor&mdash;the giving of a return from the moneys expended.  There is another point that I would like to press upon the Parliamentary Secretary, and that is in regard to those people who will secure employment as a result of the passing of these relief schemes. Am I to understand that a person must be in receipt of unemployment assistance in order to get a job on those works?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>What I would like to bring to the notice of the Parliamentary Secretary is this:- I have very great experience since The Unemployment Assistance Act was passed and put into operation that a very large number of people who have made claims for benefit under the Act did not have their claims adjudicated upon although these claims had been placed with the various labour exchanges since the passing of the Act.  This has been already referred to by Deputy Murphy and I would like to impress upon the Parliamentary Secretary that these people should have the same opportunity of getting work on these relief schemes as those who are actually in receipt of unemployment assistance. The reason for the delay in their case is through ignorance in regard to the various sections of the Act.  For instance many of those unfortunate people when asked when did they work, stated that they were idle for three or four years when as a matter of fact they had been working weeks on and off through all that time.  In consequence of that their claims have not been finally adjudicated upon and they have been left without this benefit.  I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to take that factor into consideration in connection with this question of unemployment.  We are all aware that this question of unemployment comes up each year and we are also aware that most of the Deputies&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Get round to their own constituencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;never face up to the situation; while they speak in general terms of the poverty prevailing throughout the length and breadth of the land, in every case at the end they generally want to get the relief for their own constituency.  I do not propose to adopt that policy.  Neither do I propose unduly to criticise the Government for their failure in dealing with this important problem.  What I do criticise very severely is the fact that very few Deputies have paid any <Col N="301" /> attention whatsoever as to the causes of unemployment.  In other words, they have not faced up to the situation. All the Deputies speak here on this question of unemployment and I regret to say that one particular idea is very noticeable amongst the back benchers of Fianna Fáil.  When speaking on this question of unemployment they all speak as if this country were one great empire full of riches.  Consequently, in order to gain political advantage over their opponents, they do not hesitate to make very rash promises at the cross-roads, thus giving their political opponents an opportunity of criticising them severely for not having fulfilled their promises.</P>
      <P>I was never prone to criticise this Government or the late Government in regard to their failure to solve unemployment, for the simple reason that, unlike the members of Fianna Fáil and the members of the Labour Party, I never believed that a Government could solve the question of unemployment. Neither do I subscribe to the doctrine that it is the duty of a Government to solve unemployment, for the simple reason that I know its solution is an impossibility, and I am very slow to ask people to do the impossible.  At the same time, I think I am entitled to criticise this Government for not dealing more successfully with the unemployment question, because the dead walls in the various cities and towns, as a result of the use of the whitewash brush, gave us the slogan at the last election: &ldquo;Vote Fianna Fáil and end unemployment.&rdquo;  It was not a question of solving it at all, but of ending it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This evening Deputy Kelly, who represents a County Meath constituency, told us how employment is going to increase in that county as a result of the division of land contemplated by the present Government.  Yet it was only last week he spoke about the farmers there and about their dereliction of duty in not giving work to the labourers.  Deputy Kelly, accompanied by Deputy O'Reilly, headed a deputation to the Minister for Agriculture to procure more licences in order that the fat bullocks might be exported to the British market which, to use the words <Col N="302" /> of the President, has gone for ever. Unfortunately for themselves, Fianna Fáil Deputies speak with two voices, one for the Dáil and one for the cross-roads. During the last two or three years they have told the people that, if elected, they could solve the unemployment question, that it was a question of a decent living&mdash;good wages.</P>
    <P>The present Government is the only Government that has stipulated that before a relief scheme would be put into operation it should be arranged that the rate of wages should not exceed 24/- a week.  I, as a member of the Louth County Council, have been asked to subscribe to that doctrine through the medium of a memorandum sent out by the Parliamentary Secretary.  It was a question of &ldquo;Will you come in to my parlour said the spider to the fly.&rdquo;  I object absolutely to any Government fixing rates of wages for the workers. I would object equally strongly if the Government fixed wages at £10 per week, not to mind 24/- a week.  That should be left to the individuals themselves, and I do not think it is right that the Government should make it a condition preparatory to giving the money for relief schemes that the members of any public board should subscribe to the doctrine that 24/- is sufficient to maintain a man and his family. I do not think that is right or fair, yet that is the policy that is being pursued vigorously by the Parliamentary Secretary in connection with various relief schemes throughout the Free State.</P>
    <P>As regards unemployment, I would like to help whatever Government is in power, if it were possible for me to do so, if there were a little more honesty in dealing with the matter, if men were prepared to say what economic pressure will compel the whole of us to say in the near future, to speak the truth in regard to this question.  Instead of making it a Party question, it might be well if all came together and admitted freely that we are endeavouring to do the impossible, namely, to maintain almost a war-time standard of living on a pre-war earning.  The sooner they admit that the sooner will we be on the road at least to a partial solution <Col N="303" /> of this very vexed question.  I know this is about the worst place where one could debate a matter of this nature, but I hope the time is not far distant when men will be got who will tell the truth and tell the people that certain things which have been promised cannot be realised, when one considers the resources of the country.  I would like to ask in connection with this vote, which will be welcomed by the people of the various areas in which the work will be started, that above all there should be no discrimination as regards who will receive employment.</P>
    <P>Unfortunate references have been made to Blueshirts.  It is about time, and I am speaking now candidly and honestly, that Deputy Corry and other Fianna Fáil T. D.'s should drop that gutter language altogether and recognise the fact that there are just as good men in the Blueshirts as there are in any other section of the community. It is about time those cheap jibes should stop in this Assembly and Deputies should face the situation fairly and squarely.  It might not be safe for some Deputies to use the same expressions outside that they have used here.  So far as I am personally concerned, I hope the day will never come when I shall raise my voice or use any influence I have to keep a political opponent out of employment.  I only wish I could be the means of getting employment for every workless man in the country irrespective of politics.  I hope and trust everything in connection with the working of these schemes will be done above board and, in conclusion, let me say that I would be prepared to give the Parliamentary Secretary and the officials of the Board of Works who are entrusted with the carrying out of these schemes, all the help I possibly can give them.</P>
    <P>Two things I should like to emphasise&mdash;that we should be given an opportunity of knowing beforehand the procedure to be adopted in regard to the starting of any schemes in the various counties, whether it is to be left to the people to whom it was left <Col N="304" /> last year or whether the Parliamentary Secretary is going to consult the county surveyors.  Secondly, I should like that all people who are unemployed should have an equal chance, and that there should be no differentiation, whether a man is in receipt of unemployment assistance or not.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not anxious to delay this vote and I shall, therefore, confine myself to a single point.  I should like to ascertain from the Parliamentary Secretary whether, in connection with these relief schemes, the subject of mining has been considered and, if so, to what extent.  The Parliamentary Secretary has, again and again, expressed himself&mdash;and rightly so&mdash;as being eager to get productive schemes.  In that connection, it is obvious that mining, which is a very small industry in this country at present, should offer scope, for, at least, investigation.  It is admitted, I suppose, that, owing to the world price of the common minerals, the working of most of the Irish mines would not be remunerative if carried out as an ordinary commercial transaction.  It might, however, be otherwise if the experiment were considered as a relief scheme or if mining were regarded as a protected industry, same as other industries.  I am constantly being asked, for instance, why it is that now, when there is a very rigid system of protection in operation, there should be no mining whatever in Avoca when, under free trade, there was, I am assured, never a year in which there was not a considerable amount of mining done.  That continued up to 1928.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>What was mined?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Ochre, sulphur and copper.  Copper was mined as late as 1928 by a British company.  I think that the sulphur mines had something to do with the winning of the Great War for the British.  The Arklow Explosives Factory depended, I understand, very largely on the sulphur produced in Avoca, while the fertiliser manufacturers were obliged to depend upon it.  I am constantly being asked <Col N="305" /> why it is, when that condition of affairs obtained under a free trade system, now that there is a Government in power which stands for protection and is not prepared to accept the principle of supply and demand as the last word on any question, there is absolutely no mineral activity in that area.  Mining would seem to offer an obvious opening for work designed to relieve unemployment, because one would think that the labour content should be very high and that there would be genuine results from the point of view of production.  In that area&mdash;I do not want to make the debate parochial, but it is the area with which I am most familiar&mdash;there are men whom nobody could accuse of lack of desire to work.  It is said that there are 100 men, more or less, unemployed there at present.  All these men have worked at mining at some time.  They are as keen as men could be on that class of work.  So keen are they that, although they are drawing unemployment assistance, they devote themselves every week to the cleaning up of old mines and to digging for new minerals.  Their one desire is to work at an industry of that kind.  I should be much surprised to learn that the Parliamentary Secretary has not explored the possibilities in that direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some small efforts have been made. A grant of £500 was given last year, but I do not think it was followed up or that there was ever any real intention to ascertain what the results would be.  I doubt if the material produce&mdash;I understand it was sulphur &mdash;was ever sent to a fertiliser-manufacturer. In any case, £500 worth of effort would not furnish any appreciable test.  To my mind, this would seem to be one of the things most deserving of consideration in connection with the relief of unemployment.  If it were found to be in any way economic, it would be very easy to transport men from other areas and, instead of giving them work which is, admittedly, not urgent work and, certainly, unproductive work, afford them an opportunity to produce <Col N="306" /> results and increase the national income.  If that be the position, these mines should be worked by the State. The attitude of the Department of Industry and Commerce in regard to mines and quarries seems to be to wait until private capital is forthcoming. With so many countries ready to dump their mineral products in any market in which they can get an opening, it does not seem likely that private capital will develop an interest in our mineral wealth.  We all admit that our mineral resources are not sufficiently rich to encourage the investment of private capital to any extent, especially under the present conditions.  Matters may have been different when there was less dumping and when other countries were less inclined to subsidise their exports than they are to-day.  Under present circumstances and considering that there is at least an implicit admission that there is great difficulty in getting anything like suitable enterprises on which to extend relief moneys, I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that, if he has not done so yet, he should explore very fully the possibilities of mining.  I ask him further to send somebody to that area, which is relatively the richest mining area in the country, to ascertain from the people there their experience of mining and what they think the possibilities are. Further, the person so sent to investigate should report as to the ability and willingness of the available labour.  If the Parliamentary Secretary does that, the report which will reach him will be one which, I think, should encourage him to proceed with mineral development.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>As there is money about to be distributed, I think I should make a little demand for my constituency.  At present, there is an organisation in existence called the Cumann Cosanta na Gaedhilge.  I believe that they have been in touch with the Minister for Lands with regard to getting a bounty on feeding stuffs going into an area in my constituency. The Minister was down <Col N="307" /> there recently and he said it was a difficult problem and that a committee should be appointed to put up a scheme.  That is throwing a big responsibility on what I might call unfortunate people in the country who have not the assistance of civil servants, as the Government have.  I believe there is some talk of putting up a mill.  I do not think there is any necessity for putting up a mill. I do not see why a portion of the grant should not be used for giving these people a bounty on the feeding stuffs they have to buy.  At present, they are being driven out of existence because they cannot afford to buy feeding stuffs.  They are in a part of the country where they could not grow feeding stuffs.  It is not fair to my mind to subsidise people who live upon rich land and can grow feeding stuffs.  I suggest the Parliamentary Secretary should enter into a contract with a big mill in Cork to supply people in these congested areas.  In that way, by subsidising the mill, people could get the feeding stuffs at reduced rates and would be enabled to produce bacon before the winter is out.  There is no great encouragement to people to produce barley, oats and wheat for feeding cattle.  They will not be encouraged to produce beef and they cannot get good prices otherwise. I am putting these suggestions to the Parliamentary Secretary and I think they are worthy of consideration.</P>
      <P>I understood the Parliamentary Secretary to say that preference will be given to people seeking employment, in receipt of unemployment assistance.  I do not think that is fair.  It is quite understandable that people in receipt of unemployment assistance are most needy people.  I heard the case of a man who got no relief and who was refused employment, although he had three sons at home idle.</P>

      <P>That is not my job; that is the Parliamentary Secretary's own job.  He has people here in charge of these matters.  I know what I am talking about.  When our Party were in power I always made it a point to tell gangers to give employment to the people most in need of it.  I believe that the Government, by their policy, are responsible for the bulk of the unemployment that exists in this country to-day.  I remember the time when Deputy Norton, criticising the Cumann na nGaedheal Party when they were in power and their attitude towards the 86,000 unemployed at that time, said that the Fianna Fáil Party when they came into power would solve that problem, and if they did not they would not remain 24 hours in office.  The fact, of course, is that the unemployment position is far worse to-day than it was on that occasion.  Deputy Murphy made reference to statements made by Deputy Kent with regard to the wages paid to farm hands, and said that in West Cork farm hands were paid only 3/- or 4/- per week.  I think that that condition of things demands inquiry.  I believe there must be something wrong in such circumstances.  Either the farmers are doing the work of the labourers, or, else the farmers are not in a position to enable them to pay their labourers.  The agricultural industry is, of course, the most important industry in this country. Deputy Kelly talks about the bullock and that we ought to divide more land. I have seen some land divided and I find that the bulk of it to-day has been let out for grazing.  Many of the people who got land could not grow potatoes enough to feed themselves.  In dividing the land men should be selected as tenants who are fit to work it.  There is no use giving land to people who have no experience of farming.  I met people in Dublin who never stood on a farm and yet they could teach me my business.  If I ever belonged to a Party again that gets back into power I would take these people out of their offices, put them on the land, and compel them to live on it, and then, <Col N="309" /> perhaps, they would be in a position to criticise the farmers.</P>

      <P>Deputy Corry and myself agree.  I do not want to be rid of the Party opposite too soon.  I have always said that it is only right that they should get a full trial.  I believe myself the people are getting a bit of experience of them, and before the winter is over they will have more experience.  I am very keen upon this question of the land.  Deputy Kelly, as I pointed out already, talked about the bullock, but I say if you destroy the cattle trade in this country you destroy the whole agricultural interest of this country.  I challenge any Deputy on the Government Benches opposite to get up and say otherwise.</P>
      <P>I would like to find out from Deputy, Norton whether he has worked out his ideas about the reduced hours for labour that he proposes?  Has he prepared any scheme for the farmers?  I would like to see how he is going to reduce the working hours for the farmer and what is the capacity of the farmers to pay under the changed conditions. Would the farmer require two sets of men to milk his cows&mdash;one set for the morning milking and another for the evening?  Farmers can only pay a certain rate of wages, so that I am afraid Deputy Norton's scheme would be hardly workable.  The fact is that it is simply bluff.  When Deputy Norton makes a statement of that kind it is only right that the farmers should demand from him a statement as to how he is going to work out this policy. Again I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to consider this question of giving grants to those unemployment people in congested areas by granting a bounty or subsidy on their purchases.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Coburn in his appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary pointed out that he was one of those who maintained that it was not the duty of the Government to provide work for the unemployed.  I was sorry Deputy McGilligan was not present to agree with him.  That was the argument that Deputy McGilligan put to this House when he was in office.  He said it was not the function of the <Col N="310" /> Government to provide work, or to give any relief towards unemployment, other than the small amount then allocated each year under pressure.  I am one of those who maintain that it is the function and the duty of any Government to relieve unemployment.</P>
      <P>While we admit that this Government, realising that we have a war on and that the resources of the country should be united in winning that war, has made an effort at least to look after a number of those people who had been engaged in the battle, other sections of the community, of the soldiers&mdash;the dockers and others&mdash;are not yet provided for.  We hope that Deputy O'Leary will find that the Government will adopt the suggestion put up to the Parliamentary Secretary last year, that instead of there being a wage of 24/- per week, there should be less hours worked.  I have not advocated any minor relief schemes for the reason that I am opposed to the wage of 24/- a week which is allowed for minor relief work.  That is a much lesser wage than a man receives for similar work under the county council.  I notice that £150,000 is provided in this estimate for local authorities which is to be repaid with interest.  I should like to know what the Minister for Finance will charge public bodies who are prepared to help the Government in providing schemes for the relief of unemployment.  Will the money be given on the same terms as moneys advanced from the Local Loans Fund?  Will the terms be that we shall be charged 1/2 per cent. less than the bank rate?  If so, that will be very little encouragement to public bodies.  I suggest to the Government that in cases where they see that a public body is really interested and is anxious to provide at least two years' work for a large number of men unemployed at present, they should assist that public body by granting it a loan even without any interest.  The rates can then provide any balance necessary for such relief work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to point out to the Parliamentary Secretary that where public bodies are engaged in the development of lands for housing <Col N="311" /> schemes, they have to make roads and lay down sewerage in the development area and they are obliged to charge the cost of making these roads and laying down the sewerage, against the housing scheme.  I advocated in another place that that work should be treated as a different matter and that the development of the area together with the cost of the sewerage should be a separate charge.  I believe the Government ought to give loans to public bodies to enable them to provide work in this way whilst providing houses for the working classes. In that way it will be possible to absorb a large number of men in a year or a two years plan.</P>
    <P>The adoption of a direct labour policy in connection with housing schemes has been advocated here to-night. Being one of the first boards to avail of the O'Kelly Act, the Wicklow Board of Health has some experience in this matter.  In the rural area we provided some 700 or 800 houses for agricultural labourers. We are faced with the difficulty that we are up against a combine of contractors who are trying to fleece the board of health and to charge £300 for a four-roomed country cottage. We faced that problem.  These high prices meant that higher rents would have to be charged to the tenants of these houses.  We had to get together in certain areas to compete against the contractors and we had to impress on the Local Government Department that we were prepared under a direct labour scheme to provide houses from £50 to £60 cheaper than the contract price and to supply better material and give more employment.  I shall take one area in Greystones where a contractor tendered for erection of houses.  The board of health built these houses in Greystones by direct labour.  We were able to pay 1/- an hour to the labourers, 1/10 per hour to the plasterers&mdash;the full Dublin union rate&mdash;and to put in extra material and to provide more accommodation. Yet the houses were built at £50 less than the contract price. We also gave more employment than would be given under the contract system.  A similar thing happened in <Col N="312" /> Avoca.  In other areas we were allowed to proceed by direct labour on giving a guarantee that the work would cost less than the contract price. Not alone are we doing it less than the contract price but we are putting in extra material in the way of window sills and door steps.  I therefore hope that the direct labour system will be encouraged by the Government.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance made provision in the Budget to enable county councils to open new roads which would connect one portion of a county with another.  We have prepared a scheme to connect West Wicklow with East Wicklow, on which we hope to give at least twelve months' employment to both agricultural labourers and small farmers.  If the Minister gives us a loan at a cheap rate of interest we are prepared to embark on further schemes of this kind which will assist the Government to provide work for the unemployed.  Many schemes have been put before the Parliamentary Secretary in connection with the development of harbours.  I am one who appreciates the work the Department is doing in that direction, and I recognise the efficiency displayed by civil servants in doing their part to assist public representatives.  I am one who never went into a department, even since the present Government came into office, to ask for any favours to advocate any particular scheme.  I leave these matters to the officials and I am certain that no political favour or political pull is shown.  Each county is treated fairly and if I found that it was not I would be the first to criticise the activities of the Department.</P>
    <P>Last year the Parliamentary Secretary gave us a small loan to carry out a plan on which he seemed to have some misgivings in connection with coastal erosion.  That was a plan put forward by an Irish engineer, and, with the aid of a small sum of £500, granted by the Department, which was supplemented by the county council, some thousands of pounds' worth of property has been saved.  I only hope and trust that a further sum will be provided to continue that work.  The Parliamentary Secretary has not seen <Col N="313" /> that protection work since.  I would be glad if he would inspect it and see the result of an Irish engineer's plans.  He will have to admit that they have at least been successful and that they have saved very valuable property from the ravages caused by gales from the South-East and NorthEast. I hope he will be able to give us encouragement to approach the Government to give us a further loan as 70 per cent. of the money is spent on labour.</P>
    <P>Another matter that has come to my notice is that in selecting men for work on the roads, one condition of the grant is that a man must be in receipt of unemployment assistance before he can be considered.  We had a large number of men in receipt of home help whose claims for unemployment assistance had not come back from the Department concerned, with the result that these men were debarred from getting this work although we have to continue giving them home help.</P>
    <P>I would ask that that condition should be waived pending the hearing of the appeals which these men have lodged and pending the consideration of the schemes that applicants have submitted.  It is most unfair that a large number of genuine workers should be deprived of the opportunity of getting work from the county councils owing to the enforcement of that condition.  They cannot be accepted for work unless they are able to produce a certificate from the manager of the labour exchange that they have been in receipt of unemployment assistance.  I am not saying that the Parliamentary Secretary has any responsibility for that.  The Local Government Department introduced that in connection with the administration of grants for trunk roads.  But I would ask that the condition should be waived pending the hearing of all these claims.</P>
    <P>As regards the minor relief schemes I cannot understand why the Parliamentary Secretary should have followed the bad example of the Cumann na nGaedheal Government in the matter of the non-stamping of unemployment cards of the men engaged on these schemes.  I know, of course, that <Col N="314" /> the Parliamentary Secretary will argue that this is agricultural work.  But is there any fair-minded man who would say that work on the roads or in a quarry is agricultural work?  Nobody could convince me that it is.  It may be correct to say that if farmers' sons are engaged repairing a lane leading to their farms that it is agricultural work, but they are in quite a different position to men engaged on repair work which is carried out under the control of the county surveyor.  These men have to work alongside county council employees.  They do the same class of work but their cards are not stamped, while the cards of those working beside them, because they are in the employment of the county council, are stamped.  It has to be remembered, too, that the men engaged on these minor relief schemes are in receipt of a smaller wage than the county council workers and they have to suffer the further disability of not having their cards stamped.  I know, of course, that there was a legal decision on this some years ago, but I think it should be waived in favour of these workers.  We have a war on now, and I think it is about time we got away from all this red-tapeism. The Government, I suggest, should help public boards that are prepared to initiate useful schemes that will provide employment for our people.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moore referred to the mining district of Avoca.  That is one of the hardest hit areas in the County Wicklow.  There is very little agricultural work there.  The workers there have to depend on the employment they get on the roads and in the mines.  The making of our main roads is almost completed.  If the system of direct labour was employed on the by-roads it would help very considerably to ease the unemployment problem in that particular area. I agree with Deputy Moore that something should be done to relieve the distress due to unemployment that prevails there.  The Parliamentary Secretary invited Deputies to suggest schemes of useful public works.  The schemes that I have suggested, if put into operation, would provide work for 12 months or two years.  The harbour boards in Arklow and <Col N="315" /> Wicklow have made appeals to the Government for assistance to carry out dredging and an extension of their docks.  When application is made to the Board of Works for assistance the harbour boards are referred to the Department of Finance which, in turn, points out that certain loans are due by these harbour boards.  I do not suppose it would be in order for me on this Vote to deal with the question of the repayment of loans, but I might point out that many of these old loans were obtained during the British régime. I would like to know why these loans should not be funded as the land annuity payments have been.  The position at the present time is that public boards are called upon to pay penal interest in connection with many of those old loans as well as other charges that are supposed to be due but that are not being paid to England and that I hope never will. Their repayment means an increased rate on the ratepayers in these little towns.  We have had many complaints about the position of the farmers.  Deputy O'Leary spoke about it a short time ago.  But what about the men living in labourers' cottages who are paying more in rent and rates than some of the farmers in West Cork who have 40 and 50 acres of land.  These farmers are threatening to go to jail rather than pay their annuities which, in many cases, only amount to £5 or £6 a year.  In proportion to their income, the men in the labourers' cottages are paying more in rent and rates than these farmers.  There is a large number of small uneconomic holders in my area. I would urge on the Parliamentary Secretary to use any influence that he has with the Land Commission to divide up some of the big ranches in my county.  I am not advocating the case now of the landless man, but recently I have come across cases of small farmers in my area trying to make a living on 20 acres of land. These men have told me that if they had another 20 acres they would be able to live well, and would not be obliged to seek road work from the county council with their horses and <Col N="316" /> cars.  They could leave that work for others who are unemployed.</P>
    <P>I know that the Parliamentary Secretary will not agree with the suggestion I have made as regards introducing a 40-hour week.  That however, is a question that we can debate on another occasion when a certain Bill that has been promised by the Government comes before the House.  We have a large population in the country at the present time, and I believe that if my suggestion for shorter hours were put into operation by the Government it would help very considerably to relieve the unemployment problem.</P>
    <P>As regards the rate of interest on loans that is charged to public bodies, I will be glad to have some information on that from the Parliamentary Secretary.  If lower rates were charged, and if more assistance was given to public bodies than has been given hitherto, I believe that many useful schemes of work would be put into operation.  These schemes would go a long way to provide work for large numbers of men who at present are in receipt of unemployment assistance as well as for those who are not in receipt of any assistance.  The public bodies would be quite willing to give every co-operation to the Government in the carrying through of such schemes.  The high rates of interest charged at present bear very heavily on the ratepayers in our little towns.  They should get some consideration as well as the farmers who have had their land annuity payments halved.  If loans were provided at a cheaper rate of interest than that which prevails at present, local bodies would have no excuse for not going ahead with useful public works to provide employment for the people. If my suggestion were adopted by the Government it would, I believe, mean that in my county employment would be provided for over 1,000 men for the next two years.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Even the weariest river winds somewhere safe to sea.&rdquo;  This debate <Col N="317" /> opened with a compliment to myself personally and to the immediate headquarters staff engaged in the administration of these schemes.  As far as the headquarters staff and headquarters attention was concerned, it was agreed by the leader of the Opposition that these schemes were being better administered than they had ever been administered before and administered with the intention of fairness.  Unfortunately, when the bouquet was thrown, the pot was thrown with it.  In other words, it was said once again that while the good intentions of the Parliamentary Secretary and his staff were unimpeachable, there was widespread throughout the country a campaign of victimisation. Now I allude to that because the yellow Press will come out to-morrow, as it always does come out at the end of those debates, with a heading, &ldquo;Victimisation on Relief Schemes.&rdquo; In every single debate which we have had the Press has just grabbed hold of some expression of that kind and used it as a headline to describe the discussion which took place here. Typical of all other debates in this matter, the man who made that insinuation, on being asked whether he had personal knowledge of any single particular case or whether he had, having that knowledge, brought that particular case to the Department for the purpose of examination, said &ldquo;No.&rdquo;  Now we have had that in every debate.  In the last debate we had it from Deputy MacDermot.  On being asked whether he had any case he said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;No, but where there is smoke there must be fire.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again I pointed out that in his case&mdash; like the leader we were dealing with to-day, and that leader has intended to be fair&mdash;he had behind him the organisation and machinery of a party; that he had his fingers and his eyes on the ends of the earth as far as this country was concerned; that in relation to 2,500 claims going on at the same time there was intimate local knowledge in the possession of the representatives of that party.  The same thing held to-day.  It held in the last debate.  It held in the debate <Col N="318" /> previously.  In every single case in which a man has been asked to deliver the goods and mention a case which was given to us and not investigated he has failed to do so.  Now I have had a studied patience in relation to matters of this kind.  I have felt that it was a duty on my part in both the tone and manner of the discussion here in dealing with cases of this kind to do everything that lay in my power to encourage every Deputy of the House who had facts to bring them to us with absolute confidence that they would be treated fairly.  But I am not entitled to remain patient if in every debate we are to have a repetition of that calculated insinuation, with in every case absolute lack of any evidence of a sense of responsibility behind those who make that accusation. Deputy O'Leary at the end had another case, but he had not brought it to us.  Deputy Murphy last year gave me a case and we investigated it. There was a lot of truth in the case put up by Deputy Murphy.  I would challenge anybody in this House to come and examine the file, see the care and trouble we took to get to the bottom of the case, and then say that he is entitled&mdash;knowing or suspecting that there is any malpractice on the part of any man in administration of this fund, every single penny of which belongs to the poor&mdash;to hold back from his deliberate and definite and bounden duty to help those who are anxious to get the thing cleared up.</P>

      <P>I think that was practically all that mattered as far as Deputy Dillon is concerned.  Deputy Dillon has at different times sent me cases which I have investigated.  He has also sent me suggestions which have been investigated.  If Deputies have any suggestions to make, or any cases to be investigated, let us have them.  The House might recognise that I am not here to-night administering an indefinite amount of money.  I am not concerned with what could be done if I had an infinite amount of money.  I am concerned with the administration of £350,000 which was put into my possession by the Dáil, and £150,000 which is being voted to-night.  It is merely a question of how that can be best distributed.  Deputy Dillon suggested that scenic roads would be roads to which attention should be given; that is, roads having indirect economic value for tourist traffic.  Those roads, to any extent of which we hear of them, would undoubtedly be considered. Three or four valuable roads from the scenic point of view have been created. The Deputy suggested farm drainage. A scheme in relation to that has been put up to the Committee of Public Works, and it is now being investigated. Land reclamation has been already done.  It was done under the old régime, and has been continued to the extent of £10,000 or £15,000.  Therefore, the principle of using public money on private land, where it is clearly understood you are dealing with congests, or people otherwise in uneconomic holdings, is already accepted, and it is only a question of its extension.  The Deputy desired to know how application for such money should be made.  In the first instance, it should be made to the Department of Agriculture, who will make the recommendation to us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Norton was anxious to know what would be done for large towns. Up to the present £70,000 has been allocated this year for public health schemes, practically all in towns, and there is probably another £30,000 which will be allocated for public health schemes, mostly in the cities and towns. The Deputy suggested as a solution a reduction of the hours of labour.  That <Col N="321" /> is simply a question for argument, on which people differ very much.  The argument has been stated by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, that one of the effects of reducing the hours of labour, where an employer desires to keep up production, is that he puts in machinery to do it.  When you begin to get production by increased machinery the tendency does not stop with the first success.  It is certainly a serious question to be considered.  I am only saying this from the point of view of argument, to show that there are two sides to be considered.  A reduction of hours does not increase the wealth of a community.  What it does is to redistribute, to some extent, the wealth of the country.  I am perfectly satisfied that what this country wants, more than the redistribution of wealth, is the creation of wealth.  Personally, I do not see along the lines of the mere reduction of hours.  I cannot see that you are going to ameliorate conditions.  You are going to divide the labour amongst more people. Honestly, I cannot see further in present conditions.  All I am suggesting is that it is obviously not a case where all the arguments are on one side.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce gave certain figures showing that in 1931, 17,000 people were placed in employment and in 1932, over 100,000.  I can bring out later, in relation to a question which we are going to have all over again, the significance of the actual hours in employment.  Probably I would be inclined to let that slide.  I am afraid Deputy MacDermot wandered away.  He told us he was an unprejudiced observer.  I do not think I <Col N="322" /> need go any further.  Deputy Corry suggested that under this scheme there should be preference for victimised farm labourers, for men who had been definitely thrown out of employment as a result of political pressure.  That would be a perfectly legitimate thing for a Government to do by a vote <i>ad hoc.</i> If it could be shown that a particular section of men had been victimised for political opinions, and thrown out of employment, it would be a legitimate move for a Government to deal with, but it would have to be dealt with <i>ad hoc.</i>  I do not see how you could include machinery of that kind in the ordinary regulations for the purpose of fairly recruiting labour purely on distress work out of ordinary unemployment schemes.</P>

      <P>The Deputy means to collect money and to give it to a special account.  Deputy Kent spoke of labourers who refused to work because they were getting unemployment assistance.  It is a duty everybody owes to the State, where they know of cases of that kind, to report them.  We have had already, from the very limited scope of the archaeological works, run up against a couple of cases of men who refused to work on these jobs, but who turned up to claim assistance.  In all such cases unemployment assistance has been withdrawn, and the men left with the obligation to appeal and to show cause why it should be restored.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Kent does not want the work-shy to &ldquo;get away&rdquo; with it.  We are going to have a certain small proportion of people who prefer to have 7/-, 8/- or 10/- a week and to do nothing rather than work for higher wages.  It will be our business, and I think it will be a difficult and onerous one this year, to see as far as possible that people who are prepared to misuse the Unemployment Assistance Fund in that way will not &ldquo;get away&rdquo; with <Col N="323" /> it.  We propose to do our best in that matter.  I am not clear to what degree we will succeed.  It may be found, for instance, that in certain areas there will not be registered for home assistance a sufficient number of men to fill up the gangs in those areas. You might not find people turning up who ought to be doing work.  It is not going to be an easy job this year.  The job I have is one that no one in this House envies, certainly on the principle on which we are going, of being individually responsible for recruiting and standing over the recruitment on the merits of, perhaps, 30,000 or 40,000 men, without the formal intervention of the labour exchanges as our protection, as to a large extent they were this year.  It is certainly not going to be a pleasant occupation. However, it is a job and we will do the best we can.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan referred to the fact that I had said that a man had to walk 15 miles.  I should not have said that a man had to walk 15 miles. What I meant was that a man was a considerable distance away from, and out of contact with, labour exchanges under the old position.  What we did was to bring the labour exchanges to his door and the bringing of the labour exchanges to his door was something which had a very great influence upon the fact that he did register then when he had not registered before.  The proof of that is that the vast majority of the new registration did not take place at the central office but at the local offices which we provided. Deputy McGilligan also referred to the fact that there was an economic war on, starting somewhere about the time we came in, and that the actual figures of unemployment registration had risen during the period of that war, and asked whether we were not bound to take into account the connection between those two figures.  There is all the difference in the world between <i>post hoc</i> and <i>propter hoc.</i>  Two things may run parallel to another thing without any causal connection. If anyone will study the actual graph showing the rise and time and rate and shape of the curve of the rise which <Col N="324" /> took place in the two cases in which the two big jumps came, he will find that it has no connection with the gradual development of the economic war.  He will find that the whole of the first rise took place within the two months in which the three new conditions were brought into being&mdash;local exchanges, a large unemployment grant, and the understanding that the registrations at the labour exchanges were a definite title to being employed and to getting benefit from relief.</P>
    <P>That was the first rise, and as you move along, you find that you drop back to the ordinary seasonal characteristic at the higher level, until you come to January of 1934. In January of 1934, instead of a fall taking place, as should have been the case, according to the seasonal change, it rose.  It rose against the law and it rose precisely from the time at which it was announced that at a particular date this Act would come into operation and that benefit would accrue.  The first rise actually stopped, the first rush of new registrations actually stopped, on the date on which it had been scheduled that the Act was to come into operation.  In other words, any honest inquirer, as distinct from a purely political examiner of the question, will find a direct connection between the rate of the rise and the place of the rise and the new artificial stimuli that were introduced.</P>
    <P>The other thing the Deputy said was perfectly true.  He spoke of his last year as Minister for Industry and Commerce. Deputy Murphy, and I think, Deputy Everett also, raised the question of whether or not a man was prohibited from getting employment on these relief schemes because he was not on unemployment assistance.  We shall probably take into temporary employment somewhere between 30,000 and 40,000 men.  They will not be all on at the same time, but the actual total number of people in this country who have at the present moment certificates that they would be entitled to unemployment assistance, if they were out of work, is 180,000.  Every one of those has a statutory title to be regarded as a person entitled to work out of this, <Col N="325" /> in preference to other people, and I am inclined to think that, apart from the probable irregularity of distribution of registration, we ought to be able to get, out of those 180,000 people, most of the people who are going to be employed on unemployment work.  Of the remainder, of the whole of the other people who are applying for certificates&mdash;and the gap is not very big&mdash; 220,000 as against 180,000&mdash;all those people will be registered or ought to be registered at the labour exchange if they are unemployed.  Of course, it is quite obvious that they cannot be because you have 180,000 certificates out already and you have only 119,000 on the unemployment register, and that unemployment register probably includes nearly 30,000 people who would not have, and would not be qualified for certificates at all.  Therefore, it seems to me, in the first place, that the people who have a certificate from the State that their total income is below a certain level have undoubtedly a right to a preference when unemployed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyJMurphy" hpid="Mr. T.J. Murphy Mr. T.J. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder if the Parliamentary Secretary has got the point I was trying to make or if it is my fault that I did not make it clear? There would be a large number in various districts of persons who got qualification certificates which would entitle them perhaps to a shilling or two.  They have not drawn any benefit and their cases are the subject of appeal at the moment.  I was anxious that the fact that they were not actually in receipt of benefit and that decisions in their cases were pending would not prejudice their chance of employment.  I think I understand from the Parliamentary Secretary's reply now that they would be eligible?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as I can see, they would.  The first people who would get it would be the people who are actually getting unemployment assistance. Take, for instance, the archaeological returns.  We attempted to use those as an idea of how the thing was going to work and we asked those in charge to divide the employees up into people who were on unemployment assistance <Col N="326" /> and people who had certificates granted.  They were either one or the other and, therefore, I take it a person with a certificate granted would be eligible.  Of course, a man with a certificate granted would be on unemployment assistance if he were unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>It is only right that the Parliamentary Secretary should know that, in some cases, when a man is appealing, his benefit is stopped.  I have the case of a man who had 6/- a week and who appealed against it and his card was taken from him pending the appeal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>What we will do is to try to get the atmosphere, that while the first preference goes to men who are on unemployment assistance as far as possible, the rest of the employment will go to those with qualification certificate.  I just want to know whether it is the will and judgment of the House that as far as possible employment on unemployment schemes should be given to those who have statutory qualification under this Act. Is that the general desire?</P>

      <P>While I cannot say that that will be carried out to 100 per cent., I will say that every effort will be made to bring it as near to that as we possibly can.  There may be cases of people who have not applied for unemployment assistance at all.  You may find&mdash;certainly in some of the farming areas&mdash;people who say: &ldquo;I will not go in for unemployment assistance at all.&rdquo;  I do not want to be put in the position of saying that a man of that kind would not get a chance of employment even under that.</P>

      <P>They may be very rare, but the more rare they are the more I think everybody would feel that people who took that point of view should be entitled to consideration.  Deputy Murphy was also strong on the question of direct employment in various <Col N="327" /> ways.  All the cases he raised were local authorities' schemes, I think, with the exception of cases under the Office of Public Works.  I think that the number of cases that were done by contract on relief work by the Office of Public Works are very few.  Personally, I can only recollect one case, although there may be more.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I will, but as far as the Office of Public Works in its general capacity is concerned it must be remembered that its business is to get value for State money and to treat State property as something out of which the State has to get full value.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>To the extent to which they can be reconciled they will be sympathetically considered.  Deputy Coburn asked whether all the money was allocated.  It is not.  I am going to give you certain figures, but if anybody at any time wants to tell me that I have given a solemn and sacred promise that money is going to be distributed in this manner, they had better think again.  Broadly speaking, the intention is to distribute it between public health, mineral development, peat schemes and minor relief schemes, and the rest.  Public health, probably, will get £100,000&mdash; perhaps a little more.  From £7,000 to £10,000 a year will be spent on minerals.  That may be an answer to Deputy Moore also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not much.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Oliver Twist! At any rate, to the extent to which it is being used, it is used not so much on mining as in the discovery of the places in which you could mine, in the removing of over-burden on places, in opening and investigating deposits, and, in addition, certain money has been and will be spent on roads into mineral workings.  The peat schemes depend <Col N="328" /> altogether on what they will be able to carry.  It may be anything from £50,000 to £100,000.  Probably £100,000 will be spent on minor relief schemes.</P>
      <P>While the whole of the money is segregated out in sections of that kind, the actual amount which is definitely allocated is not within £150,000 of the total, but the whole of that £150,000 will be allocated more or less on those lines.  What I am saying is that if there are any schemes which anyone has in relation to particular places, money is still available; but if you want a Local Government scheme, send it through the Local Government Department; if you want a mineral development scheme, send it through Industry and Commerce; because the procedure is that each of these Departments send up to us recommendations for grants in relation to schemes which they themselves are responsible for, having technically examined them, and we then allocate moneys to them on the basis, to a certain extent, of their desirability, and, to a certain extent, as to whether they fall in these areas in which unemployment money of that kind is required.</P>
      <P>Deputy Coburn also wanted to know about the initiation of schemes.  The difficulty is that I have got to tell the same story time after time.  On every debate in connection with this matter I have told the House that everybody is entitled to put forward schemes&mdash;county councillors, county surveyors, Deputies, Senators and so on&mdash;and we will be glad to consider them.  We have already considered some thousands of schemes and tried to sift them out on their merits and I do not think that there is any Party in this House that has submitted schemes that have not been examined and dealt with on their merits.</P>
      <P>Deputy Coburn said a most remarkable thing.  He said one of the most hopeful things I have ever heard as a testimony to the comfort and safety and comparative stability and lack of anxiety which we would all feel in relation to the present state of the country and its future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="329" /> He said that economic pressure would compel us all to tell the truth.  I suppose, therefore, that the proportionate lack of truthfulness which is now, according to political opponents, universal in this country, must be a measure of the country's prosperity and the lack of economic pressure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is unpleasant but it is hopeful.  Deputy Moore is interested in minerals in Wicklow.  We do make a rule here that no one gets any advantage by using debates of this kind for the purpose of pushing particular schemes in relation to his own constituency.  As a result, we have reduced to a minimum the speeches made for the purpose of local newspaper consumption.  In so far, however, as Deputy Moore has raised, as he always does raise, some questions of public as well as local interest, the matters will be considered; but the particular schemes which he has in view I would advise him to send through the regular channels&mdash;that is, the Minister for Industry and Commere, who will send them along.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>They were sent there long ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>If they have been there long ago, the Deputy must know that there they are sent to geological experts, and the fact that they have not yet come forward to us does not necessarily mean that they are particularly good.  I suggest that Deputy Moore should start again.  I am rather prejudiced in favour of the area to which he belongs as my mother comes from it.  Deputy O'Leary, of north-east Cork, suggests that there should be a local subsidy on feeding stuffs for that particular district.  Now, I am frankly of opinion that there are certain areas which the general policy of the Government in relieving agriculture has not touched, and where a specific remedy that will attack a specific problem is available I think we should all be very grateful to get it.  Whether <Col N="330" /> the particular proposal the Deputy has made is practicable or not I do not know, but it will be referred to the Minister for Agriculture, who will consider it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Everett wants to know at what price the Minister for Finance will give him money.  If he gets it through the Local Loans Fund, he will get it at 4¾ per cent.  Where you ask for a different rate of interest, what you are asking for is an additional subsidy.</P>
      <P>I cannot give it to you out of the £150,000.  The Minister for Finance calculates that in distributing the total amount of income that he has to give for all benefits in the country he has given to the particular activity in which the Deputy is interested all that in fairness he could give relative to others. It is the business of the Deputy to put up a special claim for that thing as against some other claim.  There is an idea&mdash;it is quite a natural idea&mdash;that the Government has a sort of bottomless sack out of which it produces stuff. That is not so.  It has a limited income. It is a question of how much it will give to one interest or activity without taking too much from another.  I think the Deputy will understand that what he has to do in that particular case is not to put up a case simply on the basis of its absolute desirability, but of its relative desirability, relative to other things.  Any reduction of interest by the Minister for Finance to a particular activity is, on a given income, a reduction of his capacity to give benefit to some other activity.  The Deputy can put it up on that basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy also raised the question of the stamping of the unemployment cards of people on relief works.  The whole question is whether in doing that you are anxious to benefit the people employed upon these relief works or not.  Our chief reason for not doing it, apart from the fact that there is a legal definition against us in the case of their being agricultural labourers, is that the people themselves would not benefit by it.  All that would happen in relation to a person engaged upon a minor relief work would be that he would be <Col N="331" /> charged up with the unemployment stamps but would get no benefit from them.  You have to have 12 stamps before you can get benefit.  From our experience of the people whom we have employed, the vast number of people engaged in minor relief schemes are not employed for 12 weeks on that work.  A great many of them are small farmers or farmers' sons, especially in the poorer congested areas, who have no other stamps to their credit, and the only effect of giving them four or five weeks' work on an unemployment scheme would be to reduce their wages by the amount of their own contribution to the unemployed stamps.  I do not think that is what Deputy Everett wants.</P>
    <P>Personally I prefer to keep a debate of this kind strictly to the Vote itself, and I have simply dealt as honestly as I could with the questions raised.  I am frankly not looking forward very much to the administration of this year. There has been a considerable change in relation to the position from the point of view of the unemployment assistance and the rest of it.  There has been a withdrawal from the relief schemes due to the unexampled pressure which the administration of the unemployment assistance and now of the free meat scheme has put upon the employment exchanges.  There has been necessarily for this year a withdrawal from co-operation.  We have now to recruit our people through a great many different and separate agencies.  The employment exchanges are prepared to give us every help that they can, and we are prepared to avail of every help they can give; but it is going to be a complicated position.  At the end of the year we will be asked to stand over the actual circumstances under which we have employed some 30,000 or 40,000 different men.  It is against all human reason to imagine that there will not be mistakes made in that.  All I can tell you is that, as far as the Department is concerned, as far as every officer of that Department as far down as we can reach is concerned, no mistake will be made that can be avoided by people who fully and definitely regard this money as a trust <Col N="332" /> put in their hands to be administered fairly for the benefit of the poor.</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that this Bill be now read a Second Time.  I think this is the first time that an Irish Parliament was invited to discuss proposals for the regulation throughout the world of Irish citizenship.  As the Deputies know, Article 3 of the Constitution created only a very limited citizenship.  Citizenship was confined then to the limits of the jurisdiction of the Saorstát as it was on December the 6th, 1921, to certain classes of people.  That article of the Constitution contemplated that conditions governing the acquisition and determination of citizenship should be determined as regards the future, after that day, by law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No such law has been passed and the result of that has been that many anomalies have occurred.  We propose now both to extend that article of the Constitution by the amending Bill which was introduced into the House on yesterday and also to implement the article by providing the necessary legislation to govern the conditions for the acquisition and determination of citizenship.  The need for this has been felt both in the domestic sphere and in the sphere of our international relations.  In the domestic sphere we need an exact statutory definition of citizenship.  For example, we need it in connection with our electoral system, in connection with entry into the public service, in connection with our merchant shipping laws, in connection with the ownership of aircraft, in connection with those special privileges which we think should be reserved for our own citizens and in connection with our general economic system.  In fact, you might say we need that in relation to every domain or sphere in which <Col N="334" /> we want our own citizens to enjoy special rights and privileges.</P>
    <P>In our external relations we require it also in a very special way.  As you know, we have established diplomatic missions abroad in many countries. We have such missions at the moment in Washington, in Paris and Brussels; in Berlin and in the State of the Vatican City as well as in London. And the purpose of these diplomatic missions is not merely to establish relations with the Governments of the particular countries, but also to give such of our nationals as may be in those countries what is sometimes a very necessary protection and to provide for them advice and facilities when they need them.  That advice and facilities are also afforded by our consular service.  That consular service is being extended very widely now in the United States.  These consuls perform many functions for the benefit of our nationals.  They have notarial functions, they have functions in regard to registers, to verification of births, marriages and deaths.  They have activities in the defence of the interests of our citizens both in and out of court, in connection, for example, with the estates of deceased persons&mdash;estates in which Irish citizens may have an interest.</P>
    <P>Then there are passports.  In the exercise of all those functions it is very necessary that it should be capable of being determined without ambiguity whether a particular person is or is not a citizen of our country.  For that reason I think every Deputy in the House should welcome the introduction of this Bill.  If you examine the Bill you will find that it falls naturally into three main sections:&mdash;first of all, the section relating to natural-born citizenship.  That I think, is dealt with in Section 2.  A number of sections then relate to the acquisition of citizenship by naturalisation certificate. A special Part of the Bill relates to the acquisition of citizenship by marriage.  Section 13 and a few sections following deal particularly with that matter.</P>
    <P>Then we have the portion beginning, I think, with Section 21 that deals with citizenship rights.  These are the main <Col N="335" /> sections&mdash;the sections dealing with natural-born citizens; the acquisition of citizenship, including the marriage provisions and the provision for reciprocal or mutual citizenship rights.  Any sections that do not come directly under these are of a miscellaneous character and they more or less stand by themselves.  They are intelligible generally one by one.  I am going to take them for a moment, beginning with Section 2.  Section 2 deals with the whole question of definition of who is, or is to be, a natural-born citizen.</P>
    <P>Natural-born citizens, you will find, are in two categories, those who are born in the territory of Saorstát Eireann or those whose fathers are citizens, whether these fathers were themselves born in the territory of Saorstát Eireann or not, and you will find that in regard to the latter, in the case of those living outside the territory, the children of fathers who were themselves born in Saorstát Eireann, these children automatically became natural-born citizens.  But the children of fathers who were not themselves born in Saorstát Eireann have to be registered in a book called the Foreign Births Entry Book, which will be kept in the Legations, where we have such, or in the Foreign Births Register, which will be preserved by the Minister for External Affairs here at home.  It seems not unreasonable to demand that where the father was not born in this country and acquired let us say, his citizenship automatically through his father, he, being more detached from this country, should, if he wishes his child to be a citizen of this country, perform some positive act in that regard and that positive act is to have the birth of the child entered in the Foreign Births Entry Book.  The child himself or herself, on attaining 21 years of age, will, in addition, have to signify the desire to be an Irish citizen.  That, I think, covers the main provisions of Section 2.</P>
    <P>The next series of sections govern the acquisition of citizenship by a <Col N="336" /> process of naturalisation.  Any person who fulfills certain conditions can apply for citizenship or a certificate of naturalisation.  The Minister for Justice will consider whether the prescribed conditions are fulfilled and it is at his absolute discretion to decide whether he shall or shall not give the certificate.  The conditions are laid down.  There is the residence condition which demands that there shall be, previous to the application for citizenship, at least five years' residence in the territory of the Saorstát, one year immediately preceding the date of application and the further four years either continuous or summing up to a period of four years, but at any rate amounting to four years in the preceding eight.  In other words, there is to be a total period of five years over a period of nine and one of the five years must be that immediately preceding the application.</P>
    <P>There are other conditions which must also be fulfilled.  The applicant must be of good character.  He must have resided continuously for the period I have indicated.  He must intend to become ordinarily resident in the country and he must make a declaration of acceptance of citizenship. Unless these conditions are fulfilled the certificate of naturalisation shall not issue.  Certain exceptions with regard to residence are made. There is the exception made in favour of those who were not included, for example, in the limited citizenship conferred by Article 3 who wish to return to this country and they can be given a certificate of naturalisation after a period of residence of one year.  The same exception is to be made in the case of certain widows. Perhaps the House may consider that that particular year is not necessary and if there is any volume of opinion in favour of cutting out that qualifying period of one year in these cases, I am certainly open to consider it.</P>
    <P>The next portion of the Bill to which I would like to refer is that portion dealing with the nationality of one spouse where one is an Irish national and the other is an alien.  We propose that marriage of itself should neither <Col N="337" /> confer citizenship nor deprive an Irish national of citizenship.</P>
    <P>You will be able to see the principles that underlie these provisions most easily, perhaps, if you classify the cases in this way : Take the case of an Irish citizen marrying a non-national, where the parties intend to reside outside the country or are residing outside the country.  You sub-divide that class into those who marry subsequent to the passing of this Act and those who will have married prior to the passing of the Act.  After the passing of the Act those who thus reside outside the country are given one year within which the Irish national can make a declaration of election to retain Irish nationality.  If that declaration is not made within one year after the marriage, then that national ceases to be a citizen.  In the case of marriage before the passing of this Act, if there is residence abroad, then a period of one year is given in which the necessary declaration can be made.  In the case of marriages of that sort, where the parties propose to reside in this country, we can make the same sub-divisions as in the previous case&mdash;those who will be married after the passing of the Act and those who will have been married before the passing of the Act.  In the case of those who will be married after the passing of the Act, the Bill allows a period of six months, but we may extend that on Committee Stage and make it, as in the other case, a period of a year.  In the case of those who have married before the passing of the Act and who are here for a period of two years or continuously since their marriage, on the Minister being satisfied that such a period has elapsed, the non-national can apply for a naturalisation certificate and the Minister can give it.</P>
    <P>The next group of sections to which I would direct attention is that regarding the mutual or reciprocal rights which it is proposed to grant to citizens of other countries in certain cases.  The general principle is that if our citizens, either in virtue of a convention or treaty entered into with these countries or because of the law in force in these countries, enjoy in <Col N="338" /> these countries certain rights and privileges, we are prepared to accord the same rights and privileges here directly as a result of the operation of this Act.  Then the rights and privileges accorded to the citizens of other countries here will be those settled and agreed to in the convention. I do not think that any such convention has been entered into by our State so far.  Where the law provides in other countries that our nationals get certain privileges, then the Executive Council can, by order, give to citizens of the countries in which such a law in favour of our citizens is in force corresponding rights and privileges here.  There are, however, reservations.  It is expressly provided in this Bill that the special rights and privileges that may be reserved by statutes, such as the Control of Manufactures Act, are still to be reserved for own own citizens.</P>
    <P>I do not think that it is necessary for me to refer in detail to the miscellaneous provisions.  The only important other provision is that contained in Section 28 regarding the repeal of the British Nationality and Status of Aliens Act, 1914, and the British Nationality and Status of Aliens Act, 1918, to the extent that they may have been or be deemed to be in operation here.  The need of that, I think, will be apparent to everybody.  It is a necessary safeguard to ensure that no question of that kind can arise.  This is, as you will see, a very important Bill.  We are anxious to have the fullest possible discussion upon it.  In Committee we shall, of course, have an opportunity of examining it section by section and line by line.</P>
    <P>Any proposed amendments will be examined and given the fullest possible consideration.  I do not think that this ought to be a controversial Bill.  It certainly is not conceived, and, indeed, it would be altogether wrong to have a Bill of this sort conceived, in any narrow or Party spirit.  We expect that every Deputy in the House will take the closest interest in it and I feel certain that, when it passes, there will be no reason for dissatisfaction <Col N="339" /> but every reason for satisfaction that the Bill has become law.</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>The citizenship in Article 3 is localised.  The citizenship here is universalised and gives extraterritorial effect.  The actual amendment would be to delete in lines 9 and 10 of Article 3 the words &ldquo;within the limits of the jurisdiction of the Irish Free State (Saorstát Eireann).&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the introduction of this Bill, and if I have anything to say about it is that I am sorry it has a limiting effect, and that the President, by some words in the Bill, or by some words in his speech introducing the Bill, did not declare his ideas with regard to the position that he expects our citizens, or those agreed to be our citizens, to take up, not in this country but when they are in England.  That is not declared in the Bill and it was not declared by himself.  The President says this change is founded upon Article 3 of the Constitution.  Article 3 establishes a certain group as having citizenship rights as from the date of the Treaty.  He is moving to delete the phrase &ldquo;within the limits of the jurisdiction of the Irish Free State.&rdquo;  I presumed, when I heard that measure was introduced, that it was to make certain that whatever benefits our citizenship could give were not going to be confined to the territory of the Irish Free State but were rather to have extraterritorial effect.  I think it is agreed &mdash;though I do not say that we should take up the position&mdash;that the jurisdiction of the Irish Free State is only over the Twenty-Six Counties.  That is the view, apparently, behind the <Col N="340" /> proposed amendment of Article 3. Firstly, we move away from Article 3, in three respects only, if it can be said to be a movement away at all. Secondly, in so far as we change the basis of citizenship for the future, it will cause inquiry as to why Article 3 was ever phrased in the way it is found.  Article 3 says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Every person without distinction of sex domiciled in the area of the jurisdiction of the Irish Free State (Saorstát Eireann) at the time of the coming into operation of this Constitution, who was born in Ireland, or either of whose parents was born in Ireland...</P>
      <P>For the future, our citizens derive only from the father, so that the matriarchal idea is gone except for the original stock.  Of course, the children of the natural stock, being themselves natural-born citizens, may transmit, through the mother&mdash;but only for one generation&mdash;citizenship to her progeny, unless the original citizens happen to be born outside this country.  The third movement is, of course, an obviously and necessary one because Article 3 limited citizenship to the number of people found here at the particular time with certain qualifications.  Since the year that that was passed, the stock of our citizens has been steadily growing less and less.  Nobody born since the date of the passing of that Constitution has acquired citizenship naturally.  We have an Article of the Constitution that declares that citizens of the Irish Free State have the right to free elementary education. The class of people who would have a right to demand that were grown beyond the stage for demanding public elementary education.</P>
      <P>Now we come to citizens in this Bill and we find that they are:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Every person who was born in Saorstát Eireann on or after the 6th day of December, 1922, and before the date of the passing of this Act.</P>
      <P>Then we have the qualification in connection with the registered ship, which says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Every person who was born on or after the 6th day of December, 1922, and before the date of the</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="341" /> passing of this Act in a ship registered in Saorstát Eireann and subject to the subsequent provisions of this section every person who is born outside Saorstát Eireann on or after the 6th December, 1922, and before the date of the passing of this Act and whose father was on the day of such person's birth a citizen of Saorstát Eireann...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>With regard to those people born of an Irish father outside this country, they do not require citizenship unless to safeguard themselves.  They have to register by taking some positive steps of their own.  Why that limitation should be there I do not know.  Most countries are content to say that people are entitled to become citizens of their country or, at any rate, that they are capable of retaining citizenship until such time as, by a positive act, they renounce it.  We take the other line.  We insist upon people taking some positive step to secure it by registering.  There are other small matters dealing with the question of the married woman which, I think, would be better discussed when these matters come up on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>There are two other interesting clauses in this measure&mdash;Clause 21, the convention clause, which I join up with Clause 28, the repeal of the Nationality and Status of Aliens Act, 1914.  I call attention to the wording of that last clause:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The British Nationality and Status of Aliens Act, 1914, and the British Nationality and Status of Aliens Act, 1918, if and so far as they respectively are or ever were in force in Saorstát Eireann are hereby repealed.</P>
    <P>There is a little bit of the mixing there that sometimes characterises the Attorney-General in other matters. He is not sure whether the Act runs here or not.</P>

      <P>In throwing it out, I see that we are not sure whether it is law or not.  Now what do we do in regard to our citizens abroad?  Have we any view upon that?</P>
      <P>Let us consider the case, say, if some adherent of Fianna Fáil, in brackets Republican Party, who is studying for medicine and who eventually becomes a doctor and who turns to take up work in some panel area in England.  What is he when he goes there?  Is he a British subject or do we say to him in England: &ldquo;You cannot become a British subject until you renounce your Irish nationality,&rdquo; or are we going to have that man following his leader's advice here at home saying: &ldquo;I am a good Republican at home and I can be a British subject if I like abroad?&rdquo; The President has begun to clear up ambiguities.  One of the things involved is passports.  I understand my name is no longer being used on passports. I understand the President has not yet faced up to his responsibility by having his name on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>Much better was done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Much better was done.  A civil servant substitutes for the President.  It was time he took my name off.  Somebody now in the service, willy nilly, has got to sign. And the President wants to clear up ambiguities! That is one of the things that make this matter of nationality or citizenship important.  We can call our citizens what we like here.  We can give them whatever privileges we like here.  The real matter that arises for consideration is what happens our citizens when they go abroad.  I think <Col N="343" /> that the only impact of nationality, in the modern world, on the citizens of any country is that when they go abroad they carry some mark, some letter of introduction, a passport, signed even by a civil servant, a letter of introduction to the other State, and that passport guarantees, in so far as the State has any power, to the citizen when he goes abroad all the protection that that other State can give him when he is abroad.</P>
      <P>There is a second matter derived from the passport.  That is to say, that if a citizen who goes abroad becomes undesirable in another country, that other country in which he is temporarily residing has the knowledge where and to whom to return that man. What do you want for our citizens when they go abroad?  The President, <i>via</i> a civil servant, <i>via</i> the King, asks certain things in the King's name.  The President does all this, and it is really only shirking responsibility to be afraid to put his name to a passport.  It either means that our citizens should get protection over and above what they would ordinarily get, by demanding it in the King's name or that the thing is an empty sham.  At any rate there should be frankness or a clearance of ambiguity about that.  The President should sign or refuse to sign.  He should say that he will not have the safeguarding of our nationals asked in the King's name by the use of the passport, or he should say: &ldquo;We mean what is there, and we do ask it in the name of the King.  We are going to rely for protection if necessary upon British consuls where we have no consuls of our own and upon British gunboats where we have no gunboats of our own.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>If, in years to come, as happened three or five years ago certain of our nationals on the Chinese Mission are kidnapped by Chinese bandits will the President be ashamed to put his name to a document asking that protection should be given to these people by the British? If the British are good enough to give them their aid, will he refuse even to <Col N="344" /> sign a letter of thanks to the people who go out to rescue these people from the hands of the Chinese bandits? What are our nationals going to do when they go abroad?  Is Section 21 going to apply to the status of a British National?  Is it intended to apply to it?  There is no convention. Is it the intention that we are going to seek convention with England; to say that we will give English nationals certain rights here in return for rights which our nationals will enjoy when they go to England?  Do we want to see the privileges of entry to certain examinations for which our people do enter in England?  Are we going to have any consideration for that privilege?  Do we want to use consuls who are called, properly called, British consuls in any areas where we have no foreign representatives or are we going to ask, as we may ask, the German consuls, the French consuls or the consuls of other nations to do us a service either for payment or in return for services which we shall render to these nations here?  Do we want in the final resort the aid of British armed forces where we have no armed forces of our own? Shall we call, as we may call for some consideration, on the help of the armed forces of some other nation or do we take the other course of simply saying that if our Nationals go abroad they go abroad knowing that we cannot help them or at least that we cannot call on one source of help, the help of other members of the British Commonwealth of Nations? That is the main question that arises on this Bill and it was worthy surely of an introductory remark or two to have clarified the position as the President would like to see it existing between ourselves and England, Australia or South Africa, if any of our nationals are found in England, Australia or South Africa.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one other aspect of this that I want to consider to-night.  This measure is founded on the Treaty.  We know that were it not for the Treaty this House would not be sitting here to-night to receive this measure.  It would not be possible of passage if it were not for the Treaty.  Before the <Col N="345" /> Treaty was negotiated, and invitation was sent to the people of this country to send representatives to see&mdash;I am not quoting the precise words, but this was the tone of it&mdash;if it was possible to realise Irish national aspirations with membership of the British Commonwealth of Nations.  The Treaty was passed and certain people thought it did not realise Irish national aspirations to be allied in a community of interests with the British Commonwealth of Nations. In a variety of conferences this matter of nationality was one thing which was dealt with.  In the 1929 Report there were six paragraphs which dealt with this question of nationality.  The matter was afterwards debated in the Dáil in 1929, 1930 and 1931 and in the end this Report and the later Report were adopted.  One of the paragraphs of the 1929 Report is as follows:</P>
    <P>The status of the Dominions in international relations, the fact that the King on the advice of his several Governments, assumes obligations and acquires rights by treaty on behalf of individual members of the Commonwealth, and the position of the members of the Commonwealth in the League of Nations and in relation to the Permanent Court of International Justice do not merely involve the recognition of these communities as distinct juristic entities, but also compel recognition of a particular status of membership of those communities for legal and political purposes.  These exigencies have already become apparent; and two of the Dominions have passed acts defining their &ldquo;nationals&rdquo; both for national and for international purposes.</P>
    <P>I will read paragraph 77:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Under the new position, if any change is made in the requirements established by the existing legislation, reciprocal action will be necessary to attain this same recognition, the importance of which is manifest in view of the desirability of facilitating freedom of intercourse and the mutual granting of privileges among the different parts of the Commonwealth.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="346" /> That referred to the common status recognised throughout the British Commonwealth which had been given a statutory basis by the operation of the Act that we are repealing as far as this country is concerned if it has any effect here.  As far as the Dominions were concerned they all agreed there that they should do whatever they pleased with regard to their own nationals as to the status and the rights they gave them and any other obligations that they put on them, but there was the declaration that if it was desirable to keep that common status, to define that in an Act or series of Acts, that then care should be taken that they would not be conferring upon any person &ldquo;a status to be operative throughout the Commonwealth save in pursuance of legislation based upon common agreement.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I brought that Report home and it was discussed here.  The man who is now Vice-President of the State said then:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Common citizenship did not appeal to us.  To our mind, it was a degradation of our Irish citizenship and national status, and if the question of citizenship is to be settled in future we would rather have it settled on the basis of Irish citizenship dissociated from common citizenship with Great Britain, Australia and any other country. Irish citizenship and Irish nationality is good enough for us.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was echoed by others.  The man who is now Minister for Industry and Commerce threw aside with contempt the facilities available for Saorstát citizens when travelling abroad, in the way of being able to avail of the services of British Consuls.  In a whirlwind of words from which it is difficult to take any sense, Deputy MacEntee, now Minister for Finance, purported to agree with both the previous speakers.  That was the point of view in March, 1930: that we do not want anything except Irish nationality, and that, if we must have some declaration, then we are going to have a declaration mainly aiming at dissociation.  If people wave before us certain privileges which our nationals may get when travelling abroad, then we are going <Col N="347" /> to put those on one side as incompatible with our national dignity and status.  We are going to have that dignity and status and we want no privileges. Could not the President tell us if he approves of what the Vice-President then said, and whether he is going to carry out that programme of the Vice-President through the medium of this Bill?  That matter was discussed later in the 1930 Conference Report, which referred to nationality in this way:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The conclusions of the conference were as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1) That the conference affirms paragraphs 73 to 78 inclusive of the Report of the Conference on the Operation of Dominion Legislation.</P>
    <P>(2) That, if any changes are desired in the existing requirements for the common status, provision should be made for the maintenance of the common status, and the changes should only be introduced (in accordance with present practice) after consultation and agreement among the several members of the Commonwealth.</P>
    <P>(3) That it is for each member of the Commonwealth to define for itself its own nationals, but that, so far as possible, those nationals should be persons possessing the common status, though it is recognised that local conditions or other special circumstances may from time to time necessitate divergences from, this general principle.</P>
    <P>(4) That the possession of the common status in virtue of the law for the time being in force in any part of the Commonwealth should carry with it the recognition of that status by the law of every other part of the Commonwealth.</P>
    <P>That was also the subject of discussion in this House, and there were many and very interesting things said about it.  But the main gist of the remarks passed on that Report was that by accepting the various paragraphs, among them being those which I have read, that I was tying this country still more tightly into the framework of the British Empire, and the word &ldquo;Empire&rdquo; was not used without <Col N="348" /> advertence as to its meaning.  I was told in 1931 that no matter what I might say the power of the British Parliament to bind the people of this country was still there and that I was strengthening it.  Deputy MacEntee, as he then was, went so far as to commit himself to the statement that even in the matter of passports he knew that the King's prerogative still ran; that even in the matter of sending Ambassadors abroad that the King still ruled, and that behind the King on these matters was the British Parliament.</P>
    <P>The President to-night, with a show of triumph, said that we have established diplomatic missions abroad. Who did?  The continuity of the State is now apparent.  We are the successors of the people who, in fact, did it. What does the President think of his colleague who in those days of gloom and enforced ignorance said that the King still ruled and that the British Parliament still ruled behind the King? Does he now think that?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The biggest sidestep done in this is the avoidance of the question of what our nationals are going to do abroad.  Is there a recognition now that what was said in these debates in 1930 and 1931 on this very matter of our nationality was so much turgid rubbish that might have gone down at a crossroads but that certainly should never have been spoken here? The President thinks that this Bill is necessary because of our domestic needs.  In respect of what?  The electoral law, and in the matter of aircraft&mdash;certainly an immediate and dangerous emergency&mdash;and shipping. Surely there is no question of urgency so far as aircraft and shipping are concerned. Then as to our general economic policy.  That is a point.  We have nationals defined in four fairly recent Acts, but there never has been the same definition in any of them. None of the definitions corresponds with citizenship as declared in Article 3 or with citizenship as declared here. Will this in future override the definition of &ldquo;national&rdquo; in the control of Manufactures Act?  Will a national be <Col N="349" /> such a person as is here defined, or are we going to have, say, in regard to the control of industry in the country a further limitation: that you will admit not as nationals but as a group such nationals as have been here over a certain period?  Then the definition of national is not required for a general economic policy except to clarify matters by saying that we can admit all the people that we admit to citizenship to the privilege of running manufacturing industry in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The President said that many anomalies had occurred.  I wonder where are they?  Will there be anything so anomalous as the new situation, giving an original stock of citizens which depends upon birth, where either of the parents was Irish, and continuing citizenship only through the father?  Previously we admitted people who could not even boast of parentage on either side being Irish, but who were ordinarily resident in this country for a period of years.  For the future we are going to say that even the children of Irish natural-born fathers are not going to become citizens unless they register in a particular book and make their claim within a certain period.  Why that anomaly?  Why create it?  I do not know if there is any example in modern law of such a restriction.  As far as I know, certainly as far as the generality of nationality laws are concerned, they go the other way; the citizenship is left there, and it has got to be positively denounced or renounced before one loses it.  Has this measure paid attention to the points that were discussed in 1929 and 1930?  Is there now created here a citizenship which, if ever we have a common status with other members of the Commonwealth of Nations, will introduce into that common group people who previously would not have been admitted?  I certainly think it may happen under the naturalisation section.  If so, are we just without any thought to the matter at all repudiating the results of two conferences which our people attended?  It may be that there is a case to be made against it, but no such case has been made or presented <Col N="350" /> to the House.  It may be that the President does not think that clash will occur, but one would like to know whether attention has been paid to the matter; whether thought has been given to it; whether examination of the classes that might come in has been made, and some provision made hereafter for ensuring that some of those naturalised persons, if they did enlarge their old circle of the common group, will not be admitted to that particular status if the status should ever be agreed upon between ourselves and the other members.</P>
    <P>Section 21&mdash;I come back to it&mdash;is the important matter.  It may be that we have decided, without any argument made to the House, that when our nationals&mdash;as we have defined them here and as we will register them hereafter and get them recorded&mdash;go abroad, we will leave them to chance.  We cannot pretend that we are going to create consular establishments in all the places to which our people travel.  We cannot pretend that we are going to have even facilities, apart from protection, afforded through the medium of our own offices to our citizens travelling abroad.  What do we intend to do? Are we going to take the initiative with regard to conventions?  Are we going to take the initiative particularly with regard to conventions&mdash; if that clause is applicable at all to members of the British Commonwealth&mdash;with say England, where quite a number of our people are, and where quite a number of them go from time to time, or are we going to make some arrangement with some other country?  If so what is the other country?  What do we want our people labelled?  Is it advisedly that the situation has been left in the position that until the British repeal the 1914 Act in relation to our people in England our people can attach themselves to that and seek its shelter when they are in difficulty? If we are doing that advisedly, can we say that this Bill marks any advance upon the arrangements of the 1929 and 1930 conferences?  Remember that we derided them as being a degradation of the nationality of the <Col N="351" /> country.  It is surely the biggest point to be decided on in this measure.</P>
    <P>The privileges that people give to their own citizens at home are clearly a matter for themselves.  It only requires the placing of certain things on record in a Bill of this sort.  It only requires attention to one or two things&mdash;the electoral law, service on juries, etc.&mdash;and you get determined easily and without any argument all the rights and obligations to which you shall submit your own citizens when they are at home, whatever their class may be.  Nobody can say that the Bill is of any importance from that angle.  The real importance of that measure is its reactions in other countries.  How are we to dovetail into the international situation? How are we going to get protection or facility or intercourse for our nationals when they go abroad?  Is it by convention, and only by convention, or is the President going to do the double as usual, and say: &ldquo;I make you an Irish citizen here at home.  I repeal in its application to this country the British Nationality Act of 1914, but I am not going to move at all in regard to that Act in England.  I know it is made applicable to our citizens over there and certainly in my old days I considered it a degradation for any of them to avail themselves of the provisions of it.&rdquo;  The President may say that; it will certainly leave our citizens with some safeguard, but is it safeguarding the ideal that made himself and his group of Ministers&mdash;the Ministers who are now here&mdash;fume and rage when the 1929 and 1930 conferences came up for consideration?  It was considered almost treason to even talk of the possibility of any association of our citizens with the citizens, say, of Australia, South Africa and England, even though we were as distinct, one from the other, as a German from a Frenchman.  The Vice-President, as he is now, had then his clear-cut defined statement:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The only thing we want is dissociation of ourselves from the British.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="352" /> We can consider on this measure whether the President has given that clearly.  Certainly from anything which the President has said so far, I came to the conclusion that what he wants is to have still the situation which he has achieved; say, with regard to the passports:&mdash;&ldquo;Anybody can sign this; I will not do it, but somebody will do it under my orders and with my consent.  I know what flows from it&mdash;a request to the King with regard to protection.  Some of our people can go to England and claim that they are, when they get into difficulties, British subjects, in order to get the protection of that British Act.  They may, and I know that they will, when in difficulties, resort to it, but I will not make any open, clear or honourable arrangement with England with regard to the matter.  I will have nothing to do with any individual who puts himself into what I consider the abject position of being a British subject.  He can do it if he likes; I wash my hands of the whole thing.&rdquo;  In the form of the Bill I judge that attitude is there quite definitely, from the mere fact that the President to-day was silent about what his intentions are under the Convention Clause.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I confess I looked forward with some eagerness to the draft Citizenship Bill, about which we have heard so much for the last few months.  I was rather eager to see how the present Government would tackle a problem which was fraught with considerable difficulty, and which was indeed a problem than which there was no more difficult one facing any Government in this country under existing circumstances.  When I read the draft of this Bill I had nothing but feelings of disappointment because, when it is examined and put into its proper perspective, from the point of view of domestic law and international law, it becomes quite apparent that this Bill is perfectly harmless and perfectly innocuous, as a piece of domestic legislation, with little, if any, effect from the point of view of public international law.  Article III of the Constitution <Col N="353" /> created this legal status of Irish Free State citizenship.  That citizenship was a novel idea, not merely under international law but in the law of what is known as the British Commonwealth of Nations.  So far as I can understand this Bill, even with the President's explanation of the proposed Constitution (Amendment) Bill, it is nothing but an attempted extension of Article 3 of the Constitution and, in fact, so far as I can see, is not an extension of that Article at all.  Certainly, as it stands with reference to the text of Article 3 it in no way extends the underlying idea in that Article.</P>
      <P>Article 3 created nothing more or less than what I might call, for want of a better term, local citizenship.  In calling the status created under Article 3, local citizenship, I do some injustice to the brains of those people&mdash; perhaps I shall say of that man&mdash;who conceived Article 3.  It was a novel idea, contrived and conceived to fit a difficult situation which existed in the year 1922; a novel idea to fit into the framework of the Treaty and the Constitution, a conception of Irish nationality as a distinct international idea, totally distinct, and in no way antagonistic to the idea, of what is known, for want of a better term, as a British subject.  It was the first endeavour made by the framers of the Constitution to get within the framework of the Treaty recognition what we all regarded as our natural and inalienable birthright, our Irish nationality.  Article 3 was recognised by the legal advisers of the British Government as being entirely within the letter and spirit of the Treaty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is merely implementing Article 3 of the Constitution, which provided and contemplated that there should be legislation providing for the conditions of the future acquisition of citizenship.  This is the Bill contemplated by Article 3 of the Constitution. This Bill, therefore, does nothing more than regulate existing citizenship and the acquisition of future citizenship, within the meaning of Article 3, and of a type within <Col N="354" /> the definition of citizenship in Article 3 and, therefore, of a type recognised by the British in 1922 as being within the Treaty.  It marks, therefore, no advance of the position that obtained in 1922.  It entirely ignores the efforts of my colleague, Deputy McGilligan, and his colleagues, and the Conferences of 1929 and 1930, which got proper recognition of the idea and the ideal of Irish nationhood and Irish nationality within the framework of the Treaty, and its recognition, both in domestic law, in the law running throughout the British Commonwealth of Nations, and in public and private international law.</P>
    <P>A very strenuous effort, as the President may learn, if he peruses the records of the Imperial Conferences of 1929 and 1930, was made to get from our confreres in the British Commonwealth of Nations a recognition of Irish nationality as something which sprang from our own nationhood, to reconcile it with what is known as the common status, and to provide by means of agreement the benefits which would accrue to us from a recognition of that common status without in any way prejudicing our Irish nationality.  That was a very difficult task.  I may say that it was the most difficult task that confronted the delegates of this country at the Imperial Conferences of 1929 and 1930.  As the President's advisers will tell him, and as he will see from the records, it was a topic which caused more bitterness between this country and the British Government, and the British delegates, than any topic discussed from 1926 to 1930.  Very considerable progress was made during these conferences.  Few people recognise the work that was put into the getting of those paragraphs which were so much decried in 1930 by members of the Fianna Fáil Party, now the Government Party, or the valuable statements that are implicit, or contained explicitly in the Imperial Conferences Reports of 1929 and 1930.  We might state that jurists from the other Dominions in the British Commonwealth of Nations recognised at the end of 1929, and were fully convinced in 1930, of the truth of the statements that <Col N="355" /> were put forward by Deputy McGilligan, who was then Minister for External Affairs, that the British Commonwealth of Nations was not a Commonwealth of British Nations; that there were different nationalities comprised in it; that the nationality of each of these nations should be recognised nationally and internationally; and that the recognition of that separate nationality was in no way inconsistent with the regulation of the common status which existed throughout the British Commonwealth of Nations.</P>
    <P>Each one of these jurists and each delegate who attended the conferences of 1929 and 1930, largely as a result of Deputy McGilligan's advocacy, recognised that this country was a mother country in the same way as Great Britain was a mother country; that it had a separate nationality which ought to be recognised nationally and internationally; and that the only problem left in 1930 to solve, was to provide a basis of agreement between this country and Great Britain as to recognition of our separate Irish nationality, from the point of view of international law and get the benefits, without prejudicing our Irish nationality, of being what is known, for want of a better term, a British subject, referred to in these conference reports as the common status existing throughout the British Commonwealth of Nations.  We should be entitled to expect that the present Government would have made some progress along that path.  Great progress was made by the last Government in that direction.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised with the <Col N="356" /> Minister for Justice to-day a question with regard to incitements to violence publicly distributed in the Dublin streets on the 20th and 21st October; violent attacks made on persons in the Dublin streets particularly on the 4th November; the neglect of the police authorities to intervene satisfactorily on these occasions to prevent the breaking of the law, and to protect persons carrying out their legal rights on the streets of the City of Dublin.  The answer given to the question to-day by the Minister for Justice raises a very important question.  I raise this matter now to give the Minister an opportunity of further clarifying to the House and to the people generally what he is going to do to prevent a continuance of this type of disorder and to prevent its development; the failure of the State to prevent the distribution of leaflets inciting to disorder; the failure to stop these incitements to disorder; the failure of the police to prevent the subsequent attacks on citizens and their failure to deal with the persons carrying on this disorder so much so that it indicates the abdication by the Minister for Justice of that primary duty which falls on him as Minister for Justice and the failure of the police to carry out their primary function. The facts are that on the 24th September the police authorities gave a permit, which had been applied for, to hold a flag day collection for the Fine Gael Party.  Copies of the following leaflet were then distributed:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Dublin Workers! Fellow Republicans ! Remember the 77.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The murder gang of 1922&mdash; Cosgrave, Mulcahy, Blythe and their rancher allies&mdash;are holding a flag day in Dublin this week-end.  The men who obeyed British orders and attacked the Republic in '22, the men who murdered the 77, now dare to ask you to subscribe to their funds. They want funds to organise the Fascist dictatorship, to renew their campaign of murder.  Off the streets with the Blueshirt-Fascists! Not a penny must be given to traitors. support the united front of Republican <Col N="357" /> and working class forces.  Forward to the Republic.  Join the Republican Congress.  Issued by the Dublin Council, Republican Congress.</P>
    <P>Now I want to ask the Minister for Justice is he going to allow public incitements of that kind to violence against persons to continue on the streets of Dublin?  He must be aware that following his non-intervention in the distribution of leaflets inciting to violence on the 20th and 21st October similar incitements to violence against other persons have since been distributed on the streets of Dublin.  An explicit answer is due to this House and to the people generally.  Is the Government going to allow incitements to violence in the streets of Dublin and elsewhere to continue?  If the Minister is determined that acts of that kind will not be allowed, these acts can be stopped.</P>
    <P>Again, on Sunday, 4th November, persons selling flags and wearing flags in O'Connell Street were attacked. The attacks began in a small way at 12 o'clock when two men were attacked by a small body.  There was no interference on the part of the police with the attackers.  The result was that the disturbance grew and continued, and by two o'clock, the centre of the city was an area of disturbance.  There were small attacks around Phibsboro' and attacks and disturbance took place at Fairview. But the centre of the city was made a scene of pandemonium.  A mob of 200 attacked a number of people and beat them badly.  Quite a number of those attacked had to be attended to in the hospitals and, as I told the Minister to-day, and he must know it himself, nine men and ten women were injured very severely in these attacks.</P>
    <P>Subsequently the headquarters of the Fine Gael organisation at 5 Parnell Square had for the fourth time its windows broken by a stone-throwing mob.  At no time in O'Connell Street was there any serious attempt made to give protection <Col N="358" /> either to the people wearing the flags or selling the flags.  There was no arrest made in O'Connell Street.  One of the victims of the attackers, a girl, who while not selling flags was wearing a flag, went to the assistance of other flag sellers. This girl got a blow on the side of her face and had her teeth broken. she held on to her attacker until she put him safely into the arms of a policeman only to have him released.</P>
    <P>I want a clear statement from the Minister as to whether he is going to see that persons who are carrying out work which they are legally entitled to carry out on the streets of Dublin, are going to get the protection of the police?  In my opinion it is not necessary to mobilise a large force of police or to throw any special burden upon the Gárdaí in order to prevent attacks of this particular kind.  What is wanted is a clear understanding that the Government is not going to tolerate these attacks, and that they are going to punish persons guilty of them.  We want to know from the Minister, too, whether the Government is going to allow a group of persons, known to the police under the name of the &ldquo;Dublin Council Republican Congress,&rdquo; to issue inflammatory statements of this kind, to organise persons to distribute them through the City of Dublin, and to organise mobs to carry out violence on Dublin citizens?  The Minister is responsible for giving the people, carrying out their lawful work on the streets of the city, the protection that they claim.  If the Minister is not going to see that that violence is stopped, then the Minister is neglecting his responsibility.  He is neglecting his responsibility knowing full well to what his neglect in this matter is going to lead.  The Minister has already had his attention drawn to statements made on this matter by the President, following a long series of destructive raids carried out by the I.R.A. The President's Press, the <i>Irish Press</i>, of the 18th September, 1933, had this statement in its leading article:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="359" />&ldquo;One of the fundamental rights of every citizen is the protection of himself and his property against violence.  If those chosen by the people to govern fail in giving that protection they fail in everything; they cease to perform the first duty given them by the community...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...And if any Government were to say to any section of the people: `We regret we must deny you the protection to which you have a right,' it would at that moment cease to govern, and the community whom the Administration had thus failed would have no alternative but to set up private defence forces of its own.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The President himself goes even further, and, in connection with violent disorder organised against members of the United Ireland Party in Tralee some time ago, he is reported in his own Press as declaring:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Government could not permit such conduct to go on.  Any failure on its part to maintain order and to punish persons guilty of disorderly acts would inevitably result in anarchy and civil war.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister was dealing yesterday with a case in which a number of farmers violently asserted their rights to be present at a public auction, and he had no hesitation in declaring that the police were perfectly within their rights in shooting down these men.  Here we have a body of men in Dublin, known to the police, organising violent attacks on persons lawfully carrying on certain activities in the city, and no action is taken by him to prevent these acts being organised or to prevent them being carried out when organised.  His reply to-day on the question of incitement to violence was that he did not think any useful purpose would be served by instituting prosecutions against persons who publicly incited to violence on the streets or who organised violence from their offices.  And turmoil in the centre of the City of Dublin&mdash;which <Col N="360" /> lasted for over two hours, from 12 noon to 2 o'clock on a Sunday &mdash;is described as &ldquo;isolated attacks here and there&rdquo; and that &ldquo;nobody was seriously injured!&rdquo; As I say, arising out of none of the disorders on that Sunday was any arrest made nor were any charges brought against anybody.</P>
    <P>The Minister must realise where this is leading to.  I speak not only on behalf of the Party that was organising this collection, but on behalf of any other organisation in the city or in this country that wants to carry out lawful business publicly.  It is interesting to recall, however, with regard to the Party that was organising this collection in the North and the South City, that at the last elections they gained in the South City 28,700 votes as against 31,900 votes for the Minister's Party, and that in the North City the Fianna Fáil Party and its Labour allies had 39,326 votes and the anti-Fianna Fáil vote was 36,689.  So that here we have a political organisation, representing nearly 50 per cent, of the population of the city, being attacked violently and in an organised way in the city, and the Minister has nothing to say to-day but that it was an isolated thing; that the police did their best to stop it; and that no useful purpose would be served by taking any steps to prevent persons organising violence of this type.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows what this is leading to.  If he does not, he ought to consult the people who write these articles in the <i>Irish Press</i>, and he ought to consult the President, who says that</P>
    <P>&ldquo;any failure on the part of the Government to maintain order and to punish persons guilty of disorderly acts would inevitably result in anarchy and civil war.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister must understand that those of us who consider that it is our duty to carry on political work in the City of Dublin in connection with our Party are not going to be beaten off the streets by any mob of this kind. We want to know where we stand with regard to the police if we are driven to take steps to protect ourselves <Col N="361" /> against violence of this kind, and we want to know whether the Minister is going to shoulder his responsibility in the matter and relieve us of the responsibility of organising our own protection against violence of this kind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Ruttledge)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think I can add very much to the answer I gave to the Deputy to-day, except to repeat that my information from the police is that there was nothing that they could see in the way of an organised attack on that particular day; that they were isolated attacks, and that nobody was seriously injured.  From the information I have received, it is not correct for the Deputy to state that there was no protection afforded in O'Connell Street.  As a matter of fact, an incident had occurred at the corner of Cathedral Street and O'Connell Street at which the police were present and gave the necessary protection. As I pointed out, in answer to the Deputy to-day, in anticipation of any violence that might be used against the people who were, as is admitted, legally entitled to carry on this flag day and who were acting in accordance with what they were entitled to do&mdash;in anticipation of that and in view of our experience of the difficulty of securing peace at their meetings, the police took every possible precaution that they could take to prevent any attacks on those people who were carrying out the flag day collection and to protect them in every way possible.</P>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to what was done.  There were all those police engaged in it.  There were also patrols through the city, and a motor car petrol.  I have no hesitation in stating to the Deputy that, so far as lies in our power, we are going to see that anybody who is about what they are legally entitled to do will get all the protection the State can give.  I have no hesitation whatever in making that statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only other matter that I can see that the Deputy has anything to complain <Col N="362" /> about is this question where I stated that the Government did not think that any useful purpose would be served by those prosecutions&mdash;at this stage.  It does not follow from that, that if, as a result of inciting statements made by anybody, an organised attempt is being made, these things cannot be dealt with after they happen; but the Deputy will realise the difficulties of dealing with some statement, that might be considered inciting, by some people who may have an exaggerated idea of their own strength and importance&mdash;reckless statements and so on&mdash;and all these things have to be considered.  For months back we have been hearing and seeing inciting statements made here on the Deputy's own side.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Let the Minister deal with this and let him deal with the others in the way he thinks they ought to be dealt with.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the difficulties in dealing with inciting statements is that one has to judge what importance can be attached to them and what results from them.  The Deputy's present leader in the League of Youth, last July, at a place called Ballinure, in County Tipperary, at a meeting held to celebrate the release of a man called James J. Dwyer from Arbour Hill Barracks, made use of the following language:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;James Dwyer was convicted on the information of some spy in Tipperary.  We have members of the Police Force ear-marked and when we get into power we will know how to deal with them, to relegate them to their proper place.  I warn the police now that any of them that are doing the dirty work for a tyannical Government would find themselves where they are now trying to put others...  If we are persecuted and driven to it we may have to resort to arms, and what we did in three months in 1922, we can do again and teach them a lesson they will never forget.  De Valera had spoken about a dictatorship, <Col N="363" /> but I say here to-night that if a dictatorship is necessary for the Irish people, we are going to have one.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>No action was taken on that.  There are a number of other statements every other day through the country, and while that statement at that time might not have assumed much importance, to-day perhaps, or at a later period, it may have assumed very great importance in the light of the events that have happened since that <Col N="364" /> statement was made.  In the same way, I do not place much reliance on certain statements, such as the Deputy has referred to, when they have not resulted in any organised attack, and I do not think they have much influence.</P>
