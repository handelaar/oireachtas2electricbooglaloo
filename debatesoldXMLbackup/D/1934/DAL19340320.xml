      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the President if he will state when the report of the Commissioner of the Gárda Síochána on Communism in Ireland, that he promised on March 1st to lay on the Table of the Dáil, will be made available for or circulated to members of the Dáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>In course of debate on 1st March when reading a brief summary of the report referred to, I stated, in reply to an interruption by the Deputy, that the report, if necessary, could be placed on the Table of the House.</P>
      <P>I have since given this matter the most careful consideration, and I think and am advised that it is not in the public interest that a confidential police document of this nature should be published.</P>
      <P>I hope that it will be sufficient to make the full report available in confidence to Leaders of the Parties in the House.</P>
      <P>If, despite the consideration of public interest, however, Deputies press for it, I shall fulfil the promise I gave.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the President is he not aware that, although he answered me that he would if necessary make the report available, he gave a specific and formal undertaking to Deputy Dillon that that report would be made available.  He said now in the last part of his reply <Col N="1090" /> that if insisted upon he would make the report available, while it was on the specific promise that he made that he was permitted to read out what purported to be a general indication of the contents of the report.  If he does say that if insisted upon he will make it available, then I propose to insist upon it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>My reply to Deputy Fitzgerald on that occasion was as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I am going to give a summary&mdash; a statement with regard to counties &mdash;and the report, if necessary, can be put on the Table of the House.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That was in answer to Deputy Fitzgerald's question.  Later on Deputy Dillon interjected:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The President will publish the full report?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>and to that I answered:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The full report will be laid on the Table of the House for Deputies to read.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is exactly what I said.  I shall repeat the last portion of my reply to-day: &ldquo;If, despite the consideration of public interest, however, Deputies press for it, I shall fulfil the promise I gave.&rdquo;  I take it from Deputy Fitzgerald, as representing the Opposition, that they are pressing for it, in which case I shall fulfil my promise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make it plain that the Opposition are not prepared to take any responsibility for deciding whether the particular report ought or ought not, in the public interest, to be published.  The President was of opinion, apparently, a couple of weeks ago, that it could be <Col N="1091" /> placed on the Table of the House without damage to the public interest, and it is the responsibility of the Government to come to a decision on that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy Leader of the Opposition was not in the House when I read the reply I should like to read it again.  (Reply read again).  After I read this reply, I understood from Deputy Fitzgerald that he is pressing for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>There are various aspects of public interest.  I should like to ask the President does he think that it is in the public interest for members of the Government to come into this House, and&mdash;by giving promises which, apparently, it is not intended to fulfil&mdash;to put themselves in a position to be able to give what purports to be the contents of confidential documents and then, in the words of the President, &ldquo;since that&rdquo;&mdash;which means thereafter&mdash;to give the matter consideration and to decide that it is not in the public interest.  I propose, Sir, raising this matter on the adjournment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply, I want to say in the nature of things it is almost certain to be necessary&mdash;for the Government, no matter what Government is in office, to assure Deputies of the House, when questions of public importance are raised, by giving them summaries of the information which the Government receive through the police authorities.  I think that is almost certain.  Now the question is whether, in accordance with the rules of the House, the Government or the Executive are to be prevented from doing that unless they give the whole of the confidential report.  I was giving a summary, and I made it clear by the two statements that if necessary &mdash;hoping that the Deputies who had experience of public affairs would not demand it and make it necessary&mdash;the full report would be laid on the Table of the House.  In the second place, I qualified my statement again by saying &ldquo;for Deputies to read.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now I understand that putting it on the Table of the House means that it is <Col N="1092" /> available for publication.  That is one of the considerations which make me suggest to the Opposition Parties that they should be content with having a full copy of the report made available for the leaders.  If, however, that offer is not accepted and I am pressed, as apparently, I am, for publication, and to keep definitely to the letter of my promise I am prepared to do it, still holding as before that in my opinion it is not in the public interest that it should be done, and that it would be better left undone.  Still there are other aspects of public interest, too, and if I am pressed I would regard that as being an overriding factor.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>I am of opinion, Sir, from what I can gather with regard to the character of this document and the allusions made in it to individual persons in various parts of the country that it would be against public interest, and would hamper the work of the Civic Guards, if it were published.  Therefore, I am not prepared to press the President to publish it in accordance with his promise. I agree with Deputy Fitzgerald that the question of the use of such documents in this House is one which demands ventilation, and I welcome the fact that he proposes to raise the matter on the adjournment.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he will state (a) the number of licensed premises that have been closed under the provisions of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1927, from the date of the passing of the Act up to the end of 1933; (b) the amount of the compensation which has been paid to the former licensees, and (c) the number of licences that have lapsed in the same period irrespective of the operation of the Act.</P>

(c) Exact information on this point is not available in my Department, but it would appear that in the year 1932 there were 609 fewer applications for renewals than in 1928. The figures for 1933 are not yet in my possession.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Geological examination of the Muckross barytes lode was made by the Geological Survey in 1919, which, I am advised, suggested the existence of a considerable body of barytes there.  The development of the deposits is a matter primarily for private enterprise, and if the Deputy is aware of any group or groups in a position to undertake effectively the reopening of the mines, I will be glad to provide every assistance within my power to further the matter.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he is aware of the excessive retail prices, having regard to the prices paid to the producers, charged in various parts of the country for eggs, fresh meat, bacon and milk; whether any representations have been made to him in regard to the matter and if he is prepared to make a submission to the Prices Commission requesting them to investigate the retail prices of these commodities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of referring the prices charged for eggs and milk has not arisen as the result of complaints made.  On the general question as to whether the prices charged for those products should be referred by me without any preliminary complaint, I am not prepared to make any statement.  The Prices Commission have a number of investigations <Col N="1095" /> in progress at the moment, and I think it would be desirable that these investigations should be completed before new subjects are brought to their notice.</P>

      <P>The recruitment and training of a sufficient number of suitable staff for the work of investigating and calculating the means of the large number of applicants for certificates at the inception of the Act would have been very expensive and would have made it impossible to bring into operation on the 1st March, 1934, that portion of the Act relating to applications for and issue of qualification certificates. This work has, therefore, been undertaken by the Gárda Síochána for the present.  I am not aware of any cases in which the Gárdaí have made the investigations referred to in the question, but if the Deputy will furnish particulars of the specific cases I shall have enquiries made in the matter and communicate further with him.  It is intended to have the means of applicants investigated by civil servants as soon as officers of the necessary qualifications can be recruited.</P>

After he had received payment of 28 days' benefit, payment had to be suspended pending the investigation of certain irregularities which had come to the knowledge of the Department.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;  Its purpose is to make provision for regulating and controlling the export of sheepskins from the Saorstát and, arising therefrom, to revive the fellmongering industry in the Saorstát. Fellmongers are persons who treat sheepskins in such a manner as to separate the wool from the pelts. During the European War the industry was in a very flourishing condition here.  It provided a considerable amount of employment to male labour, both skilled and unskilled.  The principal fellmongering firms were situated in Dublin, Cork, Carlow, Limerick, Mullingar, Mallow and Clonmel.  During that period these firms worked all the sheepskins that were available. The satisfactory state of the industry then was due directly to the prohibition which was in operation on the export of skins, but since that prohibition was removed the industry has declined and the majority of fellmongers are either closed down or working part-time.  In fact, only three firms are now engaged in the industry &mdash;two in Dublin and one in Limerick.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The decline of the industry was due directly to the inability of Saorstát fellmongers to purchase sheepskins in competition with cross-Channel buyers. There are a number of reasons for that inability of Saorstát fellmongers, apart <Col N="1103" /> from the fact that the English firms in this business are much stronger financially and operate on a much larger scale.  The skins bought here by these British firms are, of course, a very small proportion of the total of sheepskins bought by them.  For various reasons, also, the pelts treated in certain parts of Great Britain command a somewhat higher price on certain markets, and for that reason English fellmongers are occasionally able to pay higher prices for skins and they have, apparently, been operating a consistent policy in this country, which has resulted in the practical suppression of the industry here.</P>
    <P>It is, therefore, proposed under this Bill to prohibit the export of sheepskins and thereby, to make available for fellmongers in the Saorstát the raw material necessary to revive their industry.  It is estimated that employment will be found for a number of men in consequence.  There is no question that the Saorstát fellmongers can work all the skins that are available, but even if they cannot do so, provision is made in the Bill to permit the export, under licence, of any surplus. At the present time, the firms which are working&mdash;the three firms to which I have referred&mdash;are operating only to, approximately, one-sixth of their capacity, and it is estimated that the total quantity of skins is, roughly, from 20,000 to 25,000 a week.  The effect of the operation of the measure will be to reduce somewhat the prices paid for sheepskins.  It may be argued that the prohibition of the export of sheepskins, therefore, will have a bearing on the price of sheep.  There is no reason to believe that the Saorstát farmer will be affected by the Bill as the price of sheep will continue to be governed by the export prices.  Any reduction in the price of sheepskins would fall on the butchers who, however, cannot be said to be in an unfavourable position at the present time.  There is a ready market for pelts in Great Britain and the Continent, and no difficulty in disposing of the products of the industry is anticipated.  The pelts prepared in the Saorstát will be available for export as there are as yet no light tanneries <Col N="1104" /> in the country.  Any loss in the export trade will, therefore, be more than compensated for by the increased export of pelts.  The licensing provisions of the Bill can also be operated, if necessary, to prevent any attempt to depress, unduly, the price of sheepskins here.  In addition the Bill will permit of the export in the months of June, July and August of the skins of shearlings which are not worked by the fellmongers.  The measure is a simple one.  Its provisions can easily be understood.  I have outlined the manner in which it is proposed to utilise the powers conferred by the Bill.  The matter has been very carefully considered and discussed at a number of conferences with all the interested parties.  The measure before the Dáil is the outcome of these discussions.</P>

      <P>The extraordinary thing about that reply is that it discloses the extraordinary mentality of the present Government as regards the farming community.  The Minister says that the Bill will not have any effect on prices so far as the farmers are concerned.  He said it may affect the butchers.  It is the first time I learned that butchers are philanthropists.  It seems an extraordinary thing to see a Bill like this introduced and to see that the farmers are to get it in the neck every time.  If the Minister can show us how a serious reduction in the price of skins is not going to effect a reduction in the price of sheep I would be glad to know from him how he arrives at that conclusion.  The farmers in this country are anxious for industries, but I think there should be some assurance given to them that if industries are to be started here they must be able to compete with other countries.  It is not fair that farmers should be curtailed in the price of their sheep in order to start an industry here that is not able to live on its merits or on the merits of its work.  What strikes me as extraordinary <Col N="1105" /> is that the fellmongers in this country have this advantage: they are more favourably placed with regard to cost of the transport of the skins, the raw product.  One would imagine that that would mean putting them in the position that they would be able to pay as good a price as the people beyond the water.  I think a question like this that affects the farmers so much as 20,000 to 25,000 sheepskins a week is very important.  In the present condition of the live-stock trade I think it is a deplorable thing that any steps should be taken that would affect the farmers in that way.  I think the Minister ought to consider whether the industry is really worth the hardship it will inflict on the farming community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I was surprised that the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who shows periodical signs of being a business man, should bring in such a measure.  I am sure he is laughing to himself when telling us of these conferences that he had with agricultural representatives on this Bill.  I remember some years ago&mdash;when the policy here was not so favourable to wheat growing as the present policy of the Government&mdash;being on a deputation who met in conference representatives of the Department of Agriculture.  We certainly urged the case for more wheat growing.  But all the big guns of the Department flattened us out, the very same big guns that are now behind the Minister for Agriculture supporting wheat growing.  Civil Servants like all servants will stand by their boss.  In this case the Minister told the poor civil servant: &ldquo;You represent agriculture, but you must represent it the way I want it,&rdquo; and he has faithfully carried out orders. Is not that the position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce wants the House to believe that prohibiting the export of sheepskins with perhaps 10 lbs. or 12 lbs. of wool on the skin will not materially affect the price of skins or the price of sheep.  I am afraid that if there is such a great demand for sheepskins in Great Britain and the Continent we will reach the time when the skin will be the most valuable part of <Col N="1106" /> the sheep.  I wonder did the Minister consult the butchers and ask them would it affect their trade if the export of the skins was prohibited? A butcher goes into the market and puts a value on the hide of the sheep just as he puts a value on the best of the loin chops and he expects to get some of his expenses out of the skin naturally.  If he does not get that, or if there is a loss through any diminution in the value of the skin because of the passage of this Bill, is it not quite obvious that the butcher must lose; is it not quite obvious that the man who sells the sheep must lose or that the public must pay more for the mutton?  Somebody must lose.  The Minister instead of singling out 20,000 or 25,000 sheepskins a week should have put some money value on those.</P>
    <P>It is all very well to get some people into employment here and there, but I am afraid it will work out like the market that the Minister for Agriculture got, a few pounds of butter here and a few eggs there and a few pounds of meat somewhere else.  You must get something substantial.  Though I am 100 per cent. protectionist, I doubt if this thing is a business proposition at the present time, and more especially so when the value of the sheep has gone down.  The Minister will reply to this and he will quote <i>The Farmer and Stock Breeder</i> about prices, but I want to anticipate the Minister and tell him that there is an artificial increase in the price of sheep in Europe as well as here at present. There has been a diminution in the sheep population here because since the Minister became Minister lambs have been taken in exchange for two ounces of twist.  The farmers got out of breeding sheep to a large extent. But the diminution in the sheep population and the consequent rise in prices owing to the shortage elsewhere have artificially put up the price of mutton.</P>
    <P>He should have taken the House more into his confidence by showing the capacity, the outlet, the possibilities of this trade here.  He might have told us if in normal times this would be a good business proposition.  I submit for the Minister's consideration that in <Col N="1107" /> the abnormal times through which we are passing he might defeat the ends he has in view.  There is nothing as dangerous as to tackle a useful job at the wrong time, and if he cuts down the price of the commodity we have at a time when the price for that commodity is low, and puts on a certain tax in order to build up an industry somewhere else, it may poison public opinion.  He is certainly going to face failure and he may poison public opinion against attempting the job under more favourable circumstances. The Minister should not pursue this project.  He has not made a case why the butcher should suffer, why the farmer who produces the sheep should suffer, or why the public should pay more for their meat.  All three things may happen.  He has not told us what increased employment there will be or what chances there will be for the export of dressed sheepskins.  If he thinks that dressing them will provide a profitable national asset, would he not consider it advisable to fix a price for the sheepskins here not less favourable than the price they are getting for them at present?  Will he not fix a price bearing some relation to the existing price in the British market?</P>
    <P>If he is determined to go through with his Bill he should make arrangements with the factories that will work the raw material into a manufactured article so that they will take the raw material at a price that will compare favourably with British prices.  If he does so the producers of the skins here will not suffer any loss.  If he acts otherwise he is going to take something very definite away from the producers. The producers of sheepskins are not in such circumstances that they can look forward to becoming millionaires either in this world or in the next.  The Minister should make sure that they will get as good a price for the raw material as could be obtained in Great Britain.  If he gives us that assurance I might consider the Bill wise and opportune; but if the Minister cannot guarantee that, I do not think it could be considered an opportune measure.  It is very unwise to have interference with the natural flow <Col N="1108" /> of industry.  In this case we are concerned with the production of sheepskins, a by-product of mutton.  The people handling the sheepskins will make sure that the apparent loss will be greater.  I believe the loss to the producer will be greater than perhaps this innovation would warrant.  I suggest that the Minister should withdraw the Bill or otherwise see that the sheepskin producers are not going to suffer any loss.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Belton has made a very useful suggestion when he proposes that there should be an understanding with the fellmongers that a competitive price would be paid. If there are to be only three buyers of sheepskins in the Saorstát it is obvious an arrangement between them could bring down the price of sheepskins to a very insignificant figure.  As the Minister has met the fellmongers already, I would like if he would tell us whether they have given any guarantee or whether any understanding has been come to between him and them as to the maintenance of a reasonable price for sheepskins.  It is all right to say the price of sheep will not be affected since that is controlled by the demand for export.  I do not altogether accept that statement.  I think the price of sheep is governed by the competition between those who buy for the home market and those who buy for the export market.  If those who buy for the home market have to take into account that the skins they will have left after the slaughter of the sheep will have to be sold at a much less price than formerly, obviously the price they will offer will have to be somewhat less than would ordinarily prevail.  In any case I think the fellmongers hardly deserve to be offered such a big concession as this, a concession which practically amounts to a present of the raw material for their industry.  I suggest the Minister should give us some guarantee on the question of prices.</P>

      <P>This Bill seems to be objectionable in principle because it appears to amount to a concealed subsidy to one particular class of the community at the expense of another class; in this instance to the domestic buyers <Col N="1109" /> of sheepskins&mdash;fellmongers&mdash;at the expense of the farmers.  I would suggest to the Minister that if he wishes to revive the trade to which he refers it should be done, not at the expense of the farmers alone, but at the expense of the community, and that such direct grant should be given from public money as may be found necessary to make it possible for the trade to be revived and to encourage persons interested in it.  I feel that at any time, and particularly at a time when the farming community has suffered and is suffering such hardships as at present, a Bill which selects them as the victims to subsidise a new industry or a revived industry ought not to be passed by this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I know very little about sheep and less about sheepskins. so that it is merely from the economic point of view I rise to ask the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will make clear a couple of points that I have not been able to gather from his introductory remarks.  I assume that it is quite evident that when the fell-mongers here are finished dressing the skins and they are brought over to the other side or wherever they are exported to, they will cost more. Sheepskins, or dressed sheepskins, apparently, are going to cost more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister for Industry and Commerce has he considered whether there are alternative sources of supply for sheepskins, and if people who are using sheepskins have any alternative material because, at the present time, the industry is conducted on very narrow margins.  I can envisage a very small increase in the cost of the supply of raw material&mdash;because that is what dressed sheepskins are to the trade that are using them up&mdash;bringing in an alternative source of supply, or bringing in quite another material to be used.  It looks, on the face of it, as if we were going to get away with the dressing of 25,000 sheepskins per week in this country.  If that is so, and if somebody here is not going to get less for their part of the whole, it is all right; but quite apart from whether the farmer is going to get less for the sheep, or the butcher to get less for <Col N="1110" /> the sheepskin, or who is going to suffer over here, there is the still further and bigger question, I submit, of whether we can add to the price of dressed sheepskins and hold our market.  That is the important part of the question, and as the Minister for Industry and Commerce probably has the sources of information at his disposal, I should like to ask him to make that abundantly clear; namely, that we have not, in trying to get something extra, lost what we have got already.  If we can better our position it is all to the good, but are we endangering the whole source of export for our sheepskins from this market?  I should like the Minister to make that perfectly clear in his reply.</P>

I thought that, in making a statement to us, he would tell us something as to the use to be made of the sheepskins in this country and as to the extra wool to be kept here, but I find now that his statement is completely empty of anything like that.  Taking the actual contents of the Bill and the Minister's statement on it, I feel that it is a very poor tribute to this great industrial spirit that the Minister's policy is supposed to have stirred up in the country.  He gives me the impression of holding a sucking-bottle to some very anæmic industrialist's mouth and doing it in such a gingerly way as to suggest that he wished he had not such a small baby to hold, or one that looked so unpromising.  The Minister simply tells us that he is going to prevent the export of sheepskins with the wool on and that the wool is going to be taken off here; that then the wool is to be sent out of the country and the skeepskins also, and that it is going to result in the employment of a few people in the country.</P>

However, taking his statement with regard to the question of reduction in price alone, I think the House is <Col N="1111" /> entitled to hear something as to the number of people employed in fellmongering at the moment and the number of people who will be employed with regard to the whole of our skin supply.  I understand that about 1,000,000 skins are available and that about two-thirds of that quantity are exported with the wool on.  Do we understand that by keeping these skins in the country for that purpose the employment in the fellmongering industry is going to be increased by twice the amount at present employed? If so, what is the number likely to be employed?  If each of the, let us say, 660,000 skins supposed to be exported at the present time are going to be paid for at, say, a shilling less, it is going to cost some people, below the top fringe of the farming community, something like £33,000 a year.  Deputy MacDermot suggests that it would be more reasonable to give a direct subsidy for the improvement of this industry.  I should like to know whether the Minister would feel happy in coming to the Dáil to propose that a direct subsidy of £33,000 or £35,000, or a little more, should be given annually for the development of the fellmongering industry alone here.  I do not think the Minister would do that, but, at any rate, in putting a proposition before the House which definitely indicates that he is definitely going to use the powers that he is taking in this Bill for the improvement of the fellmongering industry, I think the House ought to be told what the Minister has in mind with regard to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the losses, it has to be borne in mind that within the last few years the price for these skins has fallen very considerably.  The Minister's own figures tell us that the skins exported with the wool on, in 1932, brought in only, approximately, half the price per hundredweight of the skins that were exported two years before that, and that there was a fall in that year also compared with the previous year.  There has been a considerable fall, according to the figures quoted by the Minister himself, and I should like to know is there going to <Col N="1112" /> be an additional fall of 1/- per pelt. I understand that the price received for pelts, say, from January to May, in any normal year, would be about 6/-.  Is there going to be a reduction of 1/- on that, and are we, who expected something different from the Minister as regards the development here of the actual use of the wool and the actual use of the sheepskins themselves, to understand from the Minister that he sees nothing in this proposal that is going to create additional employment around the wool that is going to be separated from the skins here, or around the skins that are going to be prepared?  Are they all going to be exported?</P>

      <P>The question of the number of people who might be employed under this Bill is a very important matter, but that is a question, which, to my mind, it is impossible to discuss, because we have not received from the Minister any real indication of the possible numbers that might be imported.  What does strike me very forcibly about it is this, that in this country we have very large tracts of land which are only suitable for, and can only support, sheep, and the unfortunate people who own these lands have been very extensively hit already, and are not in a position to bear any further burden.  It seems to me that this Bill will, of necessity, put the whole burden on their shoulders, because, after all is said and done, the price of sheep is affected by the value of the skin, and the skin value is entirely affected by two things; one, the time of the year when the sheep is killed and the skin taken off, which depends entirely on how many months' growth of wool; and, secondly, on the particular time of year that the skin is sold.  I have had very many years' experience of this, and I know that the price of the skin depends entirely on the amount of wool on the skin, and that does affect the price of the sheep.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that the whole burden is going to be chiefly borne by those who cannot support anything on their land except sheep, and also by other farmers who rear sheep as well as other stock.  I think it is a matter that <Col N="1113" /> requires very careful consideration.  I should like to mention that, although I have the highest regard and respect for the officials of the Department of Agriculture, this is a matter that goes very deep.  I should like to know what the sheep farmers in County Wicklow and in other places in Ireland, where they depend practically entirely on sheep, think of this matter.  I should like to know if they have been consulted.</P>

      <P>I should like to know if the figures which the Minister gave are export figures only, and can he give us any indication of the total production; how much is the home consumption of those skins and what uses they are put to.  Did he consult any outsiders or was the consultation on behalf of industry with his Department and on behalf of agriculture with the Department of Agriculture?  If he did consult any outside interests, why did he not consult agricultural private interests if he consulted industrial private interests?  Was the consultation altogether confined to the two Departments consulting with one another?</P>

      <P>I think Deputies who have been preaching day in and day out that the price of any agricultural product of which there is an exportable surplus is determined by the export price should not run away from their teaching so rapidly as they have done to-day.  If there was one thing which the Party opposite seemed to regard as an axiom, something beyond contention, it was the statement which they so frequently made that where there is an exportable surplus the price on the export market determines the price at home.  Either they are completely wrong in that or else they are completely wrong to-day, because if, as their earlier assertions would lead us to believe, the export price where there is a surplus determines the home price, then this Bill cannot affect the price of sheep by one red <Col N="1114" /> penny.  I think anyone who gives the matter a moment's consideration will see that that is so.  There is a large exportable surplus of sheep.  Sheep are exported with the skins on them and the price at which sheep will be purchased will be determined by the price at which sheep are purchased for export.  It is quite true, as Deputy Brennan said, that butchers are not philanthropists.  When the price of sheepskins went up over the past 12 months, and when the butcher realised more for the sheepskins than he anticipated when buying the sheep, he did not go back to the farmer and say: &ldquo;I made a mistake in the price; here is a little more.&rdquo;  Of course not.  They are not philanthropists.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>They are business people who have no control over the price they are going to get for the product. The price paid for sheepskins is determined by the price paid for pelts. It is, of course, possible for fell-mongers in Great Britain temporarily to pay a price here which is uneconomic in order to corner the supply, but they will not continue doing that indefinitely. In the long run the price secured for the pelt on the market will determine the price of the skin, and that is the fact that is going to determine the price of the sheepskin here as well as in Great Britain.  If there is any tendency to corner the market or to depress prices unduly, there is power taken in the Bill to license export and that is the most effective method of securing that the situation here will not be availed of for the purpose of making undue profits by the fellmongering firms.  I anticipate that there will be more than three firms in this business.  Firms that closed down during the past decade will, I trust, reopen, as a number of other firms that closed down have reopened.  In any event, there will be sufficient demand, between the firms now existing and the firms that will come back into existence, to ensure that competition, on the one hand, and the price procurable for pelts on the other, will determine the price paid for skins.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1115" /> I consulted the Department of Agriculture as to the manner in which the operation of the Bill might affect farmers.  I think they were the proper body to be consulted.  For the moment, I forgot Deputy Belton.  But there is no other place that I am aware of where the opinion of farmers can be procured or the manner in which the interests of the farmers are likely to be affected can be stated in an authoritative manner.</P>

      <P>May I proceed now? Deputy Dockrell appears to be under some misunderstanding concerning this Bill.  There is at present no light tannery handling sheepskins in this country.  We hope that in due course such a tannery will be established and, of course, the introduction of a measure of this kind is an essential preliminary to the establishment of such an industry.  Wool detached from the skins and the pelts after treatment are entirely exported.  There is none retained in the country at all.  That position will still continue until the light tannery has been established and it is possible to utilise the sheepskins here.  Wool, of course, will continue to be exported.  No matter what plans may be adopted in order to encourage the utilisation of Irish wool here, there will always be a fairly large surplus available for export.  It has been, in fact, calculated that if every article manufactured from wool used in this country was manufactured from Irish wool there would be still about 66?rd per cent. of the wool produced available for export.  The treatment of that wool&mdash;the cleaning of it, the scouring of it and the grading of it&mdash;gives very <Col N="1116" /> considerable employment.  That employment is now being given mainly on the Continent and there is no reason why it should not be given here.  That industry will, in fact, permit of considerable development once a start is made upon it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mulcahy was on the same point.  He seemed to consider it unsatisfactory that we were merely proposing to do the fellmongering and continue to export the pelts and the wool.  The tanning of sheepskins is a very skilled trade.  It will not be easy to get it established, but we hope to do so.  Until we do so we shall continue to operate as at present.  There will be no difficulty in selling the pelts. There is, in fact, a demand for them in excess of the supply.  That demand exists in practically every European country.  The only serious point raised in the discussion is the reaction of this measure upon the price of sheep. I think it will not affect the price of sheep.  It will affect the price of sheepskins, but not, however, to any appreciable extent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>A very large number of them.  In fact, I think it is the regular practice in most civilised homes to eat the sheep without the skins.</P>

      <P>The difference in price which will result will be very slight.  It will represent the elimination of an uneconomic element in the determination of the price&mdash;something which was bound to take place in any event.  The licensing power will be operated to ensure an economic price.  That price is easily determinable, having regard to the prevailing price of pelts.  If the price of pelts increases it is anticipated that the price of sheepskins should increase, and <i>vice versa.</i>  If there is any tendency to move in the opposite direction the licensing power can be brought into operation to check that development. The present price of sheep is higher than it was this time last year, and higher than it was this time two years. Sheep are at present selling for a <Col N="1117" /> higher price than when Cumann na nGaedheal were in office.  There may be a number of explanations of that fact, but it is a fact.  Deputies are always able to explain away developments of that kind.  They never seem to be quite so adept at finding explanations for other developments about which they talk so frequently. The price of sheepskins rose considerably during last year.  Deputies who look at the available trade statistics for January and February will see that there was almost a 50 per cent. increase in the price of sheepskins over that period.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I have only the January figures here.  In 1933, 7,112 cwts. realised £6,839.  In 1934, 7,640 cwts. realised £10,966.  I think Deputies need have no apprehensions about the measure.  It is not possible to say what employment will be given in this industry until it is known to what extent it will develop, and to what extent the sheepskins available in the country will be utilised here.  When the industry was flourishing during the war nearly 200 men were employed in it.  It is an industry which one would like to see established, because it employs adult men only, and I think that is an important consideration.  Most of the workers are also skilled workers, and can command what are in these days regarded as relatively very high wages. I do not know that there is any other point which I need mention.  The measure was decided upon after long consideration.  It may be only one of a number of similar measures that may have to be adopted in order to conserve the native supplies of raw material for different industries, as a preliminary to the wider expansion of industry.  The situation is somewhat different in respect of other animal products, but where there is raw material being exported which can be utilised at home, it may be necessary, in order to secure the utilisation of those products here, to regulate their export so as to ensure that a highly organised group in Britain will not be able to <Col N="1118" /> defeat such attempts by cornering the market.  That is the main purpose of this Bill.</P>

      <P>I hope that, as a result of meditation over the weekend&mdash;and I hope that he has given it more meditation than he gave it before the week-end&mdash;the Minister has agreed to accept this amendment.  On Friday last, he put forward a defence for the Bill as it stands and an argument against the amendment that was, even coming from the benches opposite, unusually absurd.  If he looks merely at the amendment and at the Bill as <Col N="1121" /> it stands he will see that it is contemplated that the Bill shall not come into operation before, say, some time in the summer.  Otherwise, it might have been quite easy to have fixed different dates in clause 3.  The House will remember that the argument he put forward on the last day was something like this: This Bill might become law before 31st March, and, therefore, there is no necessity to provide for the contingency that it will not become law.  That of course is so patently absurd that I was surprised the Minister put it forward.  I suggest that Section 3 as it stands contemplates the Bill not becoming law before the beginning of the new financial year.  Hence the purpose of Section 3 is retrospective legislation, to make the law operative during a period in which it was not in force.  At all times that is objectionable.  Sometimes it may be necessary or unavoidable.  If the Minister has a case of that kind to put forward, let him put it forward.  Let me remind the Minister that last year when the general Cuts Bill was going through, it was pointed out that a Bill of this kind was necessary if the policy was to be implemented so far as local bodies were concerned.  That was realised. Between last year and this year there was plenty of time to introduce a Bill if the Government had made up their mind upon it.  There is no excuse therefore for this kind of development, making retrospective legislation necessary. It is extraordinary that any such principle should be indulged in if it could at all be avoided.  But if it is indulged in, the Government should put forward some kind of an argument in its favour.  They put forward none.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, I cannot, either on this or on any other portion of the Bill, get away from the idea that the Minister is trying to convey to local bodies that he is not in favour of the Bill; that, in fact, he is against the Bill, and that it is the bold bad people of his own Party who have insisted on going on with the Bill.  But, in this amendment as in the other amendments, he has not given any justification for going on with the Bill.  This is a policy of going between the two so as to get all the advantage he can from both sides.  The <Col N="1122" /> Government want to satisfy some of their followers that they are imposing cuts according to their promises, and at the same time they are trying to convey subtly to the people who are hit that the thing is forced upon them. That is the only conclusion that I can draw from the attitude of the Minister, from his silence on this and most other clauses.  I find it rather difficult to believe that the Minister can possibly entertain the absurd argument he has put forward on this and other sections as a justification for the policy he is pursuing.  Generally the Minister has sat silent, or if he has not sat silent he has put forward arguments worse than silence&mdash;as he has done on this amendment.  His whole idea is to be quite nice to the officials, conveying to them the idea that &ldquo;personally, I am against it; do not blame me; blame somebody else,&rdquo; thereby trying to get the advantage of both sides, blowing hot and cold.  If that is not the Minister's attitude why not give some justification for the line he has taken up on the Bill as a whole?  Not in one instance has the Minister suggested that the policy for which he stands, and the policy to which the Government is now committed, is a policy which can be justified.  He has given none so far as that very objectionable practice of retrospective legislation is concerned. There is no reason why the Minister should not accept this amendment.  It is an amendment to improve the Bill. It is only the most serious consideration that can justify the adoption of the practice which the Minister is following.</P>

      <P>On Section 4, the question was raised that the Temporary Economies Bill of last year gave power to the Minister to withhold certain moneys from some vocational education committees, and made provision for the reduction of some of their employees by a certain amount. It was stated in reply to that question that certain money was actually being withheld from some of these committees in the financial year.  The Minister for Finance at the time would not give any information as to whether reductions could be made from officers of vocational eduction committees last year under the Act of last year and at the same time that reductions could be made from the same officers under the present Bill.  Is the Minister in a position to assure us that officers of vocational education committees whose funds may be affected by deductions made in respect of last year will not, in fact, suffer reductions in respect of last year under one Act and in respect of this year under the present Bill?</P>

    <P>(2)  For the purposes of the application under this section of Parts I and II respectively of the Schedule to this Act to the salary of any officer whose salary is in part only variable remuneration, such part of such salary shall be deemed to be the first part of such salary and the word &ldquo;first&rdquo; and the word &ldquo;next&rdquo; in the said Parts of the said Schedule when so applied shall be construed accordingly.</P>

    <P>(4)  Where a part of the salary of an officer consists of an amount in respect of which a bonus, varying with the cost of living and calculated by reference to such amount, is paid to such officer, such amount and such bonus shall for the purposes of this section be taken together as one sum and such one sum shall be variable remuneration for the purposes of this section and is hereinafter in this section referred to as remuneration variable by reason of bonus.</P>
    <P>(5)  Where a part of the salary of an officer consists of remuneration variable by reason of bonus and part consists of an allowance or benefit given otherwise than in money, the said remuneration variable by reason of bonus and the value of such allowance or benefit shall be taken together as one sum for the purposes of this section, and such one sum shall also be variable remuneration for the purposes of this section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The general purpose of this amendment seems to be to get rid of the discrimination that is shown in the introduction of two parts in the Schedule.  If you compare Part I of the Schedule and Part II of the Schedule you will see that whereas under Part I an officer with a salary of £500 is going to have a cut of about £10 10s., an officer with a similar salary coming under Part II of the Schedule is going to lose three times that amount.  There are very substantial differences between the two Schedules. The theory seems to be that there are two sets of officials throughout the country.  One set of officials have got the Civil Service bonus and a sliding scale of pay and they are supposed to have had certain reductions made in their pay all along, according as the cost of living changed.  Smaller reductions are proposed in the case of those officials as against the others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Minister will realise that <Col N="1128" /> the history of the application of the Civil Service bonus to employees of local authorities is not a satisfactory history.  The idea that there was a fall in the cost of living, scattered throughout the country, produced in the minds of local authorities the impression that they might not give an increase of pay that they otherwise would give.  In fact, when the Civil Service bonus was operating they took action only in certain cases, a very limited number of cases.  I submit that the Minister cannot produce any grounds for showing that there is a case for making a discrimination between the two classes of officials.  It is quite unreasonable to impose on one set of officials substantially larger cuts.  The general effect of the amendment is to delete the higher scale of deductions in Part II of the Schedule.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Deputy says about the difference in salaries of the officers of local authorities throughout the country is, of course, quite correct. The application of the cost-of-living bonus to officials of local authorities was not general by any means.  The reason for the two Schedules here is to try to bring about some definite scale amongst the two classes of officials.  One class, which is probably the smaller class, to whom the Civil Service scale and the cost-of-living bonus applied, have had cuts over the last ten or 12 years.  When the cost of living went down they suffered a cut.  The other people, who have had fixed salaries, are in a different position.  In many cases it could be shown that where their salaries were fixed they would be higher than the salaries of the men to whom the cost-of-living bonus applied.  They have escaped those other cuts.  We thought, in making this arrangement, that it was only fair that those who escaped any cut for the last ten or 12 years should have a somewhat heavier scale applied to them than the scale applied to the officers who have had those cuts over a period of ten or 12 years.  I think that is fair and just and I do not think a strong case can be made against trying to treat all alike in so far as the cut is concerned.  The men who had the advantage during the <Col N="1129" /> last ten or 12 years should not have a great grievance if they are getting a slightly heavier hand laid on them now than is laid on those who suffered those cost-of-living cuts to which I have referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit the Minister can hardly call the difference between Parts I and II of the Schedule slight.  The Minister mentioned that the larger class have escaped cuts up to the present.  To a very large extent what they have escaped is increases.  In normal circumstances the officials of local authorities would expect an increase in their salaries, but when civil servants were having their bonus cut systematically and regularly the other officials under local authorities were having their salaries reduced in the same way.  The general effect has been that officials of local authorities have been deprived of increases that <Col N="1130" /> in normal circumstances they would have received.  Many of them have given long stretches of service without getting any increase.  Now a very substantial difference, by reason of the two Schedules, is being put into operation. My submission is that the cuts proposed in Part II of the Schedule are entirely unwarranted.  The rate of deduction ought to be the rate set out in Part I.</P>

By implication it seems to suggest that the deduction will be computed from the salary from the local authority, plus the fees, though it will be only taken from the <Col N="1132" /> local authority's salary.  I want to know whether the Minister has guarded himself against computing a man's salary by adding to the salary from the local authority the fees he gets from any other person.  I admit that whatever the deduction is, it can only be made out of the salary paid by the local authority, but in arriving at the computation as to what the amount will be, and therefore the total salary of the man, it is quite clear that the fees from other persons will not be taken into account?</P>

      <P>Might I put the case of a public vaccinator?  In a dispensary district the dispensary doctor is, by virtue of his employment, public vaccinator for the area.  An obligation imposed on him is to vaccinate free, as far as the people who attend at a certain place, at a certain hour, and on certain days are concerned.  Arising directly out of his office he might also get fees for carrying out vaccinations in private houses.  That is income arising out of his office.  Will that source of income be counted under this?</P>

      <Col N="1135" /> Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 6 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>On the section I want to refer to the position of officers whose remuneration under this Bill will be affected by Part III of the Schedule.  This section sets out what the minimum deductions from salaries are to be.  Looking at Part III of the Schedule through Sections 4 and 6 of the Bill it would appear that in the case of persons affected by Part III of the Bill the minimum deduction in certain cases is to be nil and the minimum deduction in other cases is to be five per cent.  The point I want to raise on the matter is of considerable importance to all the municipal employees in the City of Dublin who work more or less in a manual capacity.  It seems to me to be possible under Section 4 and Section 6 for a cut to be imposed on artisans and other skilled labourers, and persons hired to perform only subordinate duties or ordinary labour, if the Bill goes through in the present form.  I gather from the Minister that the intention is that skilled labourers and artisans are to be exempted from the scope of the Bill, but when you look at Section 4 and Section 6 it seems to me that Part III of the Schedule could be held to read that whereas under one section the minimum deduction is five per cent., in other cases the minimum deduction is nil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It means that a local authority could impose no cut, but there is nothing to prevent the local authority from increasing the amount of the cut, and there is nothing to prevent the Minister sanctioning the amount of the cut, unless, perhaps, the undertaking which he gave the last day to make the amount set out in the Schedule the maximum instead of the minimum.  In order to ensure that artisans and skilled labourers will not be cut under this Bill, and that local authorities will not exercise any powers conferred on them under this Bill to impose cuts on the wages of artisans and skilled labourers, it seems to me to be necessary to put in there under Section 4 or Section 6 an amendment to the effect that in the case of <Col N="1136" /> artisans and other skilled labourers, and persons who are hired to perform only subordinate duties or ordinary labour, no cut shall take place.  I gather that that is the intention of the Minister, but it seems to me from the way in which the Bill is drafted it is possible to regard the &ldquo;nil&rdquo; set out in Part III as making &ldquo;nil&rdquo; the minimum, and making the maximum higher than nil.  I should like the Minister to give an assurance that that is not intended.</P>
    <P>I should like to say at this stage that the Irish Municipal Workers' Union, which represents the manipulative staff of the Dublin Corporation, has received legal advice from an eminent counsel to the effect that as drafted at present Part III of the Bill does not give them security against a cut.  The only thing it gives them security against is a minimum of &ldquo;nil.&rdquo;  It gives them no security whatever against a maximum, unless the Minister will meet the difficulty by providing specifically that the wages of artisans or other skilled labourers, and persons hired to perform only subordinate duties or ordinary labour, will be exempted definitely from the scope of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know that that is necessary.  I do not think there is any doubt on the matter.  In case there was any doubt I gave an assurance here during an earlier discussion on the Bill that it was not the intention to include in the Bill the case of artisans and skilled labourers hired to perform subordinate duties.  A number of amendments to Section 4 have been accepted, and when the new form of the section comes before me if I find that it does not cover the point raised by the Deputy I shall see that it does.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask, seeing that Part III is referred to in Section 6, whether we can at this stage get a definition of artisans and other skilled labourers?  In the Dublin Corporation there are persons employed as caretakers, <Col N="1137" /> timekeepers, paving overseers, waterworks inspectors or waterworks foremen.  Those are people who have been tradesmen employed by the Dublin Corporation, and got a slight step up by being put in charge of sections of the staff there.  I should like to know from the Minister are those assumed to be artisans for the purposes of this Bill?  They are really in wage earning categories and, of course, none of them reaches £300 per annum.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will appreciate that it is very important, because of the fact that we have no definition as to what are &ldquo;artisans and other skilled labourers.&rdquo;  It is desirable before the Bill leaves the House completely that somebody should know who is intended to come within that category, so as to give an opportunity for bringing in amendments to the particular sections.  Take a carpenter in the employment of the Dublin Corporation, who is in receipt of £4 10s. per week. I take it he would be assumed to be an artisan or skilled labourer.  Am I right in that assumption?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DrRobertJRowlette" hpid="Dr. Rowlette Dr. Rowlette">

      <P>I move amendment No. 55:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In line 36, before the word &ldquo;fifty&rdquo; to insert the words one hundred and&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>By Section 10, the Minister recognises that the medical officers of dispensary districts occupy a special position and that there are peculiarities regarding their service which entitle them to some special consideration, and he proposes that the salary, for the purpose of the Act, shall be taken to be £50 less than the actual amount thereof.  The Minister, therefore, admits the principle that dispensary doctors should, in fairness, be treated differently from other officers of local authorities, and the only question between us is as to the amount of the concession that should be granted in their special case.</P>
      <P>On an earlier stage of the Bill, a good deal of discussion took place as to the position of dispensary doctors at the present time, and it was pointed out that their general emoluments had been considerably lessened in the last few years, and that, therefore, the time was inopportune to interfere with their emoluments from public service. I do not wish to delay the Dáil by labouring that point over again, but I should like to pay particular attention to the case which the Minister has accepted, that they deserve special consideration, and to discuss the amount which he proposes to grant in the concession he offers in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The special case of the dispensary doctor is that he is probably the only local officer who has to do a considerable amount of travelling without receiving any special allowance devoted to travelling expenses.  The <Col N="1141" /> whole-time officers, such as county medical officers of health, receive a certain allowance for travelling&mdash;no doubt, inadequate for their work, but still they receive a travelling allowance. It is of the very essence of the work of the dispensary doctor that he should be able to travel expeditiously over his district.  His district is often a very large one and is very difficult to cover in the discharge of his duties. He receives no allowance for his travelling expenses, in attending to patients whether at their own homes or, as he generally has to do, at outlying dispensary stations.  All that out-of-pocket expenditure is supposed to be covered by his salary.  The Minister recognises that, and, I take it, that is the justification for the special concession he gives.  He proposes that the allowance of £50 should be considered in virtue of that annual expenditure&mdash; unusual as compared with other officers&mdash;that the dispensary doctor is put to.  The dispensary medical officer must keep a motor car, and he has, in almost every case, to keep a man to look after the car and drive him.  It is unlikely, unless he is a young and active man, that he will be able to do his work efficiently, if he has to attend to and drive his car as well as attend to his patients.  Formerly, he was given some concession in connection with the motor tax, but that concession has been removed and he now is at exactly the same expense, covering a considerable mileage, as any person who keeps a car of the same class and who covers a similar mileage.  In respect of the mileage he covers in the discharge of his duty, he is at the same expense as anybody driving the same number of miles for pleasure. In the last few years his expenses of locomotion have undoubtedly increased.</P>
    <P>On a previous stage, the Minister made the point&mdash;no doubt, accurately&mdash; that the returns kept by a dispensary doctor did not show any increase of tickets attended to, but I take it that he will not complain that the work of a dispensary doctor as such has not increased in recent years, owing to the inability of many patients, who formerly <Col N="1142" /> paid him, to pay him nowadays. In addition to the fact that his private practice has dwindled, he has to travel just as much as he had before, and even more, because he has to attend just as many patients but now they do not pay him, whether they come directly on the poor law books or not, and he has to cover his district as frequently. The salary of a dispensary doctor is, I think, £175 per annum and I am assured by dispensary doctors in many parts of the country that they calculate that even on a salary very much above £175, at least half is expended in out-of-pocket expenses in travelling through their districts.  The amendment which I am moving is that instead of the £50 concession which is proposed in the Bill an amount of £150 be allowed in the case of dispensary doctors.  That is certainly not an extravagant estimate of the expenses entailed by dispensary doctors merely in travelling.  The salary runs from £175 to £350 and it is not extravagant to say that a sum up to £150 is spent in out-of-pocket expenses and that on the smaller salary there are only a few pounds of actual emoluments left.  On the larger salary, of course, there is more.  I hope the Minister will give favourable consideration to this amendment and accept it.  He must recognise that having admitted the principle by making any concession in the Bill, the advance he has made does not really meet the justice of the case and that the £50 does not, except in perhaps a very small number of dispensary districts, meet the out-of-pocket expenses the dispensary doctor is put to in performing his work.  I ask the Minister to give it his kindly consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Deputy Dr. Rowlette in this amendment.  I put it to the Minister that the amendment is really a very modest one.  What is asked for in it is not very much.  It is to grant an exemption of £150 to the dispensary medical doctors rather than £50.  It is merely asking the substitution of £150 for £50.  The reasonableness of that particular amendment, I think, is demonstrated from the joint request <Col N="1143" /> that is made to the Minister from the fact that supporting this amendment you have members of this Party, members of the Independent Party and members of the Labour Party, and I am certain that, if it were not for the dictates of Party discipline, we would have the names of many members of the Minister's own Party supporting it.  The case was made earlier in this debate that on account of the very conditions that make this Bill a necessity, these dispensary doctors have been already more harshly penalised than they can be by any Bill of this kind; that the unpaid demands on their time have been increased; that the volume of their travelling has been increased.  Their income has gone down while their expenditure has gone up.  In view of that, some further recognition of their really difficult position should be given.</P>
      <P>I would remind the Minister also that during this year we have had legislation compelling these men to insure their motor cars, and that compulsion is associated with a 25 per cent. increase in the previous cost of insurance.  In the past, through mistaken motives of economy, very many dispensary doctors were not insured. They are compelled to insure now, and they are compelled to pay a 25 per cent. higher rate than previously.  It is out of the question to suggest that any one of these doctors could go back to the horse and trap.  There would be an outcry if they went back either to the bicycle or to the horse and trap. In view, then, I say, of their decreased income, their increased volume of unpaid practice, and consequently the increased cost of covering the road, the increased cost of insurance and taxation on their vehicles, I would urge the Minister to grant the modest all-party request that is enshrined in this particular amendment.</P>

      <P>I would like from the Labour Benches to join my voice with those who have already spoken, in asking the Minister to accept this.  The case has been put forward by Dr. O'Higgins and others, and I would urge the Minister to accept it.  I would like <Col N="1144" /> to bear testimony to the great services given by dispensary doctors to the working classes.  The great growth of the red tickets, a devolopment that has depleted the income of the doctors, should be considered by the Minister. There is no section of the community for which a stronger appeal could be made than for the dispensary medical officers.  The terms of the amendment are reasonable, and I hope the Minister will give it his favourable consideration. Deputy O'Higgins has pointed to the increased demands on the dispensary doctors by unpaid patients and to lesser remuneration because of the depressed conditions of the people.  Because of these depressed conditions the people are making more use of the dispensary doctors who are responding voluntarily indeed to the call, and making no bones about it. As a worker, and as one having an intimate connection with insurance work, I have nothing but the very best to say as to the way in which the doctors serve the working classes of the community.  I join my voice with the other Deputies who have spoken in asking the Minister to consider this amendment as favourably as he possibly can.</P>

I think that case was met by the special allowance that was made to them.  In fact, the only case where a special allowance was made was that of the dispensary doctors.  It may be, as Deputy Rowlette and Deputy <Col N="1145" /> O'Higgins have said, that their incomes have decreased.  That may, or may not be the case; I do not know.  Exception has been made in their case, and while I do not put it down and will not for reasons known to the local Deputies, we do not want that this exemption that we are giving them in the way of travelling expenses should affect them later on when the subject of their pensions comes to be discussed. I think the allowance made to them <Col N="1146" /> may not be adequate and may not be all that we possibly could desire, but it is as far as we can go in the present circumstances.</P>

    <P>(2)  Where a person who has been granted a superannuation allowance or a pension is in receipt of a salary from which a deduction is made under this Act, the amount of such allowance or pension actually payable shall be computed by reference to the full amount of such salary, and such deduction shall not be taken into account for the purpose of such computation.</P>

      <P>On behalf of Deputy Doyle, I beg to move amendment No. 56:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete sub-section (2).</P>
      <P>It is aimed at achieving the deletion of sub-section (2).  The purpose of that is to prevent an injustice which would be done to people who have been given pensions and gratuities.  The amount which, in fact, they receive out of the nominal pension or gratuity has been based on certain conditions which impressed the minds of those who arranged them as just when the arrangements were made.  The position under sub-section (2) will be this. Supposing a person has a pension from a local authority under any of the Acts which gave pensions for service to the State in a military way, the amount of the pension is reduced according to a scale, the scale fluctuating according to other emoluments which that person may get from public authorities.  I want to preserve the existing situation with regard to these people.  There are people who might simply rely on a pension but who, being offered work at a particular salary, take that work and give service for the value of the money.  They might draw, possibly, £100 and, possibly, £200 for the extra work they are taking on.  It is possible, as things are at the moment, for a man to be entitled to a pension of, say, £400 a year for doing nothing, and then on coming into receipt of emoluments for certain work done, say, to the value of £600, he does not draw his pension of £400 plus his salary of £600, but something in between.  That is, he is doing a £600 job for about £150 or £200.  When that scheme was arranged originally and the sliding scale fixed, it was thought a desirable thing to have these men, some of whom were pensioned at a time when, clearly, they had not passed the period of being able to give service to the State, induced to come back into the service of the State.  There is no reason at the moment to have that upset, and the upset that is going to be occasioned to these people will be considerable to them as individuals, while the saving likely to be effected will be very small. I think there is a complete lack of balance between the two.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that what the Deputy suggests is likely to happen.  There are, as he properly says, a number of people who have pensions and who have taken on employment under local authorities.  Some of them have taken these posts under a local authority and, again, as the Deputy properly said, instead of getting a salary of £400 a year, they are only getting £150 or £200 a year because of the pensions.  Some of them are getting a larger salary and drawing no pension, because there is a section in the Local Government Act of 1925 which arranges a sliding scale by which the salary was reduced according to the amount of the pension, or the pension, in certain circumstances, would not be paid at all.  However, if we were to do what is suggested here, it could easily happen in the case of these people who can draw pensions and are not drawing them, or certain portions of them, that a cut could be made on their salaries and then their pensions would automatically increase. In that way, they would avoid any cut. Since the principle of cuts has been agreed to on the Second Reading of the Bill and they are in order for everybody, an arrangement of that kind, between the officials of the local authority and the local authority, whereby they could avoid a cut by having the pension automatically increased to cover the amount of whatever cut they might be subject to, would not be fair to the other officials concerned.  On that ground, I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I can quite understand the Minister not accepting the amendment but I cannot understand his opening phrase, in which he says that what I have suggested is not likely to happen.  It only affects a limited class, but to every member of that limited class what I have indicated as likely to happen will, in fact, take place.  I think that that is beyond doubt.  For instance, take the people who are getting pensions at present for military service.  They have a pension of a particular amount.  Then, those of them who do get work, as they are not getting the full pay ordinarily given for that work, lose, perhaps not <Col N="1149" /> on the pay, but on the pension; but between the two they do not get the amount of the pension or the two salaries.  In every one of these cases of a person getting a pension and also doing work of this nature, this sub-section is aimed to have this effect.  I seek to prevent it having that effect on any of them.  As I say, they are a small number of people and the saving to the local authorities or whoever is supposed to benefit by this is not going to be very much in toto, while it is going to have a serious effect on the small and limited number of individuals who will suffer.  These are people who have been given pensions or gratuities for very definite services rendered to the State; so I do not think that what the Minister said about the Second Reading should be allowed to override cases of individual hardship.  These people are only a limited class in the public service.  This is not an all-round cuts Bill.  That is the objection. If there were to be an equal way of spreading hardship that had got to be borne it should be by ordinary taxation; but simply to attack, as the Bill definitely aims at attacking, people because, in the first instance, they are in the public service and are not in the local service, is unjust, and I hold it is immoral also.  I cannot understand what the Minister said as to the sub-section not having an effect on every one of those people in receipt of public moneys and getting that salary now, and that once a cut has been applied it should apply to all these people.</P>

      <P>Section 11 agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 12.</P>
      <P>The making under this Act of a deduction from salary paid under a contract of service shall not operate to terminate such contract, and such contract shall, notwithstanding the making of such deduction, continue to subsist but subject to the obligation or right to make and the obligation to suffer such deduction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 57.</P>
      <P>In line 55 to delete the word &ldquo;and,&rdquo; and substitute the words &ldquo;unless the person, from whose salary paid under such contract of service a deduction under this Act is made or proposed to be made, claims that the making of or proposing to make such deduction shall operate as his discharge and the termination of his contract of service, and in the absence of such claim.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment itself is to insert words, which I have set down here, about half way down in Section 12. As it reads, the section amounts to this, that where there is a contract of service, the terms of the contract ordinarily having relation to work to be given on the one hand and, in consideration for that, moneys to be received, now an attempt is being made under the section to enable the contract to be changed&mdash;a consideration by way of the moneys paid for the services rendered to be lessened, and at the same time prevent that operating as a breach of contract.  The section is aimed at preventing anybody saying that because the salary for which he took up certain work is being reduced that the contract is broken and also to prevent him from saying, if he can say anything, that it follows from a breach of contract.  The section is clear in its aim, and that aim is that &ldquo;the making of a deduction from salary paid under a contract of service shall not operate to terminate the contract.&rdquo;  That is taken up in the section, and it also says that &ldquo;such contract shall, notwithstanding the making of such deduction, continue to subsist but subject to the obligations or right to make and the obligation to suffer such deduction.&rdquo;  I want to insert a formula, the result of the insertion of it being this, that if there is a deduction from salary paid under a contract of service, the making of that deduction shall not operate to terminate the contract unless the person from whose salary paid under such contract of service a deduction is made or proposed to be made, claims that the making of or proposing to make <Col N="1151" /> such deduction shall operate as his discharge.  And then it ties up the end as follows: &ldquo;and in the absence of such claim, such contract shall, notwithstanding the making of such deduction, continue to subsist but subject to the obligation of right to make and the obligation to suffer such deduction.&rdquo; In other words, I am going to assume that the terms of the measure will have been brought to the notice of everybody likely to be affected by it and to put the onus on the person, on presumed notice being received by him, to say: &ldquo;I consider that that breaks the contract,&rdquo; and then for him to take whatever action is open to him.  There may be no claim, but at any rate he should have the right to say that the contract has been broken and it should be left open to him to see what remedy he has.  If he fails to make such a claim, then the section flows on as before.  The contract still exists subject to the making of the cut.</P>
    <P>Again I want to stress that the onus is put on the person to claim.  It is not that automatically, because the deduction is made, the contract is broken and certain results may be discovered afterwards to follow and may be enforced; it is only when a person is alert and vigilant enough as to his own position, and sees that he is worsened and claims, for better or worse in relation to himself, that the contract is broken, and he is going to see what then is due to him.  All this amendment means is that when you have entered into a contractual relationship with people in the public service that contract ought to be as sacred as any other, and should not be open to one-sided revision.  It should not be open to a local authority, as I asserted it should not be open to the State in the case of the public service, to say: &ldquo;No matter on what conditions we induced you into the service as to pay, holidays, security or anything else, we are going to deduct this and show the strength and length of our arm, and say that you shall not be entitled to hold that that is a breach of your contract, and shall not be entitled to pursue any <Col N="1152" /> rights for the breach of it.&rdquo;  I do not know what the repercussions will be. I have not examined the contractual rights of those in the service of local authorities, but, at any rate, whatever they are, they are open to the person to enforce for himself.  Until he does make the claim that the contract has been broken, and seeks to enforce his rights, nothing follows.  In fact, in the absence of a claim, he is understood to have waived whatever rights he may have in relation to a breach of contract. I suggest, therefore, that this is a useful amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if there are any officials of local authorities who have actually entered into a contract. It all depends on what definition you give to the word.  I do not think they enter into a legal contract.  There are contracts of another kind.  Certain agreements are entered into between them, but those agreements are very frequently rearranged by local authorities. There have been rearrangements of salaries on several occasions since the Free State was established.  I do not know that local officials themselves would demand what Deputy McGilligan seeks to demand for them. At any rate, I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
      <P>Local officials whose salaries are liable to be cut under this Bill have at least had the matter brought to their attention through the Press, if not in a formal or official way.  I do know that many of them have already, by getting increases proposed for themselves, sought to nullify the possible effects of the Bill.  At any rate I do not see that it is possible to accept the amendment.  It would practically nullify the section.  That would not trouble the Deputy, but it would make any amount of trouble for local authorities who would have a condition of affairs such as was experienced under Article X of the Treaty in connection with the Civil Service.  If I can avoid it, I do not propose to allow any such state of affairs to exist so far as officers of local authorities are concerned.</P>

      <P>The Minister's answer has entirely evaded the point. <Col N="1153" /> If there is no contract of service, what is the meaning of Section 12?  Section 12 is put in with the object of preventing anybody claiming that a deduction is a breach, but it only has its effect where in fact a salary is paid under a contract of service.  If it is not so paid, then the section has no effect, and neither will the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever number there are, they will be a limited number, and the amendment will protect as the section will destroy their rights.  If it does not apply at all, then the section is no good and the amendment is no good.  One is as valueless as the other, and one might as well be in as the other.  If they have widespread application the mind of the person who got the section drafted had fears that there was a big number, and set out to protect the State's end.  I want to protect the employee's end.  If it has only application to a small number, it does not matter putting in the section or the section with the rider to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister went on to say that he does not want to have the officials of local authorities put into the position of, say, Article X people, but they will not be by the amendment unless they are in something of that position already.  If they have no contract of service the amendment does not remove the earlier words.  My amendment is to be inserted after the very important phrase &ldquo;deduction from salary paid under contract of service.&rdquo; My amendment does not say that there is any new right of action or anything like that given.  It simply says that the making of a deduction shall not operate to terminate the contract unless the person claims that the making of the deduction shall operate as his discharge and the termination of his contract of service.  What rights he has after that will remain for further research.  It does not give him any new right.  It does not put him in any better position than before.  Whatever his position was he simply gets this clear-cut admission made by the State: &ldquo;We are making a deduction <Col N="1154" /> from your salary; you can claim that you think that breaks the contract, and when you do claim it does operate to discharge and bring about a termination of your contract with the local authority, after that you can get whatever rights are due to you.&rdquo;  That is the beginning and end of the amendment. The Minister had to exaggerate the effect of it in order to make any argument against it.</P>
    <P>He also said that the amendment seeks to put the officials of local authorities in a better position than they would claim for themselves.  I have in my hand a copy of a memorandum which is stated to be a reprint of a memorandum dealing with economy cuts forwarded to the Minister for Local Government.  Possibly that is one of the reasons that the Minister is not aware of what these people do claim, because I notice at the end of it the hope expressed that the Minister will be good enough to alter his previous decision on the question of a deputation.  It is very easy when you do not hear a deputation to pretend not to know anything about the claims of the people to whom you have refused audience.</P>

      <P>It is easy enough to be unaware of the cogency of the arguments those officials might advance when you have shut your doors upon them.  I do not claim to have done anything in this amendment outside what I know their claim to be.  Apart from what they claim, I think it is an equitable thing to say that if there is a contract of service entered into, and only if there is, and if that is based, on the one hand, on services rendered and, on the other hand, on moneys received; if there had been no change at least in the way of lightening the services rendered, but if the moneys are going to be reduced, then the person who reduces the moneys paid should have to put up with the position when the other party to the contract may say: &ldquo;I think that breaks the contract.  I think that means my discharge and the termination of my services.&rdquo;  All that then happens is that he is out of the <Col N="1155" /> service.  What happens after is a matter for further consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister merely like a child, afraid of the dark in connection with Deputy McGilligan's amendment?  He has some vague, nameless, indeterminate fear about something that may be at the back of Deputy McGilligan's amendment, and he cannot put his finger on it.  He does not know what it is, but he says it may be something like Article X of the Treaty in relation to the civil servants. The employees of local authorities have no such rights as civil servants have under Article X of the Treaty.  What is he afraid of?  They have no such rights.  The object of Deputy McGilligan's amendment is merely to preserve what ought to be preserved by <Col N="1156" /> every Party in this House, namely, the sanctity of contracts.  This section hits at the basis of contractual justice in this State.  The Executive Council and the Minister, by the introduction of this Bill, have by State action interfered in a contract between what are essentially private parties.  All that Deputy McGilligan wants to ensure is that when one party to the contract has been enabled by means of an Act of the Oireachtas to break this contract the other ought to be put in the position of repudiating the contract by reason of that breach.  That is an elementary principle in the law of contracts, and all that Deputy McGilligan's amendment wants to do is to preserve ordinary justice in relation to contractual rights.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 59:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add at the end of sub-section (1) the words &ldquo;provided, however, that an appeal from such determination shall lie to the Civil Service (Compensation) Board established in accordance with the Civil Service (Transferred Officers) Compensation Act, 1929 (No. 36 of 1929), and the said Board shall have jurisdiction to hear and determine any such appeal and the determination of the said Board shall be final and conclusive.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The first sub-section of Section 13 establishes for the future that in the case of every doubt, question or dispute which shall arise on mentioned points:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>as to whether any person is an officer within the meaning of the Act or as <Col N="1158" /> to the amount of the salary... of any officer or as to the amount of the minimum deduction to be made under this Act from any such salary...</P>
    <P>with a fourth point that may arise also for determination in the same way:</P>
    <P>...if such salary be paid by more than one local authority, as to the amount of the minimum deduction to be made from such salary under this Act by each such local authority</P>
    <P>the determination of the Minister is enforced, and that determination is to be final.  The Minister may be the Minister for Agriculture, the Minister for Education, or the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, but, in the main, it will be the Minister for Local Government and Public Health. You have a new position now for local authorities identical with the position created under the Public Services (Economies) Act for public servants. Disputes are likely to arise, or may arise, on whether a person is a person caught by the Act; on what is the amount of his salary for the purpose of calculating the deduction, and what is the amount of the deduction to be made.  On all these points in respect of the vast majority of the officials of local authorities, the determination is the Minister for Local Government, and his decision is final.  My amendment is to add to the end of the section a provision by which an appeal will lie to the Civil Service (Compensation) Board, and I give that Board jurisdiction to hear and determine any such appeal and establish that the determination of that Board will be final and conclusive.</P>
    <P>This amendment is, I think, in identical terms to those of an amendment moved by Deputy Keyes to the Public Services (Economies) Bill when it was before the House.  He was then aiming to give the right to appeal to public servants, and I am aiming at giving a right of appeal to local servants. I should not, perhaps, say that the amendments are identical, but the aims are the same.  The Deputy had previously moved to allow an appeal to be taken to a court of competent jurisdiction. The only difference between us is that I am asking that it be taken <Col N="1159" /> to an informal type of court, which is working very satisfactorily, very easily and very cheaply, in relation to questions of pensions, the status of officers in the service, deductions and so on and so forth.  It is a court which has great experience of this type of matter.  It was specially established in order to give a speedy and cheap and, I might almost say, an informal way, of getting points of importance to the service, in relation to these matters, decided.  I am asking to have the appeal taken to that body under this Bill.  The basis of the amendment, of course, is that it is a wrong thing and has always been recognised as a wrong thing to have the person operating an Act as the final and only judge of rights under that Act.  That is a principle that has been encroached upon from time to time, but has always met with resistance and has always been argued on that point of principle, that it is a wrong thing to set up a person and to give him the right to determine, in the first instance, and the right, in the second instance, finally to determine these questions. Sometimes the principle has been accepted and has grown up with a service, but certainly at each new attempt to establish it in relation to some new side of a service or in relation to new arguments or new points that may arise, it has always been very stoutly and definitely resisted.</P>
    <P>I should like to have consideration given to it at the moment.  It cannot be argued that it will delay the operation of cuts.  If cuts are legitimate; if they are proper under the Act; if the people from whom they are to be taken are the people aimed at under the Act and so on, the cuts will be achieved.  The only thing is that the people who are going to suffer the cut will not suffer under the definite sense of grievance under which they otherwise would suffer when they see that the person who brings in the Act, pilots it through the House and is responsible for the whole idea of economy, has given into his hands this knife which has been sharpened for use against certain people and told to wield it at his own will, and as the only person <Col N="1160" /> whose discretion is to be called in as to whether he is using that knife properly or improperly.  That is a bad situation to allow to develop.</P>

      <P>I am afraid the Deputy's memory must be somewhat at fault when he says that this is introducing any new principle.  I think that in several Bills, introduced when the Deputy was a member of Deputy Cosgrave's Government, sections identical to this were inserted, and I never heard the Deputy protesting.  I do not think that even any member of his Party protested, and if anybody protested&mdash;I do not know that I did; some members of my Party did, I think, when we were in opposition&mdash;the Deputy did not, in my recollection, nor did any of his Party, protest when exactly similar sections were introduced, probably more than once in each year, during the term of the Cosgrave Government. There is, therefore, nothing new in it. It is a point which has been introduced into Local Government Acts and other Acts, by which the Minister is the person to determine and decide&mdash;to be the arbitrator&mdash;in cases of doubt, question or dispute.  I would not be surprised if Deputy McGilligan, who moved the amendment and argued in favour of it, argued in favour of the very opposite when on the Government Benches. Whether he argued against this very amendment I cannot say, but I know that my recollection is that he argued against similar amendments.</P>

      <P>The Minister's refusal to accept the amendment would apparently come down to this, that the Cosgrave Government could not do wrong.  I gather from the Minister's defence of this section that he or some member of his Party spoke in heated terms against clauses similar to this being inserted into Bills during the time of the Cosgrave Government, and he says that the Deputy spoke in favour of such clauses.  That means that the Minister, when in opposition, was against such a section as this.  Let us now regard the situation as being a complete wash-out, that the situation has changed, and let us look at it from the point of view of the principle, and that it is not a question whether the Cosgrave Government did certain things or not or that the Minister's Party, when in opposition, spoke for or against a provision such as this.  That does not determine the matter.  Let us say, as I will say, that provisions of this kind, whether inserted by the Cosgrave Government or the de Valera Government, are absolutely wrong. They strike at the very root of the citizens' rights.  They strike at the spirit, if not at the letter, of the Constitution, which provides that all matters which are justiciable should be decided by the courts set up by the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This class of section, no matter by what Government introduced, is an arrogation by the Government of powers which they should not take, and it is a distinct attempt to deprive the citizen of his rights under the Constitution.  There was no Department so strong on the question of bureaucracy as the Minister's own Department of Local Government and Public Health.  The class of provision contained in this section is really bureaucratic.  It is not the concern of the Minister to try a dispute between two outside parties.  If these parties find that they cannot agree they can go to arbitration.  If they do not go to an arbitrator then they have the courts for which the taxpayers are paying.  If an employee of a local authority wishes to litigate a matter in the public court, if he insists upon his right as a citizen, no wrong can be <Col N="1162" /> done to the local authority, because if the employee is wrong he will be mulcted in costs and there will be no injustice done.  But there will be injustice done between the local authority and the employee if the case is decided by the Minister or by one of his inspectors, who do not know the real facts and can only get them on a file.</P>

    <P>(3)  Where, in the case of an officer to whom either of the foregoing subsections of this section applies, any variation occurs after the passing of this Act and before the end of the year 1934 in the nature of his employment with or the amount of the salary which he is entitled to <Col N="1164" /> receive from any of the local authorities by whom he is employed, such officer shall, not later than one fortnight after such variation takes effect, give to the chief executive officer of each of the other local authorities by whom he is employed written particulars of such variation.</P>
    <P>(4)  Where an officer (other than the chief executive officer) of any local authority receives any portion of his salary in the form of fees or other remuneration not paid to him by a local authority, such officer shall, within fourteen days after the passing of this Act, give to the chief executive officer of every local authority by which he is employed an estimate in writing of the probable amount of such fees or other remuneration to be received by him during the year 1934, and shall also, within fourteen days after the 31st day of December, 1934, give to every such chief executive officer an account in writing of such fees or other remuneration actually received by him during the year 1934.</P>

      <P>To delete sub-section (4).</P>
      <P>I can see the object of sub-section (4), but I want to find out what the Minister had in mind as to the detail of this information.  Sub-section (4) runs this way:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Where an officer other than the chief executive officer of any local authority receives any portion of his salary in the form of fees or other remuneration not paid to him by a local authority, such officer shall... give to the executive officer of every local authority by which he is employed an estimate in writing of the probable amount of such fees or other remuneration during the year 1934... and within 14 days after the 31st December, 1934 shall give to every chief executive officer an account in writing of such fees or other remuneration actually received by him during 1934.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to raise one or two points on that.  I take it that section envisages only a man getting funds from a local authority and not getting funds from another local authority but from some outside source.  The section never envisages a man getting money from two local authorities.  Why does the <Col N="1166" /> section say he shall give the chief executive officer of every local authority this estimate in writing?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>There are some officials getting money from as many as three or four local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a contradiction somewhere.  &ldquo;If an officer receives any portion of his salary... not paid to him by a local authority,&rdquo; then he has to give to the chief executive officer of a different local authority an indication of these funds.  But where is the co-relation of the funds that he gets from each of the separate local authorities by whom he is employed? I take the section to mean that nobody does draw fees or emoluments from more than one local authority&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and, therefore, all you had to cover was a man getting fees from a local authority and getting fees elsewhere.  However, that is only a small point, and I do not want to enlarge upon it.  As to giving an estimate in writing of the probable amount, and a statement after the event of the actual fees, do I take it if the estimate and the actual amount differ, the next sub-section may be brought into effect and it might be counted as a wrong return?  Would it be considered wilful neglect of the performance of a duty and the official might be removed from his office?</P>

      <P>Supposing a person makes an estimate before the year is out of the fees or emoluments to be received, and that differs from the actual return made afterwards.  Let us take an unusual case, where the estimate is higher than the actual result.  Will a refund be made?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Then in that event why not wait for the return at the end <Col N="1167" /> of the year, and levy after the facts are known?  The reduction will be then based on actual receipts, and not on an estimate.  I am afraid to leave this in a dubious position, because a very severe sub-section follows, and I am seeking to have it struck out.  I have three amendments here, and it might save time if they were considered together.  The position would be that if an officer refuses or wilfully neglects to give particulars in an estimate or if, in giving particulars, he gives false information and so on, certain penalties follow.  He would be subject to the penalties in sub-section (6), and I notice that in sub-section (6) the monetary penalty is the one that is pushed into the forefront.  He would be liable to a fine, not exceeding a certain amount.  I take it that a fine means court proceedings.  Removal from office would never be attempted except in the case of a very serious offence.</P>
      <P>Sub-section (5) puts removal as the penalty, and deems that removal to be removal for misconduct which, I think, precludes any right to pension.  I do not know why there should be that very stringent limitation, and the punishment of removal for misconduct in relation to refusing or neglecting to do a thing, whereas if a person gives false information, which is, from the angle of a completely dishonest man, the next best thing to refusing or neglecting to give the information, a monetary penalty, and court proceedings are pushed into the forefront.  I think it is objectionable that a man might be charged with having neglected or refused to give information because he has given a wrong estimate.  I think it would be preferable if this could be entirely removed, and leave a man to be brought into court for the giving of false information based on the actual return made by him after the year, when he was bound to know all the facts which can be proved against him.  That would be a better procedure than allowing the Minister to operate a section which enables him to remove for misconduct a man who had neglected to do an act or perform a duty.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the two returns, the estimate and the final return of the actual receipts, the estimate is certainly necessary.  The chief executive officer of the local authority will want to make out in advance what amount is to be cut from the salary of the officer, and he will have to have some idea what fees or other emoluments come to the officer concerned before he can make out his estimate of the cut to be made in the succeeding months.  If no cut were made, and it were left to the end of the year, and the officer concerned was asked to send in a return, the cut would have to be made in one slice, and it would be very heavy.  It is for the purpose of making it as light a burden as possible, and dividing it into monthly portions, that the estimate is asked for.  The purpose of the later return is to check up and see that the proper amount was cut from the officer's salary or emoluments.</P>
      <P>With regard to the other point, I agree with the Deputy that it does look a severe punishment for an officer who might refuse or neglect or might be guilty of wilful neglect and I think the argument the Deputy has put up as to the severity of the punishment is a sound one.  If he agrees to withdraw the amendment, I will have the sub-section looked into and altered, perhaps not exactly as he suggests, but in some form so as to reduce the severity of the proposed punishment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will certainly withdraw the amendment in order to enable that to be done.  As regards the desirability of having an estimate, those who are going to be cut under this measure can have it impressed on them in other ways that it is desirable to send in this estimate.  What I am objecting to is that the refusal or the failure to send an estimate, or the sending in of an estimate with wrong particulars, may be held to be an offence and may either get the man removed from the service or brought before a court.  As the section stands the person may be punished in either of the ways set out.  That being the case, the cut can be enforced.  There is no great chance of anybody getting <Col N="1169" /> away.  Why leave a power in the hands of any Minister to say that the failure to send an estimate, or the giving of wrong particulars in an estimate, may be the foundation for an action in court and a man may be put to considerable trouble to defend himself? Most people will not, if there is simply there this question of sending an estimate in, but to make the penalty apply only to the refusal or failure to comply with all the parts of the section except his writing of the estimate would involve hardship.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 78 is a Labour amendment, but if it is not going to be moved by the Labour people, I should like to move it for the sake of having it put as an expression of opinion, at any rate, from this side <Col N="1172" /> of the House.  Accordingly, I move amendment No. 78:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In Part I, to delete the figures &ldquo;£300&rdquo; where it occurs and insert therein &ldquo;£400&rdquo; and to delete &ldquo;£400&rdquo; where it occurs and insert therein &ldquo;£500.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The object of this amendment is simply to delete the figure &ldquo;£300&rdquo; where it occurs in Part I and to insert therein &ldquo;£400&rdquo; and to delete &ldquo;£400&rdquo; where it occurs and insert &ldquo;£500.&rdquo;  At the moment, the Schedule operates to effect that the deductions where the annual rate of salary does not exceed £300 shall be nil, whereas under the amendment in Deputy Corish's name that would be changed to read that &ldquo;where the annual rate of salary does not exceed £400 the deduction is nil.&rdquo;  The second part of it says that &ldquo;where the annual rate of salary exceeds £300 but does not exceed £400, the deduction is 2 per cent. per annum.&rdquo;  Those two figures would be substituted in Deputy Corish's amendment by £400 and £500, and would read that &ldquo;where the annual rate of salary exceeds £400 but does not exceed £500 the deduction is 2 per cent.&rdquo; and then that these other special cuts which follow in a series now applicable to salaries exceeding £400 would only be applicable to salaries exceeding £500.  It raises the exemption from deduction also by another £100.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept the amendment.  The figure of £300 is, I think, a fair figure, and it is the farthest we can go.  I think that the type of people, even in the City of Dublin, that will come in under this section will be able to meet their obligations, and that the cut will not be so heavy on them at that figure. That was the figure that was passed by this House in relation to a former Economies Bill, the Bill relating to public servants, and while I do not say that it was accepted as a fair figure by everybody, I think it was a reasonable figure, and therefore I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, I want to remark that treating this amendment in this way clearly shows the mind <Col N="1173" /> behind the measure.  We are told by the Minister that people of this type ought to be able to meet their obligations, but this is not a question of paupers.  Surely, we have not got to the scale of people who are merely at the subsistence level, but of people who have been put into honourable and responsible positions under local authorities and who had salaries given to them in proportion to the service it was thought they were giving to the community.  We are not, at any rate, in this measure, aiming at reducing people nearly to the bread-line and stopping at the point where we think we are putting them over it, and then taking pride to ourselves that we have stopped somewhere short of that. This is a question of people employed by local authorities, in the main under contracts, whether legal contracts or not, with salaries established in circumstances that realised what the work was that these people were doing and its value to the State, and, taking the other side of the account into consideration, in finding out what was the salary meet and proper to give to these people to enable them to keep up a certain situation compatible with the work they had to do and the position they were going to enjoy. Then, suddenly without any test being made as to whether the work has decreased in value or whether they were not performing the work properly, they simply come in and say that they have thought of a figure as a certain minimum and then that they have thought of another figure and they bring the salaries down to that figure. The whole thing is arbitrary.  It is <Col N="1174" /> very unjust in the manner in which these people have been segregated out for cuts at all without the slightest argument being advanced that these people were overpaid previously and therefore were what might be called people in possession of fat jobs who were the appropriate people to be cut in their salaries in a time of crisis and depression.  No such argument has been advanced.  We are simply taking those people because they stand in a certain relationship to the Government; they are within the sweep of the cutting arm, and that is the best that can be said for the measure.</P>
      <P>Deputy Corish had an amendment down.  Deputy Corish is fairly expert in local government matters.  He has been in a position of authority in one of those local bodies for many years and it is very well known that he has great experience of these matters. Viewing this measure, feeling, I am sure, in his heart, that he would rather not have the cuts at all, but looking at it and the people on to whom the cuts are to be passed, and the work they do, he says it is better to raise the exemption limit by £100 and to raise the salary on which the cut is to be made by £100, so that those will fall in a new series.  The Minister's answer is: &ldquo;It does not matter; we are giving those people enough to live on,&rdquo; and that is the point to which we have got in local government.</P>
      <P>Question&mdash;&ldquo;That the figures proposed to be deleted stand&rdquo;&mdash;put.</P>

Those people have debts to pay, many of which may be revenue&mdash;income tax, land annuities, etc.  Would the Minister not be prepared to accept them at their face value?  He is proposing <Col N="1178" /> to buy land at a time when land is at its lowest market value&mdash;at a time when it is acknowledged that land is not paying.  He proposes to reinvest that money and to put a heavier load on the land which he proposes to vest in other people, and ask them to meet the commitments on that land.  How will the interest and principal on these bonds be paid by an industry which at the moment is not a paying concern?  The credit which the bonds represent will not be utilised in another business, but in a business which already is not paying and which has to carry a bigger load and is still expected to pay.</P>

You do not pay him cash; you do not pay him legal tender.  You pay him bonds.  What is he to do with those?  If he owes a debt of £100 to the Land Commission or to any Department of the Government, why should he not be able to pay £100 of that £2,000 which he will get from the Minister for Finance to that Department&mdash;£100 of an annuity, which, by the way, will go into the Central Fund in future?

      <P>I do not know whether the Deputy who has spoken is serious in what he said.  After all, the House has accepted the principle <Col N="1179" /> of this Bill, which is to make provision for the creation and issue of Land Bonds for the purpose of the payment of purchase moneys under the various Land Acts.  That is to say, we are asking, if one likes, the vendor of this land to make a loan to the State at interest.  The terms of the issue of the loan which he will make to the State will be such that if he wishes to realise his bonds, he will be able to do so at par, without suffering any loss and if he wants, therefore, to redeem any annuities upon any other holding of his or to discharge any other liability which he owes to the State, he can do that by the simple process of selling his bonds and offering legal tender to the State in discharge of whatever obligations he has to discharge.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that the vendor is obliging the State by giving the State a loan to the amount of the purchase money.  The Minister knows quite well that that is not the principle involved in this transaction. He knows quite well that this is not a loan by the vendor but a forced loan from the citizens by the Government to the vendor.  The vendor is not in a position to lend.  He wants the money for other calls and what is good enough for the vendor to take for his property, surely ought to be good enough&mdash;face value and pound for pound&mdash;for the State to take from the vendor in respect of the discharging of the vendor's liabilities to the State.  I do not want to carry it any further, but I should like an answer from the Minister as to whether revenue can be paid or land annuities redeemed by those bonds, pound for pound, face value.</P>

      <P>This is the complement of the 1933 Act which sets out that the annuities will be halved.  I understand that, under the other Land Acts, the annuity was fixed, roughly speaking, to meet the price paid to the land-owner.  That was guaranteed to the Guarantee Fund by the grants ordinarily accruing to local authorities.  Under this Act, I understand that when the annuity is fixed, roughly, I presume, on the same basis as formerly, it will be reduced by 50 per cent., making the State immediately liable for a loss of 50 per cent. upon the issue.  Is that so? Originally, the annuities were payable in whole by the farmers and they covered, roughly, the amount that was advanced through the land-owners in respect of the purchase of the land. The amount was also secured, as I have said, by grants accruing to local authorities.  What is the position now with regard to the Guarantee Fund? Has it the same security still?</P>

      <P>First of all, I think there is some confusion in the Deputy's <Col N="1181" /> mind as to the use of the word &ldquo;guarantee&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The provisions of the Land Purchase Acts relating to the making of advances by the Land Commission for the purposes of the Principal Act, the payment of interest on and the repayment of the capital of such advances by means of purchase annuities or otherwise, and the guarantee of such payment and repayment shall apply to advances made under this section....</P>
      <P>Quite obviously, that can be related only to the bonds to be issued under this section.  First of all, their interest and repayment are guaranteed by the State and become a charge on the Central Fund.  The State itself is guaranteed or indemnified, if one likes, against loss arising from the failure of the land annuitants to meet their obligations under their purchase agreements by what is commonly known as the Guarantee Fund, which consists of the local taxation grants and the various grants in relief of rates upon agricultural land.  That will still remain.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>

      <P>The State is going to bear half the cost of completing land purchase henceforth, because it has to bear the loss due to the difference between what the tenant purchasers will be asked to give and what the vendor will agree to take for his land or what the appeal tribunal will decide to fix.</P>

If the State's whole liabilities were to be £2,000,000 a year and if nobody paid, then the whole of the Guarantee Fund would be impounded for the purposes of the Central Fund in order to enable it to discharge these obligations towards the holders of the land bonds issued since 1923.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (1), page 3, line 25, after the word &ldquo;conditions&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;in relation to registration or inscription.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment has been introduced to meet the point which was raised by <Col N="1184" /> Deputy Thrift at an earlier stage, that possibly the Minister for Finance might attach conditions which might be described as vexatious.  This makes it clear that the only condition which the Minister would specify would be the conditions relating to the registration of the bonds.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamEThrift" hpid="Professor Thrift Professor Thrift">
      <NameTxt>Professor Thrift</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that and I am obliged to the Minister for putting the matter right.  These three amendments down in the name of the Minister meet very fairly the points I made.  I think they do get over the difficulties that I saw.  The words used by the Minister oblige me to stress one point.  I am turning now to amendment No. 3&mdash;&ldquo;within the limits imposed by this section.&rdquo;  I recognise the necessity for these words in this way, that this sub-section could not go beyond the general terms of the Bill. I do not know that the terms would enforce the main provisions in the Act, namely, what the interest should be. It is quite impossible to foresee far ahead the state of the money market. Some cataclysm may come in; something that some people do not call unexpected, say, a European war, for instance, and a fall in money might follow.  I think the Minister ought to give an undertaking that, if any serious change in the value of money came so as to make the rate between 3 per cent. and 4 per cent., something that would make it impossible to get a fair value on the stock exchange for these bonds, then he should come back to the Dáil for further powers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I could not give that undertaking that Deputy Thrift asks for, because I could not bind any other person.  If so revolutionary a change should take place that the rate of interest would go up considerably, that land purchase would possibly come to a standstill, then the Land Commission would compel the Minister to come to the Dáil and ask for such an amendment of the Act as would enable the land purchase to be resumed.  On the other hand, if the rate of interest fell much below 3 per cent., then the Minister himself would come to the Dáil.  The reason that the limit of between 3 per cent. and <Col N="1185" /> 4 per cent. has been put in is that it was thought undesirable to ask the Dáil, in view of the relationship which the rate of interest bears to the purchase price, to allow the Minister to fix the rate of interest entirely at his own discretion.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1195" /> The object of the amendment is to secure in the Bill something that I do not believe the boards of public assistance or the Minister would really wish to do when he comes to put the Bill into practice.  I do not think the Minister would wish to seize small holdings or to curtail small holdings still more.  I hope he will see his way to specify that in the Bill.  If there is a small holding of up to five acres I cannot imagine that he would want to do one good thing by doing a bad thing. I suggest that the Parliamentary Secretary might accept both amendments in my name which have the same object, the protection of small holders. It must be possible to secure land for this purpose without doing damage to anybody.  I suggest that the Parliamentary Secretary might accept this amendment&mdash;indeed both of them&mdash; without doing any harm to the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty I have about this particular amendment is that if we exclude the possibility of acquiring small holdings as hospital sites we may find it impossible to get a suitable site within a reasonable distance of an urban area or centre of population where we are anxious to establish an hospital.  There are important matters, such as sewerage and water facilities, that have to be taken into consideration and I feel that if this amendment were accepted we might be unduly handicapped in certain isolated instances in the selection of sites.  I quite realise the Deputy's point of view in relation to the amendment, but I think he can rely with safety on the Minister's good judgment, following the inquiry that will take place before a compulsory order is confirmed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamEThrift" hpid="Professor Thrift Professor Thrift">
      <NameTxt>Professor Thrift</NameTxt>
      <P>In order to give holders some feeling of security, would the Parliamentary Secretary consider whether he could not put something into the Bill which would safeguard the ordinary holder's rights so that he would not feel that he was absolutely at the mercy of the local authority, in the first place, and even of the local authority backed by the Minister? <Col N="1196" /> Small holders do feel that their rights of tenure are in real danger under a Bill like this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>We have already provided ample safeguards for the small holder from any undue hardship that might be inflicted by a local authority, inasmuch as the compulsory acquisition order must be confirmed by the Minister before it can become effective. The Deputy will, however, realise that hospital sites are usually acquired in towns and that the only holdings available within a reasonable distance of an urban area are small holdings.  If we exempt them, it seems to me that we may be driven out into the rural districts to build hospitals and that would create an impossible position.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary if there is not another class of property that might be prejudiced under this section. Take the case of a fairly good residential house on a small amount of land, say, under five acres, that is only occupied for some months in the year. The Minister may say: &ldquo;We will take those when we want them; they are not of very much use to their owners; and their owners will not be very much distressed by losing them.&rdquo;  There are a number of such houses up and down the country which are maintained in a very good state of repair and give a large amount of employment to keep them in order.  The fear of a thing is very often far worse than the thing itself.  If this is going to result in a number of good-class residential houses not being kept in the condition in which they are kept at present, the Minister will find that the position is very much worse than if, even occasionally, he had, possibly with the fears he has in his mind, to go into the open market and purchase a dwelling such as I have referred to instead of acquiring it by compulsory powers.  I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that is an aspect which he has not looked into and that it is well deserving of consideration, the amount of employment such good-class residential houses give throughout the year in order to keep them in order, many of them very often <Col N="1197" /> with a skeleton staff of servants.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to consider that aspect of the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>I was anxious to hear what the Parliamentary Secretary had to say in reply to Deputy Dockrell's question.  All of us know that in country districts, on the outskirts of towns, there is a substantial number of very desirable residences and this amendment seeks to preserve the amenities of those standing on less than five acres.  All of us can visualise that if there is an hospital, or some local convenience, in the vicinity of such a house it is bound to injure, not alone that property, but the surrounding property for a considerable distance on either side of it.  That is a thing that I am sure the Minister does not desire to do under the Bill.  It is all very well to say that we should leave it to the good sense of the Minister. In many cases the Minister does not know the damage that is being done at some considerable distance away.  He has only certain reports about the matter.  If he were to see the place I am sure his good sense would guide him in many cases.  The reports of the inquiry that is held will be before him, but those do not in all cases deal with the issue that is raised here, because that issue is not within the jurisdiction of the inquiry.  It is only in a case like the present, where a Bill is before us, that we can bring forward such a case.  I know it is not the intention of the Minister, but, as Deputy Thrift pointed out, to have this Act hanging over any person in such a place is an intolerable state of affairs, and will tend to depreciate the value of property.  I would ask the Minister seriously to consider the question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is any need further to discuss the amendment. I think the reasons I gave in reply to Deputy Thrift should have been sufficiently convincing.  I should think that Deputy Dockrell's arguments would have been more appropriately directed against the Second Reading of the Bill.  One would gather from his remarks on this <Col N="1198" /> amendment that we should not take powers to acquire compulsorily sites for hospitals at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">

    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the Deputy did not say so, but one would gather that from his remarks.  Deputy Good indicates that all owners of residential holdings throughout the Free State will be in a state of panic when this Bill becomes law.  It should not be necessary to inform the Deputy that we are not going to build hospitals wholesale all over the country, and that it is only in very exceptional circumstances that the powers sought in this Bill will be operated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>Already we have acquired a number of hospital sites throughout the country by agreement.  We intend to pursue that course as far as possible, and it is only where unreasonable difficulties are put in the way that the powers asked for in this Bill will be availed of.  Deputies will probably remember that on the Second Reading I gave some instances of the exorbitant prices asked for land that was suitable as a hospital site.  As soon as it is indicated to the public that the Minister would be likely to approve of a certain site, or that a certain site would probably be suitable for the purpose of building a hospital, the owner of the land demands about four or five times its market value. Very often he has no objection to the hospital being built on his land, but if it is the only suitable site available he demands a price for it which is altogether out of reason.  It is only in circumstances such as these that the powers asked for in the Bill will be availed of.  I do not think that Deputy Good's friends need be unduly alarmed. I do not think that the Minister will set out to acquire compulsorily residential holdings, and build hospitals in every townland.  No matter how successful the sweeps may be we do not intend to do anything of that kind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamEThrift" hpid="Professor Thrift Professor Thrift">
      <NameTxt>Professor Thrift</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to stress further Deputy Dockrell's argument, <Col N="1199" /> as I think it is a good one.  The Minister himself says that the cases in which compulsory acquirement will take place will be small.  My point is that even of that small number of cases a very small percentage will come under the amendment which I put down, whether it is a small holding of land or a small piece of land attached to a private house.  What the Minister will gain by the purchase of a site by compulsion as compared with the purchase of a site in the open market I think will not at all compensate him for what will be lost, in the feeling which people will have pretty widely &mdash;however small the number of cases may be&mdash;that they are less safe in their homes than they were before.  I would earnestly suggest that the Minister should consider whether he is really giving away anything of importance if he accepts an amendment of this kind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Alton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to reconsider this matter. Possibly at a further stage he could find a definition which would cover Deputy Thrift's point.  I know the anxiety is a real one, and though I am satisfied that the Minister would not use his powers in any unkind or malignant way he cannot answer for his successors, and the owners of such property would like and have a right to a feeling of security.  The class to which Deputy Thrift alludes is a very small one, and I think that it could be covered by some definition.  Such a definition ought not to be beyond the wit of man, especially a man of the Minister's powers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I point out to the Minister that a five-acre holding is a small one, and on those small holdings there are substantial houses?  The Minister should just picture to himself the position of a hospital building within that five acres, up against a house.  What is the value of that house?  It is open to him of course to take a portion of the land and to leave the house.  Surely that is unfair treatment.  I would seriously ask him to reconsider this question, as I am afraid it goes further than he intends it to go.</P>

      <P>There is just another point which occurs to me on this amendment.  We have heard some very high sounding sentiments and ideals from the Minister for Local Government in connection with the Town Planning Bill which has just passed through the Dáil.  The Department of Local Government and Public Health are expected to say a lot from time to time about lungs, and air space, and all that kind of thing, in connection with preserving suitable atmospheres for general public health. I would also ask, in conjunction with the Deputies who have already spoken, that the Minister would consider whether he is not asking his Department to swallow some of the grand things they said about town planning generally, when he is standing out against the suggestion contained in Deputy Thrift's amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>At the end of the section to add a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>This section shall not apply to&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  any &ldquo;glebe&rdquo; as defined by the Act of 38 and 39 Victoria, Chapter 42, which now is or hereafter shall be held or occupied by any ecclesiastical persons as by the same Act defined; or</P>
      <P>(b)  any land which consists of or forms part of land which was purchased under the provisions of the Irish Church Act, 1869, for a sum not exceeding £2,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1201" /> I hold even stronger views on this matter.  The amendment which I here propose, namely the exclusion of ecclesiastical glebes, embodies a principle which, I think, has been accepted both in the Land Act of 1923 and in all Acts which have passed enabling the acquisition of plots for small buildings. The arguments are very similar to those which we have already put forward. They apply especially, I think, to glebe houses and small lands attached to them which are most usually in close contiguity with churches.  I should like to hear the Minister's views and I hope he will see his way to accept this exclusion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is surplus land available and a suitable hospital site cannot be found anywhere else, I cannot see any logical reason why the surplus glebe land ought not to be acquired, after the usual process had been carried out, and why the owners of that land should not accept the same risks and conditions as ordinary private citizens have to accept under the Bill.  I foresee a further complication if the Deputy's amendment were carried.  There are other religious bodies that acquire available land around an urban district and it is almost entirely in urban districts that we have run up against this difficulty of getting suitable sites.  If we exempt the glebe lands, I should think that, in reason and fair play, we should have to exempt any land acquired by any other religious body or community, and again, we might find ourselves depriving the people of the most suitable site on which to erect their institution.  I do not see that any convincing case can be made for it.  As I said in relation to the other amendment, land will not be compulsorily acquired, or, at least, the order will have to be confirmed by the Minister, after the fullest investigation and after a public inquiry, and the Minister will certainly take into consideration <Col N="1202" /> all the arguments that can possibly be advanced as to why a particular plot of land should not be acquired, and I think the owners of the glebe lands ought to accept the position in relation to the compulsory order that ordinary citizens will have to accept.</P>

      <P>In my whole argument, of course, I am not pressing for any special privileges at all, but the position is this: you want to get a site within a certain radius of a certain place&mdash;say, a small country place&mdash;and you have circular points around that place and there are a few spots in it which are obviously spots which cannot be chosen without doing damage to somebody.  You gain one thing by sacrificing another advantage and I am only suggesting to the Parliamentary Secretary that he should in his Bill indicate that he already recognises that such spots are spots which ought to be put aside from the very first and that he is not handicapping himself or public bodies in making the exclusions I have indicated.  The most he could secure would be a small difference in price between the purchase of the site and the acquisition of a site by reason of a compulsory price being fixed.  As I have said, this principle has been accepted already, very often, if not always, and I seriously suggest that the Parliamentary Secretary should continue it in the future.</P>

I think, however, that he will agree that if a hospital is stuck up within a few yards of a building, it becomes a very different proposition.

If there was a case of a glebe of fair size, a local body would in every case, I am sure, find that it was the easiest land in respect of which to make an agreement. Many of these large glebes would be, of design and if possible, cut down and if there was any part of a large glebe land suitable for a hospital, I am perfectly certain it would be the easiest possible bit of land about which to make an agreement, either by a planning board or by the Minister himself. It is just the compulsoriness of this that I am arguing.</P>

      <P>Deputy Thrift's admission that the only objection he has to this proposal is its compulsory nature is an argument against the entire principle of the Bill.  The Bill is intended to give the Minister power compulsorily to acquire hospital sites&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and, as I have already explained to the Deputy, it is only in exceptional circumstances that these powers will have to be availed of but, again, I would ask Deputy Thrift if we exempt a certain class of land from the scope of the Bill, where are we going to draw the line?  Other religious communities can come along then and say: &ldquo;You exempted glebe lands from the scope of the Bill and why should you not exempt us?&rdquo;  and when we finish with religious communities, we will have other vested interests coming along.  I think the House can, with safety, accept the Bill as it stands and rely on the justice they will undoubtedly get from the Minister, following an inquiry in respect of a compulsory order and when he is about to confirm or refuse to confirm an order compulsorily acquiring land.  I do not know if Deputy Thrift has any real anxiety&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I should like the House to understand that on an occasion such as this when the House rises earlier than usual, the time allowed for the question on the adjournment is half an hour.  That is the established practice of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This morning I asked the President a question in these terms:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If he will state when the report of the Commissioner of the Gárda Síochána on Communism in Ireland that he promised on March 1st to lay on the Table of the Dáil, will be made available for, or circulated to members of the Dáil.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The question arises out of the fact that on March 1st in the first half of the three-hour speech made by the President there came a stage when he indicated that he was going to quote from official documents.  He reached that stage where he said: &ldquo;I have that report here&rdquo;&mdash;it was, I think he said himself, a report of 50 pages.  It was a lengthy report, anyhow&mdash;&ldquo;and I got it summarised.&rdquo;  At that stage it was fairly apparent that the President proposed to read from an official document. In order that he might be well on his guard and that he might advert to the fact that he was running the risk of putting himself in the position of being called upon to make that document available to the members when it might not be desirable that that should be done, I immediately interjected to ask if that report would be made available to members of the House.  The President, having so far not quoted from the report, said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I am going to give a summary&mdash; a statement with regard to counties&mdash; and the report, if necessary, can be put on the Table of the House.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>There were various interjections and he proceeded to read it, and as soon as he was getting into his swing, Deputy Dillon said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The President will publish the full report&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1211" /> The President said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The full report will be laid on the Table of the House for Deputies to read.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The President, when he made that promise, had a warning beforehand that that promise might be demanded of him, but he went ahead and read out what purported to be extracts.</P>
    <P>This morning, in the supplementary questions and replies that followed on my question, the President seemed to object strongly to the fact that there is a tradition in this House that if an official document is quoted by a Minister, that document not being available to other members, the complete document should be made available. He seemed to think there was something unnecessary in that.  If, when the President was speaking on the 1st March, he had said &ldquo;I have examined carefully all the information which comes through official channels with regard to Communism in this country and I am satisfied that Communism is non-existent, or approximately non-existent, here and nobody need in any way concern himself about it,&rdquo; he would presumably have been working on the contents of reports; he would actually have been stating what was his judgment and if, for instance, it afterwards transpired that his judgment had been wrong the public would say &ldquo;The President is a person incapable of judging in these matters and he is wrong.&rdquo;  But if he selects from an official document pieces that may be completely misleading, he is not taking the responsibility; he is throwing back the responsibility for the impression he is creating, not upon himself or upon his Government, but upon officials who are unable to intervene and who are prevented from saying that the extracts the President quoted were such as to give a completely wrong idea of what the official reports contained.</P>
    <P>Consequently, it is desirable and necessary, when a Minister wishes to convey the judgment he has formed from the perusal of official documents, that he should make it clear it is his own judgment and that he is not <Col N="1212" /> making quotations.  We know, and it has been done quite often, that little bits can be selected which are completely misleading.  You can say &ldquo;This is from the report itself,&rdquo; and make the person who wrote the report responsible for the wrong impression. Personally, with all respect to the President and to the high office he occupies, I may say I do not trust his judgment in these matters.  I do not need to go further than the first page he read from the report and his succeeding comment.  When the President read the report he said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;And this is an extract from the report put here in the summary prepared for me.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He is not responsible, but some unfortunate official is.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There does not appear to be any definite effort to bring Communistic influence to bear on the unemployed as at present organised, for there is no distinct organisation of unemployed under Communistic auspices.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That states that in the opinion of the police, as there is no definite unemployed organisation in Cork under Communistic auspices, they consider that there is no definite effort to bring Communistic influence to bear on the unemployed in Cork.  That is all there is contained in that.  That is all that flows directly or derivatively from that. How does the President interpret that?  He says there is no Communism in Cork&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>On the adjournment a question is raised for the elucidation of further facts relative to the main question, to get further information from the Minister responsible, but certainly not to debate and reply to statements made on another occasion in the House and not relevant to the question when some report will be published and made available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I may have somewhat misunderstood the situation.  I was not satisfied with the President's reply this morning, not because I thought the House had been placed in the position of having to demand that <Col N="1213" /> report and get it, but merely for the reason that since the present Government came into power a certain practice seems to have been observed. Time and again various Ministers, the President in the Mulcahy charge, for instance, and the Minister for Finance on a number of occasions have made quotations.  The Minister for Defence at one time quoted extracts from evidence in an Army inquiry, and refused to produce the full evidence.  The late Minister for Justice, Deputy Geoghegan, having quoted from a document, refused to publish the document. The habit has grown up here amongst Ministers of taking advantage of the fact that they are in possession of official documents and they come along and quote pieces from these documents.  In the case where evidence was quoted, and there was then a refusal to give the whole evidence, that was clearly a grotesque distortion of justice and right.</P>
      <P>The real reason that I am raising this matter is so that we may have a clear understanding.  When Ministers are going to speak on their own authority, and give their judgments, they may do so freely, but when they are going to throw the responsibility on some official document or some official, then they must make the full document available, so that we will be able to judge whether the Ministers are doing justice or misrepresenting what the official said and then blaming the official for the misrepresentation. I desire to call attention to the reply I got to-day:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In course of debate on the 1st March when reading a brief summary of the report referred to, I stated, in reply to an interruption by the Deputy, that the report, if necessary, could be placed on the Table of the House.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Certainly that is true and nobody can say it is otherwise than true; but, at the same time, it is typically disingenuous. The President did say that, but he was careful not to mention&mdash;I think I dragged it out of him&mdash; the fact that he said to Deputy Dillon:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1214" />&ldquo;The full report will be laid on the Table of the House for Deputies to read.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In his reply he went on:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I have since given this matter the most careful consideration, and I think, and am advised, that it is not in the public interest that a confidential police document of this nature should be published.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It might have been that the President inadvertently slipped before he thought of what he was doing, and then he began to read the document.  But he read it after I had warned him of the claim that would be made if he did read it.  Having done that, he now says that when he had been allowed to read that document, and when he told us that the full document would be made available, he afterwards went back to consider whether or not it was in the public interest, and then he decided that it was not in the public interest.</P>
    <P>He goes on to say:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I hope that it will be sufficient to make the full report available in confidence to leaders of the Parties in the House.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Suppose it did happen that when that document was made available to leaders of Parties in the House they looked at it and saw that not the President but the Bishops in this country were right with regard to Communism, what could the leaders of the Opposition do?  They would be in possession of a document&mdash;this is purely a hypothetical case, I admit&mdash;which made it abundantly clear that the people should be warned of a danger that menaced them.  But if they attempted to do that the President would say: &ldquo;You are betraying a confidence. That document was only given in confidence.&rdquo;  To propose under these circumstances to make that document available to leaders of Parties in confidence was a scandalous proposal.</P>
    <P>He goes further.  He says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If despite the consideration of public interest, however, Deputies press for it, I shall fulfil the promise I gave.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1215" /> Just note what that means.  The President, who is President solely for the protection of public interest in this country, says that because he gave his word that he would do a certain thing and then afterwards looked into it and saw that if he did that, it would be endangering the public interest in this country, then says&mdash;trying to put the responsibility for it on us&mdash;that he is prepared to prostitute the very functions he is supposed to serve in order to safeguard his own personal honour and to make public a document which it is against the public interest to make known; and he proposes only to do that when he is pressed by us to make it public.  It is the President's responsibility, I agree, but I, certainly, am not going to press the President to do a thing which he himself admits is wrong and which, although he admits it is wrong, he is prepared to do.</P>
    <P>He says: &ldquo;If, despite the consideration of public interest,&rdquo; we insist.  We have not the power to insist, but ordinary decency should commend it to the President that if, time and again, this sort of thing occurs just as a few weeks ago the Minister for Finance began reading out a document and went as far as reading out the date of it, and then, when he was asked to read out the full document, discovered that it might reveal something that might not have borne out what he had suggested, then did a little trick and said that he was not quoting the document but only saying what was in it&mdash;ordinary decency should commend the stopping of that sort of thing.  This sort of thing has been a scandal in the House and I want it to be agreed to here now that Ministers will take their jobs seriously and that if it is undesirable that a document be made available to the public, they themselves will not, arbitrarily, and, if I may say so without offence, in a cowardly fashion, quote parts of a document and then say that it would not be in the public interest to publish the documents, because they find the thing would be rather against them.  This has happened quite frequently since the Government came into power.  The President, <Col N="1216" /> about three weeks ago, gave a promise that he would make this document available and now he proceeds not to do it.  Why did he insist, after the warning from me, on going ahead and reading what purported to be extracts?  There was no need for it.  He could have said that he and the Minister for Justice had read every document that came from official sources and that their judgment was, after reading these reports, that there was no fear of Communism in the country.  I admit that such a statement would not have affected me in the least.  The President's arguments on that occasion were too puerile.  He quoted election figures. We could have pointed out that in 1922 the number of people in Russia who were organised Communists was only 2 per cent. of the population, whereas in the same year in Germany the number of organised Communists was 15 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, Sir, I think that the reason the President insisted on doing this, was that he wanted to disprove what the Bishops had stated with regard to the facts in this country. He comes along and gives us what purports to be the gist or the general tendency of the police reports with regard to this matter.  Personally, I believe that even if the police reports said that there was not an atom of Communism in this country, it would not have affected me much, but I think it is an abuse of the privileges of this House and an abuse of the President's position and that of the Ministers that, when they feel they are not able to face up to the arguments of the Opposition, they should seek to shelter themselves in this sort of way by saying: &ldquo;We have official documents that tell us such and such a thing,&rdquo; and, when they are asked to produce the documents, do not do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Time and again there have been these bits taken from their context in order to misrepresent us.  One thing that has been done regularly by Ministers opposite is that they always twist about a phrase of mine to the <Col N="1217" /> effect that &ldquo;We need not blink the fact that if there were a general attack on these islands we would be on the side of England.&rdquo;  That phrase of mine has always been twisted to mean something it did not.  Time and again, too, a statement by Deputy McGilligan, with regard to the Government's responsibility for providing employment, was distorted and thrown about to misrepresent what he said.  I do think that the President who, time and again, has got up and demanded that people should use exactly his words and no other words, and who, time and again, gets up and gives what purports to be the substance of statements and which, when set out, clearly are not the substance, apart from the dignity of his position, should be most exact and most careful not to abuse the privileges of his position.</P>
    <P>I do not propose demanding that this document be made available, and I think that if I did demand it, he should refuse to do so, if what he states is true, that it is against the public interest to publish the document, although he is prepared to commit that crime.  That seems to me to be a most extraordinary statement to make.  I may have given the wrong reason, but he was very anxious to make people believe what he was saying, although he thought people might be justified in not believing what he said, but he could have said that that was the reason he insisted on quoting from the document and that that procedure would not be continued in the future.  As you have stipulated, Sir, that the whole object of this question is to ventilate dissatisfaction as to the reply given to me, my sole reason in getting up is to insist on getting further information, but if, in insisting on getting further information, I would be compounding a felony with the President in trying to injure the public interest in this country, I can go no further in the matter.</P>

      <P>The first matter that arises in this connection is, what is the tradition of the House?  It would appear, from certain remarks of the Deputy who has just spoken, that whatever tradition was there we had <Col N="1218" /> set aside, and we are accused of doing certain things which would seem to be peculiar to us.  I have asked to have the reports looked up for cases where this very subject of the extent to which documents could be used by Ministers and the question of having the documents put in their entirety before the House, have been raised already, and I find that they go back to Vol. 5.  That is a long way behind the present Government.  The matter was also raised in Vol. 18.  We have references to it almost identical with the present one, as far as the principle is concerned.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>We will come to that in time.  I have listened very patiently to the Deputy.  As I say, it is referred to in Vol. 18.  It is referred to in Vol. 28.  It is referred to in Vol. 32.  It is referred to in Vols. 36, 39, 44 and 48. Now, it seems that this is a standing question, and, of course, it is a difficult question.  There is no use in our pretending that there is not a very important matter in it.  There is; and the question is really this&mdash;whether Ministers, in order to assure the House, can give the House extracts&mdash; relevant extracts&mdash;from official reports or not.  Take, for instance, the case we had in point; that is, the case of Communism.  There is not the slightest doubt that there has been, on the part of the Opposition, both when they were a Government and since they have become an Opposition, an attempt to create a scare about this thing.  The Deputy referred to the Bishops.  I was not replying to the Bishops.  I was replying to the Deputies and those who are working with them who, although they knew the contrary to be true, tried to get this scare so developed and to give it such an effect upon the country that they could excuse the bringing into existence of a private army.  The best way of disproving that was to give extracts.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, Sir.  The President states that, although we knew a thing to be untrue, we asserted otherwise.  I say that that is an absolutely untrue <Col N="1219" /> statement.  I do not know whether the President was in order in making it or not.</P>

      <P>That was my belief, at any rate.  Whether it was justifiable or not, I cannot say.  Knowing that that report was submitted to me by the then Chief of Police I felt that giving a summary of it was necessary in order to convince Deputies that it was a scare.  There will be and must be occasions on which Ministers will have to do just that; they will have to give at least a summary of the reports which they get.  It is not a question of trying to put the blame on somebody else or not taking responsibility for the statement.  I am quite prepared to give my judgment of the report.  My judgment of the report is that it did not justify any feeling of insecurity, that there was nothing that would justify the setting up of a private army, if anything could justify the setting up of a private army.  The first thing is that there is a very delicate and difficult thing to deal with here&mdash;to what extent Ministers are to be permitted to give extracts from reports.  Are they to be entirely precluded? That is obviously always the wish of the Opposition.  These references here have all been raised by the Opposition against the existing Executive.  Undoubtedly, it is possible for the Executive to take little bits and scraps and selected passages and give a false impression.  I do not think there is any defence possible against an Executive that is prepared to do that.  But is the Executive to be precluded, because it can be abused, from just giving extracts which prove to Deputies that they have been misinformed? If so it means either that the Ministers are to be precluded and the necessary information withheld, or that confidential reports, in their entirety, are to be published.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1220" /> That brings us to what is the tradition of the House.  I have looked up the Official Reports before we came into office and I find that the simplest form of the rule, as stated by the Ceann Comhairle, was this:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The rule about documents is that when a Minister quotes from an official document and is asked to lay the document on the Table of the House he does so unless he contends that, for reasons of public interest, he should not do so.&rdquo;  (Official Reports, Volume 32, Col. 1305).</P>
    <P>It is clearly indicated there that a Minister, in giving extracts from a document, may say: &ldquo;I cannot put the document in its entirety before the House because it is not in the public interest to do so.&rdquo;  Deputy Fitzgerald, in an interruption, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I suppose this report will be made available to the members of this House.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Being aware that on one occasion, at any rate, the Ceann Comhairle had said that a document like this, if quoted from, would have to be laid on the Table of the House, I said in reply:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am going to give a summary&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&mdash;whether a summary falls under the general rule or not is a question&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;a statement with regard to counties&mdash;and the report, if necessary, can be put on the Table of the House.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is if it were demanded and if the rules of the House required it.  That is clear.  In reply to a later interruption by Deputy Dillon, I said that the full report would be laid on the Table of the House for Deputies to read.  As I explained to-day, I find that putting it on the Table of the House means more than that&mdash;that it means the possibility of general publication. Having taken all those points into consideration I suggested to the Opposition that they should be content with having a copy given confidentially to their leader so that he could satisfy himself whether the summary I gave was a fair summary or not.  That was refused.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>All right.  To-day I said that, in my opinion, it was not in the public interest that the document should be published.  I said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If the Deputies press for it I am prepared, however, to keep my promise.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Deputy tries to pretend that it necessarily follows that I was prepared to sacrifice the public interest in order to keep personally to a promise that I made.  But the Deputy had already this morning, before he thought of that particular aspect of it, stated&mdash;and I remind him of it:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;There are various aspects of public interest.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>One of the aspects is this: whether the Opposition, by a manoeuvre of this sort, should be put into a position in which they would be able to say to the country that there is in reality this Communistic danger, this menace; whether it is not of greater public importance that the country should realise exactly the extent of the danger; or that the people whose names are mentioned in this document should have to write, as the Parish Priest of Finglas had to write, and as other people had to write, that this accusation of Communism against them was completely unfounded.  I believe that Deputies are simply manoeuvring about this; that they know it is inconvenient for individuals, and a source of annoyance to them, to have a document containing their names published.  Not merely from the point of view of inconvenience to individuals, but also from a police point of view it is inadvisable that it should be done.  They know that that consideration must of necessity bear weightily upon me.  Of course it does, but a bigger consideration is that the gentlemen on the opposite benches should not be able to create a scare, and under cover of it get away with their private army, which is a much bigger danger to this State.</P>
