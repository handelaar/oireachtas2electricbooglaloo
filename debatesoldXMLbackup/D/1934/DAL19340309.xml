      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the Land Bond Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill makes provision for the creation and issue of further land <Col N="470" /> bonds for the purpose of acquisition of untenanted land under the Land Acts 1923-1933, for the resumption of holdings and for the compulsory acquisition of land for playing fields, sports fields, playgrounds, etc., and for the acquisition of sporting rights in certain cases.  The total issue of land bonds to be created and issued under the Act will be limited to £10,000,000. The land bonds will be created as and when required, from time to time, by order of the Minister for Finance. Each order will prescribe the rate of interest to be borne on the bonds created under it, but the rate will not be less than 3 per cent., or more than 4 per cent. per annum.  It is considered that the rate of interest on the bonds created by each order should be related to the rate of interest payable on the latest issue of the National Loan at the date of such order, having regard to the figure at which the Loan stands on the Dublin Stock Exchange.  A small, fractional increase in the rate of interest payable on the land bonds above that earned on the National Loan might be regarded as permissible owing to the fact that there may be only a limited market in the land bonds of each series as compared with the market in the National Loan.  These are the fundamental principles underlying the measure.  Deputies no doubt are aware that in sub-section (2) of Section 25 of the Land Act of 1923 it was laid down that in default of agreement the price to be paid for untenanted land shall be such as may be fixed by the Land Commission, other than the judicial commissioner, or by the judicial commissioner, on appeal, from the Land Commission.  It is also laid down that regard should be had to the fair value of the land to the Land Commission and the owner respectively. It is obvious that the fair value of the land to the Land Commission is the price that could be obtained on resale to the allottees; it is more difficult to decide what is the fair value of the land to the owner.</P>
    <P>The case of tenanted land is perhaps simpler because income from tenanted land is comparatively certain as in the case of holdings subject to a judicial <Col N="471" /> rent fixed for a period of years.  In this connection however it is not to be forgotten that landlords were often compelled to forgive altogether arrears even on judicial rents which had accrued during long periods of agricultural depression.  Incomes derived from tenanted land were naturally more certain than incomes from untenanted land and to that extent it is more simple to assess the fair value of the land, but, equally, like incomes from untenanted land they vary from year to year.  It is obvious that the price of land purchased by the Land Commission will, therefore, vary as it falls into one or other of these categories but, in any event, it will be a fair price; and all that we are concerned with in the Bill is to provide for its payment in an equitable way. It is considered that an equitable price for land can be fixed on a proper basis if the rate of interest on land bonds, representing the purchase money, corresponds to the yield that might be secured from investments in the latest issue of National Loan current at the date of fixing the purchase price.  The rate of interest should be such as would enable the land bonds to be sold by the vendor for an amount equal to the cash that a purchaser, other than the Land Commission, would be willing to pay for the land.  The interest on the land bonds should also be such that the prospective income to be derived from them if retained by the vendor would be at least equivalent to the income that would be earned from trustee investments if the purchase money were to be paid in cash by a person other than the Land Commission and invested in such investments by the vendor.  It is, therefore, clear I believe that the vendor is being treated with the utmost fairness if he receives land bonds at a rate of interest that at the date of issue would ensure them being quoted about par. It is upon these lines that the provisions of the Bill will be given effect to if the Oireachtas makes it law.</P>
    <P>As to the sections of the Bill itself, Section 2 provides that the purchase money payable to the vendor in future, shall be payable in land bonds issued <Col N="472" /> under the Act except in cases where the payment of the purchase money is governed by previous Acts.  The House will no doubt remember that towards the end of last year, the Land Bonds Act was introduced which authorised the Minister for Finance to issue land bonds to the value of £1,000,000, being the amount which it was estimated would be required to complete pending purchases, and pending purchase agreements arising out of the Land Acts prior to that of 1933.  Under this Bill it will not be possible to issue bonds or to compel the vendor to take bonds issued under it in respect of his purchase money under agreements and for transactions made under any other Act than that of the Act of 1923, and such subsequent Acts as experience may indicate, are necessary or desirable.  The land bonds are to be accepted by the vendor at their nominal value.</P>
    <P>Section 2 further provides that in cases where the purchase money is payable by means of an issue of land bonds created under the Act, the claims against the purchase money shall be discharged by payment in land bonds of the same series.  That is to say if we issue land bonds under this Act we shall have to accept, in discharge of any claims against holdings or estates taken over, land bonds of the same identical issue.  We cannot compel a person who is paid in 4 per cent. land bonds to discharge his liability in 4½ per cent. land bonds.</P>
    <P>Section 3 provides that advances made to tenants and others for the purchase of holdings or allotments shall be made by an issue of land bonds created under this Act.  Sub-section (2) applies the provision of earlier Land Acts to the repayment of these advances.  Under these provisions as so applied, the advances will be repaid by means of purchase annuities or other annual sums until the advance is redeemed.  But power is given to redeem advances in whole or in part during the currency of the annuity.</P>
    <P>Sub-section (1) of Section 4 empowers the Minister for Finance, from time to time by order, to <Col N="473" /> create a series of land bonds of such total amount and such denominations as he shall think proper.  The rate of interest payable on each series of bonds will be specified in the Order, but it is not to be less than 3 or more than 4 per cent. per annum. The bonds in each series are to be subject to such conditions as the Minister shall specify, but such conditions cannot, of course, override the conditions set out in Section 7 of the Bill.  Sub-section (2) is intended to provide that the Minister may, if necessary, direct that bonds of a certain series may be used for making advances, having regard not to the date of the advance but to the date of the agreement to purchase.  For instance, if an agreement to purchase be made during the period when an issue of bonds then current carries interest at the rate of 4 per cent. and if for some reason or another the transaction is not completed until a new issue of bonds has been made at a lower rate, then the bonds handed over in completion of the transaction would bear interest at the higher rate: that is, the rate of interest current upon the date on which the agreement to purchase was made.</P>
    <P>Sub-section (3) empowers the Minister to consolidate different series of land bonds when the rate of interest on such series is the same.  Sub-section (4) provides that each Order shall specify the sums to be set aside half-yearly in the Land Bond Fund.  These sums will, of course, depend on the rate of interest and the sinking fund to be paid on advances. Sub-section (5) provides that every Order made by the Minister shall fix the rate of the purchase annuities, or other annual sums payable for the repayment of the purchase money advanced, by means of an issue of land bonds created under the Order. Sub-section (6) provides that every Order made under the section shall lie on the Table of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Section 5 is not exactly the same as Section 4.  It provides for the issue of land bonds as distinct from their creation.  Section 6 limits the amount of the land bonds to be created and issued under the Act to £10,000,000. The Land Commission has calculated, <Col N="474" /> I may say, that about £4,500,000 will be required for the purchase of untenanted land and about £4,500,000 for resumed holdings and other lands compulsorily acquired for the relief of congestion, the provision of sports fields, and the other purposes to which I referred at the beginning of my speech.  Sub-section (2) of this section also provides that the land bonds advanced for the purchase of lands in respect to agreements entered into on or before the 31st December, 1935, shall bear interest at the rate of 4 per cent. per annum.  Section 7 contains provisions similar to those contained in the Land Bond Acts of 1925 and 1933 with regard to the payment of interest on, and the redemption of, land bonds.  The interest is to be paid half-yearly and the bonds are to be redeemed by means of periodical drawings.  Bonds transferred by the judicial commissioner in redemption of purchase annuities are to be subject to immediate redemption after the expiration of 30 years from the date of the passing of the Act.  Any bonds then outstanding may be redeemed at par by the Minister for Finance.  In the event of the Land Bond Fund being unable to pay the interest on the bonds, or the money required for redemption, liability for the payments is made a charge upon the Central Fund.  If it is necessary to make payments out of the Central Fund the amount so paid will be refunded out of the Guarantee Fund, but only to the extent of the revised annuities in arrear.</P>
    <P>It will thus be seen that the land bonds under this issue are secured in three ways: first, upon the land for the purchase of which they have been issued; secondly, upon the Guarantee Fund, and ultimately upon the Central Fund of the State.  Section 8 applies the provisions of Section 5 of the Land Act of 1923 relating to the costs fund of the bonds issued under this Bill.  Section 9 directs that in the accounts kept of the Land Bond Fund the Minister shall distinguish between transactions financed by the issue of land bonds under previous Acts and between transactions financed by the issue of each series of land bonds under the present Bill.  Section <Col N="475" /> 10 gives the usual power to the Minister for Finance to make regulations for carrying the provisions of the Bill into effect, and to adapt, for the purposes of the Bill, any provision relating to land purchase finance contained in any previous Act.</P>
    <P>I think I have given a fairly full explanation of the principles which underlie this Bill and of the manner in which it is proposed to operate it. I have only to say in regard to it that it is a Bill of extreme urgency: that many important transactions are held up awaiting its passage into law.  I trust that the House will see its way to facilitate me, if possible, by permitting me to take all the stages to-day so that the Bill may be in the Seanad next week and may become law before the close of the financial year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, in his preliminary remarks, indicated in a general way what would influence the price paid for land.  If I understood him rightly he said that in the matter of tenanted land or land held under a judicial tenancy&mdash;it was news to me that there are any judicial tenancies now&mdash;the price paid would be such a capital sum that, invested in the National Loan or otherwise, but invested at the rate then obtainable for National Loan, would produce a profit rent on the land being purchased. As regards untenanted lands, I understood him to say that the computation of the price would be based on what a private purchaser would give for that land in the open market.  If these are the principles on which it is proposed to work that part of the Act when computing the price, then I think that the method, in broad outline, is a fair one for arriving at a price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now we come to the Bill itself.  It really represents the financial section of the Land Act of last year.  This Bill will provide the money to work that Act.  I am afraid the Minister hardly grasps the importance of this Bill when he asks the House to sign, seal and deliver a loan of £10,000,000 in an hour or two.  It is a very easy way of <Col N="476" /> getting money, if money can be obtained so expeditiously as that.</P>
    <P>I am afraid the Minister did not pass this Bill before him in proper perspective. In considering this Bill we cannot forget that the present Government has dissipated the savings of the past and destroyed the opportunities of the present.  This Bill is their proposal to mortgage the future.  I must not be understood, in speaking against this Bill, as being in any way opposed to the subdivision of ranches and the planting of people on the land. I can say in passing that there is not a man in this House who has given more of his own time and money to further the cause of the back-to-the-land movement than I, but I am speaking on this Bill as a Finance Bill and it is nothing else.  We passed Estimates yesterday for about £30,000,000.  We are told that about £5,000,000 more will have to go on to that to meet services for the coming year.  We know that in addition to that we have to pay the British £5,000,000 in annuities and other payments. That brings our national commitments to £40,000,000.  I suppose the local rate will not be far short of £10,000,000.  The total would be anywhere from £45,000,000 to £50,000,000. That is a first charge on this country. I wonder what acreage of arable land we have?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCurran" hpid="Mr. Curran Mr. Curran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
      <P>12,000,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should say that 12,000,000 would be a generous estimate.  Therefore, we have a first charge of £4 per acre on all the arable land of the country.  The Minister wants to mortgage the future of that land now with a gesture of: &ldquo;Hurry up, boys; give me this in an hour and let me be going on to spend it.&rdquo;  He wants to mortgage the future of this land to the tune of £10,000,000.  Any businessman in this House or outside it knows businessmen's problems. There is no businessman in this country, be he big or small, but remembers the day when he went to interview his bank manager for an overdraft.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us consider the case of the managing director of this country who <Col N="477" /> at the moment, in matters of finance, is Deputy MacEntee, the Minister for Finance.  Let him go on behalf of his company, the Free State, to a bank manager and ask for an overdraft of £10,000,000.  That is what he is asking us for.  The bank manager will ask him: &ldquo;Well, how does your credit stand?&rdquo;&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; he will say, &ldquo;I tried to borrow an item of £6,000,000 a couple of months ago.  I put it up to the public to subscribe it at 80 per cent. above the current bank rate of interest in London and the public would not subscribe it.&rdquo;  The bank manager will then say: &ldquo;Now do you want me to give other people's money to you; after a pistol has been held to the heads of the banks of this country to disgorge and subscribe what the public would not subscribe, you want another £10,000,000 on top of that £6,000,000.&rdquo;  That is the first shot and the first counter-shot.</P>
    <P>Then, to carry it a step further, the bank manager will say, &ldquo;Yours is an agricultural concern.  I read in the papers where your colleague asked an Opposition Deputy a couple of days ago to sing himself to sleep by repeating the words &lsquo;wheat, beet and peat&rsquo; and, when he would wake up the next morning before his morning breakfast, his cigarette or pipe, to repeat the refrain &lsquo;wheat, beet and peat&rsquo;&rdquo;. Now, sir, the manager would naturally say to him: &ldquo;How much wheat are you growing?&rdquo;&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; he would reply, &ldquo;I have increased the acreage under wheat by 60,000 acres above what our predecessors were growing.&rdquo;&ldquo;I am not concerned,&rdquo; the bank manager would say, &ldquo;with how much you have increased it, but how much have you increased your bank account in respect of wheat?  That is my concern.&rdquo;  The Minister could only show a deficit and then would come the next step.  The bank manager would ask: &ldquo;Well, how is the beet going?&rdquo; and the Minister would reply: &ldquo;Oh, our predecessors were producing a trifle, which we inherited, of 20,000 tons.  We want slightly over 100,000 tons for our requirements and we are getting busy. We have got the authority of the Dáil and we are getting busy constructing factories to deal with that 80,000 tons <Col N="478" /> to supplement the 20,000 in order to meet our full requirements.&rdquo;  What business scheme can you lay before him with regard to that?  &ldquo;I have read,&rdquo; the bank manager, I assume, will say, &ldquo;your speech on the introduction of the Sugar Bill.  My recollection is this, that when everything is going in full going order you will be producing 80,000 tons at a loss of £800,000 a year.  Do you expect me to lend people's money on a concern like that?&rdquo;  We are making bog roads and we are borrowing for that £100,000 of the people's money&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had for two days a debate on the economic conditions of the country.  Surely the Deputy does not imagine that going into the financial aspect of beet, wheat or peat, is relevant to this motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit, Sir, subject to your ruling, of course, that this Bill to provide £10,000,000 of land bonds that we are asked to vote on to-day is, in its very nature, seeking authority to force a loan from the citizens of this country.  If the citizens of this country are able to give that forced loan they must have some assets as security for that forced loan.  I do not want to deal with these particular items in the way they have been dealt with in the last few days and previously.  To be quite candid, I am tired of hearing them repeated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaSnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>There are more than you tired of hearing them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure of that. Therefore, when I mention them I do not want to labour them or their place in the economic mechanism, but I want to analyse the security that we have for this forced loan.  Only in that regard I want to deal with it.  Those three items I have mentioned cannot stand on their own legs.  Dairying has to be subsidised too.  Store and fat cattle have to be subsidised.  The same has to be said of sheep, pigs, poultry and eggs.  The standard price to be fixed for potatoes will be 35/- a ton.  Supposing the whole outfit were put up for auction&mdash;there are some auctioneers here&mdash;what <Col N="479" /> auctioneer would guarantee £4 conacre for the land of the Free State?  I know that a statute acre of land in the Free State hardly anywhere would fetch £4 conacre, and that is the first charge.  We turn now to the industrial side.  Not one of those industries can stand on its own legs.  They have to be protected by a tariff wall.  Ability to pay that tariff depends upon the productive capacity of agriculture, which, considering the various items of agriculture separately or collectively, is not in a sound economic condition at the present time.  Anybody could turn around to the Minister and say: &ldquo;Your proposition is really further to mortgage a concern, I will not say a bankrupt one but one that cannot show a profit balance sheet, and to use that money to buy land from those people who now have it and cannot make it pay&mdash;though those men have been living on it and have been trained to work it&mdash;and to divide it up, at the cost of the State, with charges greater for the incoming man than his predecessor had; with the danger that the incoming occupier or purchaser will not be selected on the basis of competency to work the land but on some political basis.&rdquo;  How can it be proved as a business proposition that that is borrowing money for a sound investment? The moral, of course, is that the Minister and his Government, before taking land from Jack and giving it to Bill, should put agriculture in a paying position for Jack or Bill. If not, we are going to accelerate the pace to bankruptcy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could quote various independent opinions on the state of this country, and there is one independent opinion which goes to show that the economic condition of this country is such that the country as a whole is a non-paying proposition.  Instead of our Government applying itself to making it a paying proposition it tries to camouflage the position by forcing a loan out of the people's pockets which they would not give in the ordinary way. If this proposition is sound why does not the Minister float stock and buy the land with stock?  I would make him another suggestion; I will put it <Col N="480" /> to him by way of a query, which I hope he will answer.  Supposing there are £5,000 in bonds paid to a farmer for portion of his land, and supposing that farmer has £100 a year to pay in annuities afterwards; will the Government accept those bonds at their face value in payment of those annuities; or if that farmer wants to redeem the annuities on any land he still holds will the Land Commission accept those bonds at their face value to redeem that land annuity; or will they allow the man who gets those bonds to sell them to a neighbour who wants to pay his annuity or redeem his annuity?  This is the most preposterous proposition that I ever heard or read of any responsible Minister or any responsible man in any position conceiving.  How does the Minister expect that the State will be indemnified against this loss?  Who gets the power to issue those bonds?  Who buys £10,000,000 worth of land?  There will be a loss upon each little holding that will be parcelled out of that land.  The cost of that land to each allotee will be greater for that unit than it was to his predecessor, and we have it acknowledged from the Government Benches&mdash;of course we knew it without their acknowledgment&mdash;that agriculture is in a depressed condition. When the owner of the land is not able to make the land pay how will the increased charge on that land be paid by the new allotee?</P>
    <P>Remember that machinery of this kind was tried before.  National Loan could be floated easily and over-subscribed in a few days.  Prices for all agricultural commodities were higher and producers in this country could get the full world price for their produce, but they cannot get it now. Perhaps depression has reached a greater intensity now than it has any time and even though the price is rising in America and England, we have not got the advantages of that rise nor can we get the advantages of that rise for reasons which the Minister knows very well.  The fixed policy of the Minister, the boasted achievement of the Minister and his colleagues, is that we will not get those world prices <Col N="481" /> in future and that the market in which we got them is gone and yet we are going to parcel out the land, forcing money out of people's pockets and mortgaging their credit, and give it to people who have not much experience, or, perhaps, have no experience, and expect them to pay. &ldquo;Ultimately,&rdquo; said the Minister, &ldquo;the charge will be on the Central Fund.&rdquo;  Of course, the charge will be on the Central Fund and the Central Fund will have to bear it while it is able.</P>
    <P>Another important aspect of the situation is that these allottees will, of necessity, of course, be small farmers. They will have to start at the bottom to produce and when the whole economic effect of our exclusion from the world market works itself down to its natural level, it is the small farmer who will have to bear the brunt of that low level of prices, because he will be the producer of the young stock and it is at the point of production that the economic loss will settle down because the man who buys from him will buy to make a profit and will buy at such a price as will enable him to make a profit.  The next man who buys from him will do ditto and the man who produces will have to take any price that the fellows up the ladder will give him. They can only give a price that will pay them to handle the stock and, perhaps, feed them for a while.  The allottees who will get the land purchased by this money will be the people, so to speak, on the bottom storey, producing the livestock and who will have to bear the brunt of all the low prices.  How are they going to pay?  The Minister is not concerned. I can see the Minister haranguing an audience in County Dublin and saying: &ldquo;Deputy Belton often came here advocating a back-to-the-land movement but he opposed the measure in the Dáil that would enable the people to get back to the land.&rdquo;  I am opposing the putting of people into slavery. That is what it is and every man who knows anything about land knows that. I am not afraid to defend my action either in County Dublin or County Meath where I have advocated that back-to-the-land movement.  You are <Col N="482" /> going to put these people into slavery by putting them in to do a job that is physically impossible.  I remember, on one occasion, hearing the classic solution of an agricultural grievance by Deputy O'Reilly in the suggestion, put seriously, of controlling the price of calves and weanling calves. I heard him suggesting that in his best sensible mood.  They will be controlled and the victims of that control will be the very people whom it is proposed in this Bill to plant on the land as slaves.  We should break up a lot of the ranches and turn them into production in this country but nobody is ging to produce, not even if you stand over him with a whip&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister for Finance on agriculture for three or four hours is a gem!  He possibly did not waste the time of the House because not many listened to him and nobody will ever read him.  To deal exhaustively with this matter would take too long, and I do not propose to do so.  I have touched only on the simple factors of the situation and asked people to think about it before they vote for the Bill. Normally, the Bill should go through and go through quickly and if the new little farms that are to be parcelled out could be given to people who had any hope of surviving, this Bill would go through very expeditiously and I would be one of its strongest advocates, but, like many other aspects of Government policy, I have very grave misgivings with regard to the result of the things they are doing when they are not handled in the right way and at the right time.  To put a man to work on a farm at a time when every product of that farm shows a loss is not good business.  There is another side to it which even in the best of times, it would be well for the Government to bear in mind&mdash;and I am not saying but that their predecessors sinned a little in this&mdash;no man should get land unless he shows an aptitude for working that land&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I was going to make a suggestion, but I will not.  However, I just want to sum up, without going into all the details necessary in this, and to point out to the Minister that agriculture is depressed the world over-artificially depressed here, and that, at least, that artificial depression should be removed before the Minister comes to this House and asks for a forced loan of £10,000,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>We are.  The perfectly right way to remove it, or to do anything, is that you must first make up your mind to do it.  If you do not make up your mind that a thing wants to be done, you will never tackle it.  The Deputy's Party says, <Col N="484" /> in effect, that artificial depression is here and that it is going to remain, thank God.  We do not say that.  We have the mind to remove that artificial depression, and when that artificial depression is removed and when our exclusion from world markets ceases, then we can divide up ranches, if it is thought to be good business, and plant men in small farms on those ranches with a sporting chance of success.  To plant a man, however, on a little slice of land from a ranch at the present time will only mean that he will not stick it, just as some of the Deputy's colleagues there did not stick it when they got land in better times.  There will be cheap little farms for sale in a couple of years.  Within ten miles of where I am standing I could point out many ranches that have gone back to their original state.  To discuss that, however, I would be disobeying the principle of the ruling of the Chair, because I would be finding fault with the qualifications of those planted on the land, and the Chair has ruled that that is out of order. Our concern is not capable of borrowing this sum of £10,000,000 of money in the market, and so the powers of Government are being mobilised here to-day to force it out of our pockets in the form of paper bonds.  If those paper bonds will not maintain their full face value, the owner of them will lose that depreciation.  It would put the Minister to the test if he would say: &ldquo;I will accept revenue payable in those bonds.  I will accept death duties or any kind of revenue in that form.  I will accept the redemption of Land Commission annuities in these bonds.&rdquo;  There is one thing certain, and that is that England will never ask for the land annuities if she can get them in the Minister's bonds.  If the Minister wants a lightning passage for this Bill he ought to consider, during the Committee Stage of the Bill, announcing that we can pay our annuities, or income tax or any revenue in those bonds.  If the Minister will agree to that, it will mitigate some of the financial sufferings that will be caused by this Bill as a Finance Bill, but it <Col N="485" /> will not mitigate or in any way lessen the inevitable and certain loss this country is going to sustain if agriculture is kept in its present crippled condition and if its future is going to be mortgaged by a forced loan of £10,000,000 taken out of the pockets of those people who, even if they had money, would not give it to the Government for purposes, apparently, more productive than this.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, Sir, I want to say that, whatever action is taken&mdash;I do not know what action my Party is taking on this&mdash;I, as a 100 per cent. son of the soil, of the small farming stock, stand four square in opposition to this tyrannical proposal to force money out of people's pockets, ostensibly to plant landless men on the land, but in reality to plant landless men in slavery.  I want to be recorded as opposing this measure.</P>

      <P>I have very little fault to find with the statement made by the Minister as to the principles on which he thinks the Act is based, and as to the way in which the Government propose to work the Act, except to make one general remark. He used a phrase to the effect that the income derivable from property&mdash; land or holdings&mdash;should be, in equity, maintained by this transaction.  If that were to be interpreted to mean that the present income derivable from land was to be only maintained to the holder in perpetuity, I think that a terrible hardship would be done to landholders and tenants in their holdings. That is a general remark which I hope he will consider very carefully. There is one very special remark, however, that I want to make. on the grounds of which I hope the Dáil will not pass this Bill in its present form. To my mind, the Bill goes entirely beyond the principles laid down by the Minister and it would give any Government in office a power to discriminate in the issue of those bonds, which I do not think this Dáil ought to give or the Government to hold.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only way in which I can read Section 4&mdash;particularly sub-section (4)&mdash; is that after a price has been fixed, whether for landholders or for a <Col N="486" /> tenant's holding, the Minister or the Executive Council would have the power to provide the payment of that amount by the issue of land bonds and they would have the right to say whether that land bond issue should be bearing interest at 3 per cent., 3½ per cent. or 4 per cent.  That would give the Government of the day the right, practically, to vary the price that had been fixed by the court, because they would say that they would issue one class of bonds to pay, let us say, landowners at the rate of 3 per cent., and issue at the same time another class of bonds to pay for tenants' holdings, for which they would allow 4 per cent.  I got advice about it and I am assured that that is the meaning of Section 4.  I do not believe that is what the Minister intends at all.  I accept his statement in that respect completely; but there is nothing to indicate in the Bill that at the same time, quite apart from the value of money at the time, the Minister may not say that one class of bonds shall bear interest at 3 per cent. and another class of bonds shall bear interest at 4 per cent.  I quite understand that, as the value of money fluctuates, there should be some power of control of the interest on these bonds.  Money may become even cheaper than it is at present.  A land bond for £100 at 4 per cent might be worth, a year hence, much more than its present cash value of £100.  On the other hand, money may be dearer and the same land bonds issued for £100 at 3 per cent. might have a great deal less value than the present cash value of £100.</P>
    <P>There should be some power of control of the interest attached to those bonds as the value of money changes, but it should not be a power in the hands of the Minister for Finance or the Executive Council.  It is a power over which this Dáil ought to retain control.  The Dáil should be able to vary the rate of interest from time to time as money changes, but neither the Dáil nor the Minister should have the right to say that at the same time they will issue bonds for one purpose bearing interest at 3 per cent. and for another purpose bearing interest at <Col N="487" /> 4 per cent.  It is for that reason that I felt strongly on this matter when the Minister was asking for leave to put this Bill through to-day.  This Bill requires very careful examination in many of its clauses and I have in mind, on reflection, to submit for the careful consideration of the House certain amendments.  I would therefore press the Minister to give the Dáil proper time for such consideration.  To hand over the Bill in its present form to the Seanad would be surrendering the functions of the Dáil in a way which I do not think we ought to do.  I appeal to the Minister, even though the Bill may be urgent, to give full and proper time for the consideration that the Bill deserves by the House.</P>

      <P>The point that Deputy Thrift has raised emphasises what a monstrous thing it is for the Minister, on a Friday morning when the House has been sitting from the Tuesday, to come forward and ask for all the Stages of this Bill this morning because it is urgent.  Deputy Thrift put his finger on one particular point that troubled me in the Bill.  He seems to have derived a certain amount of assurance on that point from the Minister's statement.  I confess to having got rather the opposite from the Minister's statement.  It emphasises to me the necessity for having fully discussed in the Dáil what exactly the Minister has in mind with regard to that because it did seem to me setting out on a plan to borrow £10,000,000, without giving the House any information as to what he was going to base the changes in rate of interest on, but that, according as the bonds were issued, he was going to change them in a fairly radical way. I am sure the House would like to hear from the Minister on the question of interest alone what are the factors that are going to operate in his mind in fixing the interest at varying stages in different years or different parts of the year.  The Minister has indicated that that is going to be his policy.  The House will want to know what are the things that are going to operate in bringing about those changes.  It <Col N="488" /> seems to me that the House might easily decide in embarking on a scheme like this that they would not allow the change in the rate of interest to depend purely on the money market at the time alone; that they might even have to consider the land value index. There might possibly be a basic rate to be scaled up or down for, say, the 30 years that the Minister has in mind.</P>

      <P>The things that are going to affect the changes of rate of interest are matters that will require very much discussion here. The Minister indicates that the security is going to be the moneys paid by the purchasers, the moneys in the Guarantee Fund and the guarantee of the State.  The Minister has not told us how the money paid by the purchaser is going to be related to the <Col N="489" /> purchase money that is going to be paid to the owners.  He will require to make more clear the position of the Guarantee Fund at the present time and the relation the payments under the pre-1933 Acts and the payments under the 1933 Act&mdash;the moneys received from the tenants&mdash;are going to have to the Guarantee Fund; particularly what part of the Guarantee Fund is going to be related to the bonds issued under this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>There seem to me to be three points that one might discuss on this Bill.  One is the point raised by Deputy Thrift which I myself was struck by when I read the Bill. Another point that requires to be elucidated is the effect that this will have on the people from whom the land is acquired.  The third point is the probable cost to the Central Fund eventually.  The Minister rather went into the original Act&mdash;I do not want to get back on that&mdash;and stated how the land will be acquired, whether by agreement or compulsorily.  What I am mainly concerned with is the effect of this on the people from whom the land is acquired and its possible effect on the recipients of those lands.  I suppose the Minister will adjust his rate of interest to the market price of the day.  Whatever rate of interest these are issued at, there will probably be a rush to sell by the recipients of the bonds.  That is almost inevitable. The recipients of those bonds will be people who will want ready cash and <Col N="490" /> there will be a heavy loading of those bonds on the market with an almost certain fall in price.  The price which any of these landowners will get for the land must be necessarily very small, if the Minister proceeds on the method which he proposes and that he alluded to very shortly here&mdash;that the price paid for the land would be a price which was fair to the landholder and fair to the Land Commission.</P>
      <P>I want now to get what is fair to the landholder but I will not go into that because I would be going back to the original Bill; but I want to point out that the price that would be fair to the Land Commission to give for the land would be practically a very small price for the landholder and would amount to what is practically confiscation.  I would like to see that the labour recipients of this land will get fair value.  But fair value must necessarily be very small value for the landowner&mdash; practically as I have said, confiscation. And the future might make it so that it might be even of less value.  There might be further reductions in the annuities.  For the last 40 years land purchase has been improving so that each Act that was passed made the annuity or the rent lower than the previous annuity or rent and we must remember that probably we have not arrived at the lowest stage yet.  It may happen eventually that some of this money may fall on the Central Fund.  It is well that the House should appreciate that. This is not a case of borrowing money on the security of land.  The money will be entirely borrowed on the security of the Central Fund.  It is well that the House should understand that now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I, for one, am not grudging these people the land but I would rather make them a definite present of the land than ask them to pay something which I know they cannot pay and which would eventually fall on the Central Fund.  That is one point I wanted to make.  The second point is with regard to the recipients of the bonds.  I would like some assurance that when a man gets these bonds he could turn them into cash.  The price would be a very small price and the tendency <Col N="491" /> would be to overload the market.  I know the Minister for Finance will issue the bonds at the lowest rate of interest that he can give.  That is what I would do myself if I were Minister for Finance.  People will probably sell these bonds at a discount so that there will be a further loss on the already depleted price they are getting for the land.</P>
    <P>I would like to see as far as possible the sellers of the land, the original owners of the land, fairly protected. In the first place, they will be at a loss in getting the small price that will be given to them under the Act of 1933 and they should not suffer further in having to sell the bonds at a discount. At the best they would be only getting a small price.  The third point to which I wish to refer is the point raised by Deputy Thrift.  To me it seems the section is vague and I suggest that it might be interpreted in the manner in which Deputy Thrift has interpreted it. I am sure no Deputy would like the Bill to leave the House in such a state that there might be some difficulty about the interpretation of any section. I know the Minister is satisfied in his own mind that the section is quite plain and that all interests are safeguarded. But the section would not appear plain to many people and some lawyers would cast doubt on the particular section.  I do not think that the Bill is a Bill that we should rush too quickly through the House.  I think we ought to have a further occasion to consider it in Committee.  The Minister says there is urgency for it but, after all, there cannot be so much urgency that a day or two would cause any great inconvenience to the Minister. I would ask the Minister to give the Deputies a little further time to consider this in all its moods and tenses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCurran" hpid="Mr. Curran Mr. Curran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
      <P>I want some information in connection with this Bill and in what I have to say I will be very brief.  The point I am making is practically in reference to the point made by Deputy Bennett.  The Land Commission acquires a holding from, say, Jack Smith on which a value of £500 is <Col N="492" /> placed.  He will be paid land bonds, I understand, for that amount.  I can quite easily understand that these land bonds are of very little value to the individual.  If I understand the matter rightly these bonds would mean £20 a year at 4 per cent. interest.  What guarantee has he that the day on which he parts with whatever interest he has on his holding, he will be able to realise the price in hard cash, the price which the Land Commission will allow him for his holding?</P>
      <P>Very few of those whose lands will be acquired under the Land Act of 1933 will be millionaires.  Very few of them can afford to continue taking the interest that will be coming to them under this Act.  They will want ready money.  I would like to see some arrangement by which the man whose lands are being acquired will be paid that amount of money in cash and will be paid it as soon as his holding is acquired.  I would like some statement from the Minister on that particular point.  I think that is the most serious aspect of the whole problem. I am not now going to enter into the question of the Land Act of 1933 or the price that may be given for the land, but I would like to be assured by the Minister and by the Government that the people whose land is to be acquired will get money on those bonds.</P>

      <P>On the point raised by Deputy Thrift I should like to say that it is not the intention to issue those bonds in small parcels.  They will be issued on the basis of an estimate made by the Land Commission as to the number of transactions that they might have to finance over a certain <Col N="493" /> period of time&mdash;one or two years. Under Section 4 the Minister will create land bonds and under sub-section (6)  of Section 4 every order made under this section will be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made.  Under sub-section (2) of Section 4 the Minister in &ldquo;an Order made under this section may specify or restrict the class or classes of advances and purchase moneys for the making or payment of which land bonds of the series created by such Order may be issued.&rdquo;  I pointed out that the purpose of that section originally, or at least the main purpose, was to ensure that payment will be made in bonds which were current at the date upon which the agreement to purchase was made.  We contemplate that the order issuing the bonds will specify the particular class or classes of transactions for which bonds will be applied in payment and will say that they are to be applied to such as were completed on or before a certain date or in which the price was either fixed or agreed upon at that date.</P>

      <P>It is important.  It would be fixed either by agreement with Jack Smith, in which case Smith is satisfied that he is getting a fair price, or it would be fixed by the court.  The next point that arises is, if Jack Smith has to be paid in bonds, what rate of interest should they carry.  The rate of interest should be such as would enable the land bonds, representing the purchase money, to be sold by Jack Smith on the day that he gets them, or the day after or within a reasonable period, for a sum equal, at least, to the cash amount which any other purchaser than the Land Commission would pay Jack Smith for the land.  That is fair and reasonable.  I do not think one could question that basis.  That is the principle upon which the Bill will be operated.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That the Dáil condemns the action of the Government in reducing the total of the grants payable for the relief of rates on agricultural land.&rdquo;&mdash;Deputies Belton, O'Higgins and Minch.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Pretty well everything that could be said about this motion has been said, so I will not detain the House more than a few minutes.  I will not move the adjournment to-day. I am sorry I have no direct representatives here, but I have an interesting document which was signed by two Cork Deputies, giving their promises to the electors:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The land annuities will be permanently reduced by half, and the instalments which fell due during the present economic depression will not be collected.  The land of Ireland belongs to the Irish farmers who fought for it.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is signed by Daniel Corkery and Seán Moylan.  The Minister for Finance described, in very rhetorical fashion, my annihilation at a recent Ard-Fheis when I moved for complete de-rating.  The Minister for Finance, when he is running away from some position he took up himself, likes to be accompanied, whether the person accompanying him be friend or foe. He has no comrades from our side in this retreat.  Complete de-rating was not turned down by our Party.  It was referred to a body for further consideration.  This motion condemns the action of the Government in reducing the total of the grants payable in relief of rates on agricultural <Col N="498" /> land.  To sum up the position, a few figures, and a few figures only, are needed.  Our Government had taxes imposed for the relief of rates on agricultural land.  The produce of these taxes was £2,200,000.  To the query of the Minister for Industry and Commerce as to where the money was to come from, the answer obviously is &ldquo;From the taxes imposed to produce that £2,200,000.&rdquo;  These taxes operated last year and the Government had the benefit of that portion which was with-held&mdash;£448,000. That money should have been given for the purpose for which it was collected.  Another reason is that, last year, the Government collected, or funded, annuities amounting to £3,000,000.  They either got that money or it is owing to them.  In connection with this matter, I think I should quote a statement made by Mr. de Valera on 12th November, 1929. He said then:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The farmers in the Six Counties and in England were relieved of their rates.  Mr. Blythe had told them that it would be impossible to find the money to de-rate agricultural land in the Free State....  If we get control, we will not pay that money (the land annuities) which we believe is the definite property of the Free State Exchequer to England and, out of that £3,000,000, £2,000,000 could be made available for de-rating. We are prepared to put the farmers of this part of Ireland on a level with those with whom they have to compete in the Six Counties and in England.  It is madness for us to be giving employment to the stranger when our own people are out of employment.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was a definite promise of de-rating.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHales" hpid="Mr. Hales Mr. Hales">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hales</NameTxt>
      <P>You spoiled that promise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>The land annuities are paid to England.  Confining myself to the grant strictly, our Government levied taxes last year to produce this £2,200,000.  They got that money and appropriated £500,000 of it to other purposes.  They got in in annuities last year, or are owed, annuities amounting to £3,000,000.  They also <Col N="499" /> got in in taxation the £2,000,000 which should have provided for local loans and R.I.C. pensions.  Even though they did not pay that money, they did not reduce the taxes that produced that amount.  Our Government had, therefore, £8,000,000 in the Exchequer on foot of those amounts.  The farmers had to pay last year this £3,000,000 in annuities, £1,500,000 in local rates and £5,000,000 to England.  Out of what our Government had collected, that £5,000,000 normally would have been met.  All the Government paid out was £1,750,000.  They made a profit of about £5,000,000 and the farmers had to pay that £5,000,000 direct to England.  Their agricultural grant was reduced without any reason being assigned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Deputy will contradict the figures I have given.  The entire payments are being met and one section is paying not only the annuities but the local loans and R.I.C. pensions.  He will not contradict the statement that the taxes that produced the amount of the local loans and R.I.C. pensions under the previous Government were levied last year and produced that amount.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="500" /> He will also agree that our Government got £3,000,000 in annuities last year&mdash;that is the full half of the annuities for May and June and half the annuities for November and December when they were halved by the Land Act of last year.  He will also agree that the Exchequer had the taxes produced for the previous Government to provide for the £2,200,000 grants for the relief of rates.  Can anybody on the Government side of the House give any reason why the agricultural grant should have been reduced.  The Government were getting the money that they were getting the previous year and that the previous Government were getting.  Why then did they not pay the agricultural grant in full?  The agricultural industry had to pay not only its annuities to our Government but it had as well to pay the annuities to the British Government.  Not only did they pay their rates on agricultural land as heretofore, but they also paid the two millions for local loans and R.I.C. pensions, because the British Government collected the entire of what they claimed that we ought to pay.  In these circumstances, there was not an iota of reason why the £2,200,000 for agricultural grants should have been reduced.</P>
    <P>I do not think if I talked for five hours there could be anything more to be said.  The figures are there staring people plainly in the face.  The figures can be seen and understood by everybody inside and outside the House.  If people do not want to see them and remain wilfully blind, then there is no use in wasting the time of the House in trying to make them see and understand what they do not want to understand.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Derrig)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: That the National School Teachers' Superannuation Scheme, 1934, made by the Minister for Education, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, under the Teachers' Superannuation Act, 1928 (No. 32 of 1928) be confirmed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In dealing with this important question, which has been the subject of prolonged discussion and consideration, I think it, perhaps, well to explain to the Dáil, in the first instance, what the position has been heretofore. Accordingly, I intend to say a few words with regard to the old pension scheme which the new scheme, at present under consideration, is designed to supersede.  It is also necessary to give the reasons which led the Government to introduce the new scheme.  The original teachers' pension scheme was set up under the National Teachers (Ireland) Act, 1879.  This scheme provided for the granting of <Col N="503" /> pensions or gratuities to class teachers; that is to say, principal and assistant teachers in model or ordinary national schools, but not including lay assistants in convent or monastery schools or the subsequently established junior assistant mistresses.  This Act of 1879 provided for the establishment of a pensions fund, out of which all pensions were to be paid.  The basis of the fund provided for a capital sum of £1,300,000, the interest from which, at the rate of 3 per cent. per annum, was paid into the fund.  Under the Act the British Treasury had power to make regulations regarding the administration of this fund, and also to modify or amend these regulations from time to time. Actuarial valuations were made at regular intervals during the early period of this fund, and also in the later period, though not with the same regularity, so that we are able to see what was the position of the fund and the actuarial deficiencies which occurred during the time that it was in operation.  In practically all cases I think in which these actuarial valuations were made, it was discovered that there was an actuarial deficiency in respect of the fund.  In the year 1891, for example, we find that Parliament had to vote £90,000 to make up the deficiency which was disclosed in that year.  There was another valuation in 1895 which again disclosed a deficiency, and on this occasion the benefits accruing to teachers were curtailed. Their contributions to the fund were increased, while Parliament stepped in, in order to try and make the fund solvent, by giving a lump sum of £95,434, plus an annual grant of £18,000.</P>
    <P>There were subsequent valuations when it was found that the provision in the fund was not sufficient.  At the same time, as the House will remember, there was a prolonged agitation in the country extending over very many years for better conditions for the teachers, and particularly for the maintenance of pensions.  After a time the teachers' pensions were further improved and increased grants were made to the pension fund.  In 1914 a definite effort was made to put the <Col N="504" /> fund on a more definitely satisfactory basis.  The rules, which I find were then made, provided for a considerable increase in the contributions from the teachers.  These meant that the teachers' contributions were then fixed at a percentage ranging for 3½ per cent. to 5 per cent. of their salaries.  In 1921 the rate of contribution was fixed at 4 per cent. for all teachers, and this rate of contribution has been in operation up to the present time.</P>
    <P>This reorganisation of the fund, which took place in 1914, was designed to secure the solvency of the fund, and undoubtedly would have succeeded in doing so had the conditions which then applied continued, but in the year 1920 an entirely different situation was created.  An agreement was made in November, 1920, between the teachers and the representatives of the British Government as a result of which there was a very substantial and, I think, all round increase in teachers' salaries.  I think it would be fair to say that there was an increase of more than 100 per cent. in the new scales as against the rates which the teachers were then receiving.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnONeill" hpid="Mr. O'Neill Mr. O'Neill">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>Was that previous to fixing the rate at 4 per cent.?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The rate of 4 per cent. was fixed in 1921&mdash;after the 1920 agreement. It is well known that, as a result of these considerable increases in teachers' salaries, there was a consequent heavy increase in the liability on the fund in respect of pensions, pensions being based on the average salary paid to a teacher during the three years preceding his retirement from the service.  I find that the actuary in 1929 estimated that the increase in pension liability under the head of the agreement of 1920 amounted, on the average, to £330 for each teacher in the service.  It is no harm to give definite figures showing the increases in saláries which have really given rise to the whole subsequent difficulty in making the pension fund solvent.  I notice that whereas the grade salary of national teachers in 1914 ranged from £63 to £185 in the case of men, and from £51 to £151 in <Col N="505" /> the case of women, the scales of salaries in the 1920 agreement were £170 to £460 in the case of men, and £155 to £360 in the case of women.</P>
      <P>The effect on the Pension Fund of these increased rates of salary may be gathered from the fact that whereas the average ordinary pension granted in 1914 was only £41 10s., in 1920 it was £63 10s. and in 1932, £164.  After a few years it was quite clear that the solvency of the fund could not be maintained under the new conditions, that it could not stand the drain of those increased pensions.  The late Government took up the matter and had an actuarial investigation of the whole position of the Pension Fund made as on the 31st December, 1926. When the result of this investigation was published or made known, a net deficiency on the fund of £4,210,364 was disclosed.  Once the fund had become insolvent, the deficiency increased with compound interest and it is estimated that at the present time the deficiency must be well in excess of £5,000,000.  The expenditure of the Pension Fund has for some years past exceeded the income and it has been necessary to sell out stock in order to pay the pensions.  The deficit for the year 1933 was £82,580.  What is the position of the fund at the present time?  In spite of the fact that it has been insolvent and that stock has had to be realised for a number of years in order to meet pension charges, there is still undoubtedly a considerable amount of realisable assets.  We estimate that these assets, in the form of Government securities, amount to about £1,500,000.  It seems to be a substantial sum but it must be remembered that if the present position of the fund were to continue and things were allowed to drift&mdash; stock having to be realised every year in order to meet the obligations of the fund&mdash;the present assets would dis appear completely in about ten years' time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are other assets in the fund as well as this £1,500,000 of Government securities.  In the first place the teachers' contributions of 4 per cent. on their salaries run to about £102,000 <Col N="506" /> per annum.  The State is also making contributions.  In the first place, we are giving Government grants from voted moneys of £29,326 per annum. We are giving a Government grant which is voted annually, amounting to 15 per cent. of the previous year's expenditure.  That amounted to £47,726 in 1933-34.  If we were to continue the old system&mdash;allowing the present position to continue as well as facing a situation that in ten years there would simply be no assets in the fund&mdash;we would also have to make provision for an increased Government contribution because the 15 per cent. Government grant based on last year's expenditure would increase ultimately to a maximum of £90,000 per annum.  There is also an income from the Saorstát share of the £1,300,000 allocated in 1879 from the Church Temporalities Fund which amounts to £26,598 per annum.  Therefore, as regards the other assets in the fund, excluding the £1,500,000 Government securities, we have the teachers' contribution of £102,000, the State contribution of £47,000 plus £29,000&mdash;roughly £77,000&mdash;and the income of £26,500 from the Saorstát share of the Church Temporalities Fund.  In effect that is a contribution from the State.</P>

      <P>What is the total?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that if we assume that that £26,600 is portion of the State contribution, the position would be that we would be contributing, roughly, half.  That is to say, that our contribution from State sources would equal, roughly, the teachers' contribution of £102,000 per annum. The question then that has faced us, as well as our predecessors, is: what steps should be taken to deal with the position that has arisen?  Should we attempt to make the pension fund solvent by way of Government subsidy, or by increasing the teachers' contributions, or by a combination of both, or should we, by imposing a cut on the teachers' salaries, be able to make what, I think, may be described as a settlement?  Though it has never been accepted by the teachers, they have been in touch both with this Government and with the last Government <Col N="507" /> on the matter, and they have known the main outlines of the settlement that has been proposed in both cases.  Our problem was whether to attempt to make the pension fund solvent or whether we should impose what I, at any rate, call a settlement upon the teachers, as an alternative, and take over the whole liability for teachers' pensions as well as teachers' salaries in future and make them a charge on voted moneys.  The whole question has been very closely examined during the past five or six years, and we have come to the conclusion, in bringing in this scheme, that the only way to meet the situation in future is to make both pensions and salaries of teachers a definite charge on voted moneys.</P>
      <P>Our scheme, therefore, is on a noncontributory basis.  The teacher will not make any contributions towards pensions as such.  The 4 per cent. contribution is wiped out.  Instead of that contribution we are instituting a system of revised salary scales.  These salary scales are based on a 9 per cent. cut on present rates of pay except in the case of junior assistant mistresses and untrained assistant teachers who are in a specially low-paid class.  In these two cases we are making a cut of only 6 per cent.  What is the justification for this cut of 9 per cent.?  Well, the Government have had to take into consideration, in the first place, the general circumstances surrounding this whole question of the pensions fund. It can be argued, I think with reason, that the question of teachers' pensions and the question of the contributions which, in future, they must make, if the State is to take over responsibility for their pensions, cannot be dissociated from the whole question of teachers' salaries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So long as we have the question of contribution there in one way or another the matter of the appropriateness and the reasonableness of the teachers' salaries is also in question. We have also to take into consideration the charges which will be placed upon the Exchequer in future in respect of both salaries and pensions.  I find under the present Estimate the cost <Col N="508" /> to the Exchequer in 1934-35 of teachers' salaries would be approximately £3,470,000, and of pensions £79,000, making a total of £3,549,000.  Under the proposed new scheme the corresponding charges will be: Salaries, £3,228,000, and pensions £371,000, making a total of £3,599,000; that is to say that there will be an immediate additional cost to the Exchequer of £50,000.  We are also taking over a very important liability&mdash;it is one that we should take over in all reason, but nevertheless it is a big financial liability&mdash;that is, the liability for pensions for junior assistant mistresses and lay assistants.  We cannot say what the amount of that liability is, but obviously at the peak period it will be very considerable.  There are 1,755 junior assistant mistresses and 732 lay assistants.  That is one additional liability.</P>
    <P>It has also to be borne in mind that the teachers who were pensioned prior to 1920 are dying off and that there is a rapidly increasing liability in respect of pensions.  The teachers who are coming on charge on the Pensions Fund will have much larger pensions to draw than their colleagues who are dying off.  As well as having much larger pensions, the number of pensioners is increasing.  The total number of pensioners in 1922 was 1,946.  It is now 2,514.  The actuary estimated that the number at the peak period will amount to 3,300, and this does not include, I believe, the junior assistant mistresses and lay assistant teachers to whom I have referred, who are coming under the scheme for the first time.</P>

      <P>It is estimated that the eventual total liability of the Exchequer for pensions will rise to a maximum of somewhere between £550,000 and £600,000 per annum, involving an additional charge on the Exchequer for salaries and pensions of from £229,000 to £279,000 per annum.  Next year, while our liability in respect of pensions <Col N="509" /> will be £371,000, we have to look forward to the time&mdash;it is a good way off, but the State has to take all those matters into consideration&mdash;when the eventual charge in respect of pensions will be somewhere in the neighbourhood of £600,000.</P>

      <P>I do not like to interrupt the Minister as this is a very complicated matter, and I have full sympathy with him in his difficulties. Would he be able to give me any idea of what the pensions would be, not thirty years hence, which I think is about the figure he has given the House, but say about the year 1940?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I will try to get the figure.  Now there is an important offset against this heavy liability which the State is taking on in respect of teachers' pensions&mdash;it will be a continuing offset&mdash;and that is, when the fund is turned over for the purposes of the Exchequer.  I mentioned that the total value of the Government's securities in the fund amounted to about £1,500,000.  I am advised that the market value of the securities held at present amounts to about £1,476,000, with an interest-bearing value of £51,148.  There is also the interest from the Church Temporalties Fund amounting to £26,598, making a total of £77,746. That is the interest-bearing value of the securities at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask the Minister if he can tell us what was the actual interest received in respect of investments in the pension fund for the year ending December, 1933, as distinct from the market value of the securities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say at the moment, but I will get the figure.  In taking over this fund we do not propose to realise those securities; we have not yet made a definite decision as to the ultimate application of the interest which will be accruing from it.  Coming now to the details of the proposed new pensions scheme, there will be no change whatever in the method of calculating the pensions.  As at present, those will be based on one-eightieth of the average annual salary <Col N="510" /> for each completed year of service. There is also no change in the conditions under which teachers may become eligible for pensions.  Those are: (a) Retirement on ordinary pension after having attained the age of 60, or after having attained the age of 55 and having served for not less than 35 years; (b) disability pension, after having served for not less than ten years; (c) non-efficiency pension in the case of a teacher who has attained the age of 50 and was removed from the service on the ground of his inability to discharge his duty efficiently. These are the well-known conditions under which teachers are granted pensions on retiring from the service&mdash;in any event at the age of 60; at the age of 55, after having served 35 years; disability pension after serving not less than ten years; and after the age of 50, if a teacher is to be removed from his office on the grounds of non-efficiency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are other benefits which were available under the present scheme, and which we are providing under the new scheme.  First, there is the death gratuity.  The death gratuity is equal to the average yearly salary for the three years' ending 31st March next preceding the date of death, where the teacher dies in the service after not less than five years' service.  There is also a disablement gratuity.  Where a teacher has not the ten years necessary to enable him to get a pension, he will get in the case of disablement a gratuity which is calculated at the rate of one-tenth of his average annual salary for every completed year of pensionable service.  There is also a marriage gratuity which will be payable at the rate of one-twelfth of the average annual salary in respect of every completed year of service in excess of one year, subject, however, to a maximum of one year's salary.  The teacher, in order to get this gratuity, has to have not less than seven years' service.  There is also the point which I referred to that lay assistants in convent and monastery schools, and junior assistant mistresses, who were hitherto ineligible for pension benefits will be included under the scheme.  In bringing them in <Col N="511" /> under the scheme, although they have made no contributions up to the present, we are giving them credit to the extent of two-thirds of their back service, provided however that any such teacher who gave no service in the last five years, that is, the five years immediately preceding the appointed day which will be the 1st April, and who enters the service on or after the appointed day, will not receive any gratuity for back service.</P>
    <P>If one of these teachers who are coming in under the scheme for the first time left the service during the past five years, he is entitled to get the pension benefits, provided he returns to work within five years, that is to say, that teachers who left the service during the period preceding five years before 1st April next are excluded.  About 50 teachers have not come under the present pension rules.  They elected to remain under the old pension scheme prior to 1914&mdash;they paid smaller premiums and were entitled to smaller pensions, and they have not come in under the 1914 scheme up to the present, although they have been given opportunity for doing so.  It appears that they were offered opportunities of coming in under the much better scheme of 1914 but they failed to do so. However, there is a certain amount of hardship on these 50 teachers.  They are still in the service and are giving the usual good service, and if they left they would get very much smaller pensions.  We are giving them an additional concession; we are giving them credit for pensions based on half of their actual service up to the appointed day, and, of course, they will get the full benefit of their service for the future.  This small group of teachers will, therefore, get much better pension terms than they would have got under the old scheme.</P>
    <P>There is a further point, with regard to the withdrawal of premiums.  Under the present scheme the teacher is entitled to a refund of all premiums paid by him into the fund with compound interest, if he dies in the service, and without interest, if he withdraws from the service before he <Col N="512" /> becomes eligible for pension.  In future, such refund of pension will only apply to premiums actually paid up to the date on which the new scheme comes into force, and such premiums will not be refunded if the teacher is eligible for a gratuity, unless the gratuity is less than the amount he would receive by way of refund of premiums.  If, after the appointed day, a teacher is entitled to a gratuity greater than the amount of premiums paid into the fund before the appointed day, he will get the gratuity, but if, in any circumstances, there were no gratuity or the gratuity were less than the amount of premiums paid in before the appointed day, he is entitled to a refund of them.</P>
    <P>Taking the new scheme as a whole, I think we can definitely claim that the benefits provided are definitely more advantageous to the teachers than those which they at present enjoy.  In addition to that, the House must bear in mind that, in future, instead of being dependent for their pensions upon a fund which was insolvent&mdash;hopelessly insolvent, I think it could be said&mdash;and which would come to an end within a very short term of years indeed, the teachers will have the security of the State behind them for their pensions. That is a benefit which we cannot calculate in terms of L.S.D. but I think that teachers generally will realise that it is a very important benefit indeed.  We claim, and, I think, with justification, that we have taken the greatest trouble to give the best terms we could in all the circumstances to the teacher.  We regret very much indeed that the teachers, on the different occasions on which we approached them, were not able to accept those terms or that their Executive were unable to recommend to the general body of their members that in all the circumstances, these terms were fair and reasonable.  There was no alternative whatever for us but to come forward and the only regret we have is, perhaps, that we did not propose to take this step some time ago.  We had been waiting to see whether we could not strike a definite bargain and come to a definite settlement with the teachers.  We <Col N="513" /> approached them but, apparently, it was quite impossible to reach agreement. On the present occasion, the teachers are fully aware of the conditions which are now being imposed and which, I hope, the Dáil will consent to unanimously.  With regard to Deputy Professor O'Sullivan's point, the actuaries' figures, which do not include the junior assistant mistresses and lay assistants, are: Estimated cost of pensions in 1939, £395,000 and in 1944, £430,000.  With regard to Deputy Norton's point as to the interest on stock, £51,000, approximately, is the interest on the stock held for the year ending 31st December, 1933.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">

The teachers retiring now entered the service, say, about the year 1894, and since that time, the number of teachers in the service has greatly increased. I think that is the chief reason.  It may also be that the pensioners are living longer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite admit that the Minister has had to face a very difficult question, and I also readily realise that it is an extremely difficult position to make clear either to the House or to the country, and I think that anybody who has read pension rules will find it extremely difficult to understand pension rules.  I find no fault with the Minister's statement on any of these points.  I am quite well aware, as I say, of the difficulties of the task confronting him.  There were a couple of points that I think he might have developed a little more.  He assumed as something that did not require further justification or further explanation that this was the only way of meeting this particular problem; that, practically speaking, the disappearance of the fund was necessary, merely because it was bankrupt; that the putting of the fund, by yearly contributions, into a solvent state should be ruled out.  It was one of the ways in which the difficulty could be met, but the Minister did not give us any reasons why he has adopted the present particular scheme.  I think that he himself <Col N="515" /> will realise that there was one particular portion of the scheme, and of his exposition of it, that certainly lacked definiteness; and that is, what is to happen the present fund.  All that we have got an assurance of is that the securities for the moment, will not be sold out; he does not tell us or indicate at all what use the moneys of that fund will be put to.</P>
      <P>Perhaps, again, the complication of the scheme makes it rather difficult to follow, and I quite understand the difficulties that arise from the point of view of draftsmanship; but I gather that the present position is that the pensions up to the moment&mdash;that is, the pensions of the existing pensioners, or the pensioners on the appointed day&mdash; will be paid directly by the State.  Is that correct?</P>

      <P>I gathered that that was the situation.  Has the Minister considered what right he has to put the moneys of the old fund to any other use?  I am quite serious on this.  I am not quite sure where the legal custody of that fund is, whether it is in the State or not; but I suggest that if it is in the State, the Minister or the Minister for Finance is merely a trustee, and that he is bound by the conditions of the trust, and especially bound so far as the contribution side of the fund is concerned.  From that particular point of view I think that it would seem to the ordinary person that they have no right to divert it to any other purpose. I am not sure what the legal position is, and I should like to know if the Government is secure in the position <Col N="517" /> that it has any right to divert that fund to any other purpose, because I think that, strictly speaking, they are morally breaking a trust in that respect, and I doubt if they have the power to do so legally.  I merely put forward the doubt because I do not pretend to speak with any legal authority whatsoever, but I doubt whether they have the power without the consent of the beneficiaries of that fund to devote that fund to another purpose.</P>

      <P>There was nothing in reference to the fund. There was an offer to them on certain lines not connected with them, and a portion of the offer was that the &ldquo;cut&rdquo; was not to be effective so far as they were concerned if a similar &ldquo;cut&rdquo; did not apply elsewhere.  Now, of course, we have, from the teachers' point of view, undoubtedly, the full application of it to them, independent of a lot of other services in the community that have had to bear share of the contribution; but so far as the fund was concerned it never got as far as discussing with the teachers what could be done with it.  I suggest again that even the National Teachers' Organisation or the Executive of that Organisation have no power and could have no power, so far as the fund was concerned, to determine the fate of the fund.  There may have been many teachers in the country who were not members of the organisation at all, and yet who were beneficiaries under that particular fund.</P>

      <P>So far as anything connected with the law is concerned, I can assure the Minister that it is purely and absolutely a matter of opinion on my part; and I may suggest that any advice the Minister has got is probably pure opinion also.  There is only one place where this question can be tested really, as Deputies know, and as any member of the Government ought to know, and that is in the court.  I suggest that where you have a case in which private individuals are concerned, <Col N="519" /> the only way to deal with it is by Private Bill legislation.  However, I do not want to stress that more fully, but I think it is a point that the Minister would be well advised to bear in mind thoroughly.</P>

      <P>I have no doubt that it has not been overlooked but I wonder whether the Minister, to use a common expression, is not &ldquo;chancing his arm&rdquo; on the legal side of this particular matter.  However, as I say, if anybody is dissatisfied with this particular scheme and the method of dealing with it, he has his remedy and the thing can be tested from that point of view if people are serious in their opposition to this particular scheme.  I do not know how far they are serious in their opposition.  After all, the Minister regards this as a settlement.  Coming from the Fianna Fáil Benches he used a very extraordinary phrase&mdash;&ldquo;an imposed settlement.&rdquo;  I thought the Fianna Fáil mentality could not grip anything like an imposed settlement of any kind.  I thought that one of the essences of an imposed settlement is that it has no binding value on anybody.  However, I am not quarrelling with that particular matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us look at the matter both from the teachers' point of view and from the point of view of the State.  The teachers say that this is not as favourable a settlement as was suggested before.  That is their opinion and I am not canvassing it for the moment. In reality, judging by the extraordinarily vague position we are in as regards the position of the existing fund and what may happen it, it is very hard to avoid the idea that the Government in this matter are mortgaging the future rather than the present; are avoiding facing up to this particular obligation at the moment and putting the burden on the long finger.  There is a danger, and of course, a danger can always <Col N="520" /> be on two sides.  The two sides in this matter are the teachers, on the one hand, and the State on the other hand. Looking at it from the teachers' point of view, there is the fact that no provision is now being made to make the present fund anything like solvent. The 5 per cent. extra to be contributed by the teachers is really a cut in salary, not a contribution.  It is equivalent to a contribution of about 6 per cent. anyhow.  I used that particular figure in that roundabout way because the actuary, when dealing with the fund at the end of 1926, calculated that 8½ per cent., not necessarily taken from the teachers, of course&mdash;that is a matter of policy which he did not go into&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>Plus the existing 4 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Plus the existing 4 per cent.  He said that 8½ per cent. extra would be probably sufficient at the time.  Probably now it would require something in the nature of 9½ or 10 per cent. from what I gather from the Minister if the fund was to be made solvent on the basis of contribution. In reality, what the Government have done is to turn the 4 per cent. contribution into a cut in salary and, therefore, a corresponding cut in the pension.  The additional 5 per cent. is not a contribution either&mdash;it is a cut also in the salaries.  But if you are to try and compare two figures which might be comparable, it seems that the extra 5 per cent. cut will be equivalent roughly to a contribution of 6 per cent. on the old lines; whereas in reality to make the fund at present anything like solvent would require probably a contribution of about 10 per cent., whether it comes from the State or not.  What the Government, therefore, are doing is: they are deliberately refusing to face the obligations now and pushing them into the future. That is a danger undoubtedly.  So far as the State is concerned, it can be argued that it ought to be rejected on that ground.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is the further danger from the teachers' point of view that, as this <Col N="521" /> bill piles up and has apparently to be met by the State, there may be an agitation, if things do not better themselves quickly, to have a further cut. Unfortunately, the fund is not being put into a state of solvency.  I suggest, therefore, that there is a danger, whether to the State or to the teachers, as the present obligations are being transferred to the future.  That is really the consideration.  Unfortunately, although the Minister did try to give a considerable amount of information, and did give a considerable amount of information on important points, the House is still in the dark about this scheme both from the teachers' point of view and from the point of view of the State.</P>
    <P>There is one matter I might refer to in this connection and as to which I might make an appeal, namely, the question of retirement on marriage. When that suggestion first came out it was put before the teachers in the form of a rule so that they could discuss it.  The matter has no propagandist value at the moment and, therefore, my word can be taken that that was meant to form the basis of further discussion on that particular rule.  But the organisation actually published the thing in the midst of the political excitement of the moment when the ex-Ministers of the Government were far away at other work.  It was actually published during the election.  Even there I do not think a definite position was taken.  Undoubtedly, my opinion was veering towards that question of retirement on marriage.  I put it to the Minister that he might give serious consideration to a matter that I promised many teachers at the time to give full consideration to, as I thought they had a just case, namely, that the rule should not apply in the case of any people who had started their career, and that the starting of the career should be dated not from the time they entered the training college but from the time they had made up their minds to follow that career, namely, at the time they entered the preparatory college.  They entered the preparatory college at a time when the rule did not exist.  They deliberately <Col N="522" /> turned from other professions to this profession.  I suggest to the Minister for his favourable consideration that the rule should not be applicable to those who had entered the preparatory college.  I think it is only fair to them that the new conditions should not be imposed.</P>
    <P>The Minister gave a history, and I will admit that it was correct so far as it went.  As well as I can remember&mdash;it is not easy to remember all these things&mdash;the teachers have always contended that their side of the fund was always solvent.  In any discussion that I ever had with them I refused to go into the history of the matter. Probably, like the Minister, I said that I had to face up to a practical problem at the moment.  I never entered into a discussion of that particular matter with the teachers.</P>
    <P>I thought, candidly, that so far as the history of the matter was concerned, they could bring forward a remarkably cogent&mdash;I do not say compelling evidence, but certainly very strong&mdash;evidence in that way.  They could quote British statement, and they could quote not only British statesmen but even Acts of the Free State Government itself when it was dividing the fund between the Free State and Northern Ireland Government showing acceptance of the fact that the ratio was one-fourth to three-fourths.  I think they could put forward a very good case on that.  The Minister has passed over that point.  The teachers' contention has always been that their side of the fund has been solvent.  The Minister, in his answer, seems not to have touched that question.  I do not know whether he admits their contention or not, but, solvent or not solvent, the present condition of the country has to be the basis, as he put it.  Did I gather from the Minister's statement that the insolvency of the fund is due to the increases in salaries?  He certainly conveyed that impression.  Does he hold that?  Does he hold that the fund was solvent in 1920 and 1921?  Has he calculated when the increases of pensions following the increases in salaries began to be effective?  I think it is open to considerable doubt whether <Col N="523" /> the fund was solvent as far back as 1921, and whether it was altogether due to the increase of pensions, and due to the increases in the salaries.  That is the contention of the other side.  The case has always been that the fund, so far as increases of pension is concerned, looking at it from the actuarial point of view, that the teachers' contribution would meet the payments for a considerable number of years.  It was not the teachers pension that made any increase, because again and again before that increase came on, the fund became insolvent and the British Government had to come to its assistance. Whilst I accept the Minister's statement, so far as it went, there were certain very obvious lacunae in that statement.  I have no doubt that that point will be made clear by the other speakers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The most noticeable part of the debate, so far, has been the feeling of fellow-sympathy between the Minister for Education and the ex-Minister for Education.  That fellow-feeling has been demonstrated in a remarkable way by the fact that the present Minister for Education steered clear of the fact that was always recognised that the teachers' side of the fund was liable for 25 per cent. of the pension liabilities and the State side, or the endowment side was liable for 75 per cent. of the liabilities.  We had the ex-Minister saying that he saw that difficulty in the past.  He knew there were cogent arguments to support that, and that British statesmen could be quoted <i>ad naseum</i> in support of the contention that there was a liability on the teachers to bear a contribution which would be 25 per cent. of the whole liability, and would put the other 75 per cent. on the State. It is because those who are speaking for the State are unwilling to recognise the responsibility of the State to meet 75 per cent. of the cost of the pensions that it was necessary to introduce a motion of this kind imposing a permanent cut of 9 per cent. on the salaries of the teachers.  The Minister gave us some information as to the origin of the fund, and he told us of <Col N="524" /> the unscientific way in which the fund was financed.  Whatever difficulties there were about financing the fund, these difficulties showed themselves entirely on the endowment side, and even on the State side of the fund. There was no difficulty about financing the teachers' side of the fund.  Any insolvency in the fund has not been insolvency on the teachers' side of the fund.  About 36 years ago, when the teachers' fund was divided into two parts there were the teachers' account and the endowment account.  But the teachers were definitely made liable&mdash; and that fact was definitely accepted at the time, and it has not been challenged since, not even by the present or by the ex-Minister for Education&mdash;for 25 per cent. of the pensions, and liable also to meet any charges that would arise as the result of having to refund premiums to persons dying while in the service or retiring.  That was a definite liability on the teachers' side of the fund.  The State side or the endowment side accepted definite liability to meet the other 75 per cent. of the charges.  One could understand a motion of this kind and a set of statutory rules and estimates of this kind if it had been found that the whole fund was insolvent and unable to meet its liabilities. But in 1923 there was an actuarial investigation of the fund as a whole, and it showed a considerable deficit.  The fund as a whole on actuarial investigation showed a surplus on the teachers' side of £1,250,000, and such insolvency was shown as was disclosed on the State or endowment side.  Why, therefore, the teachers should be asked to make good the deficiency which does not exist on their side and which only exists on the Government side, is more than I or the teachers' organisation can understand.  In order to show the position in that respect and to show that far from the teachers' side becoming even insolvent, the figures will show the tendency is in the other direction.  On the teachers' side the teachers' contributions showed assets amounting to £532,000 in 1923, and this figure had increased in 1932 to £1,387,000.  So that, from the period of 1923 to 1932 the teachers' side of the <Col N="525" /> fund had increased from £532,000 to £1,387,000.  What was the position on the endowment side of the fund?  In 1923 the assets on the endowment side amounted to £1,791,000.  In 1932 these assets were reduced to £1,163,000, showing that while the assets on the teachers' side were increasing considerably, the assets on the Government side were considerably reduced during that period.  The teachers' side of the fund increased by £855,000 while, on the other hand, the value of the Government assets decreased by £628,000 during the same period.  The result was that the teachers who were liable only under statutory regulations for one-fourth of the pension liability had their assets in such a position that they exceeded the Government assets by the sum of £224,000, although the Government side of the fund was liable for three-fourths of the pension, whereas the teachers' side of the fund was only liable for 25 per cent.  That shows clearly that, so far as the teachers' side of the fund was concerned, it was in a healthy financial position, its assets amounting to £224,000 more than the State side. Therefore, any patching up necessary is necessary on the State side of the fund.  It is not necessary on the teachers' side, which, as the figures show, is not only in a healthy position with much lesser liability, and with much greater assets, than on the Government side.  As the actuarial investigation in 1926 showed the teachers' pension fund had a surplus of £250,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To follow further the point as to the liability of the teachers for payments towards pensions, it has always been accepted that the teachers' liability is confined to making good the cost of one quarter of the pension liability. At present the contribution of the teachers on a basis of 4 per cent. is, approximately, £102,000.  With the new clauses added, and the pension contribution 4 per cent., that sum would be increased by another £15,000, making it £117,000.  So that even on the basis of a 4 per cent. contribution covering the 2,500 about to be brought in, the teachers would be contributing £117,000.  The liability for pensions, <Col N="526" /> for the financial year ending on the 31st March, 1935, would amount in all to £371,000, showing clearly that the teachers, when they pay £117,000 out of the total superannuation liability, would be making a much greater contribution towards pension liability than the 25 per cent. so far expected from them.  The teachers are perfectly willing that the 4 per cent. arrangement should be continued for pension liability to maintain their side in a healthy condition.  It has a surplus of £250,000.  They are willing to contribute the present rates for pension liability, and to accept the present method of superannuation, with such additions as are necessary on a fairly ascertained basis.  They think that it is unfair, with the pension fund showing a surplus of £250,000, to impose on their shoulders the further obligation of giving a further 5 per cent. towards pension liability.</P>
    <P>The real difficulty in this matter is that the State fund is insolvent, that it is bankrupt, and unable to meet the obligations which the State always accepted as its responsibility, namely, to accept liability to pay 75 per cent. of the pensions.  The Government propose to solve that difficulty by imposing a cut of 9 per cent. on the teachers. On the Minister's figures it is estimated that the sacrifice which the teachers will make under a 9 per cent. contribution for pensions will be, approximately, £260,000 a year.  Not only will the State recoup itself to the extent of the cut of £260,000 in the remuneration of the teachers, but it will take other assets of the teachers, such as the fund which amounts to £1,387,000. The Minister has not told us what is going to be done with the £1,387,000, which is now on the teachers' side of the pensions fund, and which is computed actuarially to be £250,000 in excess of the obligations imposed upon the teachers in the matter of meeting pension liability.  Instead of continuing the old method of financing pensions through the Pensions Fund, in future it is proposed that the salaries of teachers shall be met by an annual Vote to defray the cost of pensions, and that a certain new class of individuals, <Col N="527" /> numbering between 2,500 and 2,600 will be brought into the scheme.</P>
    <P>In Northern Ireland this latter class was brought into the scheme many years ago, and pensions were provided for them on a scale as satisfactory, if not more satisfactory, than that provided by the Minister in this scheme. These people when brought into the scheme in Northern Ireland were not made liable for the 6 per cent. contribution imposed here.  They were allowed to continue on a 4 per cent. contribution and, in addition, no one else was asked to bear a 9 per cent. cut in order that the people the Minister proposes to bring into the new pensions scheme should obtain pensions on a scale that the Minister could never defend withholding.  The new classes came in in Northern Ireland without making the 6 per cent. contribution required here, and without the rest of their colleagues in the profession being asked to shoulder a cut in order that the junior class would get pensions.</P>
    <P>We must go back to the June offer of 1932.  At that time it was contended by the Minister for Finance, and I think he was supported in that view by the Minister for Education, that the June offer of 1932 represented a substantial advance in the offer made to the teachers by the late Government.  At all events, so far as the Government spokesmen were concerned, they took good care to ensure that that particular point of view was adequately ventilated in the Press.  It was said that the June offer of 1932 was a better offer than that made by the late Government. I wonder if it is contended now that this offer to the teachers&mdash;this imposed settlement, as Deputy O'Sullivan rightly remarked&mdash;is a better offer than the one made in June, 1932. As a matter of fact, I think, in some respects, it is a worse offer than that made by the Cumann na nGaedheal Government in 1931, which was assailed by the Minister for Finance when he was on the Opposition Benches.  The Cumann na nGaedheal offer was made in 1931.  In some respects the Fianna Fáil offer of June, 1932, was somewhat better.  In my <Col N="528" /> opinion&mdash;and I think Deputy Breathnach will bear me out&mdash;this new offer is worse than the offer of Cumann na nGaedheal in 1931 and worse than that of Fianna Fáil in 1932.  Under the Cumann na nGaedheal offer of 1931, and the Fianna Fáil offer of 1932, the pensionability of the old salaries was maintained.  It was true that under the previous proposal, a person who might have to suffer, as was proposed by the Minister for Finance in 1932, a cut of 9 per cent. or 10 per cent. for the purpose of superannuation, the salary would be regarded as the pre-cut salary for that purpose, whereas in the new proposal there is to be a 9 per cent. cut in the salary of teachers, which, in effect, means a 9 per cent. cut in superannuation.  To that extent this offer is very much worse than the offer of June, 1932.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not told the House why the pensionability of the salary is not maintained in accordance with the offer made in June, 1932.  If it was right to make that offer in June, 1932, I cannot understand why that portion of the offer has been dropped.  It cannot be pleaded that that portion of the offer was anyway excessively generous. Certainly the Minister is doing nothing under any other head to entitle him to say that the dropping of that portion of the offer is deserved in the circumstances. Deputy Thrift and Deputy O'Sullivan asked what was the ultimate liability on the State in respect of the responsibility for the payment of teachers' pensions in the future.  In the Estimates for 1934-35, the cost of superannuation of teachers is set down as £371,000.  Let us see who, in fact, is going to pay that sum of £371,000. From the speech of the Minister for Education&mdash;quite a skilful speech from his point of view&mdash;one would imagine that the State was simply prostrate in an effort to find this money to finance teachers' pensions.  What is the position? This 9 per cent. cut will yield the State an annual saving of £260,000, made up of 4 per cent., the normal contribution towards pension liability, plus the extra 5 per cent. imposed by this scheme.  Under the scheme which the House is asked to assent to now, the teachers, in the year 1934-35, will contribute <Col N="529" /> £260,000 by way of the 9 per cent. cut.  But that is not all.  In the same period, the Minister will secure, according to the information which he gave me earlier to-day, income from investments in respect of the teachers' pension fund amounting to £51,000.  We can assume, therefore, that, for the year 1934-35, out of a liability of £371,000 in respect of teachers' pensions, £260,000, made up of the 9 per cent. cut in teachers' salaries, plus £51,000 as interest on investments, will be received, showing clearly that, in respect of that year, the teachers will pay £311,000 out of the £371,000 necessary for pensions.  I cannot reconcile that fact with the statement of the Minister to-day that this was a very good scheme.  While he had not the hardihood to say outright, he almost suggested that the teachers were fools not to accept the scheme.</P>
    <P>Let us see what the State is getting out of this settlement&mdash;and when I use the word &ldquo;settlement&rdquo; I am merely quoting the term used by the Minister. Last year, the State's contribution towards pension liability amounted to £77,000.  Next year, by reason of the fact that the teachers will pay £311,000 out of the £371,000, the State will be only liable for a sum of £60,000, as compared with the £77,000 which it had to make good last year.  It is quite clear from that that this is a bad bargain from the teachers' point of view and an extremely good bargain from the point of view of the State. Since I might be accused of taking a particularly favourable year by taking next year when the liability will not be as heavy as it will be in future years, I want to take two other figures mentioned by the Minister.  The Minister told Deputy O'Sullivan that in 1939 the liability in respect of teachers' pensions would amount to £395,000.  Of that sum, £311,000 will be made good by the teachers and £84,000 will be made good by the State, showing clearly, when they pay £311,000 out of a total pension liability of £395,000, that the teachers are not merely discharging 25 per cent. of their former pension liability but are, in fact, discharging more than 75 per cent. of <Col N="530" /> their pension liability.  Instead of the State being responsible, as in the past, for 75 per cent. of pension liability and the teachers for 25 per cent., the State is going to get out of this settlement with a liability of 25 per cent.  Those are the Minister's figures for 1939.</P>
    <P>The Minister gave further figures for 1944&mdash;ten years hence.  These figures show that pension liability in 1944 will be £430,000.  Of that sum, the teachers, according to the Minister's figures, will pay £311,000.  Paying £311,000 out of £430,000, the teachers will be paying approximately 72 per cent.  It is because the teachers are aware that they will have to accept that rate of liability that the Minister cannot get the teachers to accept this settlement.  The difficulty which the Minister has experienced in getting the teachers' organisation, represented by Deputy Cormac Breathnach, to accept a settlement is because the Minister wants to swop his liability of 75 per cent. in respect of pensions with Deputy Breathnach's organisation for a 25 per cent. liability.  No teacher capable of teaching arithmetic would accept a settlement of that kind.  It would be only on the basis that a teacher did not know anything about arithmetic that he could be got to accept this scheme, so skilfully and nicely shoe-horned on to him by the Minister to-day.  No teacher with a sense of responsibility to his colleagues or with any capacity to understand and analyse figures could be possibly got to accept the Minister's scheme.  The Minister knows that the pension scheme, while a good bargain from the point of view of the State, is a very bad bargain from the point of view of the teachers.  The Minister told us to-day that, in accepting this scheme, they are accepting a very heavy liability for future pensions for teachers.  It is so heavy that, as between the year 1933-34 and the year 1944, they will swop a liability for 75 per cent. of teachers' pensions for a liability of 28 per cent.  They are swopping a 75 per cent. liability for a 28 per cent. liability and the Minister tells us that that is a very heavy burden on the State.  The Minister wonders why <Col N="531" /> it is not possible to get agreement on a scheme of this kind.  In the Estimate for next year the Government will be swopping a liability of 75 per cent. for a liability of 20 per cent. and the Minister knows that no responsible teacher could accept a settlement of that kind.  Even twenty years hence, the Government's liability for pensions will not be 75 per cent. but will vary from 25 per cent. to 40 per cent. and all along, during the ten or 20 years to come, the Government's liability for pensions to teachers will decrease substantially.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="532" /> Under the new scheme, the Minister has told us that the teachers will receive a pension on the basis of one-eightieth of salary and emoluments for each year of service.  That is expected to be a full discharge of the responsibility of the State for the pensions of teachers.</P>
