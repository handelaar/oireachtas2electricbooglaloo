      <P>This motion has been moved without notice.  No previous intimation of it has been given to Deputies.  This proposal will cause great inconvenience to Deputies who attend here from all parts of the country and who were unaware that it was to be moved this morning.  There have not been many meetings of the Dáil since its reassembly this year. There have been long adjournments. The House has met to consider the business on the Order Paper with no previous intimation that an unreasonable demand was going to be made on members' time.  If we are to be brought here to consider business which the Government is not in a position to put before the House, and if the House is to be trifled with in this way with regard to business which is unprepared, I think it is unreasonable to expect people to sit here until 12 o'clock midnight to-night in the circumstances.</P>

      <P>I read out for Deputies last night a summary of detailed accounts of the position of Communism here, as known to the police force.  I did that because this immediate threat of Communism is being given as one of the reasons for the need of such a force as the Blueshirts pretend to be.  These reports indicate that there is no organised Communism and no danger of Communism known to the police.</P>

      <P>As I have said, these reports revealed that, so far as was known to the police, there was no menace of Communism in any part of the Twenty-Six Counties with the exception of three places.  Dublin was mentioned.  Castlecomer was mentioned and Kilrush was mentioned.  Dublin, being an industrial centre as well as the capital of the country, might naturally be expected to be the point where there would be the greatest evidence of such a movement if it really existed and where there would be evidence of its activities and strength if it were active and strong.  I remind Deputies <Col N="2511" /> of some things which are well known to them but which, when they are talking in the country, they choose to forget.  At the general election in March, 1932, a Communist candidate contested Dublin City South.  Out of a total poll of 55,701, he received 917 votes.  Another Communist contested Dublin City North and he received 170 votes out of a total of 71,402.  Those who know one of the candidates will agree with me when I say that the major part of his vote was a personal vote and was not a Communist vote. What was the position a year later? That was at the election in 1932&mdash;the election on which we came into office. We are supposed to be pampering Communists, to be permitting this evil to exist in our midst without taking action against it.  What was the position after one year of our administration?  At the general election in January, 1933, not a single Communist candidate was nominated in any part of the country.  At the Dublin Municipal election in June, 1933, two Communist candidates received a total of 413 votes out of a total of 83,299.  Again, a proportion of those 413 votes were personal to the candidate.  What is the use of Deputies on the opposite side going around and pretending there is such a menace of Communism that it is necessary for the citizens to band themselves together in a private army in order to stop it?  Where there are disturbed conditions, where there is social distress and economic distress, there is danger that people who are in want of work and people who are starving will be played upon by people who have certain economic and social theories which, they pretend, will get them out of their difficulties.  That danger is here as it is in every country. It is here now and has been here in the past and at all times.  The way to meet it is the Christian way&mdash;seeing that these people get the means by which they can live.  It is not by going around in blue shirts you will stop Communism.  You will stop it much better by putting on the habit of St. Francis&mdash;if you want to stop it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now this thing of Communism was <Col N="2512" /> worked up to such a stage in the country that there is a background, for the people on the benches opposite, on which they can stand, and work on the fears of the multitude; and they have never been slow to avail themselves of that.  And this gentleman who goes out now and sets himself up as an instructor of youth has not been slow to avail himself of it.  He was a police officer and he knew the facts, and he knows the facts.  He is the very man who submitted and sent us that report.  Some time ago there was a meeting of the United Ireland Party.  Deputies will remember there was some talk in the Press of a Communist convention in Galway.  Now just think of it.  In Galway, where the report was that there was no Communism.  That was given as the centre.  Galway, if you please, was to be the place where they were to hold a Communistic convention. On the very face of it, it was ridiculous.  What was the origin of this talk about the Communistic convention in Galway?  It was circular, of which I have a copy here, which was sent round and posted to some people from an address in America.  I do not even think there was an address to it.  Now anybody can take that circular and look through it.  It is headed &ldquo;Irish Workers' Republic&mdash; Atheist; Birth Control, Civil and Industrial Emancipation Alliance, New York.&rdquo;  That is the heading of the circular.  You look through it and what do you find?  It is the production of some lunatic, some degenerate, perhaps. The same type is frequently found sending round circulars.  General O'Duffy, who is a police officer, and who could estimate the full value of that, instead of being frank with the convention, when this matter was raised, worked it up to such a point that there was a resolution put upon the clár of their convention dealing with it.</P>
    <P>Now this is a report from the <i>Irish Times</i> of what this frank gentleman, who is going to teach honesty to our youth and truth to our youth, says, frankly, facing that convention. Announcing that a series of resolutions protesting against the holding of <Col N="2513" /> a Communist congress were being withheld, General O'Duffy explained that the reason was that the congress was not now to take place.  A gentleman named Barry in New York, he said, had fixed a certain day and place for the Communist congress in this country, whether acting in conjunction with the representatives of Communism here, we do not know; but this is the lesson he wanted to produce, especially upon the League of Youth&mdash;The Congress has been called off, or postponed, because of protests, especially from the League of Youth. That is the lesson taught by a man who sets himself up as the leader of youth and a teacher of honesty. Heaven knows if there is one thing that we want for our youth, more than anything else, and that we want taught in our schools, it is reverence for truth and honesty.</P>

      <P>Now their filthy propaganda has not stopped at that.  The same type of whispering, the same dirty <Col N="2514" /> propaganda is going on now as in 1922. I have here in this House on one occasion had to speak on a personal matter.  I did it, not that I cared a snap of my fingers about what anybody says about me personally but I am jealous, as long as I occupy this particular position, that my antecedents and my character shall not be attacked. Before they went and soiled the steps of God's Altar; the same campaign in another guise is going on now and I know that in order to get some basis for their Communistic attack upon us they are suggesting that I am of Jewish origin.</P>

      <P>Go and read the <i>Cork Examiner.</i>  The proprietor and editor sent me a letter apologising privately and saying that a certain thing was let through without his knowledge, showing what is happening at some of those meetings where this question of Communism is being discussed. There is not, as far as I know, a single drop of Jewish blood in my veins.  I am not one of those who try to attack the Jews or want to make any use of the popular dislike of them.  I know that originally they were God's people; that they turned against Him and that the punishment which their turning against God brought upon them made even Christ Himself weep.  In disclaiming that there is no Jewish blood in me I do not want it to be interpreted as an attack upon the Jews.  But as there has been, and even from that bench over there, this dirty innuendo and suggestion carried, as I have said, formally to God's Altar, I say that on both sides of me I come from Catholic stock.  My father and mother were married in a Catholic Church, on September 19th, 1881.  I was born in October, 1882.  I was baptised in a Catholic Church.  I was brought up here in a Catholic home.  I have lived amongst the Irish people and loved them and loved every blade of grass that grew in this land.  I do not care who says, or who tries to pretend that I am not Irish.  I say I have been known to be Irish and that I have given everything in me to the Irish nation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2515" /> A Spanish vendetta!  The word &ldquo;vendetta&rdquo; has never been associated with the nation of Spain.  I have to apologise to the House for bringing in these personal matters, but I know that they are used, as I said, even to the steps of God's Altar.  If you have anything good in your programme, why cannot you put it to the people and win on your merits?  If you have not, will you at least be decent enough to stop that type of vile propaganda?  Those gentlemen on the opposite benches talk about propaganda !  The first time that it was suggested that I had any Jewish connections was when I was a candidate for a position as mathematical teacher in the Technical Schools in Bolton Street.  Because I was put in the first place by the Selection Committee, this was used in order to prejudice my chances with the voters.  It was used again in America for the same purpose.  As I have said, if there is anything decent or good in your programme, put it before the people and stand on it, but do not hope to be depending on that type of stuff to bring victory to you.  So much for Communism then.</P>
    <P>I also said last night that we are accused of being a Party Government and I challenge any Deputy in this House to show any example of such partiality, such favouritism, such vindictiveness as Cumann na nGaedheal or Fine Gael, as they call themselves, speakers suggest.  Somebody may say General O'Duffy himself.  The former Attorney-General, who knows better, suggested that we were breaking a practice which was established and, in fact, suggested that we were breaking the law in regard to the Commissioner of Police.  He, of all men, should know, and knows in my opinion, that the person who occupies the position of Commissioner of Police was removable at will by the Executive Council without having assigned a reason.  On the occasion on which we were debating the removal of General O'Duffy the Police Acts were read and it was made quite clear that the Executive Council could remove the Commissioner without assigning a reason.  The Commissioner of Police occupies in <Col N="2516" /> relation to the Executive a most important and confidential position. It is essential that there should be no smoke-screen, no half-truths, no holding back from the Executive of reports, as regards the state of the country, which are necessary for the Executive Council in order to appreciate the general position.  I said that we removed General O'Duffy because we had not sufficient confidence in him.  That was a perfectly good reason.  No other was necessary.</P>
    <P>As I said, the position of the Commissioner of Police was left, wisely left, under the Act at the discretion and the will of the Executive Council because, although it is right and good that the Police Commissioner should have independent functions, it is also necessary that there should be only one head and that the people who are ultimately responsible for the peace and order of the country, namely, the Executive Council, should be satisfied that they have in the Chief of Police the best possible instrument for the maintenance of public peace.  If we wanted justification for our action, the attitude of General O'Duffy since he left the police would be a good justification. He is out of the police force, yet he tells us that he has the same sources of information as he always had.  Secret intelligence was obtained by him in the past.  He paid for it with State moneys.  He got information in his position as head of the police and he tells us that he is using that and using that position still.  He has the impertinence and impudence to tell the Guards that he has his eye on them, that they are to be good boys, that he has his personal eye on them.  In other words, he is suggesting to the Guards that he may be back again and that he is watching them.  He is doing one of the meanest and most contemptible things that the holder of the office could do. After he has left office he is trying to use the information and the position which he held in order to tamper with the loyalty of the Guards to their proper officers.  He is supposed to be a police officer or was.  We see a report where he tells the women members of the organisation that he <Col N="2517" /> leads, that they will have hats with hat-pins and, when required, that they will use them in the proper place&mdash;&ldquo;the most effective place,&rdquo; I think, or some such words as these was the phrase used.  That, from this person, who puts himself up as an upholder of law, this person who puts himself up as a teacher of our youth.  We are told by the ex-Attorney-General, Deputy Costello, that we made a political appointment.  What does he mean?  He clearly suggests that we have made a partisan appointment, appointed somebody who is going to work for our Party, who is not going to work for the whole community, who is not going to be impartial in his relations to the whole community.  Every appointment by the Executive Council will be, in a sense, called a political appointment.  His appointment was a political appointment but, in the exercise of his office, I hope and feel sure that he dealt with all the citizens equally; but his appointment was a political appointment just as our Attorney-General's appointment was a political appointment.  Our Attorney-General has his own independent functions just as we have here; we have things to do which injure, in their opinion, quite a large number of our supporters; but as long as we are acting as Ministers we ought to act for the whole community and we do so act.</P>
    <P>Who is this man that we appointed, this partisan appointment that we made?  I have here a few points about the Commissioner of Police and the ranks which he formerly held.  I knew that Colonel Broy had assisted the Republican forces from 1919 to 1921. He did not take our side at the time of the Treaty.  He was appointed Adjutant of the Air Force in 1922. It is rather strange, if we were making this very objectionable political appointment, that we did not choose somebody outside, as we could have done.  We could have appointed to that position anybody outside the police force even, if we thought that by doing so the police work would be better done.  We took a police officer though. I should have said that before he went to the Free State police force, Colonel <Col N="2518" /> Broy was a man who had experience of the former police force.  He had been in the former police force and he was, therefore, a man who was trained from the very bottom up in police work.  In May, 1923, he was Secretary of the D.M.P. Division, an office which he held to April, 1925, when he became, in the amalgamated force, Chief Superintendent of the D.M.P. He was Chief Superintendent of the D.M.P. in 1925 and later he became Chief Superintendent of the Dublin Metropolitan Division of the Gárda. He held that position up to 1929.  In 1929, still with the rank of Chief Superintendent, he was made Commandant of the Depot.</P>
    <P>It was this man, who had gone through practically all the principal ranks of the police force, who had been trained in police work from the bottom up&mdash;it was this man we put in as Commissioner. And we did it because we wanted that it should not be possible that this charge of partiality and partial administration should be levelled against the Guards.  Now, that is the political appointment, and that is the evidence of the vindictiveness and the partiality which this Government have shown.  I submit that this Government has, instead, shown a desire for the impartial administration of the law.  I ask again, is there anybody who will give a single example here in the House of vindictive action taken by this Administration against any officers who were here when we came into office?</P>
    <P>General O'Duffy wants to add to the general suspicion.  There is no doubt whatever that there are large numbers of people in this country who would not think, and do not think, as I think and as I spoke last night.  There is hardly a day passes that I do not get from various parts of the country complaints saying, for example, that Land Commission officers down the country are speaking against the Government and its policy and are using their influence and their public positions to hinder the operations of the Government, to hinder the Government in the carrying out of the policy of which the people approved.  I have heard many complaints that in certain places the <Col N="2519" /> Guards are partial and I say that the people are suspicious.  It is in this atmosphere of suspicion that this friend of the Guards suggests that he is still getting reports from them and suggests that they must look to him and his success for future reward.</P>
    <P>So far from being guilty of this charge that is levelled at us from the Opposition Benches, we have leant backwards, as the Americans put it, and leant backwards deliberately.  We did it deliberately because, not merely had we to be just and fair and sure that we were not partial, that we were fair to all sections of the community, but, under the circumstances, it was necessary that we should avoid as far as possible even the suggestion of being partial, because coming into office, being the first exchange of Government here, it was vital for the future of this country that the idea of continuity of Government and not the idea of a violent revolutionary change with each successive Government should be understood in this country and should be accepted.  I again tell the Deputies opposite that our supporters are the majority of the Irish people as was proved.  That was proved twice.  Even the first time we got a bigger Party vote than any other Party had got at any time in elections since the Treaty.  And the majority of the Irish people, seeing this leaning backwards apparent, had begun to coin here a phrase against us, a phrase which was used at the Ard Fhéis in Dublin, that phrase being that our policy was to forgive our enemies and forget our friends.  As a matter of fact, the suggestion behind that is not true, but if it is coupled with me and coupled with this Administration we shall not be ashamed of it, because anybody knowing the situation, and looking at it as it is, will understand the reason for it.  We have given positions which were directly in our gift.  We have given them to the people we consider the best qualified for them, and we have not considered membership of our organisation as a disqualification.  And would it not be time to even up things a bit suppose <Col N="2520" /> we did?  Public positions, and public patronage, as it is called&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am dealing with the charges that are made against this Administration&mdash;the charges that are being used as a reason for the building up of a private army.  I have dealt with the charge that we were supporting Communism.  I am dealing with the charge that we have been vindictive and partisan; vindictive in our attitude to public offices and partisan in our appointments.  I think any person who has any sense of logic at all will understand that it is relevant.  I was talking about public patronage, or what is called public patronage.  I hate the word, but it is the word that is used in that connection.  Public appointments are paid out of the public purse.  All sections of the community are entitled to their share in accordance with their merits.  For ten years we had an Administration whose policy against a section of the community was revealed in a document that I read some time ago; when certain people were to have a heavy hand upon their lives; when employers were told not to employ them and they were left unemployed when, in accordance with their abilities, they would have <Col N="2521" /> been employed if there were no political prejudice against them.  For ten long years that policy operated, with the result, as I explained last night, that a large portion of the public services was selected from people who had a certain political outlook.  And if there was a bit of evening-up would it not be fair?  It would be fair.  Just as we are going to keep our contract &mdash;at least the State contract&mdash;with the military service pensioners, so also do we believe that those who were in a similar position on the other side have an equal title, and that it is justice and fair-play all round.  That has been our policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This charge of partisanship, this charge of corruption, has no more basis than the charge that we are supporting Communism.  Deputy MacDermot suggested that what is important is partisanship in the administration of the law.  Yet Deputies from that side, in order to make a case in another direction, themselves pointed out that the majority of the people who are at present in prison are people who are supposed, in one way or another, to be opponents of theirs.  Where is the partisanship about that?  In pursuance of a policy which we announced here and which, if we were allowed to carry it out, would be the best policy for this country, we said that we were not going to go into private homes to continue raiding for arms and the rest of it.  If raiding for arms could get those arms Deputies on the other benches had ten years to get them; they did not get them.  If raiding for arms and going into private homes could do it they could have done it.  That policy operated over a period of ten years.  Was it not time to try another policy?  We told the people frankly that we were trying that policy.  It was succeeding before our eyes.  We were able to see from the reports which we were receiving that it was succeeding&mdash;succeeding so rapidly that some of the Deputies on the opposite benches, for whom the success of that policy would be a reproach, desired us to abandon it although it was clearly being successful, and they are now trying to force us to abandon it.  They can do it; they <Col N="2522" /> know they can do it.  I said at the Ard Fheis that no matter who in this State committed an offence against the law the Executive would be forced to arrest him and that there could be no choosing of persons in it.  The Deputies on the other side who are promoting disturbances by their Blue-shirt organisation, who are promoting breaches of the law&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Last night I was passing outside, and I heard a Deputy eloquently talking about the morality of defence and attack&mdash;aggression and defence.  We have the governments of the world trying to settle that question.  Where defence ends and aggression begins is a very difficult question, and what Deputies by their organisation of this movement are doing is creating eternally for us here the problems of disarmament <Col N="2523" /> which, internationally, are puzzling the wisest minds of the world. What is the reason for nations arming? Not one of them will say that they are out to attack; everyone of them will say that they are arming for security and to preserve their rights.

      <P>With regard to this question of partial administration of the law, so far as the ordinary police work is concerned, the Executive Council does not interfere.  The Executive Council does not interfere and should not interfere.  The Commissioner of the Guards has certain defined duties and it is his business to <Col N="2524" /> carry out these duties impartially and every officer under him the same.  In regard to this matter of raiding for arms, there is a big question of public policy involved.  I told the House and I told the country what our policy was and, as I have shown, it succeeded admirably for a year, until this very thing that happens between nations began to happen here.  Certain people, feeling like certain nations, that their rights were in danger, began to equip and arm themselves in order to protect those rights.  Their neighbours on the other side, seeing this arming going on, say &ldquo;This is meant to attack us and we have got to arm.&rdquo;  Unfortunately, for the world&mdash;or fortunately, perhaps&mdash;but unfortunately, so far as this disarmament question is concerned, there is no single authority that can impose its will.  Thank God, it is here&mdash;an authority that can and will insist that this building up of private armies and this arming, whether it be for defence or attack, will not take place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nobody can accuse us of acting hastily but now we are in a situation in which if we do not act, we are going to have, as I have said, day by day the sowing of the seeds of a civil war and we are going to have a very fruitful harvest from it.  We are going to stop it in so far as the resources of this community make it possible.  We said we are not going to raid for arms but that those who would be found with arms in public places were going to be punished and we said that with all our tolerance, there was one thing that was not going to be tolerated&mdash; uniformed parades.  In defiance of that and because the Deputies over there said that it was within their legal rights to wear a military uniform, because that is what it amounts to, and because they were using the machinery of the law to defeat and prevent&mdash;<i>(Opposition laughter)</i>&mdash;Yes, the decision on questions of law is sometimes a very difficult affair as those on the opposite benches should know by this time&mdash;and they do know it.  I have seen the reports which General O'Duffy sent them about the loopholes there were and the difficulties he had in doing certain things and <Col N="2525" /> out of the abundance of their knowledge of the difficulties that attach to administration in circumstances like ours and their knowledge of the rents that are in the very things which they themselves devised, they are using the courts to hamper the Executive when it is necessary in the public interest that the Executive should be able to act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The Deputy cannot even now keep quiet&mdash;this gentleman who protests against interruption at his meetings, in the National Parliament is not able to restrain himself in an argument.  I am not saying anything offensive to him.  My remarks are not of the same type as some of the speeches that are delivered in the presence of some of our followers down the country by people on the opposite benches.  My argument is an argument and not of the type that should rile or excite anybody.  Yet this Deputy who expects us to be angels here is not able to keep himself quiet for ten minutes.  I know as well as the Deputy knows the importance for the individual citizen in the State of having independent courts to protect his rights and from the benches over there, I tried to make that operative. I said a truth when I was on those benches, that it is very important for the individual citizen in the country that the Executive, which has at its command when it needs them all the resources of the community, should not be in a position to abuse them by taking vindictive action, unfair and unjust action against an individual in the community.  That is quite true and there is nobody who respects the operation of the law more than I do and there is nobody who has a keener sense than I of the importance of <Col N="2526" /> Ministers and members of the Government and every public official who has to deal with the community as a whole acting fairly and impartially.</P>
      <P>I know the part which the courts have to play but I know also the duties of the Executive when it is facing a situation such as I see confronting this country, and I say that long and tedious action may tie the hands of the Executive in the matter of taking action at a time when they should take it&mdash;before serious developments have taken place&mdash;and to use the courts to prevent that action, particularly when that is done by men who understand the need of the Executive for such powers, is an abuse of the courts. Suppose we have long and tedious cases in court, occupying months and months and in the meantime, we have an organisation, such as the one which I have referred to several times here already, growing up, with people becoming more excited as they grow up, we will have marching and if one organisation marches 50 strong to some town, other people will march in 100 strong the next day, and if they come in in green shirts or blue shirts the day after, we are going to have other people in other coloured shirts coming along and endeavouring to show that it is they who have the majority of the people at their back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is said that this is directed against the Blueshirts.  It is going to operate against any type of uniform of a political character, and I would remind the ex-Attorney-General that when he was making the point that there was nothing political in the other Acts that were quoted I told him there was, that it is against political uniforms in all these countries that these similar Acts have been passed, because it is the political objective they have that makes them dangerous.  Unfortunately, human beings have a desire to get power.  General O'Duffy knew that when he suggested that those who got in early, who got in as the Americans say, on the ground floor, would have most of the plums.  The glamour of bright uniform, the glamour of marching, is a glamour which has had an effect, fortunately or unfortunately, upon our people.  We have <Col N="2527" /> been called a martial people.  Recent history has made marching more attractive.  Do the Deputies want to see two or three armies here attached to political parties, marching about, or would they not be better satisfied to see that the only people to march about in uniform will be the forces under the command of the duly and legitimately elected Government?</P>

      <P>That is what this Bill is intended to do.  One of the first steps necessary to do it is to ban this thing.  With all our tolerance we could not permit one thing and that is marching about in uniform.  The reasons why we were against it were the reasons apparent to the Belgian Minister when he brought in his Bill. There is the assumption of authority which it gives and the provocation it gives other citizens; the temptation to violence which it brings with it when these men reckon themselves and compare themselves with their opponents and feel that they are stronger.  There is another use which I am told it is being put to here in this country, a still more contemptible and dangerous use, when employers are asking their men, &ldquo;Why have you not got your blue shirts on?&rdquo;  These dangers and abuses are attached to it and it is purely something external that ought not to have anything to do with politics. How will Deputy Dillon be hindered if, instead of going about in a blue shirt, he is going about as his father did and other political people throughout the world do when they go to speak to their people?</P>

I would be within my rights in not giving way.  The Deputy of course denies it and his word is going to be taken.  We were told that no responsible person on the opposite benches would advocate the non-payment of rates, yet the Government was aware and perfectly satisfied that there was such a campaign and the Government has had to take very strong action to end that campaign&mdash; action that is going to bring considerable hardship on the people who were foolish enough to be led into it.  Now to continue about the arms.  We have come to the state when the Government will give orders that anywhere arms are got they are to be seized or that anywhere that the police know that arms are likely to be got they are to take them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>There are ample powers for dealing with that in other Acts and I have told you why it was that the Executive did not use these powers.  It acted in its highest conception of the public interest in the matter.  Public interest and their conception of public interest demand something else now.  It has been said that I have never asked young people not to join the I.R.A.  I waited until first of all we had cleared the road here so that the objections that were put forward actively could no longer hold.  And I waited until there is available for the young Irishman who feels that he ought to pledge himself to his country's defence an opportunity to enter into a force that will be controlled by the elected Government of the Irish people.  For a considerable period it has been known that my view is this that the day when arms outside the control of the Executive were needed in this country's interest is gone.  I see no use for them whatever. I see manifold danger in them.  I said if they are there, they can only be used in a civil war because as long as <Col N="2529" /> there is an elected Government that Government will not permit any section of the people to take upon itself the responsibility of external defence. Before any section of the people could take upon itself responsibility for external defence or external attack, as the case may be, it would have first of all either to beat the established forces by revolution and internal war or it would have to come in definitely under the State and be made amenable to the control of the State.</P>
      <P>There is no way to-day in which the arms of any section of the people can be used from the point of view of general national defence except under the control of the duly elected Government. Everybody knows it.  Nobody who is not a fool can think otherwise. It is obvious, so obvious and patent that the fact itself was sure to sink deeply into the minds of the young people in this country, and it is operating. I say, and I say to any young men who might have doubts that any arms held by the I.R.A. or any other organisation are ever going to be effective again under the circumstances, that they are never going to be effective in the national interests until they are brought under the control of the elected Government.  For good or ill for the future in this country, in my opinion, for good, every act of defence of this country and the assertion of this country's rights must be secured by men led by the elected Government of the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It cannot be secured any other way. I say that these arms that are held outside are of no national value and that they are a tremendous danger. If I had my wish, and it is a wish expressed solely in the interests of this nation, I would do with those arms what was suggested years ago to me, I think by Professor Culverwell, when he was saying that he hoped that the two Christian peoples, the peoples of the Christian religions, north and south, would some day do as the people in South America did when the arms with which they fought each other were used to erect a monument to the Prince of Peace.  If I had my way those arms that were used <Col N="2530" /> through the country would be handed up.  Any of them that are treasured as souvenirs or tokens in the hands of responsible persons might possibly be allowed to be retained under licence. But, if I were asked for another use for them, it is that which I have indicated, which would be the noblest of uses, that a cross, such as the Christ in the Andes, might be put up somewhere in Ireland as a pledge that Irishmen will never again fight each other.</P>

      <P>I have not consulted the Minister for Defence nor the Minister for Finance in this, but the Minister for Defence is organising a new Force. They will require arms for training. What better use could these weapons be put to than to be given to a Force that can really defend the national interests; that will be there to defend the nation, as the nation was defended from 1919 to 1921 under the control of the elected Government of the people? It is only in circumstances like these that there can be any success.  If the elected Government is not moving fast enough, or if the elected Government is moving too fast, there are political ways and means by which, peacefully, not by combat, but by argument, the people can be persuaded to adopt any policy that they conceive to be in their interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are standing for a certain policy.  We believe that it is the best. We mean to go forward with it as fast as the resources of our people will permit.  It is our duty to see that our people are not taxed beyond their strength.  There is no need, therefore, for any private armies or private arms. This nation will go forward fifty times as fast on its road to freedom and to prosperity if those arms are no longer retained by private individuals or private groups.  In God's name let them be sent in.  I would rather a <Col N="2531" /> thousand times to see those arms sent in and dedicated to some purpose, such as I have indicated, than that the police force should have to raid houses and other places, put people in prison and all the rest of what coercion, as it is called, means&mdash;action taken by the Executive with the forces at its command.  Those arms are outside.  Deputies on the opposite benches know that when the army was demobilised large numbers of individual officers took with them some guns they had from an earlier period, souvenirs and so on of various kinds. There is probably no country in which there is such a large quantity of arms out of control.</P>
    <P>We see from the outrages that have taken place recently the danger of all that.  I have seen circulars sent out by the I.R.A. and I know that their local officers are not obeying them.  I know that some of the people who have guns are using them for private purposes, and we cannot stand that. We cannot have houses fired into.  We cannot have people held up.  If we are not able to get the arms in the way I have suggested, the noble way, as a tribute to this country and to its peace, then we will have at least to do everything we can to ensure that those arms will not be misused.  I warn those who have them that the punishments that are available, if those who have them are found with them, are very severe.  If they do not want to find themselves for a considerable time in prison, they will get rid of those arms.</P>
    <P>I feel that I, for one, could step out of public life and step out of it with a satisfaction almost as great as the satisfaction I would experience if I saw the hopes of the dead generations completely realised&mdash;next to that the highest satisfaction of my life would be to see those arms handed in and given for a purpose such as I have indicated.</P>

      <P>Deputies on the opposite benches can do a considerable amount with their people.  I request every single young man in the country not to be misled into sectional <Col N="2532" /> armies.  If he feels that he should dedicate himself to the service of his country in arms, there is a way for doing it.  If he is a fit person to bear arms, he can get into the local Volunteer Force.  If he wants to take up arms as a profession there is, to a limited extent, a place for him in the regular Army.  I appeal to everybody in the country.  To anybody who loves this country, to anybody who wants to see this country reach its goal, to anybody who wants to see the sacrifices that have been made in the past fruitful, I would say, &ldquo;Have nothing to do with any sectional armies.&rdquo;  I speak as one who has a long experience and I ask him to give in those arms and to disband from any organisation that may appear to be a private army. As an individual I have appealed, and as head of the responsible Government I make the demand, that these arms, which are a danger to the public, and a danger to public peace, would be surrendered, so that they may be under control.  It may be suggested that that is strange coming from me. It is only strange to those who have never tried to know the truth.  When the civil war was ended, when it was obvious that we could not maintain the state which had previously existed, and when I saw that could not be done, I was anxious, at least, that a foundation should be laid by which this country would be able to make some advance. I was not the type, and those who were associated with me were not the types, who felt that if their policy could not prevail no policy should prevail; that the country should be in chaos.  We put to the responsible Executive of that day a series of propositions which had the support of all the forces hostile to it at that time.  We made a proposition that this Assembly should be freed from any political test, and that if that were done these guns, which had been used in the Civil War&mdash;these weapons which were out in the country&mdash;should be put under responsible control until the election should have decided national policy.  These propositions guaranteed that from once the people had decided national policy, and once a Government had been elected as a result of that decision, these weapons should be handed over to that <Col N="2533" /> Executive.  I say to-day that these conditions have all been fulfilled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are the Executive to-day.  We accept that position.  We have made that position.  There is no test here. There is no obligation against any citizen, who may represent his fellows, holding any political views he chooses, and getting these political views put forward and accepted.  There is freedom in this National Assembly, freedom to take any action the majority wants to take.  That being so, we hold that there ought to be no objection on the part of those now controlling arms. On their part they were ready to do it for the previous Executive.  We are in office now.  We give these terms and accept them.  We offered them before.  We accept them now as we are here.  We ask, in the national interests, having the same aims which inspired the putting forward originally of these proposals, that they be accepted.  If they have any doubt, if a Republican Government was elected in a majority, or if they have any doubt that, at the next election, they would get a vote in their favour, that there would be any difficulty about the resources of the State going to them, let them give these guns in and put them under responsible control.  If you like we will leave them in neutral ground.  But they must be open and above ground for everyone to see, and be under responsible control.  We will give them barracks in which they can be stored under a responsible guard and, if, at the next election, they get a majority, they can have these arms, and they will have all the arms available in the country to defend and execute any policy that the people, as representing the majority, may decide upon.  That is the way to peace and order.  I know that majority rule cannot be proved to have any special moral sanction behind it.  I know all the arguments that can be put up, whether it is this person with a little education is going to count or that person who has had experience, and all the rest.  I know every objection that can be made against it.  I know that you can qualify actions, of which you must accept as much as you please, just as Deputies on the other <Col N="2534" /> side qualified the payment of rates, and said something about those who cannot pay.  I objected to that, because one knows and learns&mdash;perhaps I did not learn it early enough&mdash;that unfortunately the rules by which society works have had to be, by their nature, more or less rough and ready rules; that if we want a principle to operate we cannot put in &ldquo;ifs&rdquo; and &ldquo;whens&rdquo; and &ldquo;buts&rdquo;; that we must take majority rule as determining policy, and the only way, and that we will have to be content even when we think and are convinced that it is wrong.</P>
    <P>If we modify that we will put ourselves in the position of some Deputies on the opposite side who have suggested that they will obey only the laws they like.  We simply cannot do that.  If we are going to use majority rule as an alternative to force, there is no other way out of it.  We will have to take it.  It is the only alternative. We have to take it because it is the only alternative, and that is its justification.  We can have long arguments on principles and all the rest of it, but they can be resolved in their own way, perhaps, into certain kinds of arguments, such as were before the courts.  It is a question here of majority rule.  I am satisfied it cannot be resolved except in one way, and that is to accept it, whether the verdict at the time is right or wrong.  That is the only way we can move.  We cannot have &ldquo;ifs&rdquo; or &ldquo;whens.&rdquo;  I ask people to accept it in the belief that the alternative is unthinkable; the alternative of fighting each other in order to make our policies predominate.</P>
    <P>I am afraid I have spoken much longer than I intended, but I feel that the things I have spoken of needed to be referred to.  I want to see peace.  I want to see the complete independence of this country reached as quickly as possible.  I want to see success in the national policy that we have put forward.  I want to see this country winning this economic war.  Perhaps I may be pardoned if I say a few words about that.  Certain people complained&mdash;not Deputies on the opposite benches this time&mdash;that we are not fighting this war vigorously enough. <Col N="2535" /> In other words, that our method of trying to secure for this country its rights were not spectacular enough. They thought to help us&mdash;by breaking Bass.  That is not the way to do it. If we are to be helped to win, and to defend the nation adequately against this attack upon it, we must do it, not by spectacular methods, but by reorganising our economic life, so that the pressure being put upon us from outside may not be successful.  It is a very difficult task, but there is one thing about it, certainly it is a task that would, in any case, have to be undertaken.</P>
    <P>Just the same as we cannot put &ldquo;ifs,&rdquo;&ldquo;buts&rdquo; and &ldquo;ands&rdquo; when we talk of the principle of majority, so also we cannot have &ldquo;ifs&rdquo; and &ldquo;buts&rdquo; when we talk of the right of the elected majority who have been entrusted by the Irish people with the conduct of policy.  We ought not to have &ldquo;ifs&rdquo; and &ldquo;buts&rdquo; about their right to use the resources of the country to save the country, and it is upon us in the first instance.  Deputies on the opposite side who were so very emphatic in their approval a few moments ago when I was talking about another section of the community do not seem to be so emphatic in their approval now when it affects themselves, but if we are going to get a demand from one section of the community of loyal obedience and if they are to be told that we are to conduct this in the way that we who are responsible for conducting it shall decide to be the best way in the national interest, so I say to the Deputies on the other side that they ought to patriotically help, too.</P>
    <P>Of course I know what the Deputies on the other side are talking about. I know perfectly well the objections that they will raise: that we want them to keep their opinions: not to express their opinions.  I do not want to do anything of the kind.  I believe that the more some of them go around and talk to our people the more it will consolidate the people in their determination to win out.  The whole strategy of the opposite Party has been based upon this: they know that <Col N="2536" /> the nation is in a difficult struggle, they know that the Executive has a hard task and they are waiting in the hope that the Executive may not be able to perform its proper functions. It is in that atmosphere that they are helping to build up a private army. Now that is not patriotism.</P>

      <P>Again the Deputy has shown how unwise it is for him&mdash; whoever else does it&mdash;to object to people interrupting a public meeting. I believe what I say.  This country wants the loyal assistance of all parties and there is not another country in the world in which it would not be given under those circumstances.  We are told that a solicitor down the country wrote up to me asking to have a conference. I have had a long experience of political conferences of one kind or another.  There was one successful conference and only one that I have ever had anything to do with.  They have been used, every one of them, to misrepresent and to create far more damage than their non-existence would have created.  If there is to be co-operation it can be here.  If the Deputies want to co-operate let them give us helpful suggestions if there is anything in this corporative State which they are talking about.  Let them work it out in detail and see how it will assist our people.  There are things to be done; to develop democratic machinery and to make it available for present day needs.  There are numbers of things to be done.  I had the corporative idea examined some time ago in connection with a possible reorganisation of the Seanad and I was not able to get much help out of it because we have not here the basal organisations which would make it possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said last night, I have no objection whatever to blue.  I have no objection to the salute either.  When I was travelling in America I remember <Col N="2537" /> well seeing, from the observation cars, the workmen on the line as they waved their hands.  I had always thought that it was a manly salute, a much better salute than the mere doffing of one's hat, so if people want to use that type of salute I have no objection&mdash; not the slightest.  I have no objection, therefore, to any ideas of that kind, but what we have objection to, and what this Bill is aimed at, is the branding and the segregating of certain sections of our communities into political groups, drilled and uniformed into private armies.  That is what the Bill is for, and I hope and believe that it will soon become law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>We have heard for the best part of three hours some extraordinary arguments in favour of this Bill.  We have heard lectures and explanations which have nothing whatever to do with the measure and a condemnation of the organisation which it is proposed to ban under this measure.  The main purpose of the speech to which we have just listened was to explain the impartiality of the Government: an apology for its policy, and an explanation of that policy. References have been made in the course of this debate to events ranging over the last ten or 12 years.  One would imagine that the circumstances which have existed in this country from 1927 up to 1934 had been in operation here from 1922 to 1927.  We have been invited by the Government and by speakers on behalf of it practically to accept it that the conditions from 1927 to 1934 were exactly the same as they were from 1922 until 1927.  That is not the case at all, and nobody knows that better than the members on the Front Bench opposite.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had denunciations and bitterness.  In my experience I have seldom listened to, or read, more bitter pronouncements than those which have fallen from Ministers in the course of this debate.  A remarkable characteristic of the speech of the last speaker was this: &ldquo;We can say what we like but you dare not open your mouth; whatever we say is right because we are the just men; we have divine inspirations and so on, and none of the <Col N="2538" /> rest of you ever had them; we were the prophets all along the line.&rdquo;  Now the fact of the matter is that the administration by this Government during the last two years&mdash;during the last three, four, five or six months, the last 12 months if you like&mdash;has no parallel in this or in any other country. What is the purpose of the speech of the President during the last three hours?  A denunciation of the person who was dismissed from office for no reason other than that they had the power to dismiss him.  Every civil servant in the State holds office at the will of the Executive Council.  Practically every member of the Army holds office at the will of the Executive Council, and the same might be said of the Commissioner of the Gárda Síochána.  One of the explanations that they have put forward for that is that we put such a provision into the Act because we wanted it in the Act. Did they think that we should put into that Act that the Commissioner should be dismissed by a vote of both Houses of Parliament?  Is it the contention that he should hold office in the same way as a judge of the Supreme Court or a judge of the High Court holds office, and that we had more confidence in the justice of the people of this country and in the justice of the representatives of the people or the Government elected by the people of this country than was warranted by the circumstances?  Whether the President likes it or not, his own statement in connection with the successor of General O'Duffy shows that his appointment is a political appointment and that it will stand as a political appointment and will be one of the stains on the record of this Administration.  Does it follow from that that each succeeding Government is going to do the same thing?  Is not that the headline?</P>
    <P>As I have said, most of the speech was directed towards the public policy of the ex-Commissioner of the Civic Guards, General O'Duffy, since he relinquished office.  Has he a right to enter politics?  Has he the right of a citizen?  This House passed an Act entitling the Executive to award him a pension.  Has it been paid?  It passed that Act some six or eight or <Col N="2539" /> ten months ago.  Has he received a single penny by virtue of that Act?  Is he guilty of any crime?  Is he not entitled, in justice, to be paid his pension up to the moment that he is convicted by a court, if a court ever convicts him?  There seems to me to be an obsession on the part of the present Government that it is above and before all other authority in this country.  We have such statements as: &ldquo;The courts hamper the Executive.&rdquo;  Did anybody ever hear the like?  What are courts for?  Their function is to interpret the law.  We are the legislators.  If we pass laws, somebody, who knows something about law, must interpret them.  Are we going to interfere with the courts in the interpretation of what the legislature lays down as the law?  The courts hamper the Executive!  Why, according to that, they should be arrested. There is only one court, according to what we have heard this morning, and that is the Executive Council.  The Executive Council is only in temporary occupation.  It has no judicial control and, in looking for that obedience to the law, to which they so often refer on public platforms, they should recollect that they themselves should show obedience to the law of this State.</P>
    <P>That is one case.  Here is a man who, having occupied office in this country for 11 years, and with no charge against him on leaving office&mdash; not alone was there no charge against him but he was actually offered an alternative position and asked to name practically his own price&mdash;goes out of office, and the Government passes an Act to give him a pension.  He has not got the pension.  He has not got a penny of it.  That, in my opinion, is partial administration and an abuse of authority.  Let us take the other case. A man was prosecuted for membership of an unlawful association&mdash;Commandant Cronin.  The Executive Council of this State made an Order on 8th December, published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> on 12th December, and the effect of the Order was that it was evidence that the Young Ireland Association was unlawful.  Mark the distinction! The mere Order of the Executive <Col N="2540" /> Council did not make it unlawful, but it made evidence that it was unlawful; and Commandant Cronin was arrested on 9th December.  On 9th December he was convicted of being a member of an unlawful association and he is now doing three months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the second time the Attorney-General has been reversed.  Do not let us get away from the point at issue&mdash;the impartial administration of the law.  I put it to this House that a person, who was a member of the Young Ireland Association on 8th December and was arrested on 9th December, was prosecuted by the Executive Council for membership of an unlawful association, the result of which prosecution entailed three months' imprisonment.  What was the attitude of the previous Executive Council on this matter?  The Constitution (Amendment) (No. 17) Act, commonly called and incorrectly described as the Public Safety Act, was passed into law on 17th October, 1931.  It is the Act under which Commandant Cronin was prosecuted.  What was the policy of the previous Administration on this question of membership of an unlawful association?  There was a fair warning given, under the hand of the President of the Executive Council, on the very day the Bill was passed.  Young men were advised to withdraw from those associations and their parents, guardians and friends were exhorted to get them to withdraw. In the course of this prosecution, mention was made of the issue of a notice that a certain time would be allowed for people to withdraw from the association in question.  The Order banning the Association, as it is usually called, was made on the 8th December. It was published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> on the 12th and the Association was formally dissolved on the 14th&mdash;within one week.  I put it to the House that the law could not have been conformed with more rapidly than that.  On the previous occasion on which warning was issued, not alone was the statement <Col N="2542" /> distributed throughout the country the following day but a week afterwards at Letterkenny a similar exhortation to people to leave those associations which had been banned was made by myself.  We were told in court that the warning of this Executive would have a life of either two or three days and that the fact that five days or six days had elapsed from the arrest of Commandant Cronin to the dissolution of the Association was not enough.  I ask any fair-minded man to say whether Commandant Cronin, now doing his three months in Arbour Hill, is a criminal.  We were asked to view every act of this Executive as if it were administering the law impartially.  I mention these two cases&mdash;the case of General O'Duffy, whose pension has not been paid, on one hand, and the case of Commandant Cronin, on the other hand.</P>
      <P>Let us come to the question of the Constitution (Amendment) Act itself. What was the policy of the speakers of the Fianna Fáil Party upon that Act in 1932?  There was one regular chorus of condemnation of that Act.  There were assurances to the people that under no circumstances would it be ever necessary for them to put that Act in operation.  They condemned it root and branch.  They condemned it and denounced it and poured scorn on those responsible for introducing it, forgetting that it is not the Government which passes an Act of Parliament but the Oireachtas.  We had some remarkable pronouncements as regards that Act.  On the 23rd February, 1932, the President said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;As regards the Public Safety Act, we propose to repeal it and our intention is to govern by the ordinary law and not by any expedients.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That was before the election.  The Attorney-General addressed himself on the same subject at a meeting held, I think, in Mullingar on the 9th January, 1933.  He said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;We are engaged in a war which is not alone an economic war but a civil war.  It has been suggested that we should apply the Public Safety Act. I may say we have time and again <Col N="2543" /> been asked to deal drastically with our opponents and to give them some of their own medicine but we have decided that it is better to allow complete freedom of opinion despite the fact that it may have damaged us politically.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was for the voter who was told the Government was looking for a mandate.  A mandate for what?  To put the Public Safety Act into operation? To issue a proclamation under the Constitution (Amendment) (No. 17) Act?  Not at all.  They said: &ldquo;We do not want that Act and we will not use it.&rdquo;  What are mandates?  Do mandates give the Executive Council the choice of saying &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo; or of saying both, as this Administration has done?  I have a number of these quotations but I fear it would weary the House to refer to them.  The fact is that the people were left under no doubt whatever that it was not the intention of this Administration to put the Constitution (Amendment) Act into operation.  The people were told that the Fianna Fáil Party could govern without it.  It was mainly upon that title that their candidates got returned to this House at the last two General Elections.  They deceived the people in telling them that they never intended to put that Act into force.  The explanation we got last night was that it was put in force to prevent bloodshed. In an interview with the <i>News Chronicle</i>, published in the <i>Derry Journal</i>, Mr. de Valera said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;During the ten years since the Treaty was forced upon us&rdquo;&mdash;</P>
    <P>They are very comfortable over there with the force that is upon them&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;no less than six Public Safety Acts, three Firearms Acts, three Infringement of Law Acts, four Jury Acts, one Treasonable Offences Act, one Protection of Community Act and the perpetual Coercion Act recently passed, entitled the Constitution (Amendment) (No. 17) Act. Like the British Acts, these have brought only trouble and confusion, turmoil and disorder.  We propose to try the experiment of ruling by <Col N="2544" /> ordinary law instead of these extraordinary expedients.  Our people are law-abiding, law-loving people and they recognise the law-making authority is legitimate and that the laws themselves are fundamentally just.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding that, not alone have we the perpetual Coercion Act, which was denounced, condemned and despised but it is not strong enough for them.  The courts are hampering them. They come along now with this Bill which, the Minister for Justice tells us, includes extraordinary powers which they do not intend to use.  What are the powers there for?  What is the meaning of having them enshrined in an Act of the Oireachtas if they are a joke?  They tell us that they do not intend to use these powers.  But they are the same people who told us that they would not use the Constitution (Amendment) (No. 17) Act.  What reliance can be placed on any statement made by any of them?  One after another they got up and denounced bitterness.  They told us that all the bitterness was on this side.  Let me give some of the statements made by them.  The Minister for Finance said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Mr. Cosgrave had tried unsuccessfully to get members of other parties to join his Party, but he was unclean and a leper amongst politicians and the only man willing to take his hand was Alderman Byrne.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is Christian charity for you!  Mr. Aiken said on the 13th January, 1932, referring to the British Notes:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The British had to say something or they would be letting down Mr. Cosgrave.  He had played their game for ten years.  The British had not even been as strong as Mr. Cosgrave had been.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is about the lightest of the quotations. I have another gem here from, perhaps, the most vigorous speaker on the Government Benches in support of this Bill.  The <i>Irish Press</i> of the 14th January, 1933, contained the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Addressing a large and enthusiastic meeting at James's Street, Mr. Lemass warned the Irish people <Col N="2545" /> not to be hoodwinked by any clamour about negotiations based on ability to pay land annuities.  The design and the intrigue was to secure a new agreement which would be without the legal flaws of the old one and which would secure for England the last penny which Mr. Cosgrave's tax-gathering machine would be able to squeeze out of the Irish farmers if he was returned to power.  That is the aim and design of this interesting intrigue undertaken by a minority Party behind the backs and without the knowledge of the Government of the country.  There is a definition of treason in any standard dictionary and I invite Mr. Cosgrave and his colleagues to look it up.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I had no intrigue with the British, but I want to know from the Ministry if they had any such intrigue.  This is the first time I learned about it, and I could say something upon that subject about the Ministry.  Now this is a class of speech that we are told has a very terrible effect upon the populace. That was stated in James's Street, where I was born, and people are invited to consider, to weigh and to believe that kind of bunk.</P>
    <P>This morning we had an explanation from the President of the Executive Council on various matters.  Apparently, to my mind at all events, he is very thin skinned although he has described politicians as having more than the usual amount of can on their skins.  I advise him not to be so introspective, to observe what other people have to put up with, and have had to put up with.  One statement made yesterday was rather illuminating as to the type of mind on the Government Benches.  Reference was made to Mr. Lloyd George in 1922.  That was the first time we got such a reference. It was an illuminating explanation.  If we are to have honesty and truth in public life let us have an example of it from the Government Bench opposite&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I would advise the President to read his own speeches.  I confess I have not time to do so but I sat here for three hours listening to him.  Perhaps he will look at his own speech himself to know what he did say in the matter.</P>
      <P>Now this Bill has been supported by three or four speakers from the Government Front Bench.  Scarcely a single one of them, other than the Minister for Justice, referred to the measure itself except to one particular paragraph when they said we are not going to have blue shirts, private armies and so on.  The Minister, in the course of his speech, mentioned that he had seen things in his office&mdash;implements or instruments or cudgels or things of that kind&mdash;not lethal weapons I think, which had been in possession of the Blueshirt organisation.  That together with the various other charges, that come from the Front Bench is a matter that can be resolved by the courts, if these things are illegally held or used.  Let us have less boasting from the Ministry about the resources at their command.  Let us have them brought up in court and charges made against the Blueshirts and others who employ illegal methods carrying on this business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is my own experience of the last few years?  I went to Cork in May, 1932, three or four months after the General Election.  I addressed a meeting in a hall there with very great difficulty.  There was continuous interruption and attempts to destroy the meeting.  An uproar was kept up that made it practically impossible for me to address the people of Cork.  Now, what are the circumstances?  No man who represented Cork ever got a greater poll than I got at the General Election.  I think, with the exception of one person, namely, the Lord Mayor of Dublin, I got the highest percentage of votes cast at that election. That is not a boast; it is a fact.  Still, I went to Cork, and certain people determined that I was not to be heard there.  The Civic Guards were there. Last night the Minister for Industry and Commerce invited me to ask General O'Duffy what instructions were given to him on that occasion. <Col N="2547" /> Just imagine a cheap gibe of that sort coming from the Ministerial Benches. Will Ministers ever realise that they are in a position to act for the State, not merely for their Party?  Will they ever realise that in making statements either inside or outside this House they should concern themselves with the country and not with a Party? The nation is bigger than any Party. It is not a part of my duty to ask General O'Duffy, who has been 12 months out of office, what instructions the Government gave him on that occasion.  I will guarantee one thing, and that is that they will not show me any minute of instructions given to General O'Duffy on that occasion. They never thought of it.  They never bothered their heads about instructions. What was the Civic Guards' explanation for their non-interference? That they had no authority and so on. I invite the Minister for Justice to look up the report of that meeting and see if that is a fact.  I went on to a further meeting in Trim.  What happened in Trim?  The A.C.A., or the National Guard, at the time had to create peace out of chaos, which they did.  The officers of this State, or the Government of the State, failed to do their duty and an organisation like that came along, and where there had been chaos, helped to contribute to restore peace and order and stability, in the country whereas the Ministry neglected its duty and did not provide sufficient force to preserve order.  What is the Ministry's contribution towards peace and order in the last few years? Take one case.  I have here an interview with Mr. de Valera.  He stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is up to the Government to see that opportunities for free speech are given, but the Government cannot possibly make people or causes popular.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The statement that the Government &ldquo;cannot possibly make people or causes popular&rdquo; is not the statement of a man with an independent mind, or of a man conscious of his responsibility, either as a Minister of State or as head of the Government.  &ldquo;We cannot,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;make people and causes popular.&rdquo;  What would any <Col N="2548" /> young fellow down the country think of that?  &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; he would say, &ldquo;the President is quite right; he cannot stop us, and he does not want to stop us.&rdquo;  That statement is true for the past two years.  One fellow will say: &ldquo;The President is coming down to us to make a speech,&rdquo; and the other fellow will answer: &ldquo;Who would mind him?&rdquo;  A man in the position of the President of the Executive Council cannot make ambiguous statements like that.  It is no part of his business to say whether causes are popular or unpopular.  Every great cause was unpopular at the beginning; it was unpopular at some time or other during its course.  I deny point blank that what we stand for is unpopular, or would be regarded as unpopular, were it not for the neurotic, unfair, untrue and base statements of Ministers on the other side of the House.</P>
    <P>Take the situation we are engaged in at the moment.  What is it that gave rise to the Blueshirt organisation? How is it manned?  It is manned mainly by farmers and farmers' sons.  Why?  Because they see the agricultural industry they have known and which gives them their livelihood, and which provided for their fathers and their grandfathers, being swept away and the only answer that comes from the Government is, &ldquo;The worst is yet to come.&rdquo;  Farmers who have five, ten or 20 head of cattle find that, try how they will, they are only able to procure one-third or one-fourth of their value.  One Minister says the Ministry will get the people out of that. Another Minister says, &ldquo;Oh, the cattle must be slaughtered.&rdquo;  Who is to pay for them if they are slaughtered?  The taxpayers.  But that means a loss to the country instead of a gain.</P>
    <P>What is our policy?  Help England? Our policy is to get John Bull to pay for that instead of making the unfortunate people of this country pay for it.  Is there anything wrong about that?  As long as the Ministry is responsible for bringing this country into the economic condition in which it now is, one is bound to have very strong and very bitter political pronouncements and speeches.  Talking of the past, we all remember when the <Col N="2549" /> word &ldquo;traitor&rdquo; was bandied about from one to another on the Ministerial Bench and bandied about from one back bencher to another.  What is the meaning of the word?  A man who is a traitor should be prosecuted.  It is the duty of any man in authority to do that.  He fails in his duty to the country, he prostitutes his office as Minister of the State, if he does not put such a person in the dock and charge him with the greatest of all crimes against the State, that of being a traitor.  Have they done so?  No. They have balked at it.  It just suits the hustings.  Those are the people who lecture us about private armies, the dangers of the colour blue and the awful menace of badges and the powers that must be given to the Guards to prevent any person appearing in uniform throughout the country.</P>
    <P>This is a perfectly legal and lawful organisation, the Youth Movement. If there are complaints on the part of the Ministry or the police forces against it, or against individuals in it, they have the courts.  They have, as I said, all the resources of the State.  They would be much better advised in bringing prosecutions for assaults against members of the Blueshirts, if there are such charges, than putting men like Commandant Cronin into Arbour Hill for three months for mere membership of the Young Ireland Association which had been formally and properly dissolved. Let me draw attention to the Crimes Act which was instituted by the British in 1887.  It provided for tabling in the House of Commons a list of the associations or organisations that were illegal and left opportunities to the House of Commons to deal with them. According to a judge of our High Courts mere membership of any one of the organisations was not sufficient for a prosecution or a conviction.  A man had to be identified as doing some overt act in connection with any of these organisations either at a meeting or an assembly, or taking some part in active organisation before he could be convicted in court.</P>
    <P>One remarkable fact forced on my attention during the course of the debate was this: that whatever members of the Party opposite may have <Col N="2550" /> thought or said, there is one thing of which they are convinced and that is to be inferred from their speeches&mdash;that the real home of democracy and liberty is their old Mother England.  That is the one country which has not been mentioned as having any of these shirted organisations.  They are talking of it, but people talk of a great many things. I wish we could clear the mind of the Government and that they could come down to the important things, the fundamental things and take the colours, that are obtruding on their vision, away from their eyes.  The cases of Belgium, Switzerland, Sweden, Norway, and even Holland are mentioned. We have often heard it said that the eyes of the fool are on the ends of the earth.  Take the case of Belgium. Belgium has a very powerful neighbour who was very hard on the Belgians some 17, 18 or 20 years ago.  That neighbour has adopted a particular form of political activity.  Naturally the Belgians would take steps against that form of activity there.  Much the same might be said about Holland.  In either of those countries, I could not tell you which, there is a National Government.  In Switzerland there is a section which is largely Italian. Naturally the Italians there might don black shirts.  That is the reason of the action against them.</P>
    <P>In making a case in connection with this matter, let us keep our eyes on our own problems.  The right of free speech is denied public representatives here.  Has the right of free speech been denied in those countries? What has been the root cause of the objection to the shirt that has been adopted here?  Have there been arms used?  There are no arms here. We do not stand for the use of arms. We are against the use of arms.  We say the other people should not be allowed to use arms.  May I say that I listened to the President's reference to the offer made by Professor Culverwell and I have only to say that I heard of that offer after I had made a proposal myself to the negotiaters who were sent to me by him.  I did not want the arms that were in the hands of these people.  They could have melted them and made monuments <Col N="2551" /> of them if they wished, but I will say this, that I believe the President was never in a position to exercise any influence on the minds of these people.  He had as much influence with them as he has now, and his own statement this morning convinces me of that.  He said he made an offer to make over, or to deliver up the arms.  I do not believe he ever had any authority to do so and that is borne out by the fact that he has not got these arms yet, or cannot get them.  He has as much right to get them now as he had then.  Whether the Ministry like it or not, they had a bad record before they took up the work of this Ministry.  I say that without any bitterness.</P>
    <P>What was the situation here in 1925?  Were not they a pretended Government, making us of the word Ministers?  Were not they Ministers of what was called a Republican Ireland? Did the Minister for Industry and Commerce not act as Minister for Defence in authorising a man to go up to Mountjoy and get out prisoners that were there?  That was the situation in 1925.</P>
    <P>Some criticism was passed here about certain penal enactments or regulations we had in connection with the employment of persons.  What was our duty?  If we found people coming into the service of the State here, for the preservation of which the people had to pay, who refused allegiance to that State, and that their major occupation during the course of their employment was to subvert authority, were not we bound by reason of the authority we got from the people to ensure that they would not do so?  What happened when Ministers saw grace or sense, if I might say so?  About the year 1925-26 they formed the Fianna Fáil Party.  In other words they left the Republic. They formed a Party called the Fianna Fáil Party.  What is the meaning of Fianna Fáil?  Will that be barred under this new Bill?  Is not the meaning of the word &ldquo;Fianna,&rdquo; soldiers of Ireland?  What is the idea?  Look at them&mdash;the soldiers of Ireland!  Of course, there had to be a climb down. I once had to explain a certain word <Col N="2552" /> to a man who was in politics and who did not like it.  I told him that he had got to face the fact that I was facing the Government Front Bench and that, not wanting to let anybody know that I was turning, I walked right out to Clontarf, on into Malahide and all around the country until I came back facing the other way.  Nobody saw me turning, but I was faced in the opposite direction when I came back.  That is what they did in 1925.  Nobody saw them turn when they turned.</P>
    <P>They left their life of political sin and they said: &ldquo;We are now in grace, we are forming this new Fianna Fáil Party; we are the soldiers of Ireland.&rdquo; Then they said &ldquo;The Civil War never happened and we never had any responsibility for it.&rdquo;  That is not a fact. The Civil War did happen and the Ministers over there went on with the play-acting for a couple of years afterwards. I say it without bitterness; I am simply stating the facts.  There is no use in blaming the last administration for its penal enactments or regulations without adverting to the circumstances of the time.  We had no authority from the people to allow into the service of the State in any capacity persons upon whose loyalty to the State we could not depend.  If Ministers over there look at the records since 1927 they will find that a very different policy permeated the Ministry.  Some of these regulations were withdrawn, but there is one that they have no right to withdraw, and that is the one relating to bringing into the service of the State people who would conspire to bring it down. We have stood for majority rule all along since 1922.</P>
    <P>In the course of the discussion on this Bill we were accused of usurping the functions of the police.  We did not want to do that.  We wish the Blueshirts to be relieved of the responsibility of keeping order, but we have no undertaking or security that if they go out of existence order will be kept. What is the explanation of what occurred in Limerick?  A meeting was advertised to take place in Limerick. As we were walking up the street, we were met with showers of stones and bottles, and all that happened before the people heard any meeting <Col N="2553" /> being addressed.  Is there anyone going to stand for that policy or that sort of conduct in public life?  When it happens, is it not the duty of a Minister to go out and condemn it?  We did it during the course of our office and we have been abused for all the Coercion Acts passed, Acts that were passed only to ensure the lives and liberties of the people.</P>
    <P>When the 17th Amendment was proposed here, Fianna Fáil was mentioned only once in the course of an hour's speech and that was because someone said something provocative about it. They were mentioned only on one occasion in the course of that discussion and yet on this measure there was repeated denunciation of this Party as if we were responsible for all the disorder.  Have I not got a right to go to Cork to address my constituents? If I am not given the protection that a public representative should be given by the police, am I to be debarred from supporting and helping and organising a body of men, such as the Blueshirts, to preserve order?  Having failed in their duty, and seeing what has happened as a result of their failure, the Government now say that this organisation is illegal and improper and charge us with militarisation.  What is militarisation? We are told that no military titles can be used.  I would swap all the military titles in the world, if I were a gunman, for a .32 revolver. I am sure the Minister for Defence would do the very same thing&mdash;that is, if I interpret his smile correctly.  The use of military titles is one of the things they are going to put down and it will entail a fine of £25.  The possession of a gun would not cost as much. The Attorney-General will recollect that a man who fired into the house of a citizen in Mayo was simply charged with the possession of the instrument and not with the firing of it.</P>

      <P>Very good.  We will leave it so.  In the course of a speech by a Fianna Fáil back-bencher yesterday I learned that at all the victory meetings held after the general election of 1933 toleration was recommended. My recollection is that my effigy was burned at quite a number of these meetings.  That was the type of toleration that was recommended.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>In the same County of Mayo my recollection is that a Parish Priest's house was attacked by the crowd.  There is no use in Fianna Fáil saying that all the purity in the world is over there, when we have these particular incidents to recall to their memories.  I will help Deputies opposite any time they are engaged in recollecting their offences.  They will not get over it by saying &ldquo;And for all my sins which I cannot now remember.&rdquo;  The fundamental difference between this bench and that bench is that this bench has got to consider the difference between right and might.  I have had to address the Minister for Industry and Commerce here on a previous occasion about his conception of the power of the Ministry. The Ministry is not omnipotent. If it has the might to do these things it may not have the right, and Ministers are inclined to confuse those things.  This Bill is an infringement of the rights of the people and it is absolutely wrong.  Let us have a look at Section 6:&mdash;</P>
      <P>It shall not be lawful for any person to carry any weapon at, near, or on the way to or from any public procession or public meeting.</P>
      <P>In sub-section (3) (c) it states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>...it shall be a good defence to such charge for such person to prove ... that such person ... was not, on such occasion, taking part in, or attending, or otherwise acting in relation to any public procession or public meeting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us say there is a meeting in Tuam.  It is a fair day, and a farmer is either driving his cattle or has sold <Col N="2555" /> his cattle&mdash;in the very unlikely event of that happy transaction having taken place.  Driving his cattle he has a wattle or an ash-plant, or some other instrument which would come under this measure.  Let us say there is a very industrious new member of the Gárda at or near the meeting, and he sees this farmer walking along in great vigour, having sold his cattle, or very determined if he has not, and he concludes that this man is taking part in the proceedings, in or near this meeting, with his plant.  Having the right to suspect him, he arrests the farmer.  Now, according to Section 10 (2), any person arrested may be removed to and detained in custody in any prison, station of the Gárda Síochána, or other place authorised by law for the detention in custody of persons awaiting trial.  Mark you, he need not be brought before the District Justice until &ldquo;as soon as may be practicable.&rdquo;  What is the meaning of that?  That man may be three weeks in jail, and at the end of that period he proves that he was simply engaged on his ordinary work trying to sell cattle or delivering them, having sold them.  He is kept away from his wife and family the whole time.</P>
    <P>Of course they tell us it cannot be done.  Well, I have to remind them that there were nine farmers from the County Waterford three weeks in gaol before they were charged with any offence.  Although they were found &ldquo;not guilty&rdquo; they were away from their farms for three weeks, and that happened under the Constitution (Amendment) (No.17) Act.  May I say that in the course of the President's pilgrimages through the country he has stated on more than one occasion that there has been a campaign against the payment of rates.  Where is the campaign, and who is responsible for it?  What are the Guards doing, and what is the Ministry doing, that they are not bringing the responsible people to justice?  Those charges against citizens should not be bandied about unless you can bring the people to justice.  I deny that there is any campaign, as far as we are aware, <Col N="2556" /> against the payment of rates.  I am not denying that there may be certain people, just the same as in any other capacity, who may say: &ldquo;Well, the times are difficult and we are not going to pay,&rdquo; or &ldquo;I am not going to pay,&rdquo; as the case may be.  That is quite possible.  In fact it would be unreasonable to expect anything else, but I want to put this point before, this House as I have put it before, that if the condition of the farmers of this country is such that they cannot sell their produce, that prices are not remunerative, and that the costs of their business are such that they are unable to make money, it is only natural that they should delay in paying their rates, or that they should say: &ldquo;We are unable to pay them.&rdquo; I am perfectly certain that if one were to place any of the four Ministers who are sitting before us in the position in which those farmers are, they would form an illegal association of some sort to protest against the infamy of any Government that would try to get rates out of them.  While you may be selling cattle at £1 a head, and incurring costs to the people concerned, next year's rates have got to be considered.  You cannot go on at that game.  You have to consider, in connection with public order in this State, all the circumstances in connection with the present economic trouble that there is in it.  If you are going to rule you must see that there is a fair opportunity given to the citizens to get a livelihood in their own country.  While one may talk in a very high falutin' way about the nation, and about sacrifices, and about the great spirit that there is, in the long run one cannot expect people who cannot pay their way to have any enthusiasm for a fight of any sort.</P>
    <P>While listening to portion of the speech made yesterday by the President I thought he was going to get to business.  An announcement has been made in the Press recently of a complete change of policy on the part of the Government, and an offer to withdraw this Bill&mdash;an offer to withdraw this Bill on condition that we would do for them what they believe they will not be able to do for themselves <Col N="2557" /> under this measure.  Mention of a composite force was made last night by the President, and it was further suggested that the two organisations should join in order to get peace.  He did not develop the composite force business to any extent, and I do not believe there is anything in it.  So far as the two organisations are concerned, if both sides concerned themselves with the things that are fundamental&mdash;respect for the law, the denunciation of any interruptions at public meetings or interference with free speech&mdash;it would do very much more good than the getting together of two organisations.  All over this country I have stood for that for 12 years.  I never interfered with getting what protection was necessary for Deputies opposite during the period in which they said they were not as popular as they are now.  It may be necessary for us to do it again. If this organisation keeps going on at the rate that it is going, and if the Government's policy continues as bad as we have seen it for the last two years, it is inevitable that it should happen.  If Ministers concern themselves with their own supporters, if they listen to such speeches as came from the Minister for Justice&mdash;&ldquo;get rid of the accursed crowd&rdquo;&mdash;if they look into their own hearts, into their own consciences and their own acts, as I would recommend the Minister for Industry and Commerce to do, without making baseless accusations against me, they will probably find that there will be no need to stress the point of free speech and free expression of opinion throughout the country.</P>
    <P>An opportunity was given some time ago to the President of the Executive Council if he wanted a conference on this matter.  Like him, and knowing him, I have not much faith in those conferences, but, unlike him, I could not find any justification for refusing a conference which was to be presided over by such a distinguished Irishman. If an attempt were possible I would be prepared to make it, although I will admit at once, and I want it to be thoroughly understood, that I see no prospect whatever of having any <Col N="2558" /> agreement with the President of the Executive Council.  We have different views about various matters.  I do not subscribe to his view about the present economic situation.  I do not subscribe to his view that this economic war should go on.  My idea is that it should be stopped at a moment's notice if it were possible to do it.  I believe at the present moment that the quota system, which has been inaugurated by the British Government, would not have lasted 24 hours if the Government had handled the situation properly.  If the Government had taken up that matter, and had dealt with it as Government to Government, and had not been afraid of them, that is what should have happened.  We are not going to get agreement on that.  We see the farmers of this country suffering, and while they are suffering we are saying to them, &ldquo;Law, law, law.&rdquo; Now, that is not common sense.  It is unreasonable.  If, and when a fair proposal is put before this Party in connection with any national, political or economic problem we are prepared to consider it.</P>

Deputy Norton saw the Bill before it was printed.  He told us so here.  He told us here that he was against dictation in this country except the dictator that the people wanted.  Did anybody ever listen to such bosh&mdash;&ldquo;except the dictator that the people wanted&rdquo;? The Party that denounced the Constitution (Amendment) (No. 17) Act, the Party that put out two of its members for voting for it, are now swallowing it and saying &ldquo;give us something stronger.&rdquo;  The fallen snow is trodden into slime and fallen virtue into nameless vice&mdash;that is the Labour Party for you.  This Bill is not introduced to make peace in this country.  This Bill is introduced to&mdash;as the Government says&mdash;do away with bitterness.  Most of the people who are in this new organisation know nothing of events that happened ten or 12 years ago.  I suppose it would astonish Ministers on that bench to know that quite a number of the undergraduates in the universities do not know anything of those events.  They are historical, as far as they are concerned.  They have escaped their minds, and quite a number of the school-boys at the present moment know nothing of them and they are now to be outlawed by this Administration, although brought into existence for the same laudable purpose as were the Volunteers originally, with this difference, that they are unarmed and will remain unarmed, doing very difficult duties in circumstances different from what they were at that time, but all the time with one main object in view&mdash;to keep up the character of this nation as a peaceful nation, as a just nation and as a nation which stands for the freedom of expression of opinion.  The Historical Manuscripts Commission has issued a reference to the years 1517-1522 which quotes excerpts from Galway bylaws. These laws order:</P>

    <P>&ldquo;That no guns or powder or saltpetre were to be sold to any Irish or outlandish man nor armour (not even &lsquo;yarn for a cross bow string&rsquo;) and <Col N="2560" /> that if any man shall bring any Irishman to brag or boast upon the town, he is to forfeit 12 pence; that no man of this towne shall host or receive into his house at Christmas, Easter and no feast else any of the Burkes, McWilliams, Kellys nor no sept else; and that neither O nor Mac shall strut or swagger through the streets of this our towne.&rdquo;</P>

I can say that definitely.  I have heard, as very probably other people have heard, rumours of various goings and comings which enabled the Deputy to change his policy overnight at an election time.

      <P>The Ministry was engaged in the doing of its duty. There was no intrigue.  If we carry out negotiations with Britain, there is no intrigue.  I am not aware that there were any negotiations that were not made public property and that is why I object to the suggestion that the Government was engaged in an intrigue.  We are the responsible Government and it is our duty to have correspondence occasionally and to deal with these public matters.  If that is called an intrigue, it is a new use of the word.</P>

      <P>I object to the Committee Stage being taken on Wednesday next.  This is a very important Bill, and has been the subject of a three days' discussion&mdash;a discussion which has been closured. Every clause of the Bill raises very important principles dealing with the ordinary liberty of the country.  We want to have a further opportunity in the light of the discussion that has taken place, to see what, if any, amendments can be put into the Bill later.  I oppose the taking of the Committee Stage on Wednesday next.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill has been discussed for two and a half days.  As far as its framework is concerned the Bill is a very simple one, and Deputies should have their minds made up by now as to what amendments they can make.  There are only 12 sections in the Bill, so that I think it is quite reasonable to take the Committee Stage on Wednesday.</P>

      <P>Are we to understand that there is any urgency for taking the Committee Stage on Wednesday? Can the Minister give any reasons why it should be taken then instead of on Wednesday week?  Is the matter so urgent that it should be taken on Wednesday?  Are the Government so much afraid of the Blueshirt organisation?  In view of the fact that, according to the Minister himself, the Bill is so simple, would he tell us why he could not agree to have the Committee Stage on Wednesday week instead of on Wednesday next?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will recollect, I am sure, one statement he made in connection with the Bill.  He said that it was a very far-reaching measure; that there were portions of it it was his intention not to exercise, and that it was obvious that, in the administration of it, a certain amount of discretion would need to be exercised. The Minister will certainly agree on reflection, I am sure, that in the case of a Bill such as this, containing powers out of the ordinary, Deputies should be given ample time to consider the framing of amendments deemed advisable to it. As regards taking the Committee Stage on Wednesday next, I presume it is not the intention to ask for all stages of the Bill next week.  If that is so, then why not order the Committee Stage for Friday?  In view of the fact that the House is sitting later than usual to-day, and that many members cannot travel to their homes until to-morrow, there is really no time allowed for the preparation of amendments.  Having regard to the fact that the Secretary to the Executive Council has been laid up and that the same thing may happen in the case of Ministers, I think the Minister should agree, with a view to relieving all anxiety over the weekend, to reconsider his attitude.</P>

      <P>As the Minister is making provision for a further sum for the payment of pensions to resigned and dismissed R.I.C. men, I want to say that I personally appreciate the action of the Minister in setting up this Commission of Inquiry.  I hope that its proceedings will be brought to an end as quickly as it is possible, having regard to the fact that a very large number of claims will, I presume, have to be dealt with.  I believe the Minister is quite right in his terms of reference; that is, in putting the onus and the responsibility of proving a claim on the person who makes it.  I would like to have some information <Col N="2575" /> from the Minister as to why the claims, the very small number, I understand, of ex-members of the D.M.P. have been specifically excluded by the terms of reference and why it is that the claims of three or four men, who undoubtedly resigned or were dismissed because of their national sympathies, cannot be heard by this Commission of Inquiry.  Could the Minister give the approximate number of claims received since the advertisement dealing with this Committee of Inquiry appeared, state when it is likely the work of the Commission will conclude and whether he can hold out any hope from whatever examination he has made of the claims received previous to the setting up of the Commission, as to the number likely to be disposed of to the satisfaction of the applicants?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all I should like to say most emphatically that the terms of reference that have been given to the new Committee to inquire into the cases of those who claim they were entitled to pensions by reason of the fact that they resigned from the old R.I.C. on patriotic grounds represent the Government's last word in the matter.  With regard to former members of the D.M.P., I should like to say that there never was at any time a promise given to them, equivalent to the undertaking which was given by General Collins, I think, in 1922, to the former members of the R.I.C.  The attitude which our predecessors took up in regard to those men was that any of them that were suitable for reinstatement were reinstated in the D.M.P.  Accordingly, I do not see any reason why we should <Col N="2576" /> now extend the terms of reference of the present Committee so as to embrace what is an altogether separate and distinctive matter.</P>
      <P>I am not able to give the Deputy precise figures with regard to the number of cases which the Committee may have to consider, but I should say that prior to setting up the Committee there had been received in the Department statements from at least 700 persons all claiming to have resigned from the R.I.C. for patriotic reasons and all claiming to have been rejected by the Committee of Inquiry set up by our predecessors.  I do not know how many of those cases will now come before the Committee, because people will have to make fresh claims, but, in any event, it is clear that as each case will have to be individually investigated it would be impossible for me at the outset of the Committee's inquiry to forecast a date for the completion of the inquiry.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that the terms of reference of the Inquiry exclude certain applicants; for instance, the men who surrendered arms in Listowel barracks; and that, simply because they had under three years' service, their cases cannot be considered under the terms of reference? I feel that there is good reason why the claims of these particular applicants, who had under three years' service, should be considered, and I think that some consideration should be given by the Government to the claims of these men.</P>

      <P>When the Government came into office, we put the Constitution (Amendment) Act out of operation, and, at the beginning of this financial year, it was not anticipated that any money would be required for the Army end of the expenses under that Act.

      <P>I am not surprised at the Minister having no justification for the action that has led to the taking of this particular Vote.  We had the very bald piece of history that, when the Estimates were being framed, it was not anticipated that the Government would make use of this particular machinery.  I gathered that the Minister might have said something as to what intervened between the framing of the Estimates, when they were originally framed, and the putting of this Act into operation last August.  Again and again, we have challenged the Government <Col N="2578" /> to give any justification for that particular administrative act on their part in issuing the proclamation under the Constitution (Amendment) Act, No. 17, of 1931.  They have always failed to do so, but they have given us here in the Dáil, again and again, extracts from letters for the month of October&mdash;several months subsequent to the use of that particular power&mdash; as a justification for what they did in the month of August.  These letters were not the slightest justification. Even the Attorney-General was not able to twist&mdash;nor was the Minister for Justice&mdash;the purport of these letters into any suggestion of illegality on the part of the particular body for which this Act was brought into force.  The only real attempt at justification made was the dissemination by the President of the Executive Council of a lie.  It was an abuse of his position as President of the Executive Council and an abuse of this House when the President deliberately circulated a lie.  That was the sole excuse that was given.  That was one of the main excuses, at all events, that was given for the calling into force of this particular section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many things, of course, in this position that we cannot discuss. I want to make it quite clear at the beginning that I have no intention whatsoever of discussing the court, but I presume that the expenses of the court are included.  I could not gather from what the Minister said how exactly this amount of money is made up, but I presume that all the expenses of this Act&mdash;I wish we had the details of them&mdash;are included in this Vote.  What was the position?  We had the President of the Executive Council, in public interviews and in speeches, going around the country boasting that at last there was perfect peace in this country.  It must be remembered that that perfect peace continued, so far as the opponents of the Government are concerned, up to the time when this Act was brought in against the opponents of the Government.  There had been no hint that there was any breach of the peace, or that any organisation had been established that had as one <Col N="2579" /> of its methods for the realisation of its aims the employment of force. There was no breach of order; there was no threatening of the peace, so far as the opponents of the Government were concerned; yet it was against these particular opponents that the Government determined to enforce this particular Act.  Those who had been particularly marked out on account of their observance of the law and their respect for the law&mdash;it was against those and those alone that the Government last August brought this Act into operation.  If the President was able to boast of peace in the country during the first period of his office, to whom, normally, would the credit for that go?  Who are those who disturbed the peace and used violent measures against the Government?</P>
    <P>I suggest, sir, that the Ministers, at least, should keep some order in the House.  There is continual loud conversation going on between them and it is impossible for any Deputy to make himself heard under the circumstances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest, a Chinn Comhairle, that you call the attention of Ministers to the fact that their conversation is interfering with speech in this House.  Those who had become the Opposition religiously, openly and in every possible way showed their respect for the liberties of the people and for the law of the land.  In no single instance did the Government even suggest that there was a breach of the peace by the organisations against whom they enforced this Act or that there was any intended breach of the peace.  Not once did they suggest that the A.C.A. or the National Guard had been guilty of any offence.  They could not even show that the organisation was illegal. It was the opponents of the Government who strictly observed the law, and the breaches of the law uniformly came from the supporters of the Government, the friends of the Government, and the allies of the <Col N="2580" /> Government.  It was they who, all the time, were really threatening the peace.  It was not the individuals or the organisations against whom the law was enforced that threatened the peace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In quotations given to-day, we heard how members of the Government abhorred the idea of governing by exceptional laws and how determined they were to rule by the ordinary law. That is the experiment they were to try.  They did not try that experiment. It was clear from the beginning of their assumption of office that they resented any criticism whatsoever. We had an extract read from a speech by the law adviser to the Government, the man who ought to keep the Government right in legal matters.  The Attorney-General in that speech, delivered in the year 1933, said that there was practically a civil war in the country.  That shows you the conception of the position by the legal adviser to the Government. Everything the Government have done since shows that he was interpreting the mind of the Government if he was not interpreting the law.  That shows the conception they have of liberty. Any criticism amounts to civil war.  We had last night from the man who has made use of those powers against his political opponents another threat of civil war unless his political opponents bow the knee before him.  His speech was an appeal to sweet reasonableness. As I have often said in this House, it is not the words of the President we ought to pay attention to. When he thinks it wise he adopts the sweet reasonable attitude.  If anything is clear from the speeches made from the Government benches in this debate and from the speech of the President himself, it is the viciousness, hatred and bitterness behind the Government's administration of the Act with which we are now dealing. The only people who threatened the peace were the supporters of the Government and their allies.  Those were the people who made it quite clear that they had arms in their hands and that, if necessary, they would use them when the time came.  These people&mdash;the people who treated this <Col N="2581" /> Government as a Government on tolerance&mdash;were the people who were a menace to the peace.  It was not against those people that this Act was put in force.  It was against citizens legally organised in the pursuit not merely of legal but of laudable objects. Against those people solely was this Act enforced.  We heard from Deputy Cosgrave the promises made by members of the Government in regard to this matter.  We challenge them to produce the slightest justification for the manner in which they have gone back on the promises given to the public.  They are using this Act to crush their political opponents and to try to goad those opponents into something that is illegal.  I am not going to discuss the court.  I am not at liberty to do so.</P>

      <P>What I am anxious to discuss and intend to deal with is the attitude of the Government and the mentality of the Government. What was their conception of this court?  What do they think this court is calculated to do?  What do they think this Act is calculated to do? They had no case for bringing this Act into force.  I am justified then in drawing the conclusion that they brought the Act into force because of what they alleged, in 1931, the Act was going to achieve.  This was the view of the Minister for Justice of the effect the operation of this Act was bound to have:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;This is not a Public Safety Act; it is a Public Provocation Act.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall quote from the Deputy, too.  I am not forgetting him.  He need not be so vain. That Act, described as a Public Provocation Act, was enacted when the courts of the country had failed to function and juries were afraid and when witnesses were afraid.  It was brought in against societies that had made it their avowed object to overturn <Col N="2582" /> the elected Government by force of arms.  In those circumstances it was described by the present Minister for Justice as a Public Provocation Act. The present Government brought the Act into operation by proclamation in the month of August.  There are overwhelming grounds for saying that if the Act was of that kind they have used it for that purpose ever since. Again and again, they have tried to provoke the decent and disciplined young men of this country into breaches of the peace.  They are disappointed because they are unable to do so. They, from above, and their allies, from below, have tried that provocation. What the Minister said is true of the Act in their hands, &ldquo;This is not a Public Safety Act; it is a Public Provocation Act.&rdquo;  I do not wish to repeat the threats made by the same Minister of the reactions of this Act when brought into force in justifiable circumstances.  I think we can leave those alone.  They practically meant that there was only one way to deal with this Act.  The Government tried to get the young people of this country into that particular method of dealing with this particular Act, and thank God they failed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, to satisfy the vanity of the Minister, we are going to abolish the courts, we are going to set up a revolutionary tribunal and, by the Public Safety Act, we are going to appoint five persons to act as Deputy Mulcahy's bloodhounds.  That is his conception of the court.  That is the Fianna Fáil conception of the court, and that Party now stands for bringing that particular Act into force. Only the Minister could not avoid bringing in the bloodhounds.  We have got Shelley, and the Minister cannot refrain from referring to the seven bloodhounds, but instead of seven we are only going to have five.  Therefore it is quite clear the way the Minister regards this court, and I suggest that by their use of this court since, and the various preliminaries leading up to it, they have tried to fulfil their various promises and conceptions of this Act. We had a similar condemnation throughout the country.  Now what did they do?  Not when the opponents <Col N="2583" /> of the Government were out in revolt against the Government, not when there was a society manned by opponents of the Government, but in time of peace, when they cannot make a single charge except such a one as the President made against Deputy Mulcahy, when they cannot do anything else than bring insults against their political opponents, they bring forward this Act.  The first hint we got of that was in the debate on the President's estimate last July.  Anyone listening then could know what was coming.</P>
    <P>A very different attitude was adopted towards another class of people in this country.  To those with the guns the President said: &ldquo;We cannot get after your guns, but do not parade them in public.&rdquo;  That is what it practically amounts to.  After all, he said in so many words, &ldquo;you are my friends.  Our difficulties as a Government would be almost insuperable if you paraded your guns in public. We have a number of decent supporters and they would not like it. They expect us at least to keep up the appearances of Government; we cannot get after your guns; but if people march in blue shirts they will be stopped.&rdquo;  Anything more partial or destructive of public order, or more calculated to bring the law into contempt, than that discrimination in favour of the law breakers and against the law keepers, anything more injurious to public order than that indication of policy which we got in July last, I cannot imagine.</P>
    <P>That was carried out and fulfilled when the President and the Executive Council by Proclamation brought this Act into force in the month of August. That state of affairs has existed since August, when he told the law-breakers that they could keep their guns if they would only keep quiet.  He took away guns from those who held them lawfully, while he would not go after the guns which were held by people unlawfully.  He favoured the possession of arms to those whom he presumed to be friends of the Government, on the one hand, and took them away, on the <Col N="2584" /> other hand, from those who were opposed to the Government.  We need not go into details on this matter, but I suggest that the Government, in this particular instance, has gone, not for the first time, for inspiration to a distant country in Europe.  I suggest this, that if you make the necessary allowance for the fact that Russia is in the East of Europe and we are in the extreme West this passage that I am about to read is not an inapt description of what is happening in this country, although it was not written in reference to this country.  A traveller in Russia writes:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It was a daily occurrence while I was in Russia, and will no doubt continue to be a daily occurrence, for gangs of young rag-tag and bobtail Communists to set upon a farmer, rob him of his hay, his cows, his horses, break down his fences and ruin his cottage, after which excesses the Soviet authorities attacked the injured farmer in their turn and banished him.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Essentially, not insisting upon a mere copy of details, that is the attitude of the Government and their friends here in this country.  The law-breaker, the violator of the rights of liberty is the innocent party; the perfect lamb in the mind of the Government.  The person attacked, and whose rights are interfered with is the provocative party.  It is against him that new legislation is required, as if the legislation we are now discussing were not sufficient.</P>

      <P>Perfectly clear, but, of course, I do not expect to make things clear to the Minister. Now, having put this Act into force, and set up the Tribunal, how did they proceed to operate it?  They pretended that there was danger abroad, that there was an organisation in existence for illegal purposes.  Why did they not test that?  Why did they not bring that matter before the courts?  In all the months between the preparing of the original Estimate, and the completion and bringing of this Act into force, why did they not test the legality either as to the aims or the methods of the conduct of the particular individuals or the Association against which they called this Public Safety Act into operation?  Not for one moment did they do that.  Even when they did call it into operation what did they proceed to do?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Did they once try, did they once attempt even before the Military Tribunal, to test that issue, to test whether there was, in fact, anything that was wrong or illegal, against the public interest or against the laws of this country in the activities of these bodies?  They did not.  They carefully avoided that.  I presume some members of the Government, if not their legal advisers, must have been familiar with the Constitution (Amendment) Act.  Surely anybody would have thought that Section 19, sub-section (1) gave a sufficiently wide scope if they had anything to say against those associations. Why were prosecutions before the Military Tribunal not brought under 19 (1)?  There is there a list, (a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), of sub-paragraphs, specifying various offences in great detail and various conditions that would make an association an illegal association.  Did they proceed under that?  Did they try to proceed, when the organisations against which they were blooded up, were guilty of any offences specified in any of these conditions? They did not.  What did they do?  They estopped the defence and the court from investigating these things&mdash;completely estopped them, because they proceeded under Section 19 (2) which practically allowed no discussion <Col N="2586" /> as to the merits of the case, which laid it down that the mere expression of opinion by the Executive Council was evidence that could not be rebutted. No requirement, mind you, none whatsoever, to show that there was anything illegal in these bodies against which they were out.  All that was necessary was for the Executive Council to say: &ldquo;We regard this as an illegal body.&rdquo;  Any argument on the merits of the case was then estopped.</P>
    <P>Having failed in this House or elsewhere to put up the slightest case, having failed, as they were bound to, to show that there was anything illegal in the objects which these associations had put before them, in their methods or in their conduct, having debarred them access, as far as they could, to the ordinary courts, having set up a Military Tribunal, they then prevented the Military Tribunal and the defence from arguing on the merits of the case.  That is the policy the House is now asked to approve.  What are they engaged on? The punishment of crime?  Nothing of the kind.  Nothing is further from their thoughts.  There is no suggestion of crime, there is no punishment of crime so far as these organisations are concerned.  It is not crime they are punishing.  They are simply punishing their political opponents, punishing them because those opponents threaten to be successful politically.  They are engaged in pretending that that is illegal, that that is against the law, that that is wrong which no decent man in this country believes to be wrong.  To take up an attitude of that kind must ultimately bring disrespect for all law.</P>
    <P>I would ask anybody to contrast the case put up by the Executive Council for the operation of this particular Act with the case put up by the old Executive Council in 1931.  The courts here are fully operating.  Nobody can suggest that there would be any interference with witnesses, juries or anybody else, and yet they jump at this Act because they think that by means of it they can down their political opponents.  It is a powerful Act.  It enabled the late Government to bring peace to the citizens when they were <Col N="2587" /> in office in this country.  What has the present Government done?  They have so operated the Act that terrorism is rife in many parts of the country, that crimes are committed, known to the public and known to the authorities. Even the names of the very people who committed them are known and yet nothing is done.  Perhaps nothing can be done because of the terrorism that is allowed to prevail in the country.  In one instance I remember a young fellow was assaulted, beaten up, chloroformed, left on the roadside. It was public property, yet nothing could be done because nobody dared to give evidence.  That system of terrorism, which they condoned when they were in Opposition, they have now allowed to spread throughout the country.  They are taking it for granted, and they are allowing it to be taken for granted, that the supporters of this Party can be beaten up with impunity.  They are allowing crime to go unpunished.  Possibly they say they cannot get evidence.  They cannot get evidence possibly because they have allowed terrorism to become rampant in many districts.  Yet I have no doubt that the Fianna Fáil Party and the Labour Party unanimously support that particular policy.  They, at least, have no qualm.  It does not matter whether terrorism is rife or not.  It does not matter whether witnesses are terrified.</P>
    <P>When men are brought before the courts now&mdash;of course they take good care not to come before them&mdash;the witnesses often go back on their testimony. I heard of the case of one young fellow to whom it was put: &ldquo;If you do not give evidence, you will get two months in jail.&rdquo;  His answer was quite simple: &ldquo;Better two months in jail than a bullet.&rdquo;  That is what is happening in the country.  That is what the Government is really making no effort to deal with.  They could deal with it and deal with it effectively under this Act, but instead they must suppress an organisation of the youth&mdash; their political opponents.  They must object to the Blueshirts and so on. That is what they prefer to do.  They must, having failed in the ordinary <Col N="2588" /> way, try other methods.  I suggest that it would be a gravely immoral act for the House to pass a Vote in support of a policy of this kind.  I want it to be quite clear that when I speak of the breakdown of the administration of law in many parts of the country, and when I speak of the failure of local authorities to bring people to justice for well-known crimes committed in their neighbourhood, I am not criticising these local authorities.  I know that the power has broken in their hands, and that power has been broken&mdash; whether deliberately or not I need not discuss, but in fact it has been broken &mdash;by the deliberate policy of the Government.  To vote for an Estimate of this kind is to throw all sense of justice to the winds.  It is to vote for the most degraded of all things, a grossly partisan administration of justice, and a gross abuse of the great powers that were entrusted into the hands of the Government of this country.  Powers entrusted to save the State are now being used by the members of the Government to down their political opponents, and to bring on this State ruin of the administration of justice, as they have brought ruin to the various other institutions and the flourishing economic life that was handed over to them by their predecessors.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The present situation, to my mind, has in it one element which, I am afraid, has been lost sight of. The people of our country are being demoralised inasmuch as they are being robbed by this Government of all sense of liberty.  One of the most treasured rights of a free people in this country has been the right to a fair trial by 12 of their fellow-countrymen. It has been one of the great protections of the individual against the State down through the ages.  Now, no Minister on those benches and no Deputy in that Party has ever had the hardihood to suggest that any member of our organisation, from the bottom right up to the top, ever challenged the right of the courts of this country to try them.  No member of our organisation ever threatened a witness. No <Col N="2589" /> member of our organisation ever threatened a jury.  No member of our organisation ever murdered a judge, a juryman or a witness.  Nevertheless, this Act is brought into operation, this court is set up, and before it is brought member after member of our organisation for trial.  Why?  I see no valid reason.  I do not question for a single moment that this court is doing its duty according to its best lights, but I say that it is the right of every free citizen in this State to be tried by 12 of his fellow-countrymen on issues of fact. That right is being withheld from us, for no reason whatsoever so far as I can see.  I am prepared to say, on behalf of every member of our organisation, that now and always we are prepared to receive the verdict of 12 Irishmen or women sitting on a jury on any charge that may be brought against us by the Executive.  In considering this Estimate, one has to remember that the certificate of any Minister of the Executive Council is sufficient to authorise this court to try any misdemeanour or offence, bearing in mind the Bill which the Government has introduced and which has been read a Second Time this morning, creating an offence and providing the penalties.

      <P>Is it not for the expenses of this Tribunal you are asking for money?  Is it not the manner in which you are going to spend the money that we are here to discuss?  Having pointed out that nothing which any member of our organisation did, created a situation that would justify the revival of this Act, or the setting up of this court again, because a jury was quite sufficient, I want to suggest that the setting up of this court and all that goes with it is merely a repetition of a trick that is old and familiar to the Irish people.  When you have a constitutional movement well under way, the particular Party or Party Government against which that constitutional movement is directed makes up its mind that it is becoming formidable; they ask themselves this question: &ldquo;We cannot get rid of it on constitutional lines; can we do away with it in some other way?&rdquo;  and every oppressor that ever appeared in this country resorted to the same means. He passed a Coercion Act, and he kept operating that Coercion Act until he incited some unfortunate fellow down the country to perpetrate some overt act, and immediately that happened he passed another Coercion Act and went <Col N="2592" /> a little further and moved heaven and earth to stir up disorder and lawlessness in the country, and having stirred that up himself he then advanced that as a legitimate defence for suppressing the organisation he was afraid of.  I charge this Government with doing that very thing at the present time.  I say that the setting up of this court, and the arraignment before it of members of our organisation, when it was set up, was, on the part of the Government, a deliberate attempt, together with other things that have happened, but which within the rules of order I may not dwell on now, to incite trouble and create a situation which would justify them in the eyes of the world in suppressing constitutional opposition to the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is being done and the people of this country ought to realise it.  We have, I am proud to say, preserved a record absolutely free from any form of outrage, despite all the provocation we have received from the Government's supporters, and, as I said yesterday, I hope to be able to boast of and to point to, when we clear the Fianna Fáil Government out of office, a record of agitation absolutely unsullied by any outrage or by any overt breach of the law.  It is going to be a hard job if the Government is going to do everything it possibly can to incite breaches of the law and to incite outrage, to keep every young fellow in the country who is in our organisation realising all the time what his strict duty is.  Everything that we can possibly do will be done, and I do not despair that we will succeed. There is a spirit in our organisation which in my experience in public life is something new&mdash;a readiness to suffer in order to preserve the institutions of this State and in order to preserve the liberty and decency intact.  We will want all of that spirit that we can muster to come through the next few months and I do honestly believe that we will be able to muster it, but I think it is a terrible responsibility for the Government to take on themselves to go on inciting, to go on persecuting, and to go on hoping in their hearts that there will be an outrage on our side in order to justify <Col N="2593" /> themselves for the oppression they are indulging in at the moment.</P>
    <P>They searched our houses and, I believe, they searched our correspondence and they raided our members, all in an endeavour to find material for prosecution and they found nothing. Then, they set up this Military Tribunal and they cast their net.  They were going to arraign every law breaker before it and what happened? They have arraigned and convicted 80 men, and of those 80 men, 58 are supporters of their own Party and of the 12 supporters of our Party who have been convicted, not one single one of them was even charged with an outrage or with an attack on his neighbour. Some of them have been put in gaol for the technical offence of having belonged to an organisation which was dissolved as soon as it could be dissolved after the proclamation of the Minister declaring it to be illegal. Some of them have been imprisoned for having in their possession a lethal weapon&mdash;admittedly, a lethal weapon &mdash;but no attempt was made to suggest that they had used it except in the case of one man yesterday who was committed to gaol and the only time he used it was in defence of the house of Dr. O'Higgins after Dr. O'Higgins had been murdered on his own threshold. The crime that man was guilty of was this, that in order to protect the widow and family of that murdered man, the father of a Minister of State who was subsequently murdered, he was given a rifle and he kept that rifle&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is his colleague I want. He went down to lend Deputy Kennedy a hand at one of the victory celebrations. That Deputy said that he almost burst into tears when he looked down at the honest Irish plain people.  When he looked down into the faces of the honest people of Longford-Westmeath, looking gloriously up at him in the light of liberty, he almost wept.  He said that it was such a lovely thing that we had a Ministry now to <Col N="2596" /> whom the name of a Military Tribunal or the Public Safety Act was anathema, and that it was a consolation to breathe the air of liberty in the land again.  Well, he must feel some constriction in his chest now and some myopia in his eye, because we have to-day not only the Public Safety Act, but rumblings to which I am not permitted by the rules of order to refer, and of which we have heard plenty this morning.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, now, they will never be much more than rumblings. They will never get beyond that stage to the Government's keen regret.  It is interesting when we recall the promises and the programme of Fianna Fáil&mdash; we heard promises of peace, prosperity and harmony.  We have prosperity&mdash; we all know that.  We are enjoying it.  We are suffering it and we are told that we are to be afforded an opportunity of suffering Fianna Fáil prosperity for a little while longer. Now we come to Fianna Fáil peace and harmony.  Fianna Fáil peace consists of the most reckless and outrageous coercion ever embarked on in this country by the British or otherwise.  Peace!  The astonishing part of it is that the instrument of coercion as wielded by the present Government is such that in order to strike at 12 of our men they have to hew their way through 50 of their own.  If Fianna Fáil had administered impartial justice in such outrageous cases as I have pointed out in the last 12 months, it is not 50 of their own men they would have to hew their way through in order to get at 12 of ours, but, through 1,000 of their own supporters and friends who would be in Arbour Hill at the present moment if impartial justice had been administered.  But is it because they dare not do substantial justice that so very few of those who were committing outrages up and down the country at present, are dealt with?  The Government dare not deal with them and they dare not bring them before the Military Tribunal.  I have a copy of <i>An Phoblacht</i> here.  I <Col N="2597" /> want to read something out of that valuable paper.  It learns: that &ldquo;Mr. de Valera will announce an amnesty for all political prisoners if certain conditions are complied with.  This I can state is the outcome of Mr. Seán Moylan's threat to resign if political treatment was not accorded to the Republican prisoners in Arbour Hill prison.&rdquo;  Now, is it not a wonder that we have this talk about amnesty? It was all part of the good intentions that are proclaimed from the Front Bench of the Fianna Fáil Party!  Is it not a wonder that even-handed justice is not done when <i>An Phoblacht</i> takes heart and courage from the remonstrance of Deputy Seán Moylan? I am sure if the I.R.A. want champions there will be many men there on the Front Benches who will fight for Deputy Seán Moylan in making a remonstrance to the Ogre, the present Minister for Defence, who is trampling on the rights and liberties of the Irish Republican Army to vindicate Irish nationality up and down the country.  &ldquo;They are traitors and they ought to be treated as traitors,&rdquo; says <i>An Phoblacht,</i> and they add&mdash;not with God's help&mdash;but &ldquo;with the help of the masses.  We will treat them as traitors before we are done with them!  The fight against Fascism,&rdquo; says <i>An Phoblacht,</i>&ldquo;cannot be a defensive one.  Fascism can only be battered down if the full weight of the working class and small farmers is hurled against it. The small farmers would overwhelm the ranchers, if they were released to take possession of the ranches. Stripped of his ranch the rancher is disarmed.  Stripped of their banks the bankers are disarmed.  Deprived of their press, the Imperialists would be silenced.  Silenced and disarmed, their threat would be gone, but Fianna Fáil dare not take this road; for here are tasks that could only be carried through in the Working Class Revolution.&rdquo;  Bear in mind the President's assurances to us that there is not a breath of Communism in the whole country, not a breath; it is a fraud, it is a scare, and it does not exist, so the President tells us.  At the same time the Minister for <Col N="2598" /> Defence finds himself in the extraordinary rôle of the Ogre oppressing Deputy Seán Moylan, and at the same time the benevolent Attorney-General tells us that even-handed justice is being handed out, and that every man will get justice, nothing more and nothing less.  Yet we know that all over the country intimidation and threats and violence are rife, and that it is only when the facts of the outrages are notorious to everyone that shame forces the Government to make men amenable. When they do make them amenable, in 50 per cent. of the cases the persons indicted refuse to recognise the court and bid defiance to the institutions of this State.</P>
      <P>There is one last matter to which I wish to refer in this Estimate, and I am particularly glad that the Minister for Defence is here.  Commandant Cronin was arrested on a charge, the futile charge, of belonging to an illegal association, though the Attorney-General knew that the Association in question was perfectly legal in its objects, legal in its activities, and that the law was observed by its members. It was illegal because the Minister proclaimed it under the Public Safety Act. The Attorney-General knew when prosecuting Commandant Cronin for membership of an illegal organisation he had not given him time to withdraw from the Association, if such were his intentions.  Commandant Cronin is duly convicted.  Prior to his conviction Commandant Cronin is in custody in Arbour Hill under the charge of the Minister for Defence.  He is wearing the clothes in which he was arrested. There are no prison regulations, there is no rule of common law, and there is no rule under the criminal law to require him to wear any other clothes but the clothes in which he was arrested.  Yet the Minister for Defence orders three of his men to strip the shirt&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I informed the Deputy how far the matter is gone.  A communication was addressed to the Chief State Solicitor asking would he accept service on behalf of the Minister for Defence in an action by Commandant Cronin.  A discussion took place as to whether in the particular case, in view of the statement accompanying the proceedings, the Chief State Solicitor should or should <Col N="2602" /> not receive service of a summons.  At the moment I am not aware whether the summons has actually been served upon the Minister, but I understand that it has either been issued or is about to be issued.  Certainly I am aware that a letter has been written on behalf of Commandant Cronin indicating that proceedings are about to be taken.  In these circumstances I suggest, and I am sure Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney will agree, that it is quite improper that it should be discussed here.</P>

      <P>Yes, on the question of whether Deputy Dillon should or should not pursue his investigation of Commandant Cronin's treatment in Arbour Hill.  There cannot be an action pending against the Minister for Defence in his capacity as Minister, and I think the Attorney-General will agree that no action for tort can be taken against a Minister of State even with the <i>fiat</i> of the Attorney-General. Therefore, there cannot be an action against the Minister in reference to the subject matter with which Deputy Dillon has been dealing.</P>

      <P>May I finish my point? It is well established that no action of tort can be taken against a Minister of State and, therefore, when a Minister of State is alleged to have done something wrong in the exercise of his Ministerial responsibility, the only tribunal where he can be made amenable for his official acts is this Dáil.  That is the only protection that a citizen of the State has against a Minister who is alleged to have done or who has done wrongful acts.  Therefore, I respectfully suggest to you, Sir, that if it were to be a ruling of the Chair that, in circumstances where the law says there is to be no action of tort against a Minister by reason of the old Crown prerogative, a matter could not be raised on behalf of a citizen that a Minister had done wrong, the citizen would be entirely and absolutely without legal or political remedy.  I respectfully suggest, Sir, that you ought not to make that ruling.</P>

      <P>I think it is only fair to the Leas-Cheann Comhairle that the position should be made clear.  As indicated, an application was made to the Chief State Solicitor, and he was asked if he would accept service of the summons on behalf of <Col N="2604" /> the Minister for Defence in respect of an alleged complaint by Commandant Cronin.  I pointed out the very thing which Deputy Costello had just pointed out, that the Minister could not be sued in tort, and the reply was that the solicitor concerned again applied to the Chief State Solicitor to accept service on behalf of the Minister on the ground that the Minister was being sued in his personal capacity. I directed that service should not be accepted in either way and what has happened since I do not know. Apparently, it was intended that a summons against the Minister, involving the charges which are now being opened by Deputy Dillon, was to be brought in some shape or other.  I suggest to the Chair on a point of order, and even to the Deputy on a point of propriety, that it is not reasonable that matters which may become the subject of an action in the court should be discussed here before they are determined in the court.</P>

      <P>The point is that Deputy Dillon proceeded to refer to a certain incident at Arbour Hill, and levelled a charge against the Minister for Defence, in respect of alleged ill-treatment of Commandant Cronin.  I objected to reference to that being made, by reason of the fact that within my own knowledge Commandant Cronin has indicated that he proposes to bring an action against Mr. Aiken, Minister for Defence, in respect of these charges.  I am informed, and to the best of my knowledge believe, that letters have been written to the Minister asking him to accept service. The matter came before me, and I said that in the circumstances service should not be accepted, because an action does not lie against a Minister in <i>tort.</i>  The reply of the plaintiff's solicitor was that he was bringing an action against the Minister personally. As far as I know, the advisers of Commandant Cronin are about to institute proceedings about the matter which the Deputy is seeking to discuss, and I suggest that that is not in order.</P>

I am perfectly prepared to admit and to assert&mdash;I have asserted on several occasions&mdash; that the officers were acting on my instructions.  I am prepared to discuss the matter now, and if that cannot be done now, then to discuss it some other time.  I am informed by the Minister for Finance that this Supplementary Estimate has to go through by a certain date, so that it cannot be postponed now.  Once the case is decided in the courts a motion can be put down to have this matter discussed, or I am prepared to ask the Government to give time so that we can discuss it here.</P>

      <P>We are not going to discuss it now.  I think I have demonstrated to the House that in every material promise that Fianna Fáil made to this country they have let the country down: that in every material consideration that should have weighed with them when they set up this Act they acted against common sense and every sense of justice&mdash;in bringing before this court men who were quite willing to stand their trial before a jury of 12 of their fellow-countrymen. I have never heard from any of them a defence for their action in setting up this machinery to try members of our organisation.  I have never heard them seriously maintain that one of their own supporters ought to be brought to justice under this machinery.  Mind you, I do not think they do justice if they bring one of their own supporters before the Military Tribunal if that supporter would stand his trial before 12 of his fellow-countrymen without getting Cumann na mBan to write to the jury; and it is only when one of your own supporters refuses to recognise the court or conspires with his or your own friends to intimidate the jury or the judge that, I think, it is right or fair to bring him before the Military Tribunal.  That is a very dangerous situation; so dangerous that I do not care to go into it.  Powers of that kind, in the hands of a Government, could become <Col N="2613" /> a terrible instrument of oppression. The Attorney-General knows that well, and I suggest to him that, as the head of the legal profession in this country, and as someone with some respect for the legal institutions of the country, he ought to think well before depriving law-abiding men and women of the right to trial by jury.  He ought to think well before he takes that right away from his fellow-countrymen when there is no good reason for doing so.</P>
      <P>Every matter that I desire to touch upon has been touched upon now.  It only remains for me to say that the back benchers of Fianna Fáil, who stumped this country with their maudlin hypocrisy about liberty, about freedom, and about their desire to put an end to the horrible coercionist activities of the Cumann na nGaedheal Government, might well blush if they had the capacity to blush.  I think, however, for their own peace of mind and happiness, they lost that capacity long ago.  They would have had strokes of apoplexy if they had not.  I wish them long life and deliverance from apoplexy, and if they had the capacity to blush over what they are doing now apoplexy would claim them in nine cases out of ten.</P>

The Government has been trying for two years to govern with the least possible measure of force.  When we came into office we gave proof of what we said by abolishing the operation of the Constitution (Amendment) Act, and it was only when certain galoots, who went round the country trying to egg on the young men to create disturbance, had succeeded in that object, that we brought in the Constitution (Amendment) Act with the object of restoring peace to the country. If there is one man responsible for the creation of trouble and for the consequent bringing in of that Act <Col N="2614" /> again, it is the platform Deputy James Dillon.</P>

      <P>There was peace in this country; the men who were divided by the civil war were treating each other with respect when Deputy Dillon came along on the political horizon and said, any time any little friction arose, that he was glad, God forgive him, to see them at it.  He went down to a part of the country where passions were pretty bitter during the civil war and where the people had been ground down by the Black and Tans with great violence, and, speaking to the people of that district, he said: &ldquo;We do not want to fight, but, by jingo, if we do.&rdquo; It took Deputy Dillon a long time to make up his mind when to fight, and, upon my soul, although I hate fighting, when such a man as Deputy Dillon comes around shoving out his chest and saying to people like me: &ldquo;We do not want to fight, but, by jingo, if we do,&rdquo; I feel like hitting him a slap across the face.</P>

    <P>Those of us who did a little bit of soldiering are accustomed to judge the relative importance of officers by their distance in miles from the front, but only an Einstein could estimate the importance of Deputy General James Dillon, who was 12 years behind the front.  There was trouble in this country 12 or 14 years ago.  Deputy Dillon was a man of military age on that occasion, and if he had wanted to <Col N="2615" /> fight he could have done so then; but it was only when peace was restored here, when the men who did the fighting and who had fought against each other bitterly were becoming comrades again, that we had people like Deputy Dillon coming across trying to create bitterness and disturbance.  The men who were responsible for bringing in the Constitution (Amendment) Act were people like Deputy Dillon and others such as he.  I hope that, if the Cumann na nGaedheal Party or the United Ireland Party, or whatever they are, can control the elements in their Party like Deputy Dillon this Act will not be necessary and that it can be put on the shelf again.  We do not want that Act down, and we will only keep it down for the shortest time possible.</P>

      <P>We have just listened to a short speech from the Minister for Defence, just the type of speech one would expect from the Minister for Defence; a very characteristic speech from the Minister for Defence, full of bad taste and full of bad manners, very typical, indeed, of the Minister for Defence and of his ordinary utterances in this House.  We are told at certain times that Fianna Fáil loves everybody in this country, that its heart is overflowing with charity, and then we hear a speech of the nature of the speech which has just been delivered to this House.  The Minister for Defence attacked Deputy Dillon because, he said to his supporters that we do not want to fight but if we are attacked we will defend ourselves.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>&ldquo;By jingo, if we are attacked we will defend ourselves.&rdquo; What is wrong with that? Has not every man in this State the right, when attacked, to defend himself? That is a right given to every man by the natural law, and a right conferred on him by the law of the land.  I think that speeches like the speech of Deputy Dillon, to which the Minister for Defence has just made reference, are more calculated to preserve peace than any speech the Minister has ever uttered.  Many instances <Col N="2616" /> were given here the other night by Deputy Hogan which made perfectly clear to everybody in this House, if there was anybody who did not know it already, that there is far and away greater likelihood of meetings being broken, the peace disturbed, and mob law and mob violence getting the upper hand if those present at a meeting will not exercise their common law right to defend themselves.  Many people are willing to attack defenceless men who, they know, will not make even any effort to defend themselves, but a number of those people are not at all so willing to attack men who, they know, will, if attacked, defend themselves.  It is the common law right of every individual to defend himself when attacked.  Let us come down a little further in the Minister's speech.  They hated, we are told, bringing in this Bill.  This Bill was brought in for the purpose of attacking an existing association&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am merely following him now.  I say that their object in putting this Act into operation and setting up this Military Tribunal was in order that they might, acting against the law, attack associations which were in themselves perfectly lawful and perfectly legal.  It has been put into operation against two associations.  Both of these were perfectly lawful, perfectly legal and perfectly legitimate associations.  What is an unlawful association?  A definition is given in the Constitution (Amendment) Act of 1931.  Within no definition clause in that Act did either of these associations come.  When the Executive Council declared an association to be unlawful which everybody else knew to be perfectly lawful, they were prostituting their own consciences and were bringing the law <Col N="2617" /> into contempt.  They cannot make any association unlawful.  It is the aims of an association or the acts done by an association that make an association unlawful.  No aims of the two associations they banned were unlawful and nothing in the methods adopted by them was against the law. All the Executive Council have power to do is, for the purpose of evidence, to declare and make binding on the Military Tribunal the rule they have made.  The Oireachtas gave them that power and it gave them that power because it believed there would always be an Executive which would act fairly and honestly and, given great powers, would use those powers in accordance with the principles of justice.  This Executive Council have taken the very opposite step.</P>
      <P>They are anxious, the Minister for Defence says, not to use this Act.  Why are they using this Act against men who have done nothing which is morally or legally wrong?  They are using it against men who have done nothing illegal.  They are having men put into prison merely for membership of an association that was, in its own nature, when it existed, entirely lawful.  Is not that tyranny?  Is not that the very worst exercise of tyranny?  One of your Parliamentary Secretaries said in a recent debate, &ldquo;You gave us the power and you cannot complain how we use it.  It was your own fault to confer it upon us.&rdquo;  That was the tenor of the Parliamentary Secretary's speech. Surely, if a Government wanted to bring the law into contempt, wanted to bring the whole administration of justice into contempt, it could take no better or surer course than to act in the tyrannical fashion this Government has acted and declare that to be wrong which, in its own nature, is perfectly right, legitimate and lawful. That is the whole object of putting the Military Tribunal into operation again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a time when this measure was urgently needed.  There was a time when several murders, arising out of judicial matters, had taken place.  Jurymen, witnesses and police <Col N="2618" /> officers were murdered.  The administration of the jury system had broken down.  We fought to preserve the jury system as long as it could be preserved. We hung on to the jury system as long as we could hang on to it.  Possibly, we hung on too long to it.  But we hung on as long as we possibly could.  We brought in a Juries' Protection Act, which the present Administration has allowed to lapse, in order that we might keep to the jury system.  We found that the jury system had broken down and we were driven to conclude that it was not fair to the ordinary man in the street to put him into a jury box and give him this terrible alternative, &ldquo;Do not find according to the evidence, find against your oath or, else, put yourself in danger of assassination.&rdquo; That was a risk we were not entitled to ask the ordinary plain citizen to take.  When we found that jurymen were being attacked and shot, we had to abandon the jury system.  We abandoned it very reluctantly.  We then put this particular measure into operation.  We brought back complete and entire peace, and left the country in as peaceful a condition as it was ever in the past.</P>
    <P>Now we have the Military Tribunal set up.  For what reason? To attack two associations.  Has the jury system, so far as these associations are concerned, broken down in any way?  Has a man, or woman, a member of either of these associations that were proclaimed, been brought before the courts and acquitted by a jury against the weight of evidence?  None.  If the Government were acting <i>bona fide</i> they would come here with cases in which that happened, cases in which the League of Youth broke the law and were acquitted.  They should produce cases that were brought before the courts and acquitted against the weight of evidence.  There have been no cases of any overt crime on the part of those people to bring before juries.  Not only has the jury system not broken down in regard to these men and women, but the jury system has simply not been brought into operation against them.  The Government there <Col N="2619" /> are not dealing with an association of criminals but with an association that keeps itself entirely within the law. They are dealing with an association composed of the most law-abiding people in this State and yet because the Government does not like them politically they wish to convert them into dangerous persons if they could, but they will fail.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Defence talked about acts of provocation.  I have seen acts of provocation carried out by orders of this Government.  I have seen the most terrible provocation I ever saw given in this country.  I saw the leader of a great political party, in this State at a public meeting, a man who had done nothing wrong or illegal or against the law&mdash;I saw that leader arrested and pulled off a platform.  In that large crowd there were several thousands of young men, and these men saw their leader arrested in that fashion, pulled off the platform and hustled through the streets into the police barrack.  Could there be a greater incentive to riot than that?  There was an enormous crowd of comparatively young men. There was only a handful of Guards, not more than 25 or 30 altogether. If there had been a riot it would have been a terrible riot, but those who had been responsible for that meeting made an appeal to the young men there.  They said: &ldquo;Your association is a lawful association; you are not to break the law; you are there to keep the law.&rdquo;  And they kept the law, and that which might have been a terrible riot passed away and nothing happened.  I cannot imagine a greater example of self-restraint by any crowd.  I feared myself that that crowd would not show restraint. When I saw the magnificent restraint shown by that crowd the high opinion that I had formed of the League of Youth was intensified.</P>
    <P>I can give another example.  Quite recently I was at a meeting.  It was attacked.  The young men at that meeting began to retaliate.  The police officer appealed to the leader who had received a very violent and cowardly blow and who was in great pain&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the League of Youth has not yet been proclaimed but the Minister for Defence, who spoke a while ago, said that these associations led to disturbance. But the Attorney-General says that that association is not yet proclaimed. At that meeting I saw these young men attacked.  The leader called off his men who had been attacked and these men showed the most wonderful self-restraint.  Instead of banning associations of that kind you should be delighted that there are associations in this country, at the present moment, showing such a magnificent spirit of self-restraint and such a magnificent spirit in the performance of duty and the discipline they maintain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Attorney-General says that there were certain other persons brought before the Military Tribunal and charged.  There have been.  I am perfectly well aware of the fact, but it was not for that purpose of bringing other persons before the court that this Military Tribunal was set up because the proclamation of these associations, which was the first act done under it, followed hard on the bringing of the Act into force.  I would like to know the principle upon which persons are sent before this Military Tribunal and why they are brought occasionally before a District Justice.  I would like to know why, for the mere possession of firearms, a person is brought before the Military Tribunal and why very bad cases of riot come before a District Justice and not before the Military Tribunal. What is the difference?  What is the ruling principle?  What is at the back of the Minister's mind when he makes Orders under this section that certain matters are to come before the Military Tribunal?  I shall give an example; it is rather interesting. There was a man tried the other day and the offence for which he was charged was certified by a Minister. The charge was under Section 10 (2) of the Summary Jurisdiction (Ireland) Act, 1851.  I would just like to read that interesting section to the House  <Col N="2621" /> to show the type of offence that the Minister for Justice thinks is a proper offence to bring before the Military Tribunal.  It runs as follows:</P>
    <P>Any person who shall fly any kite or play at any game or make or use any slide upon ice or snow, on any public road or in any street of a town to the danger of the passengers; or who shall cast or throw any fireworks or discharge any firearms on any public road or within sixty feet of the centre thereof or in any street or passage of a town, or who shall cast, throw or discharge the same or suffer the same to be cast, thrown or discharged from out of his house, shop, dwelling, lodging or habitation or from out of any place thereto belonging into any public road, street or passage shall be liable to a fine not exceeding ten shillings.</P>
    <P>It is that offence, an offence under that section, an offence for which the maximum fine is 10/-, which the Minister for Justice thinks it right and proper should be tried before the Military Tribunal.  But a bad case of rioting&mdash;oh, no!  The District Justice can try that.  Ministers, neither in this debate nor in any other, have made any case for the setting up of this Tribunal at the present time. Certainly by the procedure which they have adopted, they are not making that Military Tribunal an assistance but rather a hindrance to the maintenance of peace and order in the country.  I am not saying one single word against the Military Tribunal itself.  I am not to be taken as in any way suggesting that that Tribunal is not acting in a thoroughly honourable and conscientious fashion but I do say that from the nature of the cases the Minister is bringing before that Tribunal he is not assisting public order.  He knows he could not secure a conviction in these cases before an ordinary tribunal because you cannot muzzle an ordinary tribunal, as far as the evidence is concerned, but you can force the Military Tribunal under the Act, to act against facts by a mere declaration of the Executive Council.  It is because you are conscious that these men have committed <Col N="2622" /> no crimes that you have brought this Military Tribunal into existence again.  For that reason I ask the House not to pass this Estimate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GearoidOSullivan" hpid="Mr. G. O'Sullivan Mr. G. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the House to refuse to pass this Estimate on two or three grounds.  I must say that the House has got very little support and very little help in considering the Estimate from the Ministers responsible to enable them to know how this Vote is to be spent.  In view of the speeches for the last couple of days we are quite clear now as to the policy of individual Ministers and the Government.  We now know they have said that certain legislation, with which I do not propose to deal, is being enacted against one particular Party in this country.  The first reason for which I would ask the House to refuse to pass this Vote is that the money is to be spent on partisan and Party lines.  It has already been stated in public and in the House that a certain Bill is intended to deal with one organisation and one organisation only.  I think it would be a disgrace for the members of this House, even for members on the Front Bench opposite, if they, by their vote, ask the people of this country to pay thousands of pounds so that certain machinery may be set up and used in a partisan and political way.  It is quite possible that I may be challenged on the question of partiality or impartiality but even in the last few weeks in this House many instances have been given to the Ministers responsible and one particular case of partiality comes home particularly to myself.  I did not ask the question.  The Minister for Justice, I think it was, was asked was it a fact that Mr. X was convicted of personation at the last general election and sentenced by the District Justice; that he appealed to the Circuit Judge and that the sentence and conviction were affirmed; that then on a point of law he appealed to the High Court and that the High Court affirmed the conviction on the point of law.  The Minister further was asked if that person served the sentence&mdash;I think it was of three months&mdash;to which he had been <Col N="2623" /> sentenced by these three courts.  The answer was that he did not because through the Minister or the Governor-General, I forget which, this particular person got a King's pardon.  He got a King's pardon because he had voted for the Party which is now in power.</P>

With your permission, Sir, I will say that there are certain things which happened at that Tribunal which should be commented on.  I will say at once, in the presence and hearing of the Attorney-General, that there is one thing which should be commented on, namely, that if there is anything to be said which is derogatory or dirty about a person who was a member of one of those organisations who now wear blue shirts, it will be brought out by counsel responsible to and instructed by the Attorney-General, while in the case of a person belonging to another organisation, an organisation that set out to destroy this State 12 years ago <Col N="2624" /> and has continued to do so, the same Attorney-General will instruct his counsel: &ldquo;I am glad if you bring out the fact that that man has been expelled from the organisation.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>On a point of order. Generally speaking, one is not allowed to discuss the decisions of courts in this House.  The courts are regarded as sacrosanct, and are above this House, and are independent of the Executive Council.  The court we are dealing with now is appointed by the Executive Council, is removable at will by the Executive Council.  The Executive Council, therefore, must surely take responsibility in this House for the actions of that court, and the Executive Council must be criticised, if necessary, for the action of that court.  The Executive Council has power to remove that court, but they cannot do that in relation to the real courts to which the sacrosanctity applies.  Therefore, I maintain that <Col N="2625" /> this is the most proper and appropriate place for criticism, when criticism is necessary, of any action of that court, because the Executive Council is directly and immediately responsible for the action of that court.</P>

      <P>I respectfully agree with the propriety of your ruling, seeing how necessary it was, in view of the intemperate language used by certain Deputies then in opposition and who are now Ministers, when that Bill was being discussed in this House. Perhaps I may leave the court at that. I am on the question of partisanship and partiality and the necessity for this Vote.  Who has made it necessary? Who has stirred up hatred in this country?  Who has made it necessary to reconstitute that court?  Who has fanned, in every possible way, the flames of hatred and bitterness?  Certainly no person who wears a blue shirt or a blue blouse, but rather the persons who now sit on the Front Benches of the Government Party.  It is a pet subject here to talk of unity and good feeling and to forget the civil war; but what about the statements made by the present Minister for Finance?  He once declared that the name of Cosgrave would be spat upon in the pages of Irish history.  It is because of statements like that that this House is asked to vote this money to-day.  At Mallow the same Minister said: &ldquo;Knaves and traitors, stand aside.&rdquo;  We are the knaves and traitors.  Was that incitement or was it not?  Is it not because of statements like that that you have to bring in this Vote to-day?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2627" /> The President says: &ldquo;We cannot make movements popular.&rdquo;  We know the story of St. Thomas á Becket: &ldquo;Who will rid me of this troublesome monk?&rdquo;  The same words, possibly translated into modern English, are being used to-day.  Nobody sitting on the Front Bench&mdash;I will possibly except one, the Attorney-General&mdash;can deny responsibility for the necessity for this Vote by reason of their wild, intemperate language throughout the country.  Why is this proclamation necessary?  Is it because there is disorder in the land?  Who is responsible for the disorder, if there is any?  There are two names that are a greater terror to the members of the Government and their Party than is holy water to the devil, and they are the names of O'Duffy and Cronin.  These men broke the terror initiated by the Party opposite. There is no use in our going behind the facts as to partisanship.  A reputable member of this House, one whose name will go down in history with honour, Deputy Mulcahy, was addressing a meeting in Kilmallock, and associated with him was the former Speaker of this House.  Nobody can say a word against either of them as to their national record or otherwise. What happened?  I am not going to call them blackguards, or hooligans, or all the things they really are&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I will talk about the guns, too&mdash;keep quiet.  What was on their banners?  Was it peace and security, public safety and freedom of speech?  Was it Christian charity or all those other things we now hear about?  Not at all.  Instead they had: &ldquo;Kilmallock stands for de Valera,&rdquo;&ldquo;Seventy-seven executions, and we have their executioners here to-day.&rdquo; I understand Deputy Bennett was one of them also.  He was there.  It was that spirit and the inculcation of that <Col N="2628" /> hate and bitterness which have made it necessary for the Government to run away from their own promises and statements, and which have made it necessary for them to introduce this Vote to-day.  I referred to how the devil hated holy water, and I said I would speak about the guns. The evidence given in the court by the superintendent was that if Ned Cronin did not fire a shot in Kilmallock to terrify your hooligans his life and the lives of the speakers were in danger. It is because Cronin and his associates in the A.C.A., and the National Guard and the Young Ireland Movement and the League of Youth succeeded and beat you from one end of the country to the other, that you come up now asking for £2,800 so that you can beat them, and so that, without regulation or without right or otherwise, you can tear the blue shirts off them, even though those blue shirts are covered up by other clothes.  You need not say this is <i>sub judice</i> or anything else, because I know very well that the Attorney-General knows that the question of regulations&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I know you would not.  The Attorney-General knows that the regulations dealing with prisoners is a matter really for the Minister for Justice and the Minister for Defence, and no such regulation has ever been made.  No regulation has ever been made that I, if I am a prisoner, may not wear this coat or that coat or this tie or that tie.  There is no such regulation, and that is the point which should really be raised on this matter, and not the particular instance or the fact as to whether or not Ned Cronin was assaulted.  It does not arise in this House, and I do not propose to raise it.  I was saying, Sir, that partisanship and partiality in administration form the chief reason why the House should not grant this Vote.  For that particular incident in Kilmallock Cronin has never been forgiven.  He beat the tyranny of the &ldquo;We stand for Dev.&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Up Dev.&rdquo;  That cry is gone and beaten.  It has failed in the country.  What happened the 26 <Col N="2629" /> persons who were summoned for attacking the meeting that day and trying to break it up?  I happened to be in court&mdash;not in their case at all&mdash; and I heard it stated in open court &ldquo;Those summonses have been withdrawn by order of the Attorney-General of the Irish Free State.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I said I am not going to refer to it.  There are sufficient other reasons why this Vote should be refused in the House.  There is no doubt, and it is agreed by the Government Ministers, that the new legislation which is being enacted is intended for one reason.  Neither is there any doubt that the invocation of the powers under the Constitution (Amendment) (No. 17) Act was intended to deal with one set of persons, and one set only.  Neither is there any doubt that the disorder and the blackguardism at public meetings are entirely due to people having one certain political opinion in this country, and it is not the opinion of the persons on this side of the House.  I was speaking at a meeting lately, and some of the heroes of the ranks of Tuscany retired to a distance of about fifty yards and interrupted the meeting. <Col N="2630" /> Their usual litany, of course, is either &ldquo;Up Dev,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Up the Republic.&rdquo;  I happened to be speaking at the time, and I said: &ldquo;Yes, amen to the sweet prayer, &lsquo;Up Dev,&rsquo; because when the people of this country get an opportunity again they will put him so high on the political shelf of this country that he will never get on his feet again to interfere in the economic or national position here.&rdquo;  I was walking down the street and somebody threw a piece of rock at me.  They were a good distance away, and they were doing this from behind the backs of the Civic Guards.  They would not stand out on the road, as I challenged any individual to do.  They were able to shy bricks, and rocks and bottles and stones from behind the shelter of the Civic Guards' uniform.  The particular brick missed me but hit a fellow beside me.  He had his best girl, or very likely his second-best girl, with him. This is an instance of the hate and the bitterness those things cause; she did not cry; she said: &ldquo;For God's sake, Timmy, did you hit him back?&rdquo;  That is the kind of hate that is being fanned by the Front Benches and the Back Benches of this House.  That is the kind of hate that is being taught at every cross-roads throughout the country, and nobody in this House or outside it can say that we have ever uttered one word of bitterness or hate. We have always said: &ldquo;Listen to them if you want to listen to them.  If you do not, go away and do not interrupt their meetings.  Do not interfere with them.&rdquo;  This country should be a free man's country, and nobody has done as much to make it free as the men whom you are trying to ban, and whom you are trying to get £2,800 to put into Arbour Hill&mdash;the men and women in the blue shirts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="The Attorney-General The Attorney-General">
      <NameTxt>The Attorney-General</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to travel over the ground which has been covered by the Opposition speakers on this Vote.  There have, however, been one or two matters referred to with which I am more or less directly concerned.  I should like to deal with them and answer some of the charges which have been made by the speakers from the Opposition Benches.  The one which affects me <Col N="2631" /> most keenly, although in a way it is the most trivial matter, is the charge which the last speaker made against me, that under my instructions counsel appearing at the Military Tribunal have gone out of their way to elicit every discreditable fact with relation to one particular type of prisoner, and carefully avoided doing so with regard to others.  I know Deputy O'Sullivan has withdrawn that suggestion since I flatly contradicted it, and apparently he accepts my denial that I personally have ever given such instructions to any counsel appearing on my behalf, but I was more than sorry to hear the charge made.  I have followed the reports of those cases in the papers, and with one particular exception it certainly never occurred to me that, during all the time those cases had been going on, any counsel appearing on my behalf has ever done anything but present his case in as fair a manner as possible.  In fact, my instructions to the counsel who appeared on my behalf are if anything to be overfair in those cases, having regard to the nature of the Tribunal before which the accused are brought, as well as having regard to the rule which I laid down in all the prosecutions which I undertook, that prisoners must be given the utmost fairness in the way the cases are presented.  I think that if Deputy Belton were here in this House he would admit that there was that fairness in one of the very first cases brought before the Tribunal&mdash; that was the case in which he himself was charged.  At the conclusion of the case, and before the Tribunal considered its verdict, he came across to the counsel who represented me there and said that at any rate he could not say that he had not an absolutely fair trial from us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hesitate to believe that Deputy O'Sullivan has any grounds whatever for making the allegation he has made, beyond, perhaps, one incident in one case.  I repudiate the charge, and I repudiate it on behalf of the counsel who have appeared at that Tribunal.  I chose them very carefully from experienced counsel, and they are counsel on <Col N="2632" /> whom I can rely to conduct a case in the way in which I think it should be conducted.  If you look through the list, you will see there some of the most experienced practitioners to whom I committed the charge of cases. If there has been any particular case in which a complaint of that kind can be substantiated or details of it given to me, I undertake to this House at once that I will have it investigated, and see to it that no such complaint can be made against me.</P>
    <P>I will deal here with Deputy O'Sullivan's other charges, as I have already referred to that charge.  He went back into ancient history about Kilmallock.  Kilmallock has figured in a couple of the speeches in this debate and in a previous debate in this House. I thought it was so far gone past that it might be allowed to be forgotten. It was never raised in this House before, to my knowledge, and there have been at least two debates on my Estimate in this House since the Kilmallock incident, and, so far as I can recollect, not one single Deputy from Limerick, or elsewhere, ever made the suggestion that the case had not been conducted perfectly fairly by me.  To drag it in at this late hour, above everything else, shows the poverty of the material which the Opposition have at their command when they seek to make the charge of partiality that is now being dragged in.  Commandant Cronin was charged in connection with that incident.  I remember vaguely the details of the case now, and the fact that Deputy Mulcahy gave a description of the incidents has had the effect of refreshing my mind.  He made no suggestion as to the manner in which the case had been conducted by me, and it remained for Deputy O'Sullivan to give it as an instance of partiality. In my recollection, the case was to this effect: Apart from the charge of possession of a gun against Commandant Cronin, which was dealt with by the infliction of a penalty of £10, the other charges were concerned with riot, unlawful assembly and the usual charges which arise out of riotous scenes such as occurred on that occasion.  Deputy Bennett comes from that area, and he will probably have <Col N="2633" /> the details more clearly present to his mind than I&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="The Attorney-General The Attorney-General">
      <NameTxt>The Attorney-General</NameTxt>
      <P>I merely say that the Deputy comes from that area, and may have a clearer and better recollection of the incidents than I.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give some of them later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="The Attorney-General The Attorney-General">
      <NameTxt>The Attorney-General</NameTxt>
      <P>The eventual result of the case was that the local Guard officers in charge of the particular area suggested that, in the interests of the peace of the district, and as a long time had been allowed to elapse by the District Justice in dealing with the case&mdash;it was adjourned over a period of months, for which I was in no way responsible&mdash;the summonses should be withdrawn.  I do not remember, as a matter of fact, whether the suggestion was exactly that the summonses should be withdrawn, but whatever the suggestion was, I concerned myself not in the least with that case, except to do what was conveyed to me by the responsible police authorities in charge, and I think, if I recollect rightly, General O'Duffy was then Chief Commissioner of the Guards.  Anything I did in connection with that case, I did on their suggestion. Has there been any trouble in Kilmallock since?  Was it not a wise course to adopt, and why should it now be dragged out here to support this charge of partiality in dealing with such a case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has also been sought to make a case that in the handling of cases before the Tribunal, there has been some show of partiality.  I gave here the other day the figures as to the numbers of people charged before the Tribunal.  I said that the gross figure of people charged and dealt with&mdash;and I meant by that, the people who were sentenced&mdash;was 80.  As a matter of fact, my figures should have been slightly larger, as I omitted from that list the persons who had been charged and acquitted.  The variation in the figures would bring the number of people who might be said to be identified&mdash;I am not saying that they are; <Col N="2634" /> they may be repudiated by the Opposition Party&mdash;with the Opposition Party, to somewhere in the region of 20 or 21, and the total number somewhere in the region of 100. I may, perhaps, be pardoned if I give details of the cases of those who, I suggest, were connected with the Opposition Party who were brought before the Tribunal and the charges on which they were tried. A great deal of capital is being made by Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney and by Deputy Fitzgerald in his paper &mdash;he, apparently, is the man who writes these venomous articles in that paper each week&mdash;with the suggestion that the Opposition Party are suffering the greatest and most tyrannical coercion that was ever heard of in this country, whereas, when you come to analyse it and to examine the situation, you find that, in all, about 20 people belonging to the Opposition or who are associated with the Opposition, have been brought before this Tribunal.  Nine of those were the Waterford farmers who were charged in connection with the &ldquo;No Rates&rdquo; campaign in that area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The alleged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="The Attorney-General The Attorney-General">
      <NameTxt>The Attorney-General</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;or should I say, the alleged &ldquo;No Rates&rdquo; campaign. The rest are men who, with three exceptions, I think, were all charged with possession of guns or the use of guns in the public street, or with some offence connected with the use of firearms.  Charges have been levelled here that there is something happening which is unparalleled in the history of any country, whereas when we come to examine the actual facts of this terrible instrument of coercion which we have brought down and introduced here, we find that, in all, our political opponents have had to suffer the trial of about 20 of their associates or members before this Tribunal.  Yet we hear Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney saying: &ldquo;Why not try them before a jury; why take away their ordinary rights?&rdquo; and Deputy Dillon waxes eloquent on the same topic.  I shall endeavour to suggest some reasons why, in particular cases, trial by jury should not take place. There are the cold facts and when <Col N="2635" /> one comes to look at it, one finds that so much interest have we ourselves shown in the maintenance of order generally all over the country, that we have brought before this Tribunal four times as many people who could be said to be associated with our Party or at least, not to be members of the Opposition.  I do not want to describe them all as supporters of ours, but in the interests of order in the country, we have brought that number before this terrible Tribunal.</P>
      <P>Commandant Cronin was brought before the Tribunal and charged with sedition and membership of an unlawful association.  He was acquitted on the charge of sedition and convicted on the charge of membership of an unlawful association.  For Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney's information, if it is information he wants, the Tribunal is the only forum or court before which a charge of being a member of an unlawful association can be brought and when he suggests that this question of membership of an unlawful association should be investigated in an ordinary court, he has not adverted to the fact that membership of an unlawful association is a particular offence created by the Constitution (Amendment) Act and can only be tried before the Military Tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now what happened to Commandant Cronin?  He was found guilty.  Commandant Cronin was arrested, I think, after the proclamation declaring the Young Ireland Association to be unlawful. That was promulgated on the 8th and he was arrested on the 9th.  A great deal of capital was sought to be made out of the fact that at that time some information had been given in the <i>Irish Press</i> that a period would be allowed to elapse during which persons who wish to sever their connection with this unlawful association would be allowed an opportunity to do so.  A great deal of capital has been made about it here.  The last speaker apparently suggested that there was something heinous about having a man arrested and punished when such a statement appeared, and every speaker on the other side stated that such a course was adopted when the Public <Col N="2636" /> Safety Act was originally put into operation by the members of the Opposition.</P>
    <P>What happened to Commandant Cronin?  Commandant Cronin was convicted of being a member of an unlawful association.  The main part of the trial was occupied with the charge of sedition.  That sedition was brought because of a charge made by him that certain ammunition had been planted by the Gárda in 23 Stephen's Green. The Tribunal found that that charge was not sustainable and they acquitted him of it.  I am not quarrelling with the Tribunal over that.  I am only saying that Deputy Fitzgerald's organ returned to that charge on the following week and made the most outrageous attack upon the new police force, giving that force the most delightful title that they took from Deputy McGilligan.  That organ sought to create a peaceful atmosphere by making allegations that not only was ammunition planted but that those men were trained to go into private houses and commit all sorts of offences and so on.  However, that was the main charge against Commandant Cronin&mdash;he was charged with being a member of an unlawful association. I have a report of the trial here, but I did not have time to read it, but Commandant Cronin during his trial never placed any reliance upon what appeared in the <i>Irish Press.</i>  He claimed he was unfairly treated by being charged with being a member of an unlawful association.  His intention clearly was to bring the Executive Council into odium and contempt and to incite against this Government those people who were followers of the Opposition.  The whole defence consisted in submitting in fact that the association was not an unlawful association. I see that Deputy Fitzgerald nods his head.  He is bursting to go over it all again.  The point was that it could not be questioned before that Tribunal that the association was an unlawful association, and the Tribunal acting in pursuance of their duties, acting fairly and honestly, convicted Commandant Cronin.  Nobody has said the slightest thing against them. They did convict Commandant <Col N="2637" /> Cronin and they imposed a sentence of three months' imprisonment in default of his entering into recognisances. On that very night Commandant Cronin made the defiant challenge that he would not recognise the Tribunal.  We hear a lot about refusing to recognise the court, but the effect of Commandant Cronin's attitude was that he refused to recognise the Tribunal.</P>

      <P>I am saying that Commandant Cronin has gone into Arbour Hill for three months rather than give the recognisances asked for by the court, and though he said nothing about that it appeared to me to mean one thing, and that was that the court had wrongly convicted him.  I made that suggestion.  If there is anything in that that annoys the Deputy I will withdraw that interpretation and all I have said about it. I have not challenged the <i>bona fides</i> of Commandant Cronin in the matter at all.  The unfortunate thing about it is that he appears to be <i>bona fide.</i>  I am not making any suggestion derogatory to him.  These are the facts about Commandant Cronin, anyway: &ldquo;In a statement issued last night (this is from the <i>Irish Times</i> of December 30th) Mr. Cronin indicated that he does not propose to give the recognisances asked for by the Tribunal.  For the past 18 months, he said, he had given his time and energy to seeing that the people were left in the peaceful enjoyment of their constitutional rights, and he would do nothing that would fetter him during the next two years as a <Col N="2639" /> political opponent of the present Government.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>How can you explain the refusal of Commandant Cronin to enter into recognisances to keep the peace and be of good behaviour?  I do not want to cross swords with Deputy McMenamin.  His statements are like machine-gun fire with which I could not keep time.  I am not challenging Commandant Cronin's <i>bona fides.</i>  If I am incorrect in what I say, and if the Deputy says I am incorrect, I am perfectly prepared to withdraw the statement, but that is the only natural interpretation to be placed upon his attitude.  It is a matter of importance that the same action has been followed by two other men from Cork.  These three persons are the only persons who have been charged by me before the Military Tribunal with membership of an unlawful association. Only three persons have been so charged before the Military Tribunal, and yet the welkin has been made to ring for the last eight weeks with denunciations of the Government about partial administration of the law, the infamous use of power and talk of outrages inflicted by the most drastic Coercion Act ever put on the statute book.  Yet with regard to the matter of membership of an unlawful association only three persons have been tried and dealt with by the Military Tribunal.  These three persons have all acted in the same way when they were asked by the Tribunal to enter into recognisances after the charge had been proved.  They were asked to enter into recognisances to keep the peace and be of good behaviour for a period of two years. They elected with, I am sure, the approval of their organisation to make themselves martyrs and go into Arbour Hill prison.  History in this country and other countries conveys to me quite clearly what the meaning of that attitude is.  I commend it, however, to the Opposition to consider whether that is the proper attitude to adopt towards <Col N="2640" /> the orders of the court if, as they profess, they are willing to obey the laws, however oppressive they may be.  That is the extent to which the oppression has gone of that association which they say has been banned illegally.</P>
      <P>Mr. Michael Ryan and Mr. Hubert Johnston were tried before the Tribunal. I do not suppose it will be denied that they are associated with the Blueshirt organisation.  The charge against Ryan was that he entered a house where there was a man sitting at the fire, that he took him out, put a gun behind his ear, fired shots over him and threatened him. He was convicted of that.  Johnston, who was charged with him, was also convicted of being involved in the same offence.  I think one of those men is very closely connected with a very prominent member of the Blueshirt organisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney grew facetious about the case of a man named Harty.  The facts in his case were that Harty went down a street in Borrisoleigh&mdash;at least this is what we alleged against him&mdash;carrying a revolver and discharging shots at random, and that when the Guards followed him he ran away down a lane and they were unable to get hold of the revolver.  He was arrested and charged with the possession of firearms and ammunition and firing shots in the street.  Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney suggested that the only reason he was brought before the Tribunal was on a charge under a section of the Summary Jurisdiction Act.  He was charged in the first place with possession of firearms and ammunition. By a clerical error, for which I need not lay the blame on any particular person, as perhaps it was excusable, the two charges of possession of firearms and possession of ammunition were grouped together in one charge.  As those familiar with the Act know, it is necessary, in order to bring a charge of possession of ammunition before the Tribunal, to have the certificate of a Minister. It is not necessary in a charge of possession of firearms.  Objection was taken by counsel who appeared for Harty that the charge was bad as there was duplication, <Col N="2641" /> because the first charge contained those two charges; that one of them should have been certified and was not certified, and consequently the whole charge failed.  The Tribunal ruled with the prisoner's counsel. Consequently, the only charge which remained in the books against him was this charge of discharging shots in the public street.  Does anybody suggest that it is a trivial offence to discharge shots around the public street in a town in Tipperary?  That is the suggestion apparently made by Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney.  The leopard can change his spots.  If it was one of our party who committed this offence I wonder what punishment should be meted out to him, according to the people opposite. When Harty was convicted under that section the Tribunal took a serious view of the case.  If my recollection serves me right, I think they sentenced him to three months, not to be enforced if he entered into recognisances to keep the peace.</P>
    <P>There were four people brought before the Tribunal early on, but I need not refer to their case in detail, as everybody is familiar with it.  That is the case arising out of the Prussia Street incident when Deputy Belton and Mr. Barton, Mr. Ryan and Mr. Cronin were charged in connection with the trouble on that occasion.  Mr. John F. Kilcoyne was brought before the Tribunal and charged with the possession of a gun.  He was going to a meeting of this organisation&mdash;whatever the name of it was at the time&mdash;in a motor car.  When the motor car was searched by the Guards a gun was discovered. He accepted ownership of the gun, and was charged before the Tribunal and sentenced to three months.  David Bullman of Cork was brought before the Tribunal for possession of firearms without a certificate. Patrick Fehilly of Cork was charged with possession of firearms without a certificate.  Bernard O'Halloran of Tipperary was charged with a similar offence; Francis Donovan, Carrick-on-Suir, was charged with a similar offence; James Fitzgerald, Tipperary, was charged with a similar offence.</P>
    <P>We have heard a lot about the <Col N="2642" /> Frahers.  I should like to refer to the cases of Patrick Kevin Walsh, Seán Walsh, and James Gallagher, of Limerick, who have been just tried by the Tribunal and dealt with severely.  They had been members of the A.C.A., and on the evening they are alleged to have had guns in their possession actually were in the U.I.P. rooms, although, we were told, and it is probably true, that they had behaved so badly that they were put out of the organisation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="The Attorney-General The Attorney-General">
      <NameTxt>The Attorney-General</NameTxt>
      <P>I mentioned that.  Still it is worthy of note.  On the evening in question, when the police got on their tracks they actually happened to come from the U.I.P. rooms.  That is worthy of note, particularly when so much capital is made out of the fact that the gentlemen from Kilmallock were convicted the other day of serious offence.  Then we had yesterday or the day before two cases of possession of rifles by members of the League of Youth.  I do not want to elaborate or draw any more inferences from these facts than they are reasonably capable of bearing, but as to the charge of partiality, of misuse of this Act, and abuse of our powers, there are the cold facts in connection with it: that since the Act came into operation these are the only people I can find upon my list, apart from the nine Waterford farmers that I referred to already, who were brought before this terrible Tribunal.  These have all been people who had arms in their possession, with the exception of one or two I have mentioned, who were charged with membership of the Association. As Deputies will know, there have been other people from different areas connected <Col N="2643" /> with the Association who had ammunition and, in some cases, arms in their possession, and for reasons which appeared good to me I have had them dealt with by the local courts. Of course, we never hear a word of that from the Opposition&mdash;no acceptance of moderation.  I always recall to mind when Deputy Geoghegan was on these Benches, the continuous assaults made upon him, the vile abuse heaped upon him, and the questions and questions asked about him.  When he left office the organ of the Opposition Party came out regretting his departure, and saying that he was not so bad after all. I do not know whether, when I go out, they will say the same about me.  I think it is intolerable to have to stand up time and time again in this House to answer charges of partiality, charges of dealing unfairly with political opponents when, while generalisations are all very well, Deputies could readily get to know the facts. I have to go into these facts.  I do not want to have to say that I brought 60 or 80 members associated with my own Party before the Tribunal.  I hesitate to do it.  I hate to have to get up here and to go into these things at all.  I feel that in my position I should hold an even balance between all parties, that I should respect members of the Opposition Party, and treat them as fairly and as squarely as the members of my own Party.  As Deputies behind me know, it is difficult for me to carry on without criticism from all sides.  In fact, I know that probably the charge will be made that I am partial to the Opposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the charge which Deputy Hogan made against me yesterday, of prostituting the law, the Deputy should hesitate before he makes such a charge in this House.  If he said that outside he could be made amenable&mdash;as he has been made amenable before&mdash;for a libellous statement.  He instanced a case in County Galway.  The incident if I remember rightly happened at a meeting in Kilconnelly.  The Deputy forgot, when he mentioned that incident that I brought the people responsible for the trouble before the <Col N="2644" /> Military Tribunal and that they have been very severely dealt with.  The Deputy mentioned two other incidents in one of which he said shots were fired over a meeting, and the other in which shots were fired at an organiser. I deplore these incidents.  I condemn them.  If I had evidence before me that any persons could be made amenable I would not have the slightest hesitation about bringing them before the Military Tribunal straight away. I have done so in the case in which a man fired shots over a meeting, where he was actually caught.  The Deputy knows well that no matter how intent the police are, they cannot always lay their hands on the people concerned in these cases.  I doubt if any reasonable person believes that the police could lay their hands on people who fire with rifles, even at meetings addressed by Deputy Hogan.</P>
    <P>I have a list of the cases that were before the Military Tribunal and it makes sad reading.  I am very sorry to have to admit that a number of people who have been before the Military Tribunal are supporters&mdash;or imagine they are supporters&mdash;of our Party.  They have been before the Tribunal for offences which I deplore and deprecate.  I realise, whatever may be said for the reasons for bringing this Act into force that very often, in order to deal with conditions in certain districts, it is necessary, as Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney said&mdash;and I agree with every word the Deputy said&mdash;because there are cases which it is quite impossible to expect a jury to deal with, inasmuch as there will be either intimidation of witnesses or intimidation of jurors.  I am quite prepared to admit that that has been happening.  The charge made here day after day is that we acted in some sinister way.  There is not the slightest basis for that.  If there is the slightest hint, in any case that comes into my hands, that they are cases to bring before the Military Tribunal I eventually decide to bring them, when it becomes clear that they cannot be fairly tried anywhere else.  I am sorry to see such a condition of affairs prevailing, particularly in certain areas.</P>
    <P>I may also say that people are beginning <Col N="2645" /> to realise that, even our own supporters often have a great deal to put up with&mdash;I am not going to condemn our supporters in quite the way that some members of the Opposition do.  The President dealt with that side of the question, so I need not go into it.  I have not in the slightest degree slackened the law against any of our supporters.  I think if a balance had to be struck it would be found that I was more severe with our own supporters than the supporters of the Opposition.  I am determined, if evidence comes before me of interruption of public meetings, or of violence at public meetings, or any attempt to interfere with free speech, that it must cease.  We have laid it down, no matter how objectionable people may be, and no matter how strongly they may differ with each other, that, as far as the law will allow, it will prevent interference with the right of free speech.  I give an undertaking to the House that in any case in which the evidence tells of such interference, or tells of violence or of the handling or production of guns, I will take action, no matter what section is concerned. It is most unreasonable for Deputy Hogan to get up and to level a charge that I prostituted the law. The case he referred to was never before me, as far as I can recollect, in connection with any incident of interference at his meetings, save the one exception at Kilconnelly, where a man's house was attacked, because it was alleged he went to Deputy Hogan's meeting.  But the gentlemen who were responsible for that are at present in Arbour Hill.  I am endeavouring to act fairly and reasonably and, in so far as in me lies, I am endeavouring to act with moderation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzgerald talked of sedition and complained about my objection to certain paragraphs in his newspaper. A quotation was read by Deputy Cosgrave from a speech which I delivered at Mullingar in 1933, in which I said it was felt that it was better free speech should be allowed.  In regard to what appears to me to be sedition, I think if there is a charge to be levelled against me it is that I have been far too tolerant.  I have paid <Col N="2646" /> attention to the development to be seen of seditious libel.  I have felt that I should strain the law, as far as I could, to allow comment on the actions of the Government, and even though interpreting the law strictly, frequently whole pages of the organ of the United Ireland Party, and I may also say of <i>An Phoblacht,</i> could be said to be seditious, and I have little doubt that if an application were made to the Military Tribunal they would be suppressed. I have held my hand.  I think in only one case was the organ of the Opposition before the Tribunal, and <i>An Phoblacht</i> on two or three occasions.  Rightly or wrongly, it is better to let people say wild things, as long as they do not do wild things. In that regard, I have a confession to make, that I may have been too lenient, with the result that when wild words are spoken wild things are done, and that I may possibly have to reproach myself there.</P>
    <P>In regard to the administration of this Act, I do not see that we are concerned with the grounds on which it was brought in, and I do not see that I am bound to defend the proclamation or to enter into the objects of any of these associations.  Ample grounds were given.  All I am concerned with is the administration of the Act.  On the facts being examined calmly by independent persons they will see that this weapon has not been used as an instrument of tyranny or coercion, that it has only been used in circumstances where no other instrument was available to carry out its object and to preserve public order.  As regards the charge of partiality, if there has been any partiality at all, it has been towards opponents of the Government, not against them.</P>

      <P>The Attorney-General can be congratulated on one thing: that in his speeches he avoids personalities. While he was speaking I was impressed by his anxiety to be polite to all.  We are asked to vote a sum of money for the Military Tribunal.  I wonder has it been a success?  When the original Act setting it up was introduced I was not a member of the House, but I listened in the gallery to the discussion <Col N="2647" /> that took place on it.  I remember stating at the time at a meeting of Athy Urban Council that it would yet require the best elements in Fianna Fáil and Cumann na nGaedheal to take the place of that Tribunal.  I do not claim to be a prophet, but listening to the debate we had here last night, I felt that we were getting close to that position.  Since the original setting up of the Military Tribunal, and since the present Government took over office from their predecessors, there have been two distinct conditions in the country.  I will leave one of them alone.  What I wish to refer to is this: that since the Military Tribunal was re-established I have spoken to members and supporters of that Party outside this House, my feeling being that the presence of the Military Tribunal has by degrees contributed to the state of affairs we find in the country to-day, and has caused the introduction of the Bill discussed here during the last three days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I put this to the Minister for Defence.  He is a soldier.  I remember when there was a courtmartial&mdash;a body somewhat similar to that of the Military Tribunal&mdash;of Australians in Rouen. There were four or five Australians courtmartialled.  I, being a young officer, had, as the saying is, the first guess on facts.  A decision was given, and I remember that after that several more courtsmartial were held.  By degress we had 3,700 Australian mutineers at the base.  As regards the Military Tribunal, the fact of cases coming before it leads to such a state of affairs in the country that the very thought of the Tribunal creates an atmosphere against authority and against the law. In the minds of the general body of the people of the country the Tribunal has failed, and it is going to fail more and more.  We are all agreed, of course, that the officers who constitute the Tribunal deal fairly and impartially with all who come before them.  It is the existence of the Tribunal that I am dealing with.  I believe that the Bill we have been discussing for the last two days is consequent, to a large extent, on the existence of this <Col N="2648" /> Tribunal, and that by using the Tribunal we will never bring about peace.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney asked the Attorney-General how he arrives at a decision with regard to the different cases sent before the Tribunal.  As a layman I found it difficult to follow the Attorney-General as to the line or method he adopts, but I urge on him that when prisoners are to be brought before the Tribunal they should not be kept in custody for a longer period than is absolutely necessary.  I think it is a terrible thing to keep uncharged prisoners in custody for a long period.  I have had the greatest difficulty with supporters of my Party in my own county in connection with that.  They are principally young fellows who have recently left school. They were in organisations which have been banned, and I may say that I have the greatest difficulty in controlling them because of the practice of keeping untried prisoners in custody for a long period.  In all sincerity I appeal to the Attorney-General to see that that is remedied.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="The Attorney-General The Attorney-General">
      <NameTxt>The Attorney-General</NameTxt>
      <P>The cause of the delay that Deputy Minch and others have complained about is due to this: that under the practice laid down by the Military Tribunal a prisoner must receive seven days before the date of his trial, with the charge made against him, a summary of the evidence to be given against him. There is no preliminary machinery, such as you have in the District Court for the taking of depositions.  The result is that in any sort of a difficult case where there is a big body of evidence to be presented and you have to give the prisoner a full summary of the evidence, care has to be taken in preparing the summary of evidence for service on the prisoner. That is the cause of the delay.  Sometimes, if prisoners are willing, the period of the seven days is reduced by agreement.  In such cases we can deal with them more rapidly.  As well as I remember there was only the one case, that of the Waterford farmers, in which considerable delay had to be complained of.  As well as <Col N="2649" /> I recollect there was a delay of three weeks in that case.  I agree with the Deputy absolutely, and will see that, so far as it is possible, the delay is not greater than can be helped.</P>

      <P>The Attorney-General seemed to have a grievance against Commandant Cronin for acting as he did.  The Attorney-General practically suggested that Commandant Cronin's action was equivalent to the action of those people who refuse to recognise the courts in this country. Now, what happened?  The courts tried Commandant Cronin.  As the Attorney-General said, there was, first of all, a charge of sedition in that he had stated that certain ammunition, that was stated to have been found in a certain building, had been planted there by the police.  The court found that, far from that being seditious, it was clearly a right and proper thing for him to have said in the circumstances. On the question of membership of an unlawful association the court brought in a finding that he should serve a certain term of imprisonment or enter into recognisances.  What was the order of the court?  It was that he should do one of two things, and he chose to do one of the two things that the court ordered him to do, although it involved great hardship on him.  The Attorney-General now turns round, with a peculiar lack of comprehension, and says that because Commandant <Col N="2650" /> Cronin chose to do one of the two things which he was ordered to do by the court, he is an enemy of the State and refuses to recognise the authority of the State.  That was a complete misrepresentation of what he did.  If the Attorney-General says to me: &ldquo;With proper authority I order you to do this or that,&rdquo; and if I, in accordance with his order, choose to do either this or that, how can the Attorney-General turn round and say that I am defying that authority?  It is evidence of a complete failure to show any commonsense on the part of the Attorney-General. Why did Commandant Cronin refuse to do that, and what would I do in his place?  Although the Attorney-General may not believe me, I have an almost fanatical love of order and of authority, but if that position were put to me, I should say that for a man to enter into recognisances in these circumstances would mean really that, if at a later stage than the two years, or whatever the period was for, he were brought before that Tribunal charged with the charge on which Commandant Cronin was found guilty, he would really stand as though he were a man without honour, who having given an undertaking, had failed to keep it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position was that he was asked to give an undertaking which it might not be possible for him to keep.  He was found guilty of membership of an unlawful association.  The day before he was arrested he belonged to a lawful association, and one which every rightminded person in this country saw was necessary and for the public good.  By an arbitrary act in the Executive Council chamber, the Executive Council in defiance of truth and justice made a statement that, in their opinion, that association was unlawful; that is, that it fulfilled in its methods and constitution certain things which it in no way fulfilled.  Within a few hours of that action of the Executive Council, and, I think, before it was published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> Commandant Cronin was arrested.  He did not say he belonged to the association.  He had belonged to it, but before he could in any way adapt himself to the new situation created by this outrageous action of the Government, he was brought up <Col N="2651" /> and produced before the court, the Executive Council making an order which the court was bound to accept as full and conclusive evidence.</P>
    <P>Commandant Cronin, for all I know, may be a member of the St. Vincent de Paul Society.  It was clear to everybody that the Government was out to get after Commandant Cronin.  I am not saying that the Attorney-General was out to get after him&mdash;I am speaking of the Government, his masters. Commandant Cronin may belong to a dozen associations, for all I know, and he was asked to give an undertaking that, at no time, would he be caught as a member of a certain association.</P>

      <P>I am not challenging the order of the Tribunal.  I am challenging the Executive Council.  The Executive Council put the court in the position that it had only to determine whether the Executive Council had made an order or not.

What I am saying is that at any moment when the Government again want to exercise their venom against Commandant Cronin, he, without in any way intending to break any law, however arbitrary, can be brought before that court, and that court may be bound to declare him guilty.  If that is the position how can he go before a judge and enter into recognisances which means that he is not going to be in the position of breaking the law although he can be put in the position of breaking the law, irrespective of any will, intention or action on his own part, and that he may, by the arbitrary action of the Government, be put in the position of being a lawbreaker.</P>

      <P>Might I ask the Deputy a question?  The obligation which Commandant Cronin was asked to undertake by the Military Tribunal was that he should promise to keep the peace and be of good behaviour.  Is it not the Deputy's argument that he always has done that?  If, now, he has to undertake to do it for a period of two years, how is it suggested that any wrongful order of the Tribunal will in any way affect his conscience as to carrying out that obligation?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Attorney-General</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should not wriggle.  I asked the Deputy a question on his argument. I say that Commandant Cronin is guilty of an offence&mdash;do not get away from that at all&mdash;and that he should obey the order of the court; but, <Col N="2653" /> according to the Deputy's argument, he has not been guilty of any offence. What Commandant Cronin is asked to do is to promise not to commit any offence in future and to be of good behaviour.  Is there anything inconsistent in asking him to do that, or is there any reason why he should deliberately choose to go to jail rather than make that simple promise?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The very fact that the court decided that he must do one of those two things was an assertion that he had committed an offence.  It was an assertion that he had not been of good behaviour or kept the peace in the eyes of the court.  If he enters into recognisances in the circumstances I have outlined he might be put in the position of not being able to keep his undertaking.  Persons who are jealous of their good name or honour might very easily think&mdash;I myself would very easily think&mdash;that they were not going to put themselves in the position of having some other person say of them that they gave their undertaking and had failed to keep it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="The Attorney-General The Attorney-General">
      <NameTxt>The Attorney-General</NameTxt>
      <P>On your thesis, he would not have broken it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>On my thesis, certainly. If Commandant Cronin gave an undertaking regarding something which he had in mind and if the other person concerned, on his interpretation, said he had acted contrary to what he expected him to do, he could claim he was guilty of bad faith.  If Commandant Cronin was brought before the court later and said, &ldquo;I am satisfied that I have been of good behaviour and have not broken the peace,&rdquo; the court could turn to him and say, &ldquo;you are exactly in the same position as you were when before us previously.  You know that to be in that position in our eyes means either that you have been guilty of a breach of the peace or of bad behaviour.  You gave an undertaking that you would not break the peace or be of bad behaviour. You come before us in exactly the same position as before and you have broken your word.&rdquo;  Commandant Cronin, as I know him, is a <Col N="2654" /> man with infinite concern for his own good name and his own honour, which is built upon very solid foundations.</P>
      <P>Some people are very sensitive about affording any opportunity whatever to challenge their truth or honour.  He was in a position in which he could put it in the power of people to say that he had, in order to avoid imprisonment, gone before a district justice and given an undertaking, and later had been brought before the court and sentenced by the court for breaking that undertaking. That was the choice he was given.  He knew the position he was in.  The Attorney-General may belong to some organisation to-day.  If he happens to quarrel with the Government, they can proclaim that organisation to-night.  The moment they have done that, though the Attorney-General may be in bed when it is done, he is an outlaw; he is breaking the law, and he can be brought before the Tribunal. The Tribunal is bound to find him guilty and impose some sentence on him.  That is the position in which Commandant Cronin was.  Commandant Cronin preferred, as I should have preferred if I had been in his position, to do three months in jail to putting it into the mouths of the Front Bench opposite or allowing the mobs outside to say that rather than face up to punishment of three months he went crawling before a judge and gave an undertaking which he had broken.  I should have done the same, and, probably, the Attorney-General would have done the same.  Commandant Cronin is now in jail, having been placed in the position I have described not by his own action but by the action of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Attorney-General talks about our making the welkin ring with our complaints about abuse of power when only three men are in jail charged with membership of an unlawful organisation. I think it was Goethe who said that he would rather have formal order created through injustice than lack of complete order and the reign of justice.  That seems to be the Attorney-General's view.  It seems to me to be an outrageous attitude.  One man is doing three months for being in a position in which no action of his <Col N="2655" /> mind contained any guilt whatsover. I do not remember the details of the other two cases.  The Attorney-General says there are only three men in jail on this charge.  But the institution of this Court has been not in the interests of justice but in the interests of injustice. The Attorney-General has pointed out that the majority of these men, presumably associated with our movement, have been in on charges of ownership of guns and things of that kind.  I am not going to challenge the Government for applying the law with regard to guns in this country.  In some countries the ordinary law provides for everybody having a gun. That is right and just, but it would be unjust if that Government turned round and said that everybody, save some they did not like, should have guns.  Then there would be injustice. In this country certain people have been charged with the ownership of guns.  The Attorney-General referred yesterday to a case in which a haystack was raided and a rifle found. But the President of the Executive Council got up in this House and said, in my hearing, that, as far as members of the I.R.A. were concerned, he had no intention of going out to seek for guns.  The Attorney-General says there is no ground for complaint because they have raided for guns and sentenced men.  The members of the. Front Bench opposite were themselves parties to dumping guns that are now owned by the illegal organisations which are trying to promote crime. They are to be exempt.  In one country it might be unjust for a Government to prohibit ownership of arms, and in another country it might be quite right to do so.  But in any country it is wrong for the Government to make a law whose penal sanctions are applied only to one section of the community and are not applied to another.  The Government's action in the whole business of this Tribunal has been an outrage on justice.  I, personally, resent strongly that that Tribunal, composed of splendid men, should, through no will of their own, be actually made an instrument of tyranny in this country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2656" /> Personally, I should not have any natural desire to have guns all around me, but I do say that it is an injustice and a crime on the part of the Government to say that certain people, whose whole record during ten years has shown that they hold guns for the purpose of terrorising their neighbours, for the purpose of breaking the law and for the purpose of being able to outrage the rights of their neighbours, may own guns.  If they did not hold guns, there would be no necessity for other people to hold them.  To say that they, who have shown that they intend to use them against their neighbours, can have guns and that other people are not to be allowed to have guns to protect themselves from the attacks of those people is arrogant injustice.  The Minister for Justice, yesterday or the day before, when questioned about the firing of volleys over a grave in Mayo or somewhere, said it was quite all right, that the men who had rifles had permits, and that they had also permits to fire over the grave of this man, presumably because he had been associated with a movement to overthrow this State.  ExMinisters have been refused licences for guns.  Is that because they are thought to be likely to use them against the common weal?  But men in Mayo have licences for rifles, and have licences to shoot over the grave of some man, presumably&mdash;I am not certain why&mdash;because he was associated with a certain movement directed against the people of this country.</P>

      <P>I do not remember much about him in the 1922 period but I presume it was his part in the 1922 period which made it necessary to have these permits.  These people were, presumably, members of the I.R.A.&mdash; an unlawful association, by definition. The I.R.A. is an unlawful association according to the law of this country <Col N="2657" /> yet there have only been three men brought up and charged with unlawful assembly under the new jurisdiction. The Government proclaimed the National Guard but before they were able to put their machinery in motion against the National Guard, it was dissolved and abolished and in its place the Young Ireland Association was formed.  The Government then came along and declared that the Young Ireland Association was an unlawful body and that membership of it would carry all the penalties that membership of the other association would have carried.  The Government did that, and we, being desirous of obeying the law even though it was an unjust law put in operation against peaceable citizens, again readily abolished the Young Ireland Association. But though only a short time elapsed between the Government order and our obedience to that order, they managed to act quickly and, one way or another, and through a certain amount of sharp practice, they managed to get three men punished for being members of this organisation. These men were not guilty of any offence.  The association was a perfectly lawful association although banned by the Government, and, as I have stated, when it was banned it was abolished at the earliest possible moment.  But there were other associations of which no notice whatever was taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we introduced Constitution (Amendment) (No. 17) Act, in 1931, we took to ourselves great powers.  I am not necessarily against coercion.  But any Government that takes great powers to be used against the rights of the people must have very complete justification for doing so.  We proclaimed that a certain number of organisations in our opinion, as we were bound to do, violated the conditions laid down in Section 19 of that Act, and were against the law. Was there anybody in this country who could question whether that order made by us was in accordance with truth?  No one could question the fact that the organisations specifically named by us fulfilled the definition that makes an association an unlawful <Col N="2658" /> association.  The matter was beyond question.  The Bill that we introduced in these circumstances was preeminently a good Bill.  It was necessary. Young people in this country, with the trappings and high-sounding phrases of patriotism, the Republic, and the rest of it, were being induced into an organisation whose methods were the methods of crime, and, young people by being connected with these associations could only embark upon a course of crime.  That Bill was introduced in the ordinary course as the only effective way of dealing with these organisations.</P>
    <P>The Attorney-General referred to Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney speaking about the Harty case, but Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney's point was that that man could have very well been brought before an ordinary court and that there was no need for the Military Tribunal to deal with him.  Why did we create a military court? Because the ordinary courts were not adequate.  Because a criminal organisation decided by murder, and by threats of murder, to create a position in which they gave orders in the name of the sacrosanct Republic that men must call upon God to bear witness to a lie, or else they must face death.  A juryman sworn to give a verdict according to the evidence placed before him and calling upon the Eternal Truth to help him to find a verdict must commit perjury under the orders of this association, and find a verdict contrary to the evidence. The result was that there was a position created in this country that jurymen had to choose whether they would commit perjury, and call upon God to bear witness to their lies, or else come out and face the assassin's bullet. Many people have not that courage. It is most unfair to ask ordinary citizens to take the course that may mean assassination for them.  We had to find another course and that is why the Military Court was created. So far as that association is concerned its aim was to try to get jurymen to commit perjury.  The Attorney-General says that only three men of the Blueshirts had been in prison for <Col N="2659" /> membership of an unlawful association. May I ask how many members of the I.R.A. and of the Cumann na mBan have been brought up and prosecuted as members of an unlawful association?  It was only a matter of a few days between the time the National Guard and the Young Ireland Association were proclaimed and the abolition of these associations. The moment the Government made an order, the United Ireland Party came to an agreement to dissolve both organisations, and the time between the proclaiming of them by the Government and the abolition of them was the only period that anyone belonging to them could be said to belong to an unlawful association; whereas during the whole period of this Government's life the I.R.A., their members and their organisation have had absolute freedom, and they own their arms to the knowledge of the Government.  During the whole period that the Constitution (Amendment) No. 17 Act has been in force by this Government not one man or woman has been charged with membership of the I.R.A. or the Cumann na mBan.  A short time ago a member of the I.R.A. was being tried before an ordinary court on a certain charge.  Members of the jury received a document from the headquarters of the Cumann na mBan, with an address in Dawson Street, warning these jurymen that it was an act of treason to the Republic, with the arms of the I.R.A. behind it, if they acted according to the evidence, as they were obliged to do by their oath. The President was well aware of that and he spoke of it at a public meeting afterwards.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons we had when we were in office for making these organisations unlawful was that they tried to tamper with justice by intimidating ordinary jurymen.  These organisations were endeavouring to demoralise jurymen and destroy the jury system.  The document that I have mentioned had the address of its organisation at the head of it.  The heads of these organisations are known to members of the Government and are their personal <Col N="2660" /> friends.  The Government know the people who were trying to corrupt justice in that way.  They know that in that way, as by all their other methods, both the associations I have mentioned are by definition unlawful associations and that membership of them is liable to penalties in this country.  Yet no one has been brought up and charged with membership of the I.R.A. or the Cumann na mBan.  No action was taken to punish people who attempted to seduce jurymen from doing their duty and to perjure themselves.  But because Commandant Cronin was in a blue shirt a day or two after the Young Ireland Association was proclaimed, he was hauled before the Military Tribunal and sentenced to three months' imprisonment.  We have had two and three-quarter hours of passionate indignation from the President, protesting that there was nothing but the purest methods inspiring their administration.  Yet, we have in this country, at this moment, a position in which crime is fostered by the Government.</P>
    <P>You can belong to the I.R.A. tomorrow. You can organise such acts as the beating to death of young O'Reilly, be a member of the organisation and be responsible for the running of an organisation that does that sort of thing but nothing will happen to you. But if you should belong to an organisation that aims at preserving for the people of this country their ordinary rights, that aims at keeping the reign of law in this country&mdash;not under the method the Government proposes to promote the reign of law, through the operation of injustice but through order based upon justice&mdash;if you belong to one of these organisations, the Government can make an order in the middle of the night in the room of the Executive Council or in President de Valera's room and you are breaking the law before you get up in the morning. That was the position of Commandant Cronin.  When you do that you can be sentenced by the Military Tribunal.  That does not apply against the really unlawful associations.  That being so, what is the point of the appalling hypocrisy we have displayed from the Government Benches when they <Col N="2661" /> are so indignant at the suggestion that there is partial government in this country?  The Attorney-General, yesterday I think it was, got up blandly&mdash; and that is one of the reasons why people suffer injustice in this country &mdash;when somebody was speaking on this side and he said: &ldquo;How do you justify the actions of the farmers in Waterford this morning or yesterday who were organised by your Party unlawfully to prevent the auction there?&rdquo;  I heard what he said but certain other members on this side did not quite hear him and they asked him to repeat this statement. When he repeated it he did not repeat the business about their being organised by this Party.  He got up in this House to accuse our Party of organising opposition to an auction in Waterford and he had no evidence to support his statement&mdash;not the slightest.  In the usual way when they see anything happening which is inconvenient for them, they automatically decide that we are responsible for it and that we should be punished for it.</P>
    <P>I object strongly to the voting of this sum of money, not because I object to the Military Tribunal as some coercive measure, not because I object to anybody being charged before it when they go shooting along the streets or along the roads, or when they go out to terrify people in their houses.  I have no objection to that.  It is my duty as a citizen to assist the Government in putting down such unlawful practices, and the obvious way of putting them down is to apply penal sanctions and to see that the guilty parties are brought to justice.  But what is the position? We had a man charged the other day with the possession of a rifle, a man who possibly, or even probably, might be in a position of danger from the illegal followers of the Government because, as I read the case in the papers, one of the men had been given a rifle in 1923, after Dr. O'Higgins had been murdered.  He was given a rifle because he lived near by, and there was reason to anticipate that the murderers might come back to play the same game with him.  I think they actually did return, but the mere fact that he was connected with the murdered man is mentioned against <Col N="2662" /> him, so that he may be known to the friends of the Government as a traitor and may, therefore, meet a traitor's fate.  The people who think that they have a right to mete out a traitor's fate to people who differ with them politically, belong to the organisation which the President says he has no intention of disarming, but if other people have arms under those circumstances, if they are found with arms, they are going to be punished.</P>
    <P>This military court is being used, not by its own action, but is being used by the action of the Government, only to punish one side.  The Attorney-General says there is impartial administration, because there are so many followers of theirs in jail, and only so many of ours, but everybody knows perfectly well how action against our followers is pushed to the furthest point on a pure technicality, how, having declared the Young Ireland Party on the 8th December an illegal organisation, they arrest Commandant Cronin on the 9th and throw him into jail, on a charge of breaking the law. The Government does that with regard to our Party, but nothing at all with regard to the other Party.  The Government can use and is using that court for the purpose of putting into jail people they do not like, who have been guilty of no crime whatsoever, and who have been rendered liable to arrest merely by virtue of an action of the Government.  Nobody could say that Commandant Cronin was guilty of an offence against the moral or the civil law of this country by being a member of the Young Ireland Party, up to a certain hour on the 8th of December, at all events.  It is clear that it was not possible for him formally to indicate that he had ceased to be a member up to the time he was arrested.</P>
    <P>The Government is using this Act against people in whose minds, or in whose actions, there cannot be any guilt whatsoever.  It uses it against people for the ownership of guns and other things, but will not use it against members of its own Party in the same way.  I, myself, at various meetings, could really have pointed out 60 specific people who were guilty of offences of interfering and molesting people associated <Col N="2663" /> with our meetings, but in the whole country they have only got 50 odd of these people in jail.  You had two men murdered recently.  You had young O'Reilly and young Daly murdered, and a constant series of outrages. It is a regular thing in every day's newspaper to see reports of several cases of outrage for months past, yet only when they could no longer avoid it, were any men brought to justice on that side.  On our side Commandant Cronin has been imprisoned for three months against every conception of justice.  Even if the Government were right in banning the Blueshirts, they must still admit that they are imposing on Commandant Cronin a sentence which is an outrage against all justice.  They come along now to tax the Irish people for a further sum in order to enable them to carry out similar injustices.</P>
    <P>I know that the Government, time and again when they talk about majority rule, think that the term &ldquo;majority rule&rdquo; means that the Government of this country can do what they like without any regard to justice.  They think that the minority have no right to justice whatever.  The President indicated that point of view last night when he suggested that Lord Muskerry, having made a certain statement as to the position in this country, merely because he was Lord Muskerry and was not an Aiken, a Ruttledge or a de Valera, or one of the latter-day patriots, had no right to express an opinion in this country. The President talked a lot about how scandalous it was to use religion for politics.  The President did not mention that he had taxed the people of Ireland in order to send a broadcast message into America to suggest that his Party was the Party that was maintaining religion and that we, somehow or other, merely by not supporting him were the enemies of the Government in that.  Lord Muskerry is possibly one of the old landowners, possibly a Protestant.  Possibly his father may have been a Unionist, but are we to understand from President de Valera that, therefore, he has no right to express an opinion on conditions in this country?  It is an outrage, I <Col N="2664" /> suggest, to say that nobody, except people who, like themselves, repudiated the Executive and the Dáil in 1922, has a right to organise or to express an opinion in this country.  The whole administration of what is called the Public Safety Act, the Seventeenth Amendment to the Constitution, has been operated against justice in this country.</P>
    <P>One does not expect a very strong sense of fair play from the Government and one could scarcely expect, knowing how extraordinarily hypocritical the Leader of the Government is, how, whenever he is going to do a dirty thing, he always makes a most high-sounding speech, as we noticed last night and again this morning, that the Government would go out of its way in this matter to act justly or fairly. The President's little point of view, so far as Ireland is concerned, is this: you can do what you like as long as you say the right thing.  That is his reading of the Irish situation.  He says the right thing, but he intends to do as he likes, and he always likes to do anything that is tyrannical and that is an outrage against justice.  We are asked to vote here in order to enable the Minister for Defence to carry on this outrage against justice.  I would like to hear any member of the Fianna Fáil Party, the Attorney-General or anyone else, undertaking to show to the House that the sentence passed upon Commandant Cronin was a just one.  I would like to hear any one of them trying to suggest that the punishment Commandant Cronin is undergoing is otherwise than an outrage against justice and an outrage that cries out to the people to be remedied.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">

      <P>Deputy Fitzgerald has made one of his usual speeches.  He tries to make out that we have, in some way, victimised ex-Commandant Cronin because he is in Arbour Hill. Ex-Commandant Cronin is in jail because he would not give an undertaking to keep the peace and be of good behaviour.  If he gave that undertaking he would now be a free man. He is in jail of his own volition, simply because he was not willing to keep the peace and be of good behaviour for two years.  That is a nice example <Col N="2665" /> coming from the General Secretary of an organisation to the rest of its members and it is a nice thing to see the action of that man being approved by people who are supposed to be responsible members of an Opposition here.  The Government and the Military Tribunal are entitled to get from citizens who are brought before the Tribunal an undertaking that they are going to keep the peace and be of good behaviour.  The men who have talked so much about keeping within the law, and all the rest of it, have shown that what they really want is to get their followers screwed up to breaking the law and using other than peaceful measures against the Government elected by the people.  We have shown that we wanted to govern by peaceful means.  The Opposition here are determined that we are not going to be allowed to govern by peaceful means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any set of people, if they want to have force used against them, can always make those who are in control use force against them.  We have had to use force against ex-Commandant Cronin and the others who were brought into Arbour Hill, because we could not allow the people of the country to be defeated in their objects by men who were not prepared to keep the peace and be of good behaviour towards their neighbours.  When we were elected we promised the people that no man was going to be interfered with, that there would be no interference with any person or property, unless according to law.  Cronin and the others are in jail because they have not kept the law.  If he was prepared to keep the peace in the future he would not be in jail now.  We know that ex-Commandant Cronin, and others like him, are simply the tools of designing politicians who are endeavouring <Col N="2666" /> to get back into power. They have stirred up fellows like Cronin to get into jail and to keep in jail and they have endeavoured to create trouble all over the country in order that this Government may be stopped in its progress of building up. Cronin was fool enough to do it for them and a lot of other young people are fools enough to carry out their work.</P>
    <P>We do not want trouble, but we are not going to be driven along those lines without objecting to it.  We had to bring in the Constitution (Amendment) Act, although we disliked it, simply because there was no other means at our disposal to stop bloodshed here in Dublin, and to stop this country drifting into chaos.  This debate has now been going on for two or three hours.  A somewhat similar debate has been going on for the last two and a half days.  I now beg to move: &ldquo;That the Question be now put.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>That a Supplementary sum not exceeding £10 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1934, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Agriculture, and of certain services administered by that Office, including sundry Grants-in-Aid.</P>
      <P>There are two items in this Vote, one of which, the sum of £1,150, under the Acquisition of Land (Allotment) (Amendment) Bill, 1934, was rather fully explained here recently, as the total amount to be required for grants for the free provision of seeds, manures and implements, for use in allotments for unemployed persons up to March, 1934, in respect of an estimated number of 630 allotments.  The other item of £455 in respect of a research grant to University College, Dublin, is for carrying out research work under two heads: (1) virus disease of the potato, and (2) the production of certain varieties of strong strawed oats and barley.  When the Empire Marketing Board was being wound up on 30th September, 1933, the British Government undertook to carry out any commitments that any of the various Governments might have entered into. They were, however, asked to make any economies that were possible, and certain economies were made on this particular research item.  The very minimum estimated for the completion of the work was £1,134 5s., of which £445 has become due this year. Although the British Government agreed to foot the bill of all the Dominion Governments in respect of any commitments carried over from the Empire Marketing Board, it was suggested that the various Governments might undertake this payment themselves. Some of them agreed, some of them did not agree, but amongst those that agreed to pay out of their own Exchequer was this Government.</P>

There are other matters of research very important which would hardly be relevant on that, and I do not propose to go into them on this Vote.  I do not wish <Col N="2671" /> to make a speech, but I would like to get information from the Minister on these matters.

      <P>This Estimate is required to meet the additional expenditure resulting from the recruitment of the 300 new members of the Force, and secondly, it is caused, in part, by the extra cost of travelling and the responsibilities incurred in preventing or trying to prevent disorder at public meetings. Under sub-head (A) Salaries, Wages and Pay, there are increases for uniform and equipment for the men recently recruited.  In sub-heads (C) and (D)&mdash;Subsistence Allowances and Locomotion Expenses, this extra cost has been incurred because of the necessity of the Gárda attending at public meetings.  Sub-head (H), Transport and Carriage&mdash;this item is due to the increase in the Force.  The item of £360 under Incidental Expenses (N) is required for payment to the Army for certain arms and munitions which were transferred from the military authorities to the Gárda authorities. The increase in the Appropriation-in-Aid is due to an increase of £4,770 from the Road Fund.  This sum would not be normally paid until next year but owing to certain operations under the Road Act it is possible to transfer it now.</P>

      <P>This Estimate has been introduced in what I can only call a very unsatisfactory manner.  We are here asked to vote very large sums indeed for a new force of Guards.  Three hundred men are brought under very strange and exceptional circumstances into the Guards, and not one single word of explanation is given to the House by the Minister as to why these 300 men were brought into the Guards, or what was the need of these 300 young men in the Guards. According to the Minister when in Opposition, there were not only sufficient Guards, but there were at least 2,000 too many Guards.  It used to be the burden not only of his speeches, but the burden of speech after speech delivered from these Benches when Fianna Fáil were in Opposition, that there were far too many Guards in this country, that there should be enormous savings made in the Guards, especially by the reduction <Col N="2675" /> of their numbers.  Indeed, if his memory does not play him false, and if he will just cast his mind back over a very short period, the Minister who sits beside the Minister for Justice&mdash; the Minister for Industry and Commerce&mdash;would remember how very eloquent he used to grow on the possibilities of enormous savings in the Guards.  That is now all flung over. There can be no savings in the number of the Guards.  Although the Guards were at full strength when the Minister took over office, or at least when his predecessor took over office&mdash;and there was practically no diminution during the term of his predecessor in office&mdash;we now discover that that force was not adequate and that 300 new men are required.  What has become of the Minister for Industry and Commerce's eloquence?  Is it lost?  Does he never speak to his friend the Minister for Justice and tell him of the ways in which he was willing to save, and saw that those sums could be saved?  Does he never use that persuasive tongue of his to effect a reduction in numbers rather than an increase?</P>
      <P>The poor Minister for Justice himself has evidently got to admit now that all that stuff he used to talk in Opposition was a mere vote-catching cry.  There was nothing in it; it is all humbug from first to last.  The Minister has not even attempted to give us any justification for this increase in the number of Guards and also for the very strange and extraordinary method which was taken to recruit those men. This is a matter which has come under criticism in this House indirectly already and one would have thought the Minister for Justice in introducing the Estimate would have been burning with zeal to explain why this new force was brought into existence and why every single regulation governing recruitment to the Guards had to be flung aside in order that a certain type, and only a certain type, of men should be brought into this new force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The regulations as to recruiting men for the Guards are very clear and specific.  Men must be a certain height; they must have a certain chest measurement, they must be under a <Col N="2676" /> certain age, and they must be unmarried. All these things are laid down by regulation for recruiting men to the Gárda Síochána.  These three hundred men, as we know, were recruited in the teeth of the Gárda regulations. Many of them did not correspond as far as height is concerned, as far as chest measurement is concerned, as far as age is concerned, and as far as the fact that they were unmarried is concerned.  I know that the Minister made a statement in this House that men had been taken into the Guards in previous years before Fianna Fáil came into office who were unable to meet the requirements laid down. That is not so.  No men were taken into the Guards who did not fully meet the requirements.  The Minister said that men were taken in who were under height.  There were two scales of height for recruiting Guards.  There was one for the ordinary person who had to be a certain height.  There was another regulation dealing with men recruited out of the army and in their case the height standard was reduced. But here we have it admitted by the Minister that these men were taken in not in compliance with the regulations at all.  We know, too, because it was stated in the newspapers at the time, and never contradicted, that these men were chosen and selected, not by the Commissioner of the Guards, but by a Deputy of this House, and then they were handed over holus-bolus to the Commissioner with &ldquo;you have to take them whether you like it or not.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What is the reason for all that?  Why could not the ordinary regulations be kept?  Why were men long over age taken into the Guards?  Why were married men taken into the Guards against the regulations?  Anybody who has anything to do with a police force anywhere in the world has always made this discovery, that if you want to have a really good and efficient policeman you must take that man and begin the training of him when he is young.  As a matter of fact, I do know that long experience had convinced the leading officers in the Depot that if you want really good policemen it would be better to take them in under 20 rather <Col N="2677" /> than over 20.  I am informed, and I believe it to be a fact, that actually men with sons old enough to be in the Guards themselves were taken into this force.  There was no desire obviously, no wish to get proper or suitable men.  There was only a wish to recruit men of one political outlook, and for that purpose a police officer could not be trusted and a Deputy of this House had to do the important work of the Commissioner of the Guards.  I am not interested in the insult that that was to the Commissioner, but I am interested in the question of efficiency, and I say that a force recruited in that fashion can never turn out to be a really first-class or efficient body of men.  Of course, they were not.  We know that.  Men taken suddenly, collected together, and selected by a Deputy of this House, were not going to turn out good and reliable Guards.</P>
    <P>We had one of the most, in fact I should say without any qualification, the most disgraceful incident in the history of the Guards occurring very recently in consequence, as I believe, of that method of recruitment.</P>
    <P>There was a trial before the Military Tribunal, that of Commandant Cronin. There were two charges against him, one being membership of an unlawful association, and the other sedition, because he said that the revolver ammunition had been dumped in his offices by a search party.  It was a rather strange case.  In the first place, Commandant Cronin was not charged with possession of the ammunition. He was not charged with having the ammunition under his control.  The charge brought against him was that he used seditious words.  In other words, the Attorney-General had given up hope, and did not consider that there was a <i>prima facie</i> case, even for investigation, against Commandant Cronin as regards possession of the ammunition, or of having it under his control.  Seeing that he could not get reliable evidence upon which he could formally found a <i>prima facie</i> case, he fell back upon the second charge, that he seditiously said the ammunition had been dumped.  The case went into court, and when he was tried Commandant Cronin frankly admitted <Col N="2678" /> using the words, but pleaded their truth.  He was acquitted on that charge.  In other words, nothing could be clearer than that, in the view of the Military Tribunal who tried the case, the ammunition had been dumped, and dumped by some member of the party which was searching Commandant Cronin's premises on that day.</P>
    <P>Has anything been done?  Has there been any inquiry?  We heard of no such inquiry.  We have the findings of the court, that some individual dumped the ammunition.  That individual is still in the Guards, and, as far as the public knows, no effort has been made to trace him out by the Guards themselves, and no proceedings have been taken.  This is not a matter of mere rumour; not a matter of mere suggestion.  The position is that certain members of the Gárda Síochána&mdash;beyond question members of the new branch&mdash;dumped the ammunition. That is the finding of a court competent to deal with the matter. They had to find that, preliminary to the acquittal, as they did acquit Commandant Cronin.</P>
    <P>The House is asked to pass a Vote for an enormous sum of money, £30,000.  Certainly it is a big sum in these days to have flung upon the revenue, because 300 new men have been chosen in a most extraordinary fashion, for no reason that the Minister has been now or at any other time able to put forward to satisfy the people of this country or this House.  What were these men recruited for?  Why was this new addition made?  The Guards were adequate in number.  They had kept the peace of the country splendidly for many years.  There was no section of the community&mdash;of the law-abiding section, at least&mdash; that was not perfectly satisfied with the existing Guards and the way in which they did their work.  They have won the admiration of every law-abiding person.  Nobody could challenge their efficiency.  What we do challenge, and what we must challenge is the fashion in which this body has been recruited.  Therefore, you are going to change the old system, and instead of having a force of Guards that will command the respect and <Col N="2679" /> confidence of every law-abiding citizen, you want to set up a force which, certainly in one instance, has shown itself entirely unworthy of the Guards' traditions.  You have set up a force which you recruited in that extraordinary fashion solely for political motives.  You are endeavouring to have a particular political section of the Guards, that the country cannot trust to do their duty.  If more Guards were required&mdash;and the Minister has not shown us that they were&mdash;then they could have been got in the ordinary way.  Recruiting could have been opened at the depot.  The men could have come up for examination and could have been selected in the ordinary way by the Commissioner and then absorbed into the force, wherein there would be companionship with old, experienced, highly-tried and trusted members of the Guards.  In time they themselves would learn their duty and would, if properly selected, become highly respected and highly competent members of the Guards. But we have none of that now.  We have men sent out through the country who do not command the confidence of the people&mdash;of course, I mean the law-abiding people.</P>
    <P>We had another example which came before the Military Tribunal the other day.  In the presence of the Guards a man was able to fire three or four shots into a house.  He injured a person in the house.  It was the mercy of Providence that he did not kill someone in it.  I know that a man has been convicted, but that firing could go on in the presence of Guards, and the persons concerned cleared away.  As far as that household is concerned, the two new Guards who were outside were of no help and of no assistance. In a case like that why were not tried and experienced members of the Guards, who would have known how to do their duty, sent there?  Not at all. You have only succeeded in demonstrating to this country that by your political method of recruitment, you have selected the wrong type of men. In consequence you have shaken the confidence of the law-abiding citizens of this State in the efficiency of that section of the Guards.  It is a very bad <Col N="2680" /> thing.  If you start shaking public confidence in the way in which a section of the Guards do their work, the country may not be able to discriminate, and the confidence of the public in the old, responsible and tried Guards would be shaken.  There is another thing which should never be forgotten, that in a force like the Guards, with its fine traditions, splendidly built up during the last few years, one of the most valued things is <i>esprit de corps.</i>  One of the things that can be utilised in the most perfect fashion is the feeling amongst the Guards that they have a force with a fine reputation.  Each individual member will consider that he has got to keep up the reputation of that force. In consequence, there will be a driving power behind each member of the force to keep along the straight and correct path.  But do the other thing: bring in a man who lowers the reputation of the Guards in the public eye and who lowers the reputation of the whole force in the Guards' own eyes, and you are killing that <i>esprit de corps:</i> you are taking away from the Gárda force one of the very best assets that it has got, and you do so want only and without any cause.</P>
    <P>When you come into this House to introduce an Estimate dealing with that body of men you come in with no explanation to offer: just a few short words dealing with the facts and figures, but not one single word as to why this extra expenditure is required and why this extra body has been recruited in this strange fashion. Considering the present economic condition of this State, this sum of £30,000 is a very large sum, a sum which could be invested in valuable work amongst those whom the economic policy of the Government have driven into poverty. You have this sum added on to the Gárda Vote, and an explanation as to why it should be added on is not forthcoming from the Minister for Justice. In my judgment this is not a Vote that the House should pass.  If the country wants extra Guards, if there is a need of an extra police force, if the present force is not fit or adequate to deal with crime and the Minister comes to this House and says &ldquo;There are not sufficient Guards in the country to <Col N="2681" /> maintain order; I want more Guards and I am going to recruit them in the ordinary way, I am going to get the best men I can, I am going to let competent officers of the Guards select the recruits.&rdquo;&mdash;If the Minister comes to the House and establishes a case such as I have outlined, there will be no member more willing to support him than I will be.  The primary object of every Government ought to be the maintenance of order.  If the Government wants a police force bigger than its existing police force to maintain order, then most certainly I will support the Government in such a demand, but I will not support the Government in a demand that they may get pay for men whom they have not brought in to make easier the task of keeping order in this State, a body of men whom they have not recruited in the ordinary fashion and trained up in the ordinary, old way, and a body of men who have not helped in the preservation of the peace in this country and in whom the country has not got and cannot have confidence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>The only two charges that Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney has been able to make with regard to these men who are recruited is the one that has reference to the case against Commandant Cronin, and the incident in Cork.  I do not accept the implication which the Deputy wants to assume flows naturally from the decision in the Commandant Cronin case.  No reasons were given by the Tribunal for the decision they gave.  Undoubtedly, they acquitted Commandant Cronin of the charge of being guilty of sedition, in making the charge that ammunition was &ldquo;planted,&rdquo; but it is quite possible &mdash;I do not know what was in the minds of the members of the Tribunal&mdash;that they were quite satisfied that Commandant Cronin had neither knowledge nor control of the ammunition that was found there: that he made this statement <i>bona fide,</i> and having made the statement <i>bona fide</i> at the time, it was very hard to convict him of sedition. The Guard made the charge of having found the stuff there, that was all he charged Commandant Cronin with.  He did not know who had control of it.  He merely made that <Col N="2682" /> charge, and on that charge Commandant Cronin was acquitted.</P>
      <P>With regard to the other incident in Cork, I can assure the Deputy&mdash;it is very easy for people to see the position reading it from the newspapers&mdash; that the superior officers in that particular incident were quite satisfied&mdash;it was not confined to the new recruits: there were other Guards in the vicinity &mdash;that the Guards from the tactical point of view acted in the proper way in not attempting to arrest at that time.  These are the only two charges made against the new recruits.  From the reports that I have got, there is a large number of these recruits still under training in the Depot, well over 100 out of the 300.  On the reports that we get from superior officers through the country, I am satisfied that, on the whole, they are carrying out their duties, and that the <i>esprit de corps</i> which the Deputy seems so anxious about does exist between them and the other members of the force.  I do not see why it should not.  They have not been guilty of any indiscipline.  There was one case of what might be construed as indiscipline, and the man concerned was very quickly put outside the gates.  There has been a rigid discipline enforced amongst these men, and they have yielded to that discipline. The officers under whom they have served are satisfied with them.</P>
      <P>One of the points the Deputy made had reference to what he called the irregular way these men have been recruited.  He pointed out that in the past there were only two systems by which they could be recruited where there were different ages and sizes.  As a general rule that may be so, but if the Deputy had inquired from time to time about the men who were being recruited he would have found that there were numerous exceptions made during those years.  I do not want to read in the House the name of any Guard who was recruited.  I have a list here giving the height, age, and so on of men taken in at various times, who were over age&mdash;some of them 35 years, other 37 years of age, 38 years of age, and so on.  Others of them were under height.  There is a large number of them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I shall send a list to the Deputy.  A big number of them had failed in the Civil Service Temporary test, and I think every Deputy will admit that it is not a very difficult test to pass.  One man, who was taken in on the 2nd September, 1925, was 5' 5&rdquo;&mdash;hardly tall enough to qualify even for the National Army&mdash; and he was aged 26, which meant that his period of growth had passed, anyway. There were regulations, but I am satisfied that these regulations were departed from in many cases.  We have conformed to the regulations so far as possible, and there is no use in trying to raise the suggestion&mdash;and I think it is very dangerous to raise such a suggestion&mdash;that this is purely a politically recruited force.  They are not kept as a separate force.  Some of them may be utilised from time to time in detective work in that branch of the Guards, but others have been found more suitable for the ordinary uniformed branch.  I suppose the Deputy knows how the force was originally recruited.  There was not a Deputy on that side of the House, who had not the unfortunate Commissioner of that day haunted day after day to get their friends into the Guards, and considerable pressure was brought from time to time to get recruits into the Gárda.  Men are now taken in in the ordinary way, and these 300 men had <Col N="2684" /> to follow the ordinary procedure.  They had to get recommendations from their parish priests and from other responsible persons and so on, just as in the past.  If the Commissioner was not satisfied that they were of good character and in every other respect suitable they were not accepted.  They had to pass the literary test.  Nobody was taken on that did not pass that test set by the Civil Service Commission&mdash; not one that I am aware of, at any rate, and I think I have it fairly complete.</P>
      <P>A complaint has been made as to the necessity for this recruiting and as to the strength of the force.  Deputies are aware that it had not been at full strength.  I think it would be; roughly, about 470 below full strength.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, practically 200. I cannot follow very clearly the Deputy's line of argument.  If we are to agree with the claim made here that a good deal of disorder has existed in the country, it is the duty of the Government to afford protection against those disorders.  Deputies opposite say that so short are we of protective forces that they have to <Col N="2685" /> build up a Blueshirt or private army to assist the police, if not actually to take over the duties of the police.  We have to try to deal with that position and to provide police to do the work that these other people try to assign to themselves.  If you say that it is necessary for the Blueshirts to come along and give protection at meetings, and we say that it is the duty of the Guards to afford that protection, then it is apparent that it was necessary to increase the force of the Guards.  So far as I can see, the Deputy wants to cut down the numbers of the Guards and at the same time to say that their duty must be performed by people not under our control.  The Deputy will remember a minute he received in 1927 from the then Commissioner.  I do not want to go into it here, but I think the Commissioner had in mind increasing the force by something like 800.  We are told that since we came into office, particularly during the last year, there was never such disorder in the country, and that it has increased in the country. If that is true, and if we want to combat that disorder, is it not more necessary now to have an even greater number than that if 800 were required at that time?  I cannot see that the Deputy has made any case.</P>

      <P>There were two things which struck me very much in the Minister's speech.  One is the statement that these new recruits of the Guards are not in any way kept as a separate unit and that they have been completely absorbed into the force and are entirely ordinary members of the force.  That is a statement which, certainly, has not been made in this House before and is not in accordance with the generally accepted belief.  A special name is given to this new body, as far as I understand.  There is a special name given to them in your regulations.  We are all perfectly aware that another name was given to them which was ruled to be unparliamentary here the other night and which, consequently, I shall not use. Am I to understand from the Minister that these men do not from in any way a separate unit?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and that nobody has been made a sergeant or an inspector or anything of that kind within a week or fortnight or month of his being enlisted; that not a single one of these recruits has been given the rank of sergeant or receives more pay than an ordinary recruit coming into the Depôt?  If these are the facts, it is very strange that the Minister has allowed it, without contradiction, to be so often said that these men are receiving a higher rate of pay than the ordinary men who were recruited to the Guards received, and that they were receiving considerably more than the 50/- a week which they should receive for their first six months.  That certainly has been stated, and I have seen it in print.  It is rather curious that the Minister has not contradicted it if it is not a fact.  I have also seen it stated that some of those new recruits were promoted to the rank of sergeant, and I should like to know if that is so.</P>
      <P>The Minister has not attempted to deal with the other matters at all. Why was this method of recruiting adopted?  Why was this large body of men collected on one day, and why was the selector a member of this House? These are matters with which the Minister has not dealt.  The Minister says that more men were required to preserve the peace.  I already stated that if the Minister could make a case for more men, and could say that he was recruiting these men in the ordinary fashion, speaking not merely for myself but for the whole Party, I would support him.  The Minister has not said that in to-day's discussion.  He has not been anything more than hypothetical in the whole of his speech.  If he says the Guards are not keeping order at meetings, then we ought to have more Guards.</P>

      <P>I agree.  But does the Minister say it?  If the <Col N="2687" /> Minister does not say it, then he has absolutely failed to make a case for any new Guards.  If the Minister admits frankly that the country is getting out of his hands, if he says that new Guards will help him, and that he will recruit them in the proper way, I, as I said before, shall support him. But let him recruit them in the proper way, and let him allow his Guards and, especially his old trained Guards, to do their work without let or hindrance. Let it be emphasised to all concerned in the giving of orders that the main and primary duty of the Gárda force, as of every police force, is not the conviction of criminals so much as the prevention of crime.  Do not let us have the hands of the Guards tied by orders, so that horrible crimes can be committed and the Guards will not be allowed to interfere to prevent them. If the Minister wishes to utilise the Gárda force, without let or hindrance, in the proper discharge of their duties in preserving order, and if he recruits the right type of men, then, I say, let him have as many men as he is advised by the competent heads of the police are required.  We have not heard even a suggestion that this body of men was recruited upon the recommendation of the Commissioner of Police.  I am not satisfied at all&mdash;I shall not say with the case made by the Minister, but with the refusal to make a case.  That was the characteristic of the speech of the Minister.</P>

      <P>This Vote of £8,000, odd, for what is, to all intents and purposes, an auxiliary police force would want some explaining, especially having regard to the method of recruitment.  I know many of the members of the new force, and I do not want to say anything against them.  No matter what they are, or what they are not, or what they have been, the method of recruitment vitally concerns any police force.  When the Minister proceeded to supplement the police force, he was not in the position that obtained here in 1922, when there was practically no police force and there had to be mass recruitment.  The men recruited had to get as quick a training as <Col N="2688" /> possible and had to be sent out to do duty.  The Minister started to recruit men about 5th August, of last year, and, as far as any evidence I have goes, I do not think I would be wrong in saying that these men were turned out to do police duty without any training at all.  A lot of play has been made in the debates here to-day and yesterday with certain matters. I could say a good deal about these matters but I should not like to do so on account of certain notes struck in the debates both yesterday and to-day. It would be much better for the country if these notes could be carried a bit further.  It is an appalling situation to find this country having, in 1934, what is, to all intents and purposes an auxiliary police fore and &mdash;I say it without any offence&mdash;a political auxiliary police force.  The note that has been struck is a good one and I hope responsible people on both sides of the House will give ear to that note and let us, as soon as possible, get down to normality. Whatever differences there are, let them be genuine differences of economic policy or of political outlook, if you like.  The words &ldquo;murder&rdquo; and &ldquo;murderer&rdquo; have been bandied about very much, but since then a better note has been struck and it would be well to get on to that note.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not fair in dealing with a police force for the Minister to recruit men and send them out to do duty without giving them a proper training.  There was a dangerous occasion on 20th September last in connection with the sale of cattle in Linehan's pound.  To quote the President, that was an action that no man could make popular in this country.  It was sworn by a member of this special force that he was in charge of this force on that occasion.  The Superintendent of the Gárda, who was nominally and outwardly in charge of all the police there, was really not in complete charge.  He had no knowledge of this force being there officially.  This junior officer swore that he was in immediate charge of this force of special Guards.  He said there were about 40 there all armed with guns. A number of these were put up as witnesses, on the advice of <Col N="2689" /> the Attorney-General, and every one of them swore they had guns and that they got these between the days they joined the Guards and the 5th August and 9th September.  Now men who joined on 9th September had only eleven days from the day they joined until they were sent up to deal with, what was sworn to be, a dangerous situation in Linehan's Pound.  Forty men without any training were there with their guns in their pockets on that occasion.  I do not think that is a good way of preserving the peace or that it was a proceeding which should be allowed in any civilised country. Some of those Guards who swore that day that they were armed were men I could identify and did identify in June as men who were leading gangs round to break up meetings.</P>

      <P>I only gave an instance as typical of the quality of what we have bought for this £8,000, and I ask the Minister does he deny that?  As I said at the beginning, I do not want to strike a discordant note on this matter, as I hope that the spirit shown yesterday and to-day will be built upon here. I would be glad to see before long these Guards assimilated to the ordinary Guards here, and not kept in a separate corps of their own to help to build up a dictatorship.  I hope they will not be used for that purpose.  Events have been pointing to that, but perhaps there is a change of heart and that that will not come off.</P>
      <P>I cannot see what need there was for this special force.  We were informed that there was sufficient force at the disposal of the Government to preserve the public peace.  The public peace was not preserved, as the Minister well knows.  It was during the term of office of his predecessor, Deputy Geoghegan, that a big meeting was held in O'Connell Street.  We partly in Cathal Brugha Street.  We were told to-day that everything reported to the Attorney-General, by way of disorder at public meetings, was taken up by him and a prosecution instituted and the culprits brought to justice.  At that meeting in O'Connell Street, at which there were 40,000 or 50,000 people, there was obviously organised opposition to freedom of speech and everything else.  Loud speakers were installed and right over where the police were drawn up a man climbed on a pole and cut down a loud speaker.  The police officer remonstrated with him but the man remonstrated as much as the police officer, and yet he was not taken into custody.</P>

      <P>I cannot give the exact date but it was in January, 1933.  I can get the exact date for the Minister if he likes.  It was the first public meeting our party held in the North City in the opening of the election campaign of last year.  I could give the date but I am sure the Minister could get it quite easily himself.  I do not think <Col N="2691" /> there was any case in the courts arising out of that meeting, although 22 of our supporters had to be treated medically for wounds they received from bricks and bottles in Cathal Brugha Street. There was no inquiry and there was no reshuffling in the police force.  There was no censure or suspension of any senior officer.  The officer who was on duty in O'Connell Street that day was the same officer who was in charge of the force in Linehan's Pound, and was forthwith suspended because he did not order a baton charge in Linehan's Pound and has since been put out of the force.  That was Superintendent O'Connell.  Will the Minister contradict that?</P>

      <P>In a sense yes, and in a sense no, because the Ministry I am sure, did not decide in a night to recruit this force.  They had been considering it and finally came to the conclusion, I take it, that they would institute the force and recruit for it. The interval between the time when they actually recruited for the force and the time I am speaking of, was only six months and that is not a big lapse of time for strong bodies to move.  We always hear that great bodies move slowly and I take it they moved slowly.</P>

      <P>That is the quality of the peace officers that have been recruited by the Minister&mdash;come in to-day, given a gun, go out on the street to-morrow as a peace officer.  That is really what we get here.  I am not saying that should not be so if there was necessity for it.  Will the Minister show us the necessity for it, considering that according to the Minister's spokesman, and particularly his colleague the Minister for Finance, years ago we were over-policed?  We must be over-policed still and yet we have £8,000 here for an auxiliary force. It was so urgent that they could not be trained.  They come in, they are given a gun and out they go.  They had no uniforms to put on them.  Whether they contemplated putting uniforms on them or not I do not know.  I wonder is the Minister satisfied that this is conducive to peace, that this is an addition to the peace forces?  What reason has he for varying the system of recruiting for the Guards from the old system?  Why not recruit Guards in the ordinary way?  Why not give them ordinary police duties and send them out into the streets of Dublin and throughout the country trained men knowing their duties and prepared to <Col N="2693" /> do them?  But no, the Minister did not do that.  Can he blame anybody for thinking, to put it no stronger than that, that this is a political force?</P>
      <P>The position boils down to this that despite all we have heard about this Party system, when a Party gets office it should govern for the whole of the people and not for its own Party.  Why did not the Minister police for the whole of the people and not for the Party?  Why is there need for this political force which is charged up to the country's account?  We know the qualifications for it.  They were sworn to in open court.  The Minister will not attempt to deny that.  Will they preserve the peace?  Will they help to preserve the peace?  I have seen them in action and I am afraid they will not. I have seen them in action in the last ten days and I am afraid they will not. I hope the Minister will admonish them and advise them to act as police officers and not as partisans.  I hope he will further advise them to try to stop breaches of the peace and not to try and create breaches of the peace. I know what I am talking about when I throw out that hint.  They are in the force now.  We will make them worthy of the force by advising them, and advising them strongly, to act as police officers.  We, of course, have been told that other people are causing breaches of the peace.  We know the way that breaches of the peace are caused and I am not going to go into it.  I would advise the Minister in order to develop the little atmospherics that were introduced here by his leader, to act so that in preserving the peace, he will depend more on the uniformed Guards.  If he wants to use his new force, let them go out in uniform so that they will be known, because many of them have been so well known in other directions that the last body in this country with which people who know them, would connect them, would be a police force.  Even if he insists on gathering in his recruits from political clubs there is one thing that I would strongly advise him to do and that is to recruit no more Black and Tans for it.</P>

I hope the Minister will very soon&mdash; there is no reason why he should not do it forthwith&mdash;get to the ordinary practice of his predecessors in the matter of recruiting men for the Guards.  I have no doubt that the Minister and his colleagues would like to make up leeway and provide old friends with jobs; it is natural and I do not blame them for it; but that can be done just as well by recruiting men ordinarily and training them properly before sending them out on duty.  They should be trained and educated into their duties so that they will be a help and not a hindrance.  Give the people good police and not recruits who are paid full money.  My colleague from the North City and myself will, I suppose, do all we can to keep the olive branch aloft.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>A prominent lawyer Deputy, who made a very forcible speech last night in the House, referred to the Gárda Síochána as a political police force.  I want to see the least possible political interference by this Government with the uniformed forces of the State, who carried out their duties in an impartial way during the lifetime of the previous Government. It is generally admitted that the uniformed forces carried out their duties in an impartial way.  We know that of no police force in the world would it be possible to say that all the members of the force were saints.  I think the circumstances under which the Guards were set up in this country, and the subsequent conduct of that body, should make every Deputy here feel proud of the manner in which those men carried out their duties.  I think it was the same Deputy who referred to the present Chief of Police as the political head of a political police force.  I believe the present Chief of the Gárda Síochána is a good officer, an efficient officer, and he should not be referred to by any Deputy of any Party as the political head of a political police force.  It is <Col N="2697" /> a wrong thing to create the impression in the minds of the people who do not know the man personally that he is what the Deputy alleged him to be. I have been informed that certain of the recruits recently taken into the Guards were sent out to do detective work without any previous training at the Depôt in some cases, and I say it is very wrong and most unfortunate if it is true some of these men were sent out to do that work in their own native areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to have some justification from a Governmental point of view for sending those men to do detective work in their native districts.  It is certainly a most undesirable proceeding, and it should immediately be stopped.  It is unfair to a man, who is anxious to work conscientiously, to send him to his native locality to do detective work.  No matter how conscientious a man might be, you may find that either he or members of his family have a grudge against some neighbour, arising out of some difference within the past ten or 20 years, and I submit that that officer is bound to bear that grudge or grievance in mind when carrying out his police duties and he may overstep the mark in order to get a bit of his own back, as a result of the power placed in his hands.  He will have an inclination to get his own back on someone who did him an injury in years gone by.  If any police officer, who may have been recently recruited, is to-day serving in the area where he was born and reared, I hope in the interests of efficient police administration he will be changed to some other area, and that that policy will not operate in future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is it a fact that some of the three hundred, or whatever the exact number may be of those recently recruited, were sent out to do detective and other police work without any period of training?  I think it is very desirable that recruits to the Gárda Síochána should have some reasonable minimum period of training in the Depôt before they go out to do any police work. I do not see how you can get any reasonable number of Guards&mdash;except <Col N="2698" /> an exceptionally brilliant man who is cut out for police work&mdash;to go out and do efficient police work in a month or two or perhaps a week or two after being taken into the force.  They surely should learn something about police work in the Depôt before they are sent out to do their duties, either in their own native area or in any other area.  Is it a fact&mdash;I have been informed it is&mdash;that some of the men who were recently recruited, and who are serving in their own native areas, are allowed to interfere with the work of the uniformed Guards?  Is it possible, in Dublin City or anywhere else in the country, for one of the men recently recruited to go out in the City of Dublin or in any other area without the knowledge of the superintendent in the particular area, and make private reports to the headquarters, or to the chief superintendent of that area, or even to the Minister direct?  I am sure the Minister would not stand for such a policy.  A policy of that kind is bound to create demoralisation in the Force if allowed to go on.  In my opinion any man recently recruited, especially any man now engaged on detective work, should not be allowed to interfere in any way with the work of the uniformed Guards.</P>
    <P>Am I to understand that those recent recruits, now doing detective work, are responsible to the superintendent of the area in which they are operating, or are they allowed to go outside a particular superintendent's area and make reports about officers and members of the uniformed Guards direct to some other centre?  If the Minister is not quite certain that those things are going on I would ask him to make careful inquiries, and if what I allege is correct I hope he will take the necessary steps to have it stopped.  I am not quite sure whether there has been any alteration in the method of carrying out their duties in the detective branch, or whether any people who are to-day engaged as detective officers in the Gárda Síochána have the privilege&mdash;I do not think they should have it&mdash;of reporting direct to politicians or to the Minister; or are we to understand that all such <Col N="2699" /> reports must go to the headquarters, or to the Minister if necessary, through the recognised officer of the area where such work is carried out?</P>
    <P>I have been told, and I think there are some grounds for referring to it here in the House, that some of those recruits are allowed to go out and make secret reports about members of the Guards in the Dublin Metropolitan area.  I have been told that that has been done in a couple of cases by new officers of the detective force, and that reports have been made against uniformed members of the Dublin Metropolitan Division with whom some of those people came into contact, and into conflict, during the civil war period.  If such has happened it should not happen again, because it is not very desirable that it should be allowed to go on.  If any interference is to take place with the uniformed members of the Guards it should be by the officer who is immediately in charge of that particular uniformed Guard, sergeant or whatever else he may be.  Reports of a disciplinary nature should be sent through the proper recognised channels to whatever quarters they must finally reach.  It was never more necessary than it is now to see that the police force of this State is not interfered with in any political way.  I think, if the uniformed officers of the Gárda Síochána are to be expected to administer in an impartial way the Bill which passed a Second reading here in the House to-day, it is very desirable that there should be no political interference with those people in the administration of delicate duties of that kind.  I have every confidence that the present Chief of Police, as a good police officer, as a man who has had long and considerable police experience, and who was appointed to and filled a very high position during the régime of the late Government, will carry out his duties in a fair and impartial way if he is not interfered with by politicians, or by people who may be attached to either one side or the other in the conflict that is now going on.</P>

      <P>A Chinn Comhairle, we are opposed to this huge increase in the Gárda Vote.  This is another instance of the non-fulfilment of the economies that were pointed out to us at various times by the Ministry opposite. At the very beginning of this year we were told there would be no new recruits wanted for the Gárda; that there were sufficient police, and that recruiting would be put off for an indefinite period.  During the debate that has taken place yesterday and to-day it would appear from the Attorney-General's statement that there was very little real unrest in the country. They were forced, he said, to put into operation the Constitution Amendment Act and to set up a Tribunal, but it really was not necessary to use it; there were very few cases brought before that particular Tribunal.  It would appear, therefore, that on that particular point this new force was not needed.  One would have to examine one's conscience very closely&mdash; at least, the Minister would&mdash;to make a definite case as to why this Force was brought into operation.  I for one, before I go any further, would like to say that I have as much respect as anybody&mdash;perhaps more respect than some&mdash;for our police force in this country, from the top to the bottom.  Anything that could be said in their favour I would say, and back it.  They are an excellent body, who are doing their duty, and who are fully capable of doing their duty without any addition to their service.  Whatever few remarks I am going to make are not directed against the personnel of the new addition.  I do not know any of <Col N="2701" /> them personally.  I have no doubt that quite a number of them, perhaps all, are excellent men.  What I am objecting to is the expense to this State of the unnecessary addition to this force. This force was brought in some time last August or September, for what reason one does not quite know.  The Ministry, evidently in a panic, believed that there was some modern Guy Fawkes somewhere in this Party, alive with the intention of blowing up those premises, or something similar.  There was, I believe&mdash;I do not know for what cause &mdash; some little smoke appeared at the back of those premises, and possibly the Ministry imagined, as they appear to imagine in every instance of any like occurrence, that it was caused by a big plot amongst the occupants of these benches.  Now there is no use, I suppose, in our saying or declaring that we know nothing whatever of such a plot.  That is definite. In any case, some of us were surprised one morning to find that this place was manned by a new police force, a force that even Deputy Davin would admit&mdash;and I am not referring to their personal characters&mdash;should not be allowed into this country&mdash;men put into uniform at a day or two's notice.</P>

It is a lamentable thing that the Minister should make that statement to-day.  When it was commonly mooted that a certain force was in occupation, the Minister should have taken the first opportunity to deny it.  He now says that they were not on duty, but they were here.  If they were not on duty here, what right had they to be here?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>In this Estimate, we are asked to vote £25,000, part of which is to pay men, who were being paid while they were not on duty and who should have been in the Phoenix Park undergoing training as Gárdaí, learning how to conduct themselves properly&mdash; again, I am not speaking personally, but one recognises the value of training &mdash;and learning how to carry arms, if you like, with safety to the public and themselves.  It is a monstrous proposal, and unless, as I said originally, it was because the Ministry got it into their heads that there was a modern Guy Fawkes among the occupants of these benches, I can see no reason for the institution of this force.  One finds it difficult to believe that the activities of the United Ireland Party made it necessary to provide an addition, requiring some £25,000, to the existing police force.  There may be other matters in respect of which the services of this particular police force were required, but I, for one, object to the employment of any police officer as a <Col N="2703" /> cattle dealer, for instance.  I think it is absolutely unnecessary that the police forces of this country should have to engage in those duties.  If it is necessary for the Government to employ men to engage in cattle dealing, they can get other men in this State to do it, and to do it openly, without employing the police force.</P>
      <P>We rather expected on the advent of this Government into office that, instead of the almost monthly additions to taxation in the way of Supplementary Estimates, there would have been a promise or a hope of reduction. Certainly, in regard to this particular vote for the Gárda Síochána&mdash;one of the most excellent police forces in the world&mdash;we did expect that the men already recruited were in number, in equipment and in efficiency capable of supplying the needs of this State. There has been nothing from any Minister who spoke, even in the heated debate which we had on another matter, to prove that there was any necessity whatever for any addition to the numbers already in the Gárda Síochána.  I altogether agree with what Deputy Belton has said as to the different uses to which this particular body have been put and I can only say, in conclusion, that one cannot too strongly object to a Supplementary Estimate to provide an addition for which no great case has been made to a force, part of which has been used to parade around these premises, not on duty but, I might say, on vacation, at the expense of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to say very much on this Vote, but while Deputy Belton was speaking, I could not help feeling that he and his Party were largely responsible for the bringing before this House of Supplementary Estimates of this kind.  Were it not for these theatrical military tactics of August and September last year, it would possibly not have been necessary to augment the force as apparently it was found necessary during that period.  The Deputy ought to remember that during that period, we had declarations by gentlemen bearing military titles that they would <Col N="2704" /> insist on holding parades in Dublin, and that come what would, they would not be deflected from that course, and after emulating the Duke of Plaza-Toro, who is reputed to have marched his army up and marched them down again&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The same gentlemen came along afterwards and announced that they were going to hold chapel parades all around the country, using the churches as meeting grounds for their political camp followers and again, the country was told that no matter what happened, these demonstrations would take place, and no matter what sacrifices were involved, these demonstrations would be persisted in.  I want to ask Deputy Belton what effect these kinds of declarations, these declarations of intention to hold large-scale demonstrations which were to be carried through no matter what the cost, apparently, in physical suffering or bloodshed, had upon the necessity for recruiting a force of this kind? The Deputy stooped to-day to using this House as a means of attacking individual members of the new force&mdash;</P>

He had no criticism to <Col N="2708" /> offer for the recruitment of 300 Gárdaí in 1932.  The Deputy was wisely not critical then.</P>

      <P>The Deputy could have raised it in February, 1932, and members of his party knew perfectly well that a large number of Gárdaí had been recruited.  The pace at which the Gárdaí were recruited in February, 1932, makes the recruitment of the recent addition to the Gárdaí a matter of a snail's progress.  The Deputy should have thought of making enquiries as to what were the qualifications and tests in 1932, and who were responsible for placing numbers of the Gárda Síochána and if he had that information in his possession he would not come along here to-day deploring the fact that additional people were recruited recently; and he and his party would not be deploring the fact of these additional recruitments in circumstances that justified the recruitment of additional Gárdaí much more so than the recruitment previous to the election in 1932.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Yesterday evening when we discussed another Bill mention was made of the fact that the Government should use all the forces at its disposal to insure a fair and peaceful hearing for all parties in the State at public meetings.  I want to put it to the Minister for Justice now that very definite instructions should be given to the Gárdaí as to their conduct at public meetings.  They should be told definitely what their instructions are and they should be told that it is the desire of the Government to insure that peace will be maintained at all costs at these public meetings.  I suggest to the Minister for Justice that he ought to close his ears to any complaints against the Gárdaí as to the way in which they carry out their duties at these public meetings.  The Gárdaí should have definite instructions as to the manner in which they discharge these duties when they are sent to these meetings. It is important that the Gárdaí should be told publicly and privately that no effort should be spared to maintain order and that they will have the <Col N="2709" /> support of the Government in doing their duty in that respect.</P>
    <P>The very fact that there is any doubt as to the Government's view on the matter of the maintenance of peace at public meetings, or that any complaints are brought to Ministers against the Gárdaí is calculated to cow the Gárdaí in discharging their duties at public meetings and this inevitably causes a certain uneasiness amongst the Gárdaí.  I hope the Minister for Justice will tell the House that the Gárdaí will have these definite instructions.  I hope further he will use this House as the platform to give these instructions and that he will tell us that he will do everything to help the Gárdaí to put down interruptions at public meetings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to reply to the questions that have been raised here by Deputy Bennett.  I had already replied twice in this debate to these questions before Deputy Bennett spoke, and I think that is enough.  I do not think when a Deputy leaves the House for some hours, then wanders in and raises a question already dealt with that I should be expected to go over all those matters again.  Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney, in his second speech, made an attempt to cause some suspicion as to the pay and allowances of these new recruits.  It was stated here already that these people are paid according to the statutory allowances and nothing more.  The suggestion that they are getting special pay and allowances that are not given in the ordinary way to the other members of the force is a suggestion that I deny. It is contemptible when a denial has been given to an assertion like that, that it should be repeated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I pointed out already that a large number of these recruits, over 100, are still in the Depôt.  They are on probation the same as any other Gárdaí there going through their normal course of training.  That course of normal training is not a matter that has ever been strictly adhered to.  The officers in charge of these recruits will train them and give them instructions and these <Col N="2710" /> officers are the best judges as to whether those new recruits are capable of performing their duties as Gárdaí. Reference had been made to it by Deputy Davin.  Again I say it is not a new practice that in the course of getting instructions some of these new recruits are sent out on duty with trained men.  I think that is a very necessary part of their training.  They are responsible to their officers and they always keep in contact with the men who know their business better than they do and who have long experience in the force.</P>
    <P>The suggestion has been made by Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney that they are not allowed to do their duty. Either the Deputy has some information or some information is available that the Guards and their officers are being interfered with by me or some member of the Government.  I do not want to use strong words, but I say it is incorrect and untrue.  I have not at any time interfered, through the Commissioner or otherwise, with any member of the Guards or with any officer in the discharge of his duty.  If the Deputy wants to do a service to the Guards and to the people, if he has a suspicion he will try to get whatever information he can and place it in the hands of the Commissioner or in my hands.</P>

      <P>I do not know.  I have stated that there has been no interference.  The Deputy will not accept that and I cannot put it any further.  Deputy Belton complained about what he called mass recruitment. Deputy Norton dealt with one of the reasons, at any rate, that there was at the time what might be called mass recruitment.  In that mass recruitment &mdash;if you wish I shall accept your description of it&mdash;the ordinary methods were employed.  I do not see that there can be any particular grievance about departing from the old practice, which was a recommendation from Cumann na nGaedheal clubs.  I know Deputy Belton may have a grievance about that, but if he understands my position <Col N="2711" /> in August last he will see that there is no ground for it.  He will realise that in August last Deputy MacDermot's Party, the Cumann na nGaedheal Party, and others were in a fluid state. I do not think that they have got much more solid since, but at that time how was I going to go back to the old method of asking for recommendations from the Cumann na nGaedheal clubs?</P>

If they take them out after a certain time or for certain duties it was not at my direction or under my instructions they were taken out.  I am satisfied that they were taken out by good, responsible officers and that they were taken out because they were considered by the officers to know their business and were considered capable and fit.</P>

      <P>I cannot be waiting to reply to Deputies opposite when it suits them to wander into the House. I have dealt with that matter already. <Col N="2712" /> One of the matters that I do take exception to&mdash;I do not want to have any heat about it&mdash;is the matter referred to by Deputy Belton.  That was threshed out in another place.  I do not want to refer to individuals as I know it would be out of order to do so.  I am satisfied, however, that this House should not be taken advantage of, any more than the court, which was also in a privileged position, should be taken advantage of, to slander somebody.  I do say in view of the evidence tendered at the court that the slander which was tried to be spread about that individual was absolutely undeserved.  The Deputy knows well that the body of evidence brought up afterwards went to show that it was a slander.</P>
      <P>Certain other matters have been raised by Deputy Davin.  The Deputy complained that detectives were put on work in their native areas.  I am not aware of that.  I certainly say that it is most undesirable that such should be the case.  It has been the recognised practice when Guards get married in a certain area that they are taken away from that place except in exceptional circumstances, and even then they are not left in the exact area.  I do agree that it would be most undesirable that people should be operating in their native area.  I agree with Deputy Davin that there may be old feuds and sores existing between families and that if a person comes into the service of this State he might, if he were of that disposition and had not come under discipline sufficiently to forget these things, abuse his position in a very serious way.  However, I shall make inquiries, but I am quite satisfied that the information is incorrect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the period of training, there is no fixed or defined period of training. A man may be more adaptable for certain work, such as detective work and take a shorter period than others would.  As I have said already, it has been the practice to take men who are being trained for a particular work out with men who are trained, but in all these cases they act under their responsible officers who sent them out on that particular duty.  The <Col N="2713" /> question has been raised by Deputy Davin as to whether information goes through recognised channels.  It certainly does.  There is no direct touch with any member of the Government or any other way by which information is given by any member of the force.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>No; Deputies or anybody else are not entitled to go and ask for information from any Guard. If anybody wants to assist the Guards he can assist them, but the Guards are not entitled to give information, which must necessarily be of a confidential character, to anybody.  If anybody infringes that regulation and the Deputy can give information about it I am quite sure he will be dealt with.</P>

      <P>There are recognised channels, of course, for police transferring their information and giving particulars of their duties and these channels have not been departed from. There has not been any departure with regard to the new members of the force taken in.  Deputy Norton referred to instructions as to meetings.  I referred to that in the other debate.  Instructions, explicit and definite, have been sent out to the Guards already, and those instructions will be repeated, that every possible step must be taken to preserve the right of free speech at public meetings.  I cannot say any more than that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGovern</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not much to say on this Vote.  I have nothing to say against the personnel of the new force, because I know nothing at all about it.  Incidentally, I notice that Labour members take exception to some Opposition Deputies, because they designate the new force as a political force.  It is not only the United Ireland Party that conveys that impression, but the Fianna Fáil organisation as well convey it by implication.  I will mention a specific incident that has come under my notice. In one district in County Leitrim a <Col N="2714" /> Fianna Fáil Club has asked to have some members of the new force sent there on the grounds that the other Guards were not carrying out their wishes, although we heard it stated from the Government Benches and from the Opposition Benches that the Civic Guards are the best and most impartial police force in the world. That is admitted on every side, yet, that impartial and efficient force is not good enough for some of the Fianna Fáil Clubs in County Leitrim, and they want some of the new force.  I know nothing about the new force, but judging from the inferences to be drawn from this it looks as if there was something in the charge that it was a political force.  That is the only implication that can be got from the action of the Fianna Fáil Clubs in County Leitrim.  I am concerned about the £25,800 that is asked for for this force.  The present Government claims that they got a mandate&mdash;I suppose for this Vote as well as for everything else.  What did this Government get a mandate for at the last two general elections?  Was it a mandate to increase expenditure?  The mandate they got was one to reduce expenditure. They promised to do so, and in particular they promised to reduce the expenditure on the police force. Reasons have been given as to why it was necessary to increase the police force last year.  One reason was that the Blueshirts are the cause.  It is easy to prove that the Blueshirts have not been the cause, and that they have not created any necessity for the recruiting of an extra police force.  The real cause is that the Government, instead of putting down and checking crime, encouraged it.  I can prove that by giving a specific instance.  At the last election in County Leitrim, cars that were to be used to bring Cumann na nGaedheal supporters to the poll were dismantled on the night previous to the election by a certain illegal organisation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGovern</NameTxt>
      <P>These are facts.  I am not drawing on my imagination. Let it be denied if it can be denied. It is not the Blueshirts are responsible. I heard the Attorney-General stating yesterday that things were peaceful at the last election and that they were not peaceful in 1932.  I know the cause of that.  If fewer Guards were necessary and if things were peaceful at the last election it was because the people were so intimidated that they had to lie under it and put up with it and had to stay in their houses.  That is how Fianna Fáil got a mandate on which they now claim to pass legislation to restrict the rights and liberties of the people of this country and to prevent them from exercising their natural rights.  These are facts that cannot be denied and all the eloquence put forward from the Government side cannot alter them.  What was the position in County Cavan?  Notwithstanding the Attorney-General's denial yesterday I know what happened in his presence in that county.  The Cumann na nGaedheal candidate got up on a platform to address a meeting at the fair in Cavan at the start of the election campaign but 30 or 40 hooligans gathered around with the result that about 600 people who were around the platform could hear nothing.  These hooligans never allowed Doctor O'Reilly or his supporters to be heard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A colleague and myself in the Centre Party got on the same platform afterwards, but the same thing occurred. The same crowd shouted us down, so that not a single word was heard by our supporters.  The Attorney-General <Col N="2716" /> was looking on, yet he got up in this House on yesterday and said that everything was peaceful.  Seemingly things were going according to his wishes.  If he wishes, he can deny that. I cannot say that I saw him there, but I have it on the best authority that he was there.  I say that he was there. Is anybody able to deny it?  The Fianna Fáil Party held a meeting afterwards which was addressed by the Attorney-General, and there was not a single interruption.  Remember the Fianna Fáil Party were not a majority party in County Cavan.  They were a minority party.  Fianna Fáil polled only 48 per cent. of the vote, yet the majority party were not allowed to hold their meeting in the capital of Cavan. That is what the Attorney-General tells us was a peaceful time.  He said that there was no necessity for the extra police force until the Blueshirts came along.  That and similar occurrences all over the country created the necessity for the Blueshirts.  There is to be another meeting in Cavan on 17th March, and as there will be Blueshirts there, please God, the hooligans will keep away.</P>

      <P>I should remind the Deputy that a vote was taken on the Second Reading of a certain Bill to-day, and that the debate on that then closed.

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGovern" hpid="Mr. McGovern Mr. McGovern">

      <P>The argument put up by the Government Benches is that this extra force and the money involved to pay for it were rendered necessary because of the Blueshirts.

I got no opportunity of replying to him because of the closure, and I did not think it out of place to refer to it now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGovern</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I propose to do.  I am, perhaps, trespassing too far, but I will try to keep within the bounds of order.  We are told the force was established because of the provocation given by the Blueshirts. That is not the fact.  What about the provocation that is being given by the armed force that we have in the country?  The President referred to that armed force to-day.  He said that if he had his way he would see that those in it would hand in their guns. He means to have his way with the Blueshirts and to compel them to hand up their shirts, but he does not mean to have his way with the people who are going around with the guns.  He is prepared to coax them: to tell them to be good boys and ask them to hand up their guns.  It is generally admitted that it is quite illegal for these people to have guns, but there is nothing illegal about the shirts.  That is the position that we have in this country. It is because of it that it is necessary to recruit this extra police force at a cost to the country of over £25,000</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are frequently told about the mandate this Government got from the people.  They certainly got no mandate to increase expenditure.  They went to the country and asked for a mandate to cut down expenditure, to effect economies, but what do we find? In every direction, instead of economies, we have increased expenditure. It was because of their promises about the economies they would effect, if elected, that they secured a mandate. Of course, other means were adopted to secure that mandate.  My friend, Deputy Tom Kelly, could tell us something about them: such as &ldquo;Vote early and vote often.&rdquo;  I do not propose to go into that.  The Government certainly got no mandate from the people to increase taxation.  Yet since they came into power expenditure on the police force, on the army, and indeed in every other direction has been increased.  I hold that at the <Col N="2718" /> present time they have no moral right to introduce legislation to increase taxation because they only represent a minority of the people.  Even if they did get a mandate at the last election&mdash; and in my opinion the majority they obtained was not got by fair means&mdash; I believe they no longer hold that majority and that the time has gone when they have any moral right to introduce legislation at all.</P>

      <P>I object to this Vote on this ground: that there were two objects in the recruitment of the new force.  One was to suggest to the country that the Blueshirts were a danger that had to be provided against. The other was the indecent attempt, the cowardly attempt, on the part of the Government to weaken the I.R.A., whom they were not prepared to deal with, by taking into the new force the most formidable members of that organisation.  In the month of August last a parade was arranged in Dublin of a peaceful organisation&mdash;the Blueshirts. This was availed of to create a panic in the minds of the public by suggesting that there was something sinister behind it, but nobody knew better than the members of the Government that there was nothing sinister behind that parade: that it was a political demonstration against the present Government.  But they pretended to be in a panic and they recruited this new force.  I was amazed to-night to hear the Minister for Justice say that this force did not come into operation until last week.</P>

I saw some of them in operation elsewhere.  The second point on which I object to the Vote is the one that I have stated: that, in my opinion, one of the objects in recruiting the new force was the cowardly attempt to placate the more formidable members of the I.R.A.  About six weeks ago one of them appeared as a witness before the Military Tribunal.  He said that he had been recruited into the new force last summer.  This was a man, remember, who was sent out as a public servant to deal impartially with Blueshirts and everybody else.  On his own admission that man's record was this: that he joined the I.R.A. after it had been proclaimed by the Government of this country; that he paraded in the streets of Cork as a member of this illegal body after it had been proclaimed, and when he was asked in cross-examination if the Minister and the people who took him into the force knew that that was his record he said that he believed they did.  Is that a proper man to preserve order in this country?  Why was he taken in?  Is he the kind of man, going around as a Guard in this country, who can be respected as an upholder of law and order by the people who support us? Why was he taken in?</P>

      <P>We have this Vote supported by Deputies Norton and Davin, the two members of the Labour Party who occasionally attend in this House.  I remember the time, when I came into this House first, when there were 22 members of the Labour Party here, and I must say this, that I looked forward to the position in this country when the Opposition in this House, when the alternative Government here, would be Labour.  I looked forward to that and hoped to see it happen.  It will never happen now.</P>

I do not know whether you have ruled, Sir, that I am entitled to deal with Deputy Norton and his Party or not.  I wish to say that Deputy Norton and his Party are supporting this Estimate.  I say that in doing that they are flying in the face of the few people who support the Labour Party in this country. There are 56,000 registered trade unionists in the City of Dublin. That represents at least 100,000 votes in the City of Dublin. They are not able to return one member representing them in the City of Dublin, because the people of Dublin have found them out.

      <P>I am glad to see Deputy Davin looking for protection.  I know he wants it badly.  As I was saying, there are 56,000 members of trade unions in the City of Dublin.  7,000 is the quota in South City and 8,000 is the quota in the North City.  They cannot return a single member to represent them here, because the working men of Dublin have found them out and know that they are a fraud and do not represent labour in this country at all.  They represent militarism in this country, and militarism is represented by the new Force.  That is the expression of militarism in this country, and you are standing for it.  It is a degradation of the Party that was in this House in 1927.  The tail that is left of that Party now, the eight members who now pose as labour representatives, <Col N="2722" /> are a degradation of the Party of 22 members that was here in 1927.</P>
      <P>I say, Sir, that I oppose this Vote, and I oppose it because it was only the first step&mdash;we have had another step in the Bill that passed its Second Reading to-day&mdash;it was only the first step in the policy of the Government to suppress the Blueshirts in this country, who are being suppressed because the Government know that those people are going to put them out of office.</P>

      <P>I connect the two things in this way.  I say that the first step taken to suppress the Blueshirt movement was the recruitment of this Force, and I am objecting to the Vote on that ground.  I say that the next open step to suppress that movement was the Bill which received its Second Reading here to-day; and I then say to the members of the Government opposite that they should pay attention to the appeal made to them last night by Deputy O'Higgins.  It was a moving appeal and an appeal to which every Irishman ought to pay attention.  He asked them, for God's sake, to think of what the implications of this measure were; that these young fellows had been <Col N="2723" /> restrained; that they had been asked to obey the law and that they had obeyed it; but not to tempt them too far.  You are tempting them too far in the measures you are taking now.  You first did this recruitment in order to suppress a political body.  I do not like the smug look on the face of the Minister for Industry and Commerce. I hate that look on the face of a man who ought to feel his responsibility, and I am sorry that he was not in the House last night to listen to Deputy O'Higgins's appeal to him and his colleagues. This is not a laughing matter, nor a matter for a joke.  This country is in danger.</P>

In other words, is it going to be taken into account as a sum they have received or is it confiscated?  I do not know whether the Minister is aware that a question arose some years ago in connection with the payment of compensation as to the meaning of &ldquo;commandeering&rdquo; and &ldquo;confiscating.&rdquo; The late Minister for Justice, God rest his soul, said in explaining the matter to the British Government that if a man here had a motor bicycle and the military came along and took possession of it, and if it just struck the man, knowing the difference between confiscation and commandeering, of which <Col N="2729" /> I am quite sure the Minister is also aware, to rush out when the lorry was going off and say: &ldquo;Are you confiscating it or are you only commandeering it,&rdquo; that man might be able to make a claim for it afterwards.  Would the Minister tell us whether the money has been confiscated or commandeered?  If it is only commandeered, we can enter a claim for it later.  If it is confiscated I presume our title to it has gone.</P>

      <P>I could not say whether it is confiscated or commandeered, but the fact is that it has been withheld. The one thing I know is that we did not get the money, although we were entitled to it on account of the services rendered by our Department.  It is to make provision for that deficiency that the Vote is introduced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>This withholding of moneys seems to be a catching disease. We withheld certain sums from the British and the British are now withholding certain sums from us.  The unfortunate farmers are withholding their cattle because they cannot send them anywhere and they have been accused of withholding their annuities. This £53,000 would pay the annuities in my part of the country, anyway, but I suppose we shall have to pay our share of it now.  If this disease of withholding proceeds much further I do not know exactly where we shall stand. We shall not be able to withhold enough to live.  We are to be debarred from withholding our shirts.  Next, I suppose, the stockings and the breeches will go.  The pockets anyhow are not much use except to put one's hands in them to keep them warm.  I really think that some effort should be made to recover this £53,000.  They have three or four millions to spare in the British Post Office and £53,000 would not worry them.  I appeal to the Minister <Col N="2730" /> to make an urgent effort to get his colleagues to settle this unfortunate dispute that started the withholding disease, and we might get something. The Minister laughs at that.  Of course £53,000 is not much when you say it quickly, but it is a terrible amount in the mind of a farmer who is trying to make a bare existence at the present time.  This is another example of the ramifications into which this economic war has led us.  We do not know where we are going to stop.  The sooner it is stopped the better for the country and then there will not be any need of Bills such as the Bill brought in yesterday.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I would, and if he wants an assistant I will leave that to Deputy Briscoe.  He will get them over; he knows all about the international exchange.  I wonder did the British include this in their net of seven millions odd which Mr. Thomas mentioned?  Who is losing this?  We could add this to the withheld agricultural grants&mdash;another case of withholding. Of course the Minister for Finance will swell his chest and say the financial position is buoyant, and he is the boy who will make it buoyant.  If we have much more of the Minister it will be buoyant in a particular sense, because there will be no finance there; it will be a floating debt we will have.</P>

      <P>I do not forget the olive branch; we are paying very well for it.  We will have a terrible lot to forget and forgive when we hold out the olive branch.  I suppose communities, like individuals, sow their wild oats. This country has sown its wild oats and it is paying very well for it, not in the feeding mixture of the Government but in real wild oats.  This is only £53,000 <Col N="2731" /> of the whirlwind harvest we have to reap.  The day of reckoning is fast coming.  The Government's latest tactics would seem to indicate that they saw red when they saw blue.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister can probably tell Deputy Belton what he, perhaps, would not want to know if he were a Tipperary farmer, that there is not much use in seizing cattle to make up for this money.  I would like the Minister to tell us if there is going to be additional taxation imposed this year to make up this £53,000 and whether he anticipates that it will be necessary to impose £53,000 additional taxation during the coming financial year in order to make up that amount. The Minister told the House about 12 months ago that it would not be necessary for us to impose any additional taxation in order to bring the present dispute between this country and Great Britain to a victorious conclusion. At that time the Minister had already put the country under a very terrible burden of taxation.  For that reason I think the Minister, when he asks the House to vote this very big sum of money arising out of the dispute with Great Britain, ought to take the House into his confidence and tell Deputies how much of this amount will involve additional taxation on the country this year and whether a similar sum is likely to be involved next year &mdash;that is, another £53,000 in respect of the next financial year&mdash;and also what additional taxation the country will have to bear in consequence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to know if the Minister has taken any steps to recover this money.  We are alleged to be at war and we are told we have won some round.  Is there any attempt being made to win this round? The English have already collected over £6,000,000 on our agricultural produce. Have we collected anything off them?  Have we no means of striking back at England so as to collect even this £53,000?  If the Government cannot contrive some means by which to get even this small sum, it is about time we heard of the end of the economic war. Surely there are certain articles of British manufacture that we handle on <Col N="2732" /> which the Government could collect this sum.  Some active steps should be taken to prove to the country that this Government can hit back in some direction and that they will not be sitting with the white flag in their hands all the time.  Why not select some articles of British manufacture and make sure that you will collect off them sufficient to provide even this £53,000?  Up to the present the tactics of the Government in their conduct of this alleged war resemble a sort of continuous litany of imbecility, incapacity and ineffectiveness.</P>

      <P>I do not think the Government would be wise at the moment to adopt the policy of war or piracy suggested by Deputy McMenamin.  I think it would be foolish if they were to do so, and I am sure the Deputy is not quite sincere in taking up this warlike attitude.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cleary</NameTxt>
      <P>I rather thought that Deputies opposite were not in full agreement that this war should be carried on with any greater intensity than it is being carried on.  The only disappointing note we have struck so far was the statement that we heard from Deputy MacDermot that the British were an honourable people prepared to pay their just debts; that they were a decent people with whom to discuss anything, and that they gave fair play all around.  It would appear to me that that is not the case now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not amazing, when the British do try to commit this highway robbery we are told about, <Col N="2733" /> that the Government here have not devised some practical way of retaliating? For instance, if we were to shake Deputy Cleary at them he might not, perhaps, be very effective as a weapon, but I should think that it would be almost the greatest insult we could hurl at them.  Now, what about the economies of all this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Do I understand the great fear that is hitting the Minister on this occasion is that postal communication between the two islands might be cut off or might be interrupted?  Why do we want postal communication between the two islands?  We do not want the British for business purposes, I understand.  Surely the Minister is not providing for the passage of letters and mails merely on social matters?  We do not want any sort of business as between this country and Great Britain; the British market is gone, thank God for it, we are told.  If we have nothing to write letters about I do not suppose Deputy Cleary is going to write letters bemoaning that!  Why do we want to get letters from Britain?  Why does the Minister want to get them?  Why are those letters to be passing backward and forward?  Is it not possible to do something manly, if stupid, like stopping our letters to them?  We have done it with our cattle; we might as well do it with our letters.  Why cannot something really blatantly stupid like that be done?  This is a microscopic provision which shows up the arrogant stupidity of all the other things.  When we are stupid in the big things why not be stupid in the details?  Is there any way we could do something, like shaking Deputy Cleary, to scare them out of their skins?  We have a Minister here who has avowed himself an adept at teeth slapping.  Why not send his over?  We have another Minister who has&mdash;I suppose by way of competition&mdash; avowed himself an adept at faceslapping. Why cannot he be sent over?  Why cannot the President write a &ldquo;Dear Mr. Thomas&rdquo; letter like he did when he wanted to know what would happen if he declared a Republic?  &ldquo;Dear Mr. Thomas, We never believed you would be ignorant <Col N="2734" /> enough&rdquo;&mdash;as Deputy Cleary would say&mdash;&ldquo;to get your own back on us if we tried to do something dirty on you, and we are ashamed of your conduct.  We should have asked you, before we did anything to rile you, what you would do in certain eventualities.  Let us now forget what happened, and let us know what you are going to do if this continues in the future.&rdquo;  Next year, are we to make provision for another £53,000? Is this what I might call only the fruits of one year's milking&mdash;this loss of £53,000?  Is this only one year we are answering for?</P>

      <P>Is not that an alarming profession of weakness on the part of this amazingly strong native Government of ours, in connection with a matter so vital as a few letters not required for business purposes?  Fiftythree thousand pounds!  This is the most amazing exhibition of incompetence, stupidity and weakness I have ever come across.  It is almost worth while feeing the Minister for Finance to go over and make speeches at them. If we are getting into the idea of trade by barter why not get into the idea of communication by personal messenger? As far as business is concerned one man crossing once a week would probably be all that is required, and in connection with merely social matters or light personal conversation the Minister for Finance could be sent over, and nobody would regret it if he stayed over for a long time.</P>

Now he comes along with this Estimate quite unexpectedly at the end of the financial year.
