      <P>I object to the taking of Nos. 3, 5, 6 and 7 without debate.  I argue that where there is disagreement in relation to this item, or any other, there should be a debate on it. The proposal is to establish a number of committees of this House.  We have sought at meetings of the Whips to have the numbers on these committees extended to provide a place for The Workers' Party.  It is difficult to comprehend <Col N="2058" /> the mentality of those who refuse to provide an opportunity for people in this House who are anxious and willing to participate in their proceedings&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2a:</P>
      <P>In page 6, between lines 7 and 8, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(ii)  would be likely to stir up hatred against a group of persons in the State or elsewhere on account of their race, colour, nationality, religion, ethnic or national origins, membership of the travelling community or sexual orientation, or&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Two amendments by Deputy McCartan, Nos. 3 and 7, were debated on 8 November. The purpose of these amendments was to add to the grounds for refusing a supply certificate and making a prohibition order respectively, the fact that the viewing of a video work would be likely to stir up hatred against any group of persons on account of their race, nationality, religion, gender or sexual orientation.  During that debate I acknowledged the force of the arguments made in favour of the amendments and undertook to ask the Minister to consider amendments on the lines suggested in the Seanad debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The matter has now been fully considered and, having regard to the points <Col N="2074" /> of view expressed in both Houses, it has been decided to accept the arguments put forward for including incitement to hatred on certain grounds among the grounds for banning video works.  In coming to this conclusion, the Minister has been particularly impressed by the desirability of affording appropriate protection to vulnerable minority groups.  In line with this decision an amendment was moved on 15 November to the prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Bill to include the sexual orientation in the definition of &ldquo;hatred&rdquo; so that it would be an offence to use words or behaviour to stir up hatred against groups of persons on account of their sexual orientation. This amendment was passed by the House.</P>
    <P>The effect of amendments 2a and 6a will be to make the Video Recordings Bill correspond exactly to the incitement Bill in this respect, that is to say, the amendments will add to the grounds for banning a video work not only that it would be likely to stir up hatred against persons on account of their sexual orientation but also that it would be likely to do so on account of their race, colour, nationality, religion, ethnic or national origins or membership of the travelling community.  The only ground mentioned in Deputy McCartan's amendment which does not reappear in my amendments to the present Bill is that of &ldquo;gender&rdquo;.  There does not appear to be a sufficient need to include gender in either Bill, especially not in the Video Recordings Bill now that it does not appear in the amendment which the House has approved in the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Bill. My amendments also follow the amendments approved in the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Bill in providing expressly that groups against whom hatred must not be incited are groups either in the State or elsewhere.  This provision seems to be clearly desirable. I commend amendment No. 2a to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased with the developments which have taken place.  The Minister of State has honoured an indication he gave during the earlier debate on Report Stage that he would avail of the slight recess in time in the debate to consider an appropriate amendment.  As he said, he has brought in an amendment which brings the definition of &ldquo;hatred&rdquo; in the context of this Bill into line with what we have already agreed in the context of the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Bill. This is a sensible development.  For this reason I do not propose pursuing my amendment No. 7 and I am only too happy not to do so in the context of what we have now achieved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is an important development that we are giving recognition in our legislation to the position of a number of vulnerable communities within our society.  I listened to a radio programme this morning which reported on the existence of a neo-Nazi group in Cork whose basic primary plank of philosophy is in agreement with the views and thoughts of the great dictator of this century, Adolf Hitler.  It would be naive for any of us to be so complacent as to suggest that certain communities within our society are not open to racial attack on the grounds of hatred.  Coincidentally I also received a letter from a young traveller in my constituency who I last met at a pub quiz in a local public house.  He lives close to the <Col N="2076" /> pub and took part in the night's entertainment. In his letter he said that when he subsequently visited the public house he was told that travellers meant trouble and he would not be welcome there.  This is an unfortunate matter which I will have to take up directly with the publican involved.  I have no doubt that there has been a gross misunderstanding and miscalculation by the proprietor of the licensed premises and I am sure we will put matters right in time.</P>
    <P>It is sad that even today people will avail of and abuse the freedoms available to them in our community to make statements of a racial or ethnic nature.  If we had not agreed to this amendment I have no doubt that those who have narrow, neo-Fascist and vicious attitudes towards persons on account of their religion, national origins, membership of the travelling community or sexual orientation would have availed of the opportunity to sell, distribute or otherwise pass their views around using the loopholes in this legislation.  It was for this reason we put forward our amendment.  I am pleased that the Minister has acknowledged our argument and brought in a very good addition to the Bill as it now stands.  I thank him for doing this.</P>

      <P>My faith in parliamentary democracy has been reinforced by the action taken by the Minister. Obviously he has been listening to the arguments from the Opposition side of the House and has responded to them by bringing forward this amendment.  I am glad that has been the reaction of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The points made earlier in favour of the introduction of an amendment of this kind were compelling.  Perhaps it is a coincidence that we debated the Video Recording Bill and the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Bill virtually simultaneously. It ties in neatly that we can include the same provision in the Video Recordings Bill.  The effect of the amendment will be that the official censor will have a further ground for declaring a work to be unfit for viewing.  It is proper that the provision which gives the censor <Col N="2077" /> the ability to refuse a certificate on the basis that the work is capable of stirring up hatred should be included in this Bill. Apart from this we are sending a clear message to those in our community, like the group in Cork, who might be tempted to engage in activities which do not have the support of most people that their activities are not acceptable.  This amendment has the support of Members on this side of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision now being included in this Bill is contained also in the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Bill.  This will be the lead Act in moving against those persons who endeavour to incite hatred against people on account of their religion, ethnic or national origin, membership of the travelling community or sexual orientation. This means that a person who uses videos to convey this type of incitement to hatred can be moved against under two Acts.  It was appropriate when the two Bills were before the House at the same time that the Minister take the opportunity to include The Workers' Party amendment in this Bill.  It will mean that the censor can prevent this type of material coming on to the market in the first instance.  We welcome the fact that the Minister has accepted The Workers' Party amendment and has included it in this Bill.  This offence is covered in the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Bill but it also needed to be underlined in this Bill.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5a:</P>
      <P>In page 6, between lines 30 and 31, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(5)  It shall be an offence for a person to apply for a supply certificate or a limited supply certificate unless such person has been authorised to apply by the owner of the copyright in the said video work.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We will leave a gaping loophole in our efforts to regulate the sale and supply of <Col N="2078" /> video nasties if action is not also taken in relation to copyright.  We need parallel measures to stop the increasing growth in video piracy through major amendments to existing copyright laws.  The present position is that the legitimate video industry employs approximately 2,000 people and has an annual turnover of about £30 million.  It is estimated that the illegal video trade has a turnover of approximately half that amount but, of course, there are no VAT or PRSI returns to the Exchequer from that side of the trade.  Therefore, pirate productions account for nearly 50 per cent of the market.  I am not focusing on the loss to the Exchequer as a result of the activities of pirate operators but I am anxious to highlight the fact that because of the existence of such an enormous pirate trade in videos the Bill before us will be ineffective, it will leave a gaping loophole.  It is our job to ensure that that loophole is shut off.</P>
    <P>We are proposing to make it an offence for a person to apply for a supply certificate unless such person has been authorised to apply by the owner of the copyright in the said video work.  This matter was raised on Second Stage and earlier on Committee Stage.  In the course of the Committee Stage debate the then Minister, Deputy Collins, agreed that changes in the copyright legislation were absolutely necessary.  In the course of that debate, as reported at column 436 of the Official Report of 15 February 1989 he stated:</P>
    <P>If we do not get the copyright legislation through we are left swinging somewhat.</P>
    <P>That rather colourful expression is an indication that the Minister agreed with the view of the Opposition that changes in the copyright legislation were absolutely necessary if the Bill before us was to achieve the effect intended.  If there is agreement on all sides that changes in the copyright legislation are necessary, I wonder why those changes are not introduced.</P>
    <P>The former Minister, during the earlier Stages of the debate on the Bill, indicated <Col N="2079" /> that he had been in touch with the Minister for Industry and Commerce and he expected action on that front but no such action has been forthcoming.  On Second Stage not alone was the then Minister in agreement about the need for action but he indicated to the House that he had been in touch with the Minister for Industry and Commerce who reported that legislation on copyright was in the final stages of drafting.  He said it was hoped to introduce a Bill in December 1988.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Flanagan, and myself are forced to table an amendment to the Bill to highlight the need for changes in the copyright legislation.  We want to draw attention to the lack of action by the Government in bringing forward the necessary changes in that legislation.  I accept that the approach adopted by way of amending the Bill to cover the question of copyright is not a perfect solution but because we have not had action on that front we do not have any option but to press the issue by way of an amendment.  It is clear that breaches of copyright are taking place on a large scale and that there is a lot of money involved in that operation.  I understand that videos cost about £80 and that they can be pirated for about a quarter of that price.  If we pass the Bill in its present form the Film Censor will not be in a position to examine the question of copyright. A breach of copyright is not fraud. By highlighting this glaring loophole I am pointing out to the Government the need to introduce legislation to close it.  If they do not do that all the time we will have spent trying to produce a watertight Bill on video recordings will be wasted.  I demand action from the Government to close that loophole.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>I contend it is unnecessary to create an offence of applying for a supply certificate for a video work of which somebody else owns the copyright. I accept the point made by Deputy O'Keeffe of using this opportunity to highlight the whole question of copyright. The copyright aspect of legislation is the preserve of the Minister for Industry and <Col N="2080" /> Commerce and I undertake to convey to him the views expressed by the Deputy. I shall stress to him the importance of having amendments to the copyright legislation introduced.  I understand that legislation is at the drafting stage.</P>
      <P>If the official censor learned that an applicant was acting in breach of somebody else's copyright he could simply refuse to consider the application just as if he learned that the applicant was acting without authority or that the video recording containing the work had been stolen.  That is on the general principle that the statute must not be made the instrument of fraud.  A similar situation might arise in theory over a cinema film. In either case the applicant would scarcely venture to challenge the censor's refusal by proceeding in the High Court unless there was a genuine issue over the ownership of the copyright.  Indeed, the owner of the copyright might seek an injunction to prevent the censor from considering the application.  I am opposing the amendment but the emphasis put by the Deputy on the question of copyright will be conveyed to the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not impressed with the Minister's reply and I believe the points he has made in defence of his stance do not hold water.  The legislation has been before both Houses of the Oireachtas for over two years.  On various occasions both in the Upper House and in this House the Minister for Justice of the day stated categorically that the question of copyright was under review. We have heard the Minister of State say for the fourth time that he will communicate the urgency of the matter to the Minister for Industry and Commerce. This matter was raised on the Order of Business within the past two weeks and when the Minister for Industry and Commerce was asked to comment, he shrugged his shoulders as if he knew nothing about it.  It is unfortunate that two years have elapsed since the then Minister for Justice, Mr. Collins, made a statement in the Seanad that the copyright legislation was at an advanced stage of preparation. <Col N="2081" /> It is not good enough for the Minister of State to say he will communicate with the Minister.  This is our last opportunity to tackle this issue before enacting the legislation which I believe will be flawed unless we tackle the area of copyright.</P>
      <P>The legislation is designed to prohibit the exhibition, distribution and supply of certain videos and to operate a system of licensing.  Our efforts to impose these sanctions will be defeated unless we can combat the pirate video industry, which is growing by the week as people can operate out of the back of vans or cars in housing estates.  The legislation is fine were it not for the fact that the issue of copyright appears to have been ignored. I believe the extra powers we have given to the official censor will only drive the pirate industry further underground and enhance its operation.  We have made no effort to combat the question of piracy.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State stated that the official censor could make inquiries whether the video material was stolen, but there is not an onus on the censor to go beyond his primary duty which is to decide whether to grant a certificate to a film.  Without making it an offence to apply for a certificate when in breach of copyright, it is quite possible for anybody in the illegal video market to apply to the official censor for a certificate.  Can the Minister confirm that there is no onus on the official censor and that it is beyond his duty to inquire whether material is in breach of copyright?  I believe there is not a role for the censor in this regard, and if that is the case, then the extra powers available to the censor are irrelevant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The function of the censor is to certify what is presented to him.  If this amendment were to be accepted it would make it an offence for somebody to seek a certificate from the censor without having the bona fides to so do.  We will also be doing a disservice to the videogram association, a body which gave certain undertakings prior to the introduction of the legislation as to the manner in which they would police the official video industry, if we allow this loophole in the legislation, and the job of policing will become almost impossible.  Their position has <Col N="2082" /> been one of the utmost responsibility and we should bear this in mind before passing the legislation today.</P>
    <P>Although the Minister has accepted a number of Opposition amendments, it is unfortunate that he has chosen not to accept this amendment.  I ask him to reconsider his position before the end of Report Stage or alternatively that he extract a statement from the Minister for Industry and Commerce on the copyright legislation so that the House might know the position regarding this legislation which has been promised on a number of occasions.  There is considerable confusion as to whether the legislation is in the course of preparation.  I believe that without the accompanying legislation, this Bill is insufficient.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment being proposed by the Deputies. As I understand it, the Minister's argument is that while he accepts there is a lacuna in the law, that a loophole exists, that the law with regard to copyright is not all it should be and that we are still swinging, to borrow the words of a former Minister for Justice, because of the absence of the amending legislation, this is not the appropriate vehicle to address the copyright law.  If that is the Minister's position, he might agree to this amendment and when the new copyright Bill is before the House it could include a provision that allows for the deletion of this amendment.</P>
      <P>The movers of the amendment have made a very cogent argument in attempting to address the problem of video piracy.  Video piracy is a major industry and is very prevalent particularly in urban areas.  It represents a serious intrusion on the legitimate video recording industry. If we can do anything to try to address the problem in the interim, we should do so.  The amendment is very straightforward and simple and makes it obligatory on the censor when considering an application for certification that he require the person applying to provide a letter of authorisation from the copyright owner.  This is a good amendment for an interim period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2083" /> When the Minister for Industry and Commerce was asked about the impending copyright legislation, he first indicated that he did not believe such a Bill was promised, but then he had to admit that if it was promised he did not know a great deal about it but that he would communicate the information in due course.  This would seem to suggest that if the Bill is at the drafting stage, it is not hovering close to the Minister's desk. This would lead us to believe that the interim period will be for a considerable length of time.</P>
    <P>When the legislation comes into force later this week, having passed all Stages in both Houses of the Oireachtas, there is the problem that it does not seriously address the problem of video piracy through which most of the offending material will be circulated.  The amendment merely puts an onus on the censor to be vigilant in this regard.  I think we should support it.  As I have said, when the legislation dealing with copyright is before the House it can contain a simple provision to withdraw this amendment if it has a better solution.  I ask the Minister to consider accepting this amendment.  I do not think it is going to take from or add to any major issue of principle nor does it in any way ask the Minister of State to shift his ground or approach to the Bill.  I urge him to consider the amendment.</P>

      <P>I could cite many examples where a Bill, introduced in this House for a specific purpose, has been used as a vehicle to plug a loophole in another Act when a weakness was highlighted in a particular area.  I recall during my time in the Department of the Environment where, when we noted a deficiency in legislation, we used a Bill going through the House as a vehicle to make amends for it.  On this occasion a different Minister has responsibility for patent law, but it is appropriate that this opportunity be taken to include this amendment in the Bill.  As Deputy McCartan has said, when the Bill covering patents is introduced in the House the <Col N="2084" /> opportunity could be taken to exclude it, but in the meantime it is appropriate that this amendment should be included in this far reaching legislation on videos.  If action has to be taken at a later stage, so be it.  I support the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The major point I want to make is that nearly 50 per cent of the video market is controlled by pirates. Many of the problems we face today arise directly from that sector.  Many of those involved in the piracy end of the market are not concerned about standards.  It is my view that we must make a stand against video piracy, otherwise we will not control video nasties.  That is the basic point which needs to be made.  This is good legislation, but it has one glaring loophole.  Effectively, it will not apply to the 50 per cent of the market controlled by the pirates.  That is the reason I am pushing the question of copyright.</P>
      <P>The pirates will not conform to the terms of this legislation.  Legitimate operators will end up with a more difficult job as they will have to conform in full with the legislation while at the same time compete with the pirates who will gaily ignore the provisions and continue to peddle video nasties all over the country. Therefore we could end up far worse off, with a proliferation of horrific pirate videos all over the country.</P>
      <P>I accept that what is needed is new legislation on copyright.  The provisions of the 1963 Copyright Act are not sufficiently wide enough to deal with this problem while, more importantly, the penalties contained in that Act, I think a maximum of £100, are peanuts in circumstances where huge money can change hands and where huge profits can be made by bringing in video nasties from outside and copying them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The suggestion made by Deputy McCartan should be considered.  He made the point which I myself raised, that the solution I propose is not the perfect one but that the good is not necessarily the enemy of the best.  What I am looking for is the introduction of new legislation on copyright, but to be honest, and here I must be careful of <Col N="2085" /> my choice of words, I have considerable doubts about the commitment of the Government to introduce such legislation. As I mentioned, the former Minister for Justice, Deputy Collins, indicated last year that he hoped such legislation would be circulated by December 1988.  As Deputy Flanagan has said, when the Minister for Industry and Commerce was asked about this matter last week he knew nothing about it. Therefore, what are we to believe?</P>
    <P>It will be some considerable time before we see copyright legislation.  In the meantime we need to plug this gap. <Col N="2086" /> The amendment we propose will not plug it totally nor is it the perfect answer, but at least it will provide a temporary plaster until legislation on copyright is passed by the House.  If this amendment is included in the Bill, and the Government are very strongly of the view that it is not a totally satisfactory answer to the problem, it might provide some spur or impetus for the Government to bring forward legislation on copyright which all sides of the House agree is necessary.  Therefore, I am afraid I cannot accept the assurance of the Minister of State and I intend to press my amendment.</P>

      <P>4.&mdash;(1)  When granting a supply certificate the Official Censor shall determine, and shall include in the certificate a statement indicating, to which of the following classes the video work concerned belongs:</P>
      <P>(a)  fit for viewing by persons generally,</P>
      <P>(b)  fit for viewing by persons generally but, in the case of a child under the age of 12 years, only in the company of a responsible adult,</P>

      <P>(d)  fit for viewing by persons aged 18 years or more,</P>
      <P>and for the purposes of this Act the class specified in paragraph (a) of this subsection is the highest classification and that specified in paragraph (d) of this subsection is the lowest classification and that specified in paragraph (b) of this subsection is higher than that specified in paragraph (c) of this subsection and references in this Act to classification or higher classification or lower classification shall be construed accordingly.</P>

    <P>(4)  (a)  The Minister may be regulations amend (whether by the addition, deletion or alteration of classes) the classes specified in subsection (1) of this section:</P>
    <P>Provided however that an amendment under this paragraph shall not have the effect of providing a classification indicating that a video work is fit for viewing only by persons aged more than 18 years.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
      <P>In page 8, between lines 6 and 7, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;or</P>
      <P>(c) it is pornographic.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am aware that my attempt to introduce what I thought should be part of this Bill &mdash; an interpretation or a definition of the word &ldquo;pornographic&rdquo;&mdash; at an earlier stage was necessary, because in dealing with this Bill we are dealing with two specific areas of video recordings that we all want to see being removed from availability to the public and prevented from sale or production in this country. I refer to violent and extremely violent films and pornographic ones which depict sex in a totally objectionable manner, particularly those that are objectionable and degrading for women.  I thought the Minister would have accepted that this should have been part of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Minister, Deputy Collins, brought the Bill into the Seanad in November 1987 he mentioned on at least ten occasions the word &ldquo;pornographic&rdquo; to describe the degrading and sexual type of films we are trying to have banned.  In the Official Report of the Seanad of 4 November 1987, column 1212, volume 117, in his introduction he said: &ldquo;I have no hesitation in including pornography in <Col N="2091" /> the Bill and in dealing with it by way of a total prohibition of supply&rdquo;.  I was disappointed that we did not get a definition from the Minister and I attempted to put the definition of that word into the Bill but we were unsuccessful.  It should have appeared in various sections.  This is the third section where I believe it should have been introduced to make sense of the Bill.  I have failed on the other two occasions and this is the last occasion I can ensure that a definition of the class of a video recording we wish to see banned is included in the Bill. Therefore, I propose my amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with what Deputy Kavanagh said.  We had a fairly full and frank discussion on the matter on amendment No. 2 last week.  It was unfortunate, if I may say so, that that amendment was defeated.  I feel what we are doing now, and what Deputy Kavanagh is attempting to do if this House is not going to define pornography, is to allow the courts to come up with a definition on the merits of a particular offence or case that might be brought at some subsequent stage.  I do not believe that is the ideal but it is better than to allow this legislation to go through the House without explicitly outlawing the sale, distribution, supply and viewing of pornographic videos.  We are not engaged in the best approach.  It is unfortunate that we did not succeed on the last occasion with either Deputy Kavanagh's definition or the one introduced later by my colleague, Deputy Barnes.  However.  I would be happy to accept the proposed amendment in the name of Deputy Kavanagh now on the basis that it would at least give the legislation sufficient power to tackle a difficulty that might be neglected in the main body of the legislation.  I support the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I too support this proposed amendment to section 6 which empowers the Official Censor, having examined videos, to ban their distribution by refusing a certificate of supply.  We give him the powers to form <Col N="2092" /> an opinion where the likelihood is that the video would cause persons to commit crime, might incite or encourage them to commit crime or might help them to contrive ways to avoid detection of crime once committed; we allow him to refuse to supply a certificate because the video might tend, by reason of the inclusion of some obscene or indecent matter, to deprave or corrupt persons who might view it, and finally we allow him to form an opinion that he should refuse a supply certificate if the video on his viewing depicts acts of gross violence or cruelty towards humans or animals.  Therefore, we give the official censor wide scope in viewing videos to form a vast range of opinion.</P>
      <P>What is wrong then in allowing him this one further step in the process of deciding what is or is not pornography? It is not extending the provisions of this Bill a great deal but it is addressing directly what the Minister suggested would be addressing in the Bill once passed, namely tackling video nasties and the proliferation of pornography and degrading films.</P>
      <P>Other parties in the House have attempted a comprehensive definition of that word &ldquo;pornography&rdquo;.  At the end of the day we may not have been able to find an agreed definition but the next best step is to allow the person who has a primary duty in this area, namely, the Official Censor to whom we are giving a vast range of powers under section 6 to formulate opinion, to have the opportunity to impose his or her definition on the concept of pornography.  It would be a matter then from subsequent practice to decide whether we in the community, either in this House or before the courts, would agree with his or her definitions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have not been able to get the support of the Government for a comprehensive definition and what is now being proposed is the next logical stage in that process, namely, the inclusion of the opportunity for the Official Censor where he or she felt it important to refuse a supply certificate because in his or her opinion the video could constitute pornographic material.  If we are serious <Col N="2093" /> about what we are trying to do, using this Bill to tackle that invidious form of trash that is becoming all too prevalent, we should agree to this amendment.  It is not asking much and would indicate a certain earnest from the Government in this regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to add my voice in support of Deputy Kavanagh's amendment. Like the other speakers I believe that if this amendment is not accepted the Bill will be seriously flawed.  The Minister for Justice has given a commitment to process legislation to try to cope with the damage pornography does.  However, to bring in a Video Recording Bill without including pornography means that the Bill is not full and comprehensive.  One of the most outrageous and damaging areas we must concentrate on is the pornographic material now freely available and being freely circulated in shops and other outlets all over the country.  The House has already heard that research in this area has revealed a direct link between violence, particularly against women and children, and pornography. This has been referred to not only in this debate but in the debate on the incitement to hatred legislation.  It cannot be emphasised enough that legislation we bring through this House must comprehensively concentrate and integrate into it the areas of most concern and urgency.  Therefore, it is quite unacceptable that we would not accept Deputy Kavanagh's amendment.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Justice indicated when last we discussed this matter that the drafts people might have some difficulty with definitions already given to the House, and Members on this side of the House are willing to accept that.  It must be agreed that the amendment as it stands is totally acceptable and leaves it open to the drafts people in future legislation, and, indeed, to censors &mdash; as Deputy McCartan has pointed out &mdash; to bring in the interpretation and the definition. I promise that all of them will have the help and the benefit of the research that has been done in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2094" /> Apart from the direct links with violence, to which Deputy McCartan, Deputy Kavanagh and my colleague, Deputy Flanagan, have referred, we are hoping in this Bill to concentrate on removing material that would lead to incitement to violence.  I do not have to emphasise again the direct relationship between the ultimate degradation involved in the violence that occurs to women and children, in particular, but to all women in general because of the fear in which they have to live their lives by reason of the perversions and the violence threatened upon them through the wide circulation of pornographic material.</P>
    <P>Not alone would this Bill be flawed but we, as Members of this House, would be failing half the population if we did not seek to have this amendment included in the Bill.  To avoid being chauvinist, I would also point out that every Member who spoke on this side and, indeed, the Minister for Justice, took on board the seriousness and the concern being expressed regarding pornography and gave the commitment to do everything in their power to eliminate it.  It is within their power to eliminate it in this Bill by means of this amendment.  If the wording &ldquo;it is pornographic&rdquo; is accepted the way would be open to enable us to work on the elements of that later.  It is important and essential to the whole Bill that the amendment be included.</P>
    <P>There is no way that this House or society in general can accept the idea of a commitment to equal rights for women, equal freedoms for women or to even citizens' rights for women if we do not take on board the whole area of pornography and address it in legislation as quickly as possible.  We cannot allow this opportunity to go by without including it in this Bill.  This Bill is seriously flawed. If the amendment is not accepted women will be seriously undermined.</P>

      <P>I think I responded too soon to the previous amendment.  I <Col N="2095" /> should have waited until more Deputies had spoken because I had some very good information to impart.  Since we have gone from that amendment I want to avail of this opportunity to reiterate that I am opposed to this amendment.  The matter has already been debated in the context of amendment No. 5 in relation to section 3.  That amendment was not accepted.  I oppose this amendment for the reasons stated in relation to amendment No. 5. Sections 3 and 6 are clearly in language which is satisfactory, in my view, for this Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;when it states &ldquo;obscene or indecent matter which would <Col N="2096" /> corrupt or deprave people who might view it&rdquo;.  That is sufficient.  Anybody who thinks we have not used in the Bill sufficient words and strength of words to convey to all and sundry &mdash; producers, licence holders and the few agents &mdash; what this Bill is all about, let me remind them that the underlying element of the Bill relates to obscene and indecent matter which would corrupt or deprave people who might view it.  That should, in my view, cover the intentions of the amendment.  On that basis I am opposing the amendment.</P>

      <P>In page 11, lines 13 and 14, to delete &ldquo;the holder of a licence&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;persons of prescribed categories&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment relates to section 11 and deals with the categories of people <Col N="2100" /> entitled to get labels for video recordings from the Official Censor.  The Bill, as originally drafted and passed by the Seanad, provided that anybody could get labels from the Official Censor on payment of the appropriate fee.  An amendment on Committee Stage provided for a tightening up with regard to who would be entitled to get such labels.  In speaking to that amendment the Minister told the House that further thought would be given to the matter, particularly having regard to the remarks made in the course of the debate.</P>
    <P>The amendment now being proposed would enable the Minister to stipulate, by regulation, who would be entitled to get labels from the Official Censor. Initially it would be the intention to provide that only a person who was furnished with a supply certificate, or his business successor, would be entitled to get labels. Should this prove to be an unsatisfactory arrangement it could then be changed by regulation.  The Minister is satisfied that this amendment would constitute a satisfactory solution having regard to the various viewpoints expressed by Members on this matter.</P>
    <P>I commend the amendment to the House.</P>

De bharr an chomhoibrithe a bhí le feiceáil anseo idir an Rialtas agus na Teachtaí ar an dtaobh eile den Teach, tá Bille maith á ghlacadh againn.

      <P>I thank all those Members who contributed to the debate on this Bill throughout its various Stages.  It was evident that we considered all suggestions made, leading, by way of mutual co-operation, to a worthwhile, strong, Bill. While there was a substantial degree of agreement on amendments there were some areas of disagreement which is only natural.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Fine Gael Party I agree with the Minister's sentiments about this House answering the clear need of society by introducing this Bill.  We have had censorship in so <Col N="2104" /> far as cinema and publications are concerned. We are answering a clear need to outlaw the vicious types of films which were available.  The Minister might have taken on a number of amendments but did not do so.  I wish the legislation a speedy passage through the Seanad.  It was introduced as early as October 1987 and progress was slow.  I welcome the fact that we are disposing of it now.  It was said outside this House that we were introducing a form of undue censorship. I refute that in the strongest possible terms.  There is a clear need for the legislation on our Statute Book.  I thank the Minister for accepting a number of amendments on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>There has been a general demand for this Bill over several years.  In 1986 my party introduced a Private Members' Bill to deal with the matter.  It was taken up by the incoming Government and introduced in the House in October 1987.  Apart from some of the amendments which were not accepted by the Minister, it has met the general demand.  I am disappointed, however, that some of these amendments were not accepted.  Nevertheless, I congratulate everybody concerned.  This Bill will totally remove videos dealing with pornography and excessive violence.  This type of material will disappear as the regulations are brought into effect.  I would ask the Minister to ensure that this is done as soon as possible.  Two years have passed since we started this debate and it is time for the speedy implementation of the provisions of the legislation.</P>

      <P>I welcome the passage of this Bill.  It will have to return to the other House in view of some of the amendments accepted here.  The Bill is a very welcome development which closes an obvious gap in our <i>corpus</i> of legislation. I hope it heralds a vigorous war on video nasties which promulgate hatred against vulnerable minorities, women and children, in the form of pornography. I thank the Minister for accepting the proposal made by The Workers' Party to <Col N="2105" /> amend the legislation to include protection for those vulnerable minorities we have dealt with.  I hope the authorities, including the censor and the Garda, will be given the necessary powers to take effective action in relation to the provisions of the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4.</P>
      <P>In page 5, between lines 35 and 36, to insert the following paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(i)  promote the formation and effective functioning of horticultural co-operatives or associations in the areas of production, processing and marketing.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed that amendments Nos. 2 and 3 have been ruled out of order. The more efficient use of our agricultural land and the proper development of our food processing industry is in the interest of farmers and industrial workers, and should be a priority for Government. When we joined the EC it was expected that many jobs in the industrial sector would not last, but it was anticipated that there would be a tremendous development in the agricultural area and that the downstream industries which would be created would compensate for losses in other areas.  This has not happened in relation to traditional agricultural production and certainly not in relation to horticulture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Against this background, the Bill is <Col N="2106" /> inadequate.  The kernel of the Bill is section 5 which replicates the functions of other similar State promotion agencies and also replicates their weaknesses.  The basic function of the board will be to provide information for horticultural procedures and hope they will respond. This type of approach has been shown in the past to be inadequate and a poor use of taxpayers' money.  We would prefer an interventionist approach by Bord Glas and a system where by horticultural producers would take more responsibility for their own success.  These two approaches are not necessarily contradictory.  We must capitalise on Ireland's natural environment for food production and this requires that a large proportion of our food should be sold on the export markets.</P>
    <P>We should like to see section 5 expanded to allow for the employment or sponsoring, via Teagasc, of a team of field officers to promote expanded horticultural production, processing and marketing and improved techniques for the achievement of these objectives.  In the late fifties and sixties when the Sugar Company set up Erin Foods and East Cork Foods it is well known that they did not achieve their objective entirely by reason of the fact that there was no strategy for marketing.  The company were restricted to 10 per cent of the home market.  There was no proper approach to the marketing of the product, such as appointing people who were qualified in that field to promote and sell the products of Erin Foods.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 3 relates to the provision of financial assistance in the form of loans and grants to achieve these objectives.  Such assistance would be made available only in relation to the gradual achievement of development plans agreed with officers of the board. Impetus would be given to the work of the board by having a system whereby loans and grants would be made available subject, as I have pointed out, to plans being produced.  There should be promotion of the formation and effective functioning of horticultural co-operatives <Col N="2107" /> or associations in the areas of production, processing and marketing.  Financial assistance should be provided in the form of loans and subsidies towards these objectives, again in the context of an agreed development plan.  Unless we give the board these sorts of powers, the Bill will have no significant impact on horticulture and we will be back again in five or ten years time lamenting our continued failure in this area.</P>

      <P>I would just like to make a comment on that.  I had hoped that this work could be done within the existing allocation of finance, without imposing any extra charge on the Revenue.  We have to accept that the board will provide finance for this type of work.  I had hoped that out of the existing money that will be provided initially by the State, this work could be carried out without setting up another tier of bureaucracy.  The money could be spent in employing the existing agencies to do the work.  I do not believe the amendment should have been ruled out of order on that basis.  I am not asking for any extra expenditure within the context of the Bill.  I think the Minister will agree that we are talking about a certain amount of money being made available for this promotional work.  This is outlined in section 1 of the Bill.</P>

      <P>For the information of the House, I will again indicate the position.  Amendments Nos. 1, 2 and 3 were ruled out of order. Amendment No. 4 in the name of Deputy Sherlock is in order and has been moved. For discussion purposes we are taking with it amendments Nos. 7 and 8.  Deputy Stagg's amendment No. 5 has not been reached yet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I see that the amendments are closely linked.  Basically what we are seeking to do with the amendments is to strengthen the Bill and we hope the Minister will accept that.  I am sure he will agree that assistance and encouragement should be given to co-operatives in the horticultural area.  Likewise, with regard to education and training and the advisory services in the horticultural area, we would envisage An Bord Glas being involved directly, in co-operation with the other bodies.  I would certainly see An Bord Glas as having a very definite role and we hope the Minister can accept the amendments on that basis.</P>

      <P>It was decided that amendments Nos. 1, 2 and 3 would be ruled out of order but Deputy Farrelly is perfectly within his rights in making a short comment on them.  It seems that the thrust of this amendment is to take away key functions from the board, as set out in the legislation.  I would refer the Deputies to section 7 of the Bill under which the board is empowered, if it thinks fit, to arrange for the performance of some of its activities by the Minister or by another person.  The person in this case would of course cover commissions, as mentioned in the Deputy's amendment, companies or other agencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2110" /> To reply briefly to Deputies Sherlock and Stagg, since I was given responsibility for horticulture two and a half years ago, a fairly constant theme has been to actively encourage producers to involve themselves with an organised marketing structure.  On the basis of what has been said already, the Deputies on the other side of the House agree with that.  We have available to us at present the producer group grant scheme for fruit and vegetables and quite generous aid is available for the establishment of these producer groups.  In recent times the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Michael O'Kennedy, has succeeded in negotiating producer groups status for the potato sector.  Under that heading quite generous start-off aid will be given for the initial five years.  I refer Deputies to the aid available under those headings.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the producer group grant scheme for fruit and vegetables.  At present there are three such groups in operation, the Green Ace producer group, the Fingal group and the Dublin-Meath group.  We estimate that approximately 20 per cent of producers are directly involved with these groups and approximately ten per cent supply wholesalers and other outlets on a contractual basis.  We regard this as quite a satisfactory marketing arrangement.  As Deputies will note from those figures, there is still a large percentage of growers and producers whom we would like to see getting involved with producer groups and organising themselves into a producer group system.  We would be very grateful for any assistance from the Deputies on the other side of the House in actively encouraging growers to do this.</P>
    <P>I refer to the producer group status for potatoes.  We have got the scheme together and we hope to be in a position to issue a leaflet on it.  We have been granted producer group status for potato growers and the details of the scheme, so that growers will be able to participate in it, are well in hand and will be announced very shortly.  We have agreed <Col N="2111" /> with the IFA to appoint a market co-ordinator for the potato sector.  If this can be combined with the producer group scheme we will be going a long way, from a governmental and State agency point of view, in coming to terms with the disorganisation which unfortunately reigns out there in the industry.  We are also actively pursuing the question of increased storage aid for the potato sector.  I am sure Deputies will agree that all those initiatives represent a significant move forward for the potato sector.  In view of what I have just said perhaps Deputies will consider withdrawing their amendments because I believe these functions are adequately catered for in the Bill as it stands.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very disappointed at the Minister's response.  This is very important legislation in regard to the promotion of horticulture.  My amendment proposes that the formation and effective functioning of horticultural co-operatives or associations in the areas of production, processing and marketing be added to section 5, which deals with the functions of the board.  The functions of the board as outlined in section 5 are very general. The section states that the functions of the board shall be to survey, investigate and develop markets and potential markets for horticultural produce; collect and disseminate market intelligence; conduct reviews, etc.  These provisions are not specific enough to give one confidence that the Bill will make any changes in the development and promotion of horticulture.</P>
      <P>Recently I had talks with some producers who are very concerned that a monopoly might develop in the industry. I raised this question with the Minister in this House.  I should mention that Food Importers Ltd. are involved in this sector. The real fear in the minds of producers is that there is no protection for them and that they may not have a future.  They are the people who are contributing to the economy of this country by producing horticultural products.  This is the type of development we want.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2112" /> Inasmuch as we have criticised the co-operatives, it has to be said that without them there would be virtually no food processing industry at all.  The co-operatives have been very much to the fore in my constituency, for example, in the Mitchelstown area, Ballyclough, the Golden Vale and the food division of the Sugar Company.  The co-operatives need to change and adapt if the full potential of our food industry is to be realised. Nevertheless, the principle of the co-op must at all times be to the fore and that is what my amendment to section 5 proposes.</P>
    <P>As I have said, I am disappointed at the Minister's response.  The development of producer groups, such as those the Minister referred to, is very important in the enactment of legislation of this kind. Horticulture is one of our greatest resources and we must remember that what we produce is virtually important for the creation of jobs and to the economy of the country.  The other benefits which come in will be the icing on the cake. The control and marketing of what we produce is vitally important for the future of this industry.  I ask the Minister to accept my amendment to section 5.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said during the debate on Second Stage, I agree with the main thrust of the Bill.  I want to go further and compliment the Minister on the work he has been doing.  What we are seeking to do is strengthen the hand of the Minister in the job he has to do and the amendments we are discussing seek to do that.  They do not seek to take away from the effectiveness of the Minister's job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister admitted that only 20 per cent of producers are organised through co-operatives for the sale and marketing of their produce.  The EC is not providing aid for the formation of such groups.  If the Minister had the flexibility our amendments propose to give him he could, if not in the immediate future then in the longer term, more readily assist the producers and facilitate them by being in a position, from a legislative basis rather than on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis, to put the required infrastructures in place.  If he <Col N="2113" /> accepted our amendments his hand would be greatly strengthened in that regard.  I ask the Minister to discuss these proposals with his advisers and experts and to look at them again.  From the point of view of the State, the producer and the consumer, our proposals would enhance the Minister's role, not take away from it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed that the Minister thought I did not think these functions would be carried out.  I am not disputing the fact that the board will carry out their functions.  Amendment No. 4 proposes the setting up of another organisation to do a job which at least 16 organisations are currently doing in promoting the sale of our goods and products.  I do not believe we should add to that list and have extra people attending different fairs throughout Europe and everywhere else.  As I mentioned on Second Stage, a substantial number of the people from Ireland who attend these fairs promote their own lines and I believe this promotion should be more positively co-ordinated. I agree with the Minister's assessment but I am anxious to ensure that we do not set up another layer of bureaucracy.  Had my first amendment been accepted we would not have to deal with this problem.</P>
      <P>The Minister told us that the potato growers will appoint a co-ordinator and I would like to know if that person will be working on behalf of the growers with existing State agencies or with the new board.  I am aware that certain criteria will be laid down about storage.  Is there any way that the number who must be involved for a co-operative to qualify for storage aid can be reduced from ten to five?  There are many potato growers in my constituency but I do not think it will be easy to get ten people to join to provide storage facilities.  If the number was reduced to five the suggestion would be more acceptable.  The Minister was present in my constituency for the launching of a book, a function I was not invited to, and he had an opportunity to discuss this issue with those involved in the industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to tell Deputy Sherlock that section 4 sets out the functions of the board.  That section states:</P>
      <P>(1)  Subject to the provisions of this Act, the general functions of the Board shall be to develop, promote, facilitate, encourage, co-ordinate and assist the production, marketing and consumption of horticultural produce.</P>
      <P>I do not think that description can be misinterpreted.  As I said on many occasions, I see the board as a catalyst for the horticulture industry.  It will co-ordinate all efforts, will work with Teagasc, the IDA, CTT and other State bodies who have a role to play.  An Bord Glas will have the primary co-ordinating role.  Any misgivings the Deputy may have about the board are answered in section 4.</P>
      <P>I should like to tell Deputy Stagg that there is no inadequacy in the producer group grant scheme in terms of assistance being available from the Community to encourage people to get involved. However, we want a commitment from the growers.  The new board, and its executive, will have to convince growers that their long-term interests will be served by being members of producer groups.  One producer group that I am aware of has been in operation for a long time and is doing an excellent job for its members.  I accept that it deals with the cream of the country's producers but I am satisfied that there is a general lifting of standards in the industry.  In time producers will realise how important it is that they should participate in such groups. When the board is established the role of the co-ordinating officer will be more clearly defined.  The experience gained by the market co-ordinator for the potato sector will be invaluable to the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In response to Deputy Farrelly I should like to quote from the joint advertisement produced by the Irish Farmers' Association and An Bord Glas.  That advertisement sought a national potato market development officer to organise and promote greater efficiency in the marketing of Irish potatoes with a view <Col N="2115" /> to harmonising supply and demand.  The advertisement stated:</P>
    <P>This appointment will be for an initial three year period subject to yearly progress assessments.  The person appointed will encourage participation by potato growers in production groups, in accordance with the EEC scheme for producer organisations, liaise with producers, trade marketing outlets, wholesale and retail, consumer organisations as well as with appropriate State Bodies (Department of Agriculture &amp; Food, Teagasc, An Bord Glas).</P>
    <P>Salary by negotiation.</P>
    <P>State employees with experience in this sector and who could secure release from present employment will be considered eligible to apply.</P>
    <P>I am sure that job description answers Deputy Farrelly's query.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister told us that the new board will consult with other State agencies and I should like to know if it is intended to establish another marketing group within An Bord Glas. According to section 5 the board will survey, investigate and develop markets, will collect and disseminate market intelligence, conduct reviews, provide publicity, advertising and promotional campaigns and publish and distribute magazines.  It will cost a lot of money to carry out those functions and I should like to know from what source the new board will receive the necessary finance. I accept that initially the Government will provide finance but it is intended that the board will be financed from other sources within a few years.  Are we talking about establishing another layer of bureaucracy?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure what the Deputy has in mind but I should like to tell him that it is not intended to have a huge bureaucratic structure.  I am sure the secretariat of the new board will have a role to play in the compiling of market information which I am sure the Deputy <Col N="2116" /> will agree is an important function.  We have a major problem in regard to the dissemination of up-to-date market information. Teagasc use Agri-Line and I regard that as a useful vehicle for the dissemination of up-to-date information to producers around the country.  It will be important for the new board to encourage producers to link into Agri-Line and to use it as the source of information. The compilation of market information and its dissemination will be an essential role for An Bord Glas.</P>

Those of us who know anything about the collection of information will be aware of how expensive that can be.  Is it not possible to engage other agencies to collect this information on a contract basis so as to avoid employing additional officials?</P>

      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will give for each of the last seven years the gross figures for emigration from this country, that is, the number of those who emigrated without deducting the number who immigrated; if his attention has been drawn to a survey carried out by a person (details supplied) in Cork which showed that gross emigration over the past seven years has amounted to almost 300,000 persons; if he will confirm these figures; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. V. Brady)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the absence of comprehensive documentary or other administrative procedures relating to the movement of persons into and out of the State, migration estimates are made annually using current population estimates and data on births and deaths. These migration estimates are for the net balance between inward and outward flows in the 12 month period to mid-April each year.  Corresponding estimates for gross inward and outward flows are not available.</P>
      <P>The estimated total net outward migration in the seven year period to mid-April 1989 amounts to 176,000 persons. This is an estimate of the extent to which outward flows have exceeded inward flows over that period.</P>
      <P>Certain estimates of gross inward flows can be derived from the annual sample labour force survey.  Adding these estimates of inward flows to the estimated net balance provides a rather crude derived estimate of gross outward migration on an annual basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The gross emigration figure quoted by the Deputy was apparently derived by <Col N="2120" /> combining the official net migration estimates with the separate estimates of inward flow referred to above and aggregating them over the whole period.  Such an aggregation is not completely appropriate, however, over a period of years since a proportion of the inward flow in any particular year will relate to persons who emigrated in earlier years of the period.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister of State admit that he is familiar with the report done by Mr. Courtney at the regional technical college in Cork which shows that the official figures disguise the extent of the outflow, totalling 300,000 people since 1982, and would he admit that in any event the actual figures are immeasurably worse than our worst fears no matter what method is used to compute them?  For example, the figure for the current year is 65,000.  Will the Minister of State not agree that only a major shift in industrial policy will make any impact on the extent of emigration and that it is time the Government abandoned their reliance on the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> as the standard reply to a question on what we are doing about emigration?  It is no longer an adequate reply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me repeat that the correct figure is 176,000 persons.  The person to whom the Deputy referred, in compiling the report did not take into consideration the numbers coming back into the labour force survey.  Taking that figure into consideration, the accurate net number is 176,000 persons.  With regard to policy, during the past two years employment has been on the increase and will continue to increase.  In my view, that does not indicate any failure of Government policy, in fact quite the opposite.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to challenge the Minister of State on his understanding of the methodology used in this report. Does he not accept that the gross emigration estimates in the report were arrived at by adding the unpublished one year immigration figure from the labour force survey, to which he referred, to the estimate for net emigration?  Therefore the figures I have advanced are at least as reliable an assessment of the extent of emigration as the Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Minister for the Marine (Mr. Wilson) John P. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11, 17, 37 and Priority Questions Nos. 3 and 6 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I outlined in considerable detail to the House on 25 October last the wide range of consultations I had held with the different interested groups and agencies with <Col N="2123" /> a view to resolving the difficulties that had arisen regarding angling licences.</P>
    <P>Also on that occasion I set out my general perception of the problem and the objectives I had set myself.  In particular, I stressed the need to bring about reconciliation between the various pro and anti-licence groups so as to heal the deep divisions which sadly are so evident in some communities.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the need to create a mechanism which would overcome the perceived difficulties raised by the licence concept and could be capable of being implemented in a fashion which would be tolerant of local feelings and traditions.  I added that I was finalising specific ideas along those lines but stressed that it would be wrong to underestimate the difficulties of getting the various parties to come to any agreement and that there would have to be give and take on all sides.</P>
    <P>Having carefully listened to and considered the views put forward by the various groups involved, I decided that the best course of action was to introduce a completely new system of funding trout and coarse fish angling development to replace licences for trout and coarse fishing. In this regard I should mention the strong avowed commitment by all groups to support the funding of inland fisheries. The new system I propose now provides them with the opportunity to demonstrate the earnest of this commitment.</P>
    <P>This new system, the details of which were announced generally on 10 November last, envisages trout and coarse fish angling development co-operatives being established in each of the seven fisheries regions.  The membership of the co-operative will comprise holders of &ldquo;share certificates&rdquo; which will be issued annually. The holding of a certificate will enable the holder to fish.  It will also entitle him or her to vote for representatives on the regional fisheries boards as well as for the management of the co-operative. There will be special arrangements and incentives for clubs as well as £ for £ matching for an initial period for receipts.  There will be exemptions for <Col N="2124" /> young anglers, senior citizens and unemployed and disabled persons.  The management of the co-operative will, in the main, be elected by the shareholders on a local basis and they will be given considerable discretion in managing their own affairs on the basis of good democratic and co-operative principles.</P>
    <P>These arrangements, I am satisfied, meet the genuine grievances of all parties and are aimed at reconciling the different groups by promoting co-operation and neighbourliness &mdash; comhar na gcomharsan &mdash; on our rivers and lakes.  If this concept is taken up and worked by committed anglers, it has enormous potential and could lead to a transformation of the funding of the in land fishery resource.</P>
    <P>I have met the various angling groups at length to outline and explain my proposals. I remain confident that they can still attract all-round approval and support. The tourist sector has acknowledged my efforts as a major advance. Other groups who consider a licensing arrangement to be the best approach, while they have reservations, are nevertheless prepared in a spirit of compromise also to go along with my proposals, if they would lead to a settlement.</P>
    <P>I have made it clear at all times that my door remains open and that I am prepared to clarify further the proposed arrangements to interested parties.  That process, however, will not involve any fundamental change in the balance of my proposals which were carefully worked out after several months' deliberation and consultation and were framed in such a way as to take account of all points of view so that the various parties involved can be reconciled.</P>
    <P>I have had a request from representatives of the anti-rod licence campaign for a further meeting and I will be arranging this as soon as possible.  Deputies will appreciate that I have been fully occupied in recent days with important European Community business relating to our sea fisheries and aquaculture, which is a £150 million export industry.  I have, in fact, four Council meetings within a period of less than a month and these must be given their proper priority.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2125" /> I will be appealing again to the anti-licence group to give my scheme their full backing.  I have made a major and generous offer and this has been acknowledged across the spectrum.  The only criticisms I have received are largely to the effect that I had gone too far.  But I make no apology for that.  The onus now, however, lies squarely on all to reciprocate and to do so without delay so that planning for next year's tourist angling season can proceed on a proper footing in those areas where fishing was disrupted over the last year or so.  Deputies will be well aware, of course, that angling has proceeded as usual over large areas of the country and that very successful coarse angling, with many visitors participating, is, in fact, going on at the moment in many localities.</P>

I will be arranging a meeting as soon as I can, considering the pressures from the European Council that now exist in my Department.  With regard to the request to suspend licences, I do not have the power to suspend licences.  This House decided on the licence.

In his reply, the Minister basically gives a resumé of what has happened up to 10 November.  In my priority question, I specifically asked the Minister to find out what progress had been made since the Minister's meeting on 10 November.  Will the Minister say if any informal meetings have taken place between officials of the Department and members of the anti-rod licence group and, if there have been meetings, if there has been any change of attitude in the Department or among the anti-rod licence people?  Has this matter been discussed in Cabinet?  If so, what has been the outcome of such discussions?  I would like to ask also if the Minister for Energy, Mr. Bobby Molloy, who has repeatedly stated that this matter will be resolved before Christmas, is speaking on behalf of the Government or in a private capacity?  This matter has caused quite a lot of difficulty accross the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to assure the Deputy that prior to and since the closure of these fisheries I have been exploring all possible means of obtaining additional catch possibilities.  At my direction discussions were held with EC Commission officials.  Also this week in Brussels I raised this matter during the course of the Fisheries Council.  In my intervention I emphasised the present difficult position of both the catching and processing sectors involved in the pelagic fishery.  I made a strong plea to the Commission and to other member states to facilitate this country through the arrangement of appropriate swaps.</P>
      <P>In addition, I took the opportunity of having direct bilateral contacts with a number of my European counterparts on the question of quota swaps.  In particular I approached my UK and German counterparts and explored possible arrangements with them.  In the course of pursuing these various possibilities the views of the industry were taken fully into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At this stage, because of the high rate <Col N="2130" /> of utilisation among member states of the particular quotas concerned and other factors, it seems unlikely that any substantial additional fishing opportunities can be obtained for the remainder of this year.  I am, however, still pursuing a number of possibilities.</P>
    <P>Moreover, in the light of my discussions at Brussels and the latest scientific assessments of these stocks now available, I will be pressing very strongly for increased quotas for Ireland for next year at the December Fisheries Council.</P>

Hundreds of people are becoming unemployed. There is a very bleak winter and Christmas facing those people.  Some of them face emigration and many families face disaster.  While I appreciate the Minister's attempts to secure quota stocks from the UK and Germany, is there any possibility at all that he could secure an additional quota outside of the quotas arranged for 1989 from the EC Commission because what was secured last year was absolutely disgraceful and now we are seeing the dire results of the negotiations that were held last December.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very serious matter indeed.  I want to tell the House that 69,280 tonnes of mackerel were caught, a tribute to fishermen and their <Col N="2131" /> industry.  Unfortunately they had exhausted the quota which was 10,000 tonnes less than the year before and this has meant considerable stress in the area. The total allowable catch is decided on scientific grounds and the total allowable catch decides how much of a quota we get.  We get 21 per cent of the total allowable catch and if the total allowable catch is set low, on scientific advice, what we get by way of quota is less.  It has nothing at all to do with the strength of the negotiators at the last Council meeting.  It has a lot to do with supply of stock and the supply of stock is decided by the scientific advisers.</P>

    <P>(a)  five fishery harbour centres, owned and managed by the Department, at Killybegs, Rossaveel, Castle-townbere, Dunmore, East and Howth. In 1987 these five ports accounted for landings of over 150,000 tonnes valued at £36 million;</P>
    <P>(b)  a number of strategically located other major harbours at which significant catches are landed, such as Greencastle, County Donegal &mdash; landings in 1987 of 3,500 tonnes valued at £2.6 million &mdash; where a major development scheme is under way, and</P>
    <P>(c)  a number of secondary and smaller harbours and piers catering for fleet needs which cannot be satisfied elsewhere because of congestion at the larger harbours or because of proximity to valuable fishing grounds or large mariculture sites.</P>
    <P>For the rational development of an adequate infrastructure for the industrious fishing fleet, proposals have been submitted to the EC for a programme of fishery harbour development with an estimated expenditure of £17 million over the next four years.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply, but let me refer him to the paragraph subsequent to the one he referred to in the national plan, namely 3.1.36, where there is a commitment <Col N="2133" /> from the Government to invest £72 million in the commercial ports, not £60 million as he has advanced now, provided the approval of Brussels is forthcoming. Does this represent a diminution in the investment?  Does the Minister agree that in Single Market conditions the state of our ports and their ability to handle the extent of our trade will be more important than ever and, currently, that the figures are 80 per cent in volume terms and 65 per cent in value terms?  Finally, is Dún Laoghaire excluded and are the berthing facilities for the passenger service on which the continuation of the passenger ferry may well depend entirely excluded?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a diminution. The funds being made available are less but, as the House will see from the statistic I have given, there is still a very substantial investment and it will go far to support the objective, namely of having proper harbour facilities, and it will be up to the Minister for the Environment to provide roads and to CIE to provide rail service to the port.  The actual amount of investment will go a long way to doing what we want to do.  I agree with the Deputy.  When I was in the Department of Transport we did a great deal of study and gave much thought to the problem of ports and, with the channel tunnel in the background, we were concentrating very heavily on getting the maximum facilities for our ports.</P>
      <P>Dún Laoghaire is a separate matter. The House will know that I promised an interim harbour board.  I am in the process of consulting people whom I want to act on it.  I will be announcing its members tomorrow and I will be getting advice from that interim harbour authority with regard to the development of Dún Laoghaire and, of course, the report, of which the Deputy is aware, of the committee chaired by Professor McAleese.  The distilled wisdom of that committee is also available to me as will be whatever input both Dún Laoghaire Corporation and the members of the interim harbour board will be able to provide me with.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Marine if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the North-Western Regional Fisheries Board have reduced their protection staff from 29 permanent staff and five temporary staff in 1981 to 20 permanent and one temporary in 1989, while the number of development staff has decreased from 12 in 1985 to seven at present; to the fact that no additional staff were provided for manning the seagoing patrol boat; if he is satisfied that the protection and development aspects of fisheries in the region are being adequately catered for; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the staffing position in the North-Western Regional Fisheries Board.  I realise that there is a shortage of certain staff in the fisheries service generally and I accept that the reduction in staff numbers as a result of the Government embargo on recruitment in the public service and through the voluntary redundancy/early retirement scheme has had some effect on the service provided by the fisheries boards.  I am satisfied, however, that the North-Western Regional Fisheries Board are making every effort to make the best use of available resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one correction in relation to the figures given by the Deputy in his question.  In addition to the staff mentioned by the Deputy the North-Western Board have two fishery officers who are on long term sick leave.  The Department <Col N="2137" /> of Finance have authorised the reemployment of a fishery officer and a general operative who had been on career breaks.  The board also have a water pollution officer.</P>
    <P>I am anxious that vacancies in key posts in the fisheries boards generally should be filled.  My Department, in conjunction with the Central Fisheries Board, are pursuing this matter and in particular the filling of a vacant inspector post in the north-western region.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that his reply and his acknowledgement that there has been a substantial cutback in the number of fishery protection development officers in the North-Western Regional Fisheries Board area is a sad indictment on our commitment to the development and protection of fisheries?  Would he also agree that in the light of the greater realisation of the potential of angling, within the ambit and the possible development of tourism as a major source of revenue to the regions, that the beautifully crafted speeches which are delivered on selected occasions paying lip service to tourism, sound very hollow in the context of the figures given?  In the light of the fact that this area has 76 lakes, one of the three great lakes, Lough Conn, and the River Moy &mdash; the major fisheries river in Europe &mdash; and would he agree that it is an insult to our commitment to this area of our economy to acknowledge that this service has been cut by a substantial number over a period?</P>

As I have said, I am anxious that vacancies in key posts in boards generally, should be filled and, in particular, I am pushing hard at present for the appointment of an inspector post in the north-west region which should ease the burden on the existing fishery inspectors.  The Moy is claimed to be the greatest salmon river in Europe.</P>

      <P>The registration under the Irish flag of a ship of the order of 12,000 deadweight tons would result in an increase of more than 8 per cent in the total Irish registered tonnage and would, therefore, be a significant addition to the Irish fleet.</P>

I am sure the Minister will appreciate that there can be quite a time gap between the laying of the keel and the completion of the ship.

The group are representative of the fisheries research centre and aquaculture division of my Department, the Central Fisheries Board and the Irish Salmon Growers' Association.  I expect the group to report to me by mid-December 1989.</P>
      <P>In addition I have directed my Department to draw up a systematic inspection programme for aquaculture, using all available resources, to ensure that existing standards and any new codes of practice be adopted and fully observed.</P>

Like all growth industries there is concern about its development and, in particular, about the use of pesticides like Nuvan 500 EC and, as more stocks are being held in cages and otherwise, the increase in fish <Col N="2142" /> effluent.  The biggest concern of all is in relation to diseased fish escaping to the wild and infecting the stocks.

      <P>The technical group I set up, mainly for the specific reasons which Deputy Byrne has given, met on 28 September. The points made by the Deputy are specifically in their programme, the use of chemicals and antibiotics in fish husbandry, arrangements for the disposal of dead fish, farmed fish escapees and &mdash; one which the Deputy did not mention &mdash; the control of bleeding of fish at slaughter.  We are very heavily committed to getting this right because the environmental aspects are very important. It is also important that non-scientific and scare stories should not gain credence in this growth area which has accounted for a great increase in the numbers employed in the aquaculture industry. The Deputy insinuated that I did not act quickly in regard to the bonamia <Col N="2143" /> outbreak in Galway.  I reject the insinuation as I am taking it seriously now and I always did.  If he looks at that area, he will see that very strong measures were taken when the outbreak occurred to make sure that it was confined.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister told the House that this report will be published by December. Will it deal with the issuing of fish licences?  Is it the intention of the Minister to have a public inquiry before fish farming licences are granted?  I am sure he appreciates the degree of community concern which has arisen in various areas where fish farms are proposed.  There is also concern from an environmental point of view regarding the difficulties that can arise from one type of fish farming in an area where shellfish development is taking place.  There are fears that a conflict may arise because of the two industries in the same area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The committee will deal with the implications of adoption of recommended standards for the growth of the industry and the status of the environment. There is no question or doubt about that and there is a strong thrust towards EIAs in all these matters nowadays. I will only hold a public inquiry <Col N="2144" /> in relation to fish farm licences if it is necessary in a particular area.  I will await the structures suggested and we will then have an opportunity to discuss it.  I can assure the Deputy that a structure and regimen will be put in place which will enable the aquaculture industry to develop without damage to the environment or existing fishing projects in an area.</P>

      <P>The preparation of a sea pollution Bill which will give effect to an international agreement known as Marpol 73/78 is at an advanced stage in my Department.  One of the provisions of regulations to be made under the Bill will require ships to use reception facilities to be provided at ports for disposal of waste and garbage.  The dumping of garbage, including plastics, from ships will become illegal by virtue of the Bill in question which I hope to bring before the House shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>European Coastwatch, 1989, which is fully supported by the Government and which was partly financed by a contribution from the Government undertook a survey of our coasts in September of this year.  The results of the survey which I <Col N="2145" /> expect will be available shortly will provide useful information on the extent of the problems.  My Department are cosponsoring with the Wildlife Service a poster campaign which will increase awareness among seafarers of the dangers to marine life and the environment of disposing of garbage, including plastic, from vessels at sea.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister's announcement that he will bring legislation before this House soon because it is long overdue and a matter of grave concern.  The Minister must be aware of the amount of plastics washed on to our coasts in the most remote parts of the country.  In the legislation he proposes to introduce, will the Minister be in a position to impose fines?  What facility will he have for monitoring people who offend in relation to the dumping of plastics?  There are many offenders&mdash;not just ships at sea &mdash; in relation to the dumping of plastic.  This has caused many difficulties in relation to fish kills and boats being damaged.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I can tell the Deputy that the sea pollution Bill is being drafted in the Attorney General's office at present.  It will enact into Irish law Marpol 73/78 and the intervention protocol. The Marpol Agreement strengthens the law on oil discharges from ships &mdash; which is very important &mdash; extending it to pollutants, other than oil &mdash; which again is important &mdash; liquid harmful substances, sewage, garbage and so on.  With it there is an intervention protocol.  When that has been passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas it will empower us to take action in relation to ships on the high seas apart from those that cause pollution <Col N="2146" /> while in our harbours or within our coastal limits.  I accept what the Deputy says, that plastics constitute a big problem because they do not destroy; that is the trouble.  I have an idea that the individuals to whom the Deputy referred in the course of her supplementary, who pollute from land, would be covered by existing legislation initiated in the Department of the Environment.  The Sea Pollution Bill provisions will give me very strong powers in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's assurance that the Marpol Agreement will be signed in the near future. Since it would be necessary that containers be provided at ports around the country to dispose of garbage from ships &mdash; after signature of this agreement &mdash; would the Minister say who would be responsible for the cost of providing such containers?  For example, will it be the responsibility of shipowners, the harbour authorities or the Department of the Marine?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I would expect that it would be the harbour authorities who would be responsible for them.  It is difficult for me to give a straight answer to that because some harbours come directly within the overall responsibility of the Department of the Marine, whereas, for example, Rosslare comes under the aegis of CIE.  Therefore, I cannot give an across-the-board answer to that.  It is sufficient to say that there will be an obligation on the people responsible for individual harbours to provide receptive facilities for waste and garbage.  I fully agree with the Deputy when he says that this is an important development, in that shipowners henceforth will not have the excuse that they have nowhere to put their garbage or waste.</P>

      <P>In the context of plastics being dumped at sea would the Minister agree that ultimately the only effective way to deal with this problem is to work towards elimination of the creation of plastics as a consumer product? With regard to the extent to which sludge dumping in the Irish Sea contributes to this problem &mdash; particularly that emanating from the city of Dublin &mdash; can the Minister indicate whether the site of that sludge dump has yet been moved further away from Howth Head &mdash; as was promised by his predecessor &mdash; down towards the south Atlantic?</P>

      <P>With regard to the Deputy's question about ceasing the production of plastics altogether, that is too big a question for me today.  I do know that there is a movement to get rid of plastic as a product.  I know also that very many people claim that it has enabled improvements to be effected in the standards of hygiene in the handling of food.</P>

As a simple, interim measure would the Minister not agree that more skips might be provided at our main ports?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>On-going engineering inspections reveal that there is no subsidence at the East Pier in Howth Harbour. The surface of a portion of the East Pier is quite rough in places.  This matter is currently being dealt with by officials of my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Contract documents are in preparation <Col N="2149" /> to invite tenders for resurfacing that part of the East Pier adjoining the marina breakwater and the work should commence early next year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJoeCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the East Pier is in a very dangerous condition because of lack of proper road surfacing?  Is the Minister also aware that a large number of people use this pier for walking exercises when, particularly on Sundays, it is as busy as Dún Laoghaire pier?  Should an accident take place at this pier in the interim would the Minister say whether his Department have sufficient insurance cover?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to assure the Deputy that my departmental engineer has inspected the East Pier at Howth Harbour on a number of occasions, the most recent being 16 November. Approximately 160 meters of the surfacing on the East Pier adjoining the marina breakwater, was damaged by the contractor's machinery during the construction of the breakwater.  It was subsequently repaired by the contractor in 1984 and restored to its 1980-1981 condition. The old concrete surface has now got rough and cracked.  There are some holes in places because it was laid initially over the stone flags.  During easterly winds and high seas the waves break over the upper deck of the pier and the action of the sea water is eroding the joints between the old concrete and the repaired areas.  This gives it the patchy appearance the Deputy knows about. The engineer reported to me within the past week that there is no subsidence of the surface which cannot then be regarded as hazardous to pedestrians.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Deputy's additional supplementary about insurance cover, I am not aware what is the exact position with regard to insurance.  But I am quite sure that, when my Department take over the pier, it will be adequately covered by insurance.</P>

      <P>I join Deputy Cosgrave in welcoming the decision taken to have the surface repaired because this is <Col N="2150" /> a very important amenity which should have been examined long before now. Would the Minister inquire into the contribution that motor traffic on the East Pier makes to its further deterioration? Would he ensure that commercial traffic only &mdash; related to fishing and the use of the pier for that purpose &mdash; is allowed because I am aware there have been many complaints by pedestrians using that pier at weekends to the effect that there is other motor traffic using it thereby endangering them?</P>
      <P>Can the Minister indicate when it is likely that his Department will be taking charge of the East Pier considering this was first promised in October 1988?</P>

      <P>I want to tell the Deputy about the East Pier which is a matter of concern to him.  Contract documents are in preparation to invite tenders for its resurfacing, that is the resurfacing of the part I have mentioned already, the part of the East Pier adjoining the marina breakwater.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no plans to restrict traffic on it at present but I will bear in mind what the Deputy has said and will have the matter examined to ascertain whether that traffic element is significant. From the substance of my reply to the supplementary already it would seem that it was not ordinary leisure traffic that did the damage but rather fairly heavy contractors' traffic.  When work gets going on the resurfacing early in 1990 we will be able to examine the Deputy's suggestion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Marine the action it is proposed to take in respect of the major development programmes which were submitted to his Department following on the meeting approximately a year ago between the managers and chairpersons of all the regional fisheries boards and an official of his Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The development programmes prepared by each regional fisheries board and submitted to my Department were part of the general Government exercises to prepare a national programme for submission to Brussels in connection with our application for Structural Funds.  My predecessor was concerned that development plans which would identify all possible areas for developing inland fisheries would be prepared at the earliest possible stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was no commitment or guarantee at that stage of such a complex process that funding or particular amounts of funding would be available under the EC Structural Funds to finance these plans. I must compliment the regional fisheries boards and the Central Fisheries Board <Col N="2152" /> on the excellent standard of the development plans drawn up.  They are a blueprint or reference to draw on for the future.</P>
    <P>It emerged, however, that many of the projects contained in the plans were deemed ineligible for EC Structural Funding because they would involve recurring or operational-type costs, e.g. wages, extra staff, fisheries protection, hatcheries, stocking and re-stocking, etc. Revised plans were later invited for the development of tourism angling which are being processed under the operational programme for tourism, details of which are expected to be announced shortly by my colleague the Minister for Tourism and Transport.</P>
    <P>The comprehensive development plans referred to earlier will be drawn on, on an ongoing basis, in accordance with the availability of funding from whatever source.  I will obviously be using my best endeavours to maximise such funding.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that his description of this as a Government exercise is very apt?  Would he acknowledge that he heightened expectations last year when he asked the fisheries boards to prepare specific plans? While it is understood that a small amount, £1.5 million over four years for the entire country, is being provided through Bord Fáilte for angling tourism projects, such moneys can only be expended on works such as access to fisheries.  Will the Minister acknowledge that many of the areas he discounts such as stocking, restocking and conservation are vital components in the development of inland fisheries?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree they are vital components but the decision-makers in Europe decided that they were not projects that could demand support from the EC Structural Funds.  That decision was not made here but in Europe.  My predecessor asked the regional boards and the Central Fisheries Board to prepare a plan and they were perfectly entitled to make the strongest possible pitch for support from Europe.  I made this point in <Col N="2153" /> answer to another question.  If expectations were heightened, I see absolutely nothing wrong with that.  The decision was made that these moneys were not available.  A scheme has been made out which will be very useful for the development of fisheries anyway.</P>
      <P>With regard to the specific tourism aspects of the question, a parliamentary question to another Minister would be in order.  Some people from my Department are in consultation with the Department of Tourism and Transport with regard to the specific questions the Deputy mentions.</P>

    <P>This amendment involves the substitution of section 6 in its entirety.  In deciding not to put forward a large number of draft amendments separately, I am mindful of the need to avoid distracting the House from the central issues arising.  I will be glad to deal with any questions Members may have on individual subsections.</P>
    <P>The principal substantive change involved in the provision for appeals is now contained in the new section 7, the insertion of which I will move when the House has finished its deliberation on this section.  Section 6 empowers the Minister to make building control regulations dealing with procedural, administrative and control arrangements to be operated <Col N="2206" /> to secure compliance with building regulations. There is power within this section for the Minister to apply different systerms of control to different kinds of building or to buildings in different areas if he so wishes.  This power gives the Minister a flexibility to apply either an approval type system of control, involving the submission of plans to building control authorities for their approval for the erection of individual buildings, or a self certification system based on certificates given by designated persons on their own responsibility, or a combination of both systems.  Provision is also made for the submission to a building control authority of an application for a fire safety certificate in respect of a building of a prescribed class such as high risk premises and places of public resort. This power is inserted in response to the recommendation of the Stardust Tribunal, that it would be undesirable for the fire-related parts of the building regulations to be subject to a self certification system of control.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1 to amendment No. 12:</P>
      <P>In subsection (2), to delete subparagraph (a) (i).</P>
      <P>I am aware, from reading the report of the debate on section 6 prior to the dissolution of the Dáil, that this amendment received quite a detailed airing at that stage.  It produced quite an interesting debate which ranged in its subject matter from the integrity and so on of professionals to deep considerations of ideology. What I would like to do is to get back to the basics of what this Bill is all about.  This is a Bill which provides for building regulations and in my view, it is long overdue.  It is essentially consumer legislation.  If it is to be meaningful it would have to give some degree of protection to the home buyer and to the owners and users of public buildings and ensure that the great majority of the public who use buildings in one way or another are protected against any kind of risk, bad design, bad workmanship, bad materials and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2207" /> Section 6 is the core of the Bill.  This is the section that provides for the kind of building control mechanism that is going to be put in place.  Essentially this is the section that answers the question as to who is going to say that a building has met the proper standards and has complied with the regulations that are set down under the other sections of the Bill. In theory, this section gives the Minister a range of options.  It gives him the option of self certification, of certification of fire safety, of local authority certification or of some combination of all of those.  In another section of the Bill there is provision for a building regulations advisory body.  I noticed from the debate prior to the dissolution of the Dáil that the general emphasis seemed to be that this building regulations advisory body would advise the Minister and he would decide what kind of certification would be appropriate at a particular time or in a particular area.</P>
    <P>That is the theory of the Bill but it is quite clear from the debate that took place on the Bill and from statements that have been made over a long period that what the Bill intends to do is to provide for self certification.  That is what this Bill is all about and that is what will emerge in practice if this section, which I am seeking to have deleted, remains in place.  Furthermore, it is intended that this system would apply universally throughout the country.  The fear has been expressed, and I repeat it, that this could result in the system of building control which exists in a number of local authorities being done away with and being replaced by a system of self certification. Therefore, the degree of building control, limited and all as it is, which exists in some local authority areas at present, including the largest areas, could be considerably watered down as a result of the passage of this section of the Bill.  Instead of the Bill actually tightening building control and giving better protection to house buyers and to the users of buildings, it could actually do the reverse in large areas of the country.</P>
    <P>The whole debate on this Bill is about <Col N="2208" /> the question of self certification.  What is wrong with self certification?  In the course of the debate that took place before the dissolution of the Dáil, a lot of suggestions and arguments were made which, quite honestly, do not stand up. Nobody is trying to impugn the integrity of an entire profession.  Nobody is&mdash;and certainly I am not &mdash; trying to suggest that the majority of architects or of any profession are going to willy nilly sign certificates of compliance that are inaccurate or that do not stand up.</P>
    <P>There is a principle here.  You do not ask somebody who designs a building and is responsible ultimately for the construction of that building to certify that the building complies with the regulations.  That is not impugning their professional integrity just as, for example, the Department of Social Welfare presumably are not impugning the professional integrity of doctors by insisting that qualification for disability benefit requires certification by doctors nominated by the Department of Social Welfare. It does not impugn the professional integrity of teachers, for example, that they are not allowed to correct the leaving certificate papers of their own pupils. It should not follow that the certificates of compliance in this case should be submitted by the people who are ultimately responsible for the building itself.  Self certification gives rise to problems and that has to be recognised at this stage. There is no point in saying that it might not be self certification in some cases; that it might be certification by the local authority.  It is quite clear from what has been said previously in the debate on this Bill that the intention is self certification.</P>
    <P>Considerable emphasis has been placed on the whole question of independence. Independent authorities are now the order of the day.  There seems to be general consensus in political circles that we need an independent environmental protection agency.  Why do we not have self certification with regard to environmental protection?  Why do we not ask various industries, farmers or certain professionals who might be engaged <Col N="2209" /> by them, to certify that they are complying with the regulations?  We insist, and correctly so, that there must be independent assessment and control.</P>
    <P>The third argument I would put forward is that what is proposed in the Bill is considerably out of line with the practice in other EC countries.  We have to anticipate the possible harmonisation of building control throughout the Community. Already in seven of the EC member countries, building control is exercised by the local authorities.  In the two countries where self certification applies, it applies in situations where there are very strict controls regarding insurance and so on.  What is being proposed here&mdash;a system of self certification &mdash; is very much out of line with what has been the practice in the rest of the European Community.  What I am proposing here is that the provision for self certification be deleted from this Bill.</P>

      <P>I would like to compliment Deputy Gilmore on having grasped the essence of the tortuous debate we had the last time we spoke in the House on this Bill and for admonishing us to try to get back to the basics of what the Bill is about.  It is a complex Bill and we all know that.  I think all of us would agree that if we were to write the Bill again in its entirety perhaps it could be improved. This is a Ford motor car that was made either on a Monday or a Friday but it is the only motor car that is in front of us and we have to deal with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The net point that Deputy Gilmore has raised in relation to section 6 &mdash;it is, as he has rightly said, the core of the Bill&mdash;is whether any Minister of the day should have the power to provide for some form of self certification.  The essence of the amendment in the name of Deputy Gilmore is that no Minister at any time in the future should have the power to provide for self certification.  Notwithstanding the merits, the demerits and all the other concerns that would make up the philosophy of whether there should or should not be self certification, to remove <Col N="2210" /> the possibility &mdash;in terms of law, a Minister of the day would have to provide such a provision with or without safeguards &mdash; seems at this point to be inadvisable. I will not be supporting this amendment because of its fundamental nature as indicated by Deputy Gilmore &mdash;indeed he has been consistent in this respect.  Some form of self certification should be an option at some point for some Minister for the Environment if all the necessary components and safegurads which are required are put in place.  This is an enabling provision.  The effect of the amendment of The Workers' Party spokesman on the Environment would be to, <i>inter alia,</i> remove absolutely the power of any form of self certification. The amendment is too extreme and I will be opposing it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to reply to my colleague, Deputy Quinn.  If this section simply proposed giving the Minister for the Environment the power to have self certification, in certain limited circumstances, exercised from time to time or whatever, and introduced a degree of flexibility into the system, I would not be too concerned about it.  However, we cannot look at what is in the Bill outside of the context of what has been said about it during the entire debate and what the intention of it clearly is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite clear that the intention in this section of the Bill is to introduce a system of self certification which will be the primary instrument used to give effect to building control.  It is a little misleading to suggest that the provision for self certification is some kind of an adjunct to the general provisions of the Bill and which can be exercised from time to time. It has been made crystal clear &mdash; this is my reading of the debate which took place before the adjournment of the Dáil &mdash; that the central method by which it is intended building control will be exercised under this Bill is through the system of self certification.  In other words, a competent professional or whoever has designed a house, is responsible for the building of it and so on, would also be the person who would be able to say <Col N="2211" />&ldquo;this building is fine&rdquo;.  That principle is not acceptable in commercial life.  If it was accepted in commercial life, why do building societies, when they are approving a loan for somebody buying a house, decide they will not automatically accept the word of the professional representing the people selling the house? They send out their own surveyors to inspect the house and insist that everything is correctly monitored, that standards are met, that there will be value for money and so on.</P>
    <P>The principle being enshrined in this section is very dangerous.  It will expose people who are buying homes to buying products which are sub-standard against which they will have no comeback. Under a later section of this Bill once a local authority take in a certificate of compliance and file it away one cannot take any action against them.  These people will have no worth-while come-back if a certificate of compliance does not properly ensure that a building meets the required standards.</P>
    <P>We are talking about very serious matters; we are talking about buildings and structures which should last for hundreds of years.  It is only right that the regulations under which those buildings are constructed should be properly monitored by an outside body and that the people who say &ldquo;yes, this building is fine and meets the regulations which have been laid down&rdquo; should be removed and should not have any vested interest or professional interest in the building.  I have no doubt that the professionals will, of course, comply with their professional ethics but we know very well that there are people in every profession who cut corners.  We know very well also that in a highly competitive business such as the construction industry the temptation is always there to go for the lowest common denominator.  When one professional goes for the lowest common denominator it brings down the whole tone of the regulations.</P>
    <P>The certificate stating that a building meets the requirements of the regulations should be issued by the local authority. <Col N="2212" /> This is the system being used in the majority of member states of the European Community.  If at some future time there proves to be some difficulties with the system it will be open to any Minister to bring in an amendment to correct the problem.  We will be building up trouble if we base the entire building control system on the principle of &ldquo;I am designing the building and putting it up and if I say the regulations are right then they are right&rdquo;.  That is an incorrect way to proceed in regard to building control.  Too many people in housing estates bought their homes with their life's savings, and very often their future earnings, only to find out later that something was seriously wrong with the premises.  There are many examples of public buildings and buildings of one kind or another which have shown up defects after a number of years.  No doubt those buildings were designed and examined by professionals&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not deny it.  I am not suggesting that we will ever get a 100 per cent guarantee that the regulations will be complied with but we have to strive towards this aim so far as possible. We are far less likely to get this guarantee if we rely on the people who have an immediate professional and sometimes vested interest in the building being constructed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the difficulties in this area is that it is very easy to articulate the problem but there is a number of possible solutions.  Deputy Quinn and Deputy Gilmore in their exchange illustrated the nature of the problem.  The buildings we have had problems with in the past possibly did not have the type of building control we would like to see in place.  It is easy to criticise this Bill as not doing a variety of things some of us would like to see done and to produce some other methodology whereby things might be approached but the reality is that we <Col N="2213" /> are talking about buildings where controls, for want of a better word, were lacking in both the private and the public sector, where there were by-law approvals, the planning conditions inserted were complied with and the professionals in both public and private authorities were involved, but which at the end of the day gave rise to problems. There is a variety of buildings which have given rise to difficulties, some of which the State took over on a long term basis from private developers and which we could refer to here.</P>
      <P>The difficulty arises in providing the necessary controls to ensure a particular standard is maintained and the various necessary steps taken with regard to constructing the building and then to ensure that the job is being done properly.  There is an interaction there between the public and private sectors.</P>
      <P>I am concerned with self-certification in the context of it resulting in local authorities, who currently exercise a control, not being able to properly monitor what is happening and not being able to exercise the necessary control.  I am concerned that there is a possibility that this could end up being legislation which gives the appearance of providing a greater protection to the general public and the consumer without doing so.  Amendments Nos. 5 and 12 are being discussed together and in that regard the approach suggested by Deputy Gilmore is correct. I do not wish to go into the detail of those amendments now but if we were tied to taking amendments Nos. 1 to 14 in a conglomerate fashion we would descend into linguistic chaos.  It would be better to deal with each one and tease it out. However, where there is an interaction it is relevant to point that out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 5 is designed to ensure that the individuals involved in the designing and construction of the building are not the people who do the necessary certification.  The Minister may not want to accept the exact phraseology of that amendment but he should bear in mind that the idea is to ensure that those involved in the construction or design of a building should not carry out the <Col N="2214" /> certification.  If the Minister was willing to take on board that type of approach we would get over the problem referred to by Deputy Gilmore in the context of a Minister putting into operation the power that the new section 6 would give with regard to self-certification.  If we take this a stage further and take amendment No. 12 which may not necessarily be greeted with enthusiam by local authorities, we would be giving the consumer, if that is the person we are concerned about, a great deal more protection than is envisaged in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill effectively excludes the local authority from being under any statutory duty to ensure that a building has been erected in the way certified and my amendment No. 12 would have the opposite effect and would result in subsection (4) reading as follows:</P>
    <P>... the building control authority shall be under a duty to any person to&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) ensure that the building or works to which the certificate or notice relates will, either during the course of the work or when completed, comply with the requirements of building regulations or be free from any defect.</P>
    <P>(b) ensure that the certificate of compliance complies with the requirements of this Act ...</P>
    <P>I have reservations about the way that section is constructed.  If one takes self-certification as being certification by the designer or the person involved in the construction of the building, and one then takes it that thereafter the local authority are under no particular duty, I am not sure where the real protection is for the consumer.  If the building control sections in local authorities are to operate in a way that is meaningful to the person who purchases the building &mdash; we will come to the problem of domestic dwellings later &mdash; or for a person who is using a building or, indeed, for a person who might walk below a building that is likely to fall into the street, it would seem to me that there is not a lot of merit in subsection (4) which appears to say that the building control authority is not under <Col N="2215" /> a duty to do a variety of things which to my mind it should be under a duty to do. Admittedly, that would put an onerous responsibility on the local authority but it would ensure that a very real protection exists.  It would remove many of the worries people have in the context of self-certification, because it clearly ceases to be a self-certification.  The local authority have a specific duty to maintain an ongoing monitoring role.</P>
    <P>There are different ways of dealing with the issue Deputy Gilmore has raised and the way Fine Gael are proposing to deal with it is in the context of amendments Nos. 5 and 12.  There are other amendments that interact with this but amendments Nos. 5 and 12 are central to this discussion.  I would be interested to hear the Minister's response to amendment No. 1, in the name of Deputy Gilmore, and Nos. 5 and 12 in my name.</P>

      <P>I am pleased that Deputies have expressed their pleasure that the Bill is before the House again.  I hope we can dispose of it on this occasion.  That is my aim and I seek the co-operation of the Deputies to achieve it.  It might be useful at this time if I gave an overview of this section seeing that it is some time since we spoke about the control and enforcement procedures in the Bill.  When the Bill was last discussed in Committee we had a lively debate in relation to different options for control systems proposed in section 6.  From an examination of the transcript of that debate it appears that there is some confusion in relation to this section, and related matters, provided for in the Bill.  I should like to explain the thinking underlying the control mechanisms that are proposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first point I wish to emphasise is that section 6 can only be understood in the context of the Bill as a whole.  I can best illustrate this in the following way. Let us assume that section 6 was deleted from the Bill and ask ourselves what would be left to promote observance of the building regulations.  Firstly, there is the fact that contravention of the building <Col N="2216" /> regulations is a criminal offence and, in addition, the Bill sets up building control authorities with powers of inspection, enforcement and prosecution under sections 7, 10 and 15.</P>
    <P>Most of the legislative codes for which I am responsible operate perfectly well within a similar legislative framework and without the type of additional control mechanisms envisaged in section 6.  It is clear, therefore, that the control powers in this section are additional to, and not a prerequisite for, substantial control and enforcement powers in the other sections to which I have just referred.</P>
    <P>Section 6 is the enabling power for making building control regulations.  I readily acknowledge that the range of options proposed is wide but, as Deputy Quinn has pointed out, this framework legislation will probably have to last for some considerable time.  I pointed that out on the last occasion we debated the Bill and that was accepted by all.  It would be unfortunate if the Minister of the day was to be unduly confined in relation to the type of control system that might be appropriate to the building industry at different times in the future.</P>
    <P>Again, I should like to bring home the point that whatever the building regulations may contain, any approval of certification procedures will be in addition to the powers of inspection, enforcement and prosecution given to building control authorities by other sections of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Essentially, the three options are proposed in paragraphs 6 (2), (a), (i), (ii) and (iii).  Provision for self-certification is made in paragraph (a) (i) and this system centres around a large measure of self-regulation by the industry itself.  Third party certification, involving certification of the design and construction of the building by an independent or appropriately qualified person is also possible under this provision.  Third party certification is an independent form of self-regulation of the industry.  The other main option is set out in paragraph (a) (iii) and is based on an interventionist-type role for the building control authority in relation to the design or the construction of the building, or both.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2217" /> This proposal is broadly similar to the system of control applicable in those local authorities which operate building by-laws. It would involve the submission of plans and other information to the building control authority for approval and the approval of this authority could also be required in respect of the completed building.  Let me say here that I do not envisage an approval system by the building control authority for the construction of buildings.  I find it difficult to visualise a situation where such a system would ever be required for all buildings but a situation could arise at some future stage where an approval system might be desirable for the construction of some class of building or some new building techniques.</P>
    <P>The last control mechanism is the fire safety certificate procedure provided for in subparagraph (a) (ii).  This would involve the submission of an application to the control authority for approval on the fine aspects of the design of certain buildings before commencement of the work.  The insertion of this provision arises directly from the recommendation of the Stardust Tribunal.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides for the combination of the above control systems in relation to different buildings in different areas.  That said, Deputy Gilmore suggested it would be a mistake to have the people who design and build buildings certify that they comply with the regulations. Of course, he misses the point. These are exactly the people who should carry the responsibility for certifying that the job has been done correctly.  To have somebody else do the certifying would be to remove from the designer and the builder the responsibility for the building which has been built.  I welcome Deputy Quinn's support for the concept of self-certification which he quite rightly pointed out is just one of the options available to the Minister under the legislation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore also placed much emphasis on his concern about sub-standard buildings.  I think that this concern will be allayed by giving building control authorities the enforcement <Col N="2218" /> powers under sections 7 to 10 to take action in the case of buildings not being built in conformity with the building regulations. There was much discussion on the last occasion on the possibility that builders will cut corners.  I hope we will not get into that line of argument on this occasion.  I do not want to repeat myself, but as far as I am concerned the vast majority of builders do the job in accordance with specifications and do it well. They will only be able to continue it business as long as they have good quality work as their trade mark.  I do not believe that anything in this Bill will expose home buyers to the possibility of buying a sub-standard building.</P>
    <P>In regard to housing, I would like to point out to Deputy Gilmore that there are already controls in place on most houses by way of the structural guaranted scheme.  There are certain controls it place so far as the payment of house grants is concerned.  Department inspec tors carry out inspections before grants are paid.  Therefore, there are sufficient safeguards in place in that area.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore suggested, by implication, that all legislative codes are based on an interventionist type role for public authorities.  This is not so.  With the exception of the planning code, action of this kind is not required under most other local government legislation, such as the Road Traffic Acts.  No one is obliged to have their new car examined by a local authority before they are allowed to drive it on the road for the first time.  Nobody is suggesting that should be the case. fail to see therefore why local authorities should, as Deputy Gilmore suggests have to approve the design of all buildings before they are constructed.  This is no necessary under the present system which has not been found to be wanting in the past.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter really referred to his own amendment, amendment No. 5, it so far as third party certification is concerned. That was his principal point.  It seems that the effect of that amendment would be to replace the concept of self-certification with what I would call a third party certification system.  In other <Col N="2219" /> words, a person would not be entitled to certify compliance with building regulations if he was personally involved in the design or construction of the building in question.  I would point out that the amended section 6 would enable the introduction of either a self-certification or a third party certification system, or even a combination of both.</P>
    <P>I would be reluctant to embrace the concept of third party certification, particularly if this would involve the exclusion of self-certification.  There are a number of reasons for this.  First, third party certification would impose a layer of cost similar to that pertaining to the local authority approval system and the costs of third party certification would fall directly upon the construction industry, while a local authority approval system would be paid for either by way of general taxation charge or by way of a system of fees which, again, would be borne by the industry itself.  The central point is that costs of a similar order would arise under both systems.  The extent to which one system would be less expensive than the other would presumably depend only on the relative efficiency with which they were administered.  Second, the delays in starting up construction projects, which would be obviated by self-certification, would to a greater or lesser extent arise under the third party oriented system.</P>
    <P>Finally, even if I were to accept that third party certification ought to be introduced in respect of certain complex or sensitive buildings, it is obvious that the less complex type of building or extension could quite adequately be catered for within a self-certification system.  I am not therefore prepared to agree to the amendment which would have the effect of precluding a self-certification system. It would be better to refer the whole question of building regulations to the advisory body referred to by Deputy Gilmore. For that reason we should proceed in the way outlined in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister respond to amendment No. 12, to which I referred, when he has a moment to do <Col N="2220" /> so?  Let me raise one question with him with regard to buildings.  In referring to the new section 6, in particular subsection (2) (a) (ii) which deals with the position in relation to fire safety certificates in respect of a building or buildings of a prescribed class or classes and so on, in the context of grants, the Minister said that the local authorities check out the domestic houses concerned.  I am not sure how comprehensive that checking out is; in most instances it is merely a question of checking whether the house has been built as opposed to checking out the type of thing referred to in this Bill.  Perhaps the Minister would clarify the intention with regard to domestic dwellings, that is domestic dwellings in private ownership and domestic houses built by local authorities. In a sense here we have a conundrum of the local authority possibly checking the local authority.</P>
      <P>Two incidents which occurred within the last ten days give rise to immediate concern.  It was only on Monday week last that a three storey Dublin corporation house went on fire in the Summerhill district of Dublin, and two young children had a very tragic death, trapped on the third floor of a corporation house without anyone being able to gain access to them. Because of the way that house was built the third floor was a fire trap.  I visited these houses and I have no doubt that if there was a fire on the second floor of any of the houses in Summerhill, cutting off access to the third floor, once the stairs were affected by fire, no one, neither an adult nor child, would escape. There is a problem for people who are trying to provide help gaining access to those on the third floor, and there is also the problem that those who find themselves trapped would be unable to get out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of this Bill what is being done to ensure that that type of problem will not arise in future local authority buildings?  What role will the fire authority who are here doubling up with the local authority, have?  This Bill will deal with building control in the sense of buildings that are built in the future, <Col N="2221" /> though there are certain matters of relevance to older buildings.  From what I have seen of Summerhill and the rather crass reaction of Dublin Corporation which was to announce that there is nothing wrong with those houses, there is a very real problem with them.  As a result of that fire, all local authorities should be asked to review the safety provisions with regard to possible fires in all three storey local authority dwellings and Dublin Corporation should be asked to do so as a matter of urgency.  If there is another fire in another three storey local authority dwelling which results in tragic deaths, everyone will ask why Members of this House did nothing to get the local authorities to put fire safety provisions in place.</P>
    <P>Dealing with the fire authority in the context of whatever regulations the Minister envisages here, what will be done to ensure that local authority houses will be built in such a way that these people will be able to escape a fire; what will be done to ensure that the materials used in the building of these houses will prevent fire spreading rapidly with a view to preventing loss of life?  Last night in my constituency there was another tragedy resulting in the loss of lives of young children in a fire in a private dwelling in Marley Grove, Rathfarnham.  I am concerned at the speed with which fire enveloped that building.  What controls will this legislation put in place in the context of private dwellings?  There is a rumour that what is being done in this legislation will not affect the ordinary domestic dwelling.  I am raising that simply in the context of the Minister making reference to section 6(2)(a)(ii) in which buildings of a prescribed class or classes are included.  This obviously means other buildings will be excluded. Perhaps the Minister could respond to amendment No. 12.</P>

We can then get on to some of the other sections, including section 10 which deals with some of the concerns we all have.</P>

      <P>Since Deputy Gilmore's amendment is a very fundamental one proposing to eliminate the whole section, it might facilitate structured debate in the light of what Deputy Shatter asked for at the outset.

      <P>The House is at liberty to change its mind. If there is a new proposal now that we exclude from what has already been agreed amendment No. 1 in the name of Deputy Gilmore, get that out of the way and then proceed to discuss all the subsequent amendments, and not put any question until all contributions have been made, that seems to be a reasonable request.  We can proceed to do that now when Deputy Gilmore has concluded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with that procedure because some of my subsequent <Col N="2223" /> amendments anticipate what might happen to amendment No. 1.  The amendment is about a central principle contained in this Bill.  I do not propose to repeat what has already been said, but if we go back to the starting point and take this from the perspective of somebody buying a house, it is not clear that domestic dwellings will be covered under this Bill.  That is something we can come to later but if domestic dwellings are covered, a person buys a house and a few years later finds something seriously wrong with the drainage system or a major structural fault, or if there is a fire, what is his comeback?  What if he finds that the building did not comply with the building regulations?</P>
      <P>The Minister says there will be a certificate of compliance lodged by the appropriate person with the local authority and that we should not absolve the person who lodged the certificate from responsibility.  Suppose the person in question looks for the person who lodged the certificate and is gone, since there is no provision in the Bill for insurance, he does not have any comeback in that sense.  Under section 6 (4) he can go to the local authority because since the local authority lodged the certificate of compliance they must have some responsibility for it, and they can point out that under section 6 (4) of the Bill the local authority shall not be under a duty to any person for any of the matters covered in it.</P>
      <P>The Minister says there is the structural guarantee scheme.  I have yet to meet a house buyer who has had a satisfactory experience with that scheme but I have met several people who have found it very difficult to have their problems redressed under it because there are considerable delays; so I do not think the structural guarantee scheme is going to be a great deal of comfort to somebody in that situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has just admitted that the system of approval by local authorities will apply only in very limited circumstances. He goes on to say that <Col N="2224" /> the local authorities will have responsibilities in the areas of prosecution and enforcement which seems to contradict what had been said at an earlier stage, that the whole business of building control regulations would involve enormous costs for the local authorities and would be very unwieldy requiring a large number of staff and many inspections. One is going to have that if one is to give effect to the Bill from the point of view of prosecution and enforcement.</P>
    <P>In fact if one looks at the overall situation, the local authorities that operate the existing building control by-laws actually cover 40 per cent of all construction in the country.  One is not actually expanding the role of the local authorities to a great degree in that sense.</P>
    <P>In relation to the idea of third party certification, even though the option will remain in the Bill, the Minister seems to effectively rule it out because of the additional costs he talked about.  We are back to the idea of self certification; he who designs and builds the building says that the building is okay.  It is a peculiar adaptation, some kind of Flynn variation of Confucian law; but it will give very little comfort to people who are buying houses.</P>

      <P>That brings me to Deputy Shatter's amendment.  This <Col N="2226" /> would have a rather bizarre effect.  On the one hand he seems to be saying that he cannot support my amendment to remove self certification but the effect of his other amendment is in fact to shift the responsibility onto the local authority. The effect of this amendment would make the local authorities responsible for the certificates of compliance which are submitted to them.  One would then have a situation where the certificates of compliance were supported on a self certification basis but the local authority would have to carry the can for the consequences. It seems to me that if the local authority are going to have to carry the can they will have to carry out inspections and so on to make sure they are not exposing themselves to any liability or risk.  In those circumstances it would be logical for the local authority to be the body giving the approval.  This amendment is central to the whole Bill.</P>

      <P>I have been looking at what is before us and I am reminded &mdash; it is often unwise to depart from normal procedure &mdash; that, perhaps, the House would agree that the most expeditious way of dealing with the business before us would be to look at the Minister's amendment and proceed down through it, paragraph by paragraph, applying whichever amendment is appropriate en route and that at the end of those discussions on the amendments there would be a discussion on the new section.

That might be the best way to do it.  It may not be necessary to dissect every sub-division of the Minister's proposed new section 6. Obviously we will discuss some parts of it as we go through the various amendments.  I think that would be a speedier way of doing it, in other words, we would come to amendments 1 to 14 and we would then know if there are any particular portions of those that the Minister is willing to incorporate into his amendment. In a sense we would know what the final version of the new section 6 is going to be.  That might be an easier way of dealing <Col N="2229" /> with it.

      <P>In the seventh and eighth lines of subsection (2) (a) (iii), to delete &ldquo;the building or works in the opinion of the building control authority, comply&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;in the opinion of the building control authority the design or construction of the buildings or works comply&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In moving this amendment I would like to note that, as far as the Labour Party are concerned, we have no problem with the proposed amended section 6 (2) (a) (ii) because my amendment pertains to paragraph (iii) of subsection (2) (a).  In essence that amendment is an effort to separate the principle of the design and the construction of the buildings.  The House will recall that when we debated this issue earlier we were trying to make a clear distinction between those people responsible for the design of a building and those people responsible for the construction and provide a clear legislative understanding and definition whereby accountability and responsibility in relation to undertakings given by a team of designers, or one designer, for compliance with the building regulations, in respect of the design of a building, would be compartmentalised and certified accordingly, or evaluated by the building <Col N="2230" /> control authority as being in accordance with the building regulations.  In other words, would a package of drawings submitted to the building control section of a local authority, if examined by that local authority, stand up to scrutiny and be certified as complying with the design standards as set down in the building regulations and that the liability of the design team could be clearly identified and accounted for?</P>
    <P>In the event of the package of design drawings, structural, mechanical and electrical, not satisfying the design requirements of the building regulations, the building authority or any other third party investigating the documentation, could clearly say that the building was not designed in accordance with the regulations. The intention is to separate that from how it may subsequently be constructed. While the design team may design strictly in accordance with the building regulations, as they currently stand, or as they may be altered from time to time, there is no guarantee that the same design team that designed the package of drawings will necessarily be involved in the construction, that all the same team will be involved in the construction or, indeed, that any of them will be involved in the construction.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding whether they will be involved, it is simply not possible or feasible for somebody to certify that work done by other people to drawings which they had prepared has been done strictly in accordance with the way in which they were designed.  That is one of the major concerns of the design profession. The converse must be true also, that the construction industry are prepared to take on responsibility for that over which they have control.  To take on responsibility for work that will be carried out by somebody else, and over whom one would not have direct control, is to add an impossible burden.  The essence behind the language contained in that amendment which separates the words &ldquo;design&rdquo; and &ldquo;construction&rdquo; from the building is to give effect to that concern. I recommend it to the House.</P>

However, some of them seem on occasion to have a vested interest in excluding other organisations involving people with similar skills and expertise such as the Irish Architects' Society.  Will the Minister clarify the classes of persons he has in mind as I am anxious to ensure that people who are fully and properly qualified to operate this legislation in the certification area are not subsequently excluded following regulations made as to who people who can certify should be?  They could find themselves excluded because of the power exercised by any particular lobby group of professionals in this area.  Perhaps the Minister will clarify that?</P>

      <P>A &ldquo;person&rdquo; can be a body corporate under the interpretation Acts and we should bear that in mind in the reference here to &ldquo;persons&rdquo;.  To confine approved certifiers to classes of persons, which would be the effect of omitting &ldquo;persons&rdquo; as proposed, would unduly restrict the Minister in designating certifiers who would be approved for the purpose of signing certificates of compliance with the building regulations.  In effect, that is looking for a closed shop and it would mean that before a person could be designated as an approved certifier he or she would have to belong to some particular class such as architects or engineers or be a member of one of the other professional building organisations. This would not only be unacceptable but impractical and restrictive, particularly in a broad enabling Bill. Deputies should try to remember that we are not talking about something confined to high rise buildings or big conurbations, we are also talking about rural areas and the whole spectrum of building development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the word &ldquo;persons&rdquo; is omitted, I could be in the ridiculous situation of making up a class of persons to cover one <Col N="2233" /> or two people whom I consider are fully competent to sign certificates of compliance. At this point let me assure the House that it is far from my intention to designate persons as certifiers if they do not have the required competence.  I will, however, ask the Building Regulations Advisory Body to advise me as to the persons or classes of persons who would, in their opinion, be competent to sign certificates of compliance in respect of different types of buildings.  I can envisage a situation where the additional degree of competence of a particular group of persons would have a significant bearing on the range and complexity of works which they would be permitted to certify.  It is with that in mind and covering the whole spectrum and variations of classes of persons and different qualifications as applied throughout the whole country that I ask the Deputies to leave it as it is.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course the key to this and to the approach that may be taken with regard to, for example, individual architects who might not be formal members of any particular group will depend on the representation on the Building Regulations Advisory Body, in other words, if there is a difficulty as to who will be appointed to that body and to what extent they will be representative of a cross-section of individuals who may have the necessary experience and qualifications to certify.  If they are only representative of individuals on a limited number of organisations there is a danger that the Building Regulations Advisory Body might advise the Minister that certain people should be excluded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an interaction here.  We can tease this out further on section 13 of the Bill.  I do not want to dwell unnecessarily on it now.  However, there are two concerns here.  One is the concern of the individual who is well qualified and who is not a member of any particular group and the other is the interaction between different groups, some of whom would regard their membership as being possibly better qualified or superior to other groups.  I will not get into inter-wrangling <Col N="2234" /> between different professional bodies as I am sure the Minister has had a plethora of correspondence in regard to this legislation. On the other hand, there is the concern that a particular person might be picked out and certified as an appropriate person and that a Minister may do so in circumstances that may not be appropriate. There may not be a great deal of reality to that issue.  Nevertheless, this amendment was tabled in order to tease out that problem.  The advice the Minister receives as to who the certifiers should be may be determined largely by the representative nature of the advisory group the Minister appoints to advise him on the regulations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy makes the case for me.  That is the reason I want total flexibility &mdash; to cater precisely for the person about whom the Deputy speaks, who might not be in favour in a particular month with a particular group, a group to which he might in normal circumstances belong but who would be a perfectly suitable and competent person to certify.  I want him included as well and I sought total flexibility to allow me to do so. Individuals can be suitable.  I would expect that they would be part and parcel of the certifying process if and when that comes to pass.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5 to amendment No. 12:</P>
      <P>In the first line of subsection (2) (c), after &ldquo;classes of persons&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;other than the person or classes of persons responsible for the design or construction of the building concerned&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a sense we discussed this amendment in the context of amendment No. 1.  Of course Deputy Gilmore and the Minister were right in saying that this was moving away from self-certification to third party certification and was approaching the <Col N="2235" /> problem from a different route from that taken by Deputy Gilmore.  The Minister's main objection seemed to be the cost factor.  My concern is two-fold: self-certification may be acceptable in the context of the building control authority &mdash; in effect the local authority &mdash; having the type of specific functions to carry out checks such as are referred to in amendment No. 14 to amendment No. 12 tabled by Deputy Gilmore and myself, and also in the context of the local authority carrying out all necessary checks if they are under statutory obligation to do so, as I envisage will be the case in the amendment made to the Minister's section 6(4) My problem is that the Minister has not responded to amendment No. 12, which is the one that affects section 6(4).  I am assuming at this point that, in a sense, he is not prepared to allow a local authority to play such a role that could result in possibly their being sued at a later stage if a building does not comply with the regulations in circumstances in which the local authority have accepted a certification.</P>
    <P>The cost factor is an element in this, but to my mind, in the context of a building built, the safety factor is a greater one.  I do not foresee any great difficulty, if a premises is built and there are certain specifications that have to be complied with, in a third party carrying out necessary inspections to be able to certify.  In a sense that happens every day of the week.  Suppose someone is a first-time house buyer, or is buying any type of house, new house, second-hand house, whatever, any sensible lawyer would advise a client buying a property to get their own architect or surveyor to check it out.  The same thing will apply if somebody is purchasing a block of flats or an industrial building.  Any decent lawyer will tell a client going to invest large sums of money in a property to get it checked out by his or her surveyor and/or architect; to make sure that planning permission has been obtained, that the planning conditions have been complied with; to ensure there is by-law <Col N="2236" /> approval and that all the necessary specifications with regard to that building have been complied with.  It happens every day of the week.  That third person doing that introduces a degree of independence. They have no particular vested interest in finding that a building has or has not been built properly; their only interest in it is to protect the purchaser.  There is not a major expense involved.  There may be major expense involved if one is purchasing a very expensive building but in most cases the expense is comparable to the price being paid.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that the Minister would have a view that where one builds a relatively uncomplicated, simple structure, the architect or surveyor involved in its design and construction should have an intimate knowledge of its design or construction and should then be able to certify. Equally I do not understand why a third party cannot do the job, in a sense providing that additional protection.  I do not see the cost that would be incurred as all that large in the overall context of what is involved in the acquisition of the building.  I should like to tease this out further with the Minister because it is as if there is something impossible or unusual in a third party intervening in this way.  In the marketplace at present, in other circumstances, this is something that happens on a regular basis.  Indeed, currently in the context of the draft building regulations, it is something that happens to assure somebody acquiring a building that the draft regulations have been complied with.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Shatter's amendment to amendment No. 12. Given the fate of my first amendment and the manner in which the principle of certification is to be dealt with, this would be a reasonable approach to take.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I noted what the Minister said earlier &mdash; he felt that the cost element would constitute a problem.  I do not see that. There will be a cost element involved in certification anyway.  Even in the process of self certification I cannot imagine any of the professions doing it for nothing, so there will be a cost element involved <Col N="2237" /> anyway.  If there is an additional cost in having it done on a third party basis, that additional cost would be marginal given the type of money, the value of property and so on about which we are speaking. There are also many precedents for it. Somebody buying a house will pay a lot of money to people in Deputy Shatter's profession to ensure that the title and so on are in order.  If there are costs involved &mdash; for example, costs for the builder or whoever, in getting a third party to certify &mdash; those costs, having regard to the total value of the property and the issues about which we are speaking, will be fairly marginal.</P>
    <P>Additionally, I would have thought that the professions involved would be keen on having it done on a third party basis.  I cannot imagine there would be too many people in the professions concerned madly keen to self certify if there were a system of third party certification.</P>
    <P>For all of those reasons the Minister should give serious consideration to this amendment.  If he were to do so it would allay many of the fears I expressed earlier in the day when proposing my earlier amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I might add my voice to support what is an enabling provision. Among the range of supervisory options open to him, the Minister of the day in giving effect to the building regulations, should give an option to the industry and the consumer to say that if a particular designer or constructor does not want to certify that the building has been built in accordance with the building regulations a third person, other than the local building authority, provided they were deemed to be suitably qualified, could certify.  My one reservation &mdash; on which the Minister might give his opinion &mdash; is whether the precise wording of Deputy Shatter's amendment would exclude the possibility of self certification and require exclusively third party certification.  That is the way I read it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that is fundamental.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Logically I would not be <Col N="2238" /> in favour of that.  I would be in favour of a provision whereby a given team of designers could request somebody else to certify that a building had been properly designed, or the construction industry could ascertain whether the builder wanted to do so.  I do not think it should be exclusively one or the other but I see some merit in making provision for one or the other as comprising part of the range of options of the Minister of the day when he comes to drawing up the regulations.  If the legal interpretation is that it does exclude self certification, then I am not in favour of the precise wording of this amendment.  But I would recommend the principle of the provision in some form to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>That just about sums it up. Deputy Shatter's amendment rules out self certification entirely and allows third party certification only.  That is what the amendment is about.  Deputy Quinn is right in saying that both options are available to the Minister under the legislation, both third party certification and self certification. There are costs but one cannot specify them in great detail here.  The costs arising under the self certification system would not be additional as the same person who designed and constructed the building would certify it.  I am at a loss to understand why Deputy Gilmore should seek to impose costs on ordinary persons.  An engineer or builder constructing a single house or an extension to a house in the country should be entitled to certify it himself rather than incur the increased cost of bringing in an outside person.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 6 in the name of Deputy Shatter.  Amendment No. 7 is related and these amendments may be discussed together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 6 to amendment No. 12:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2239" /> In subsection 2, to delete paragraph (h).</P>
    <P>This amendment relates to subsection (2) (h) in the Minister's proposed section 6, which confers a discretion on the Minister to make provision for the charging of fees for the registration of certificates of compliance, the submission of applications for fire safety certificates or certificates of approval, the provision of copies of certificates or other documents or extracts therefrom, the carrying out of inspections and tests and the testing of samples taken pursuant to section 10 and any other matter that the Minister considers appropriate.  The amendment is tabled because we have taken the view that it is not appropriate that the authority should charge fees for these functions, which are part and parcel of what the building control authority will have to do to ensure that the obligations imposed on them under the legislation are exercised.  The Minister objected to the proposal with regard to third party certification on the basis that it would involve unnecessary additional cost.  In this context where a statutory obligation is conferred on a building control authority the general public should not have to pay to get those functions performed. This is what the subsection appears to envisage.  It is our view that this is inappropriate and that subsection (2) (h) should be deleted from the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot concede to the Deputy since his amendment would preclude the charging of fees for work arising for the building control authority.  One of the main attractions of the self-certification system is that the costs arising for the building industry will be minimised and I will take full account of that in determining the level of fees, if any, which would arise for the registration of certificates of compliance.  Considerable resources would be required to operate an approval-type certification system by building control authorities and I cannot envisage any circumstances where this <Col N="2240" /> type of system could be put in place without the consequent imposition of fees. Fees are charged for planning applications, for example, and most people accept that a public service must be paid for.  In this instance fees would be a fairer method than a charge on general taxation. I do not envisage establishing a system of this type in the near future and I do not envisage anything more than a modest fee for the provision of copies of certificates or similar matters.  It is inherently reasonable that some charge should be made for the service.  It is necessary to take power to charge for inspections and tests pursuant to section 10 as building control authorities might have to go to considerable expense in the process of carrying out inspections and tests, some of which can be quite complex, and which may be occasioned due to errors or omissions on the part of a designer of a building.  In those circumstances it is reasonable to have this type of fee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to speak about my own amendment but let us deal first with paragraph (h), the principle of which is the charging of fees by the local authority. In so far as such fees represent a form of direct taxation I have no fundamental problem since they are levied on the prospective beneficiaries or agents of the beneficiaries of the service provided. It would be contradictory for me to adopt any other position since I, as Minister of State, was responsible for bringing in planning application fees and the like.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite prepared to take responsibility for the good and the bad things done during my time in office.  I lost some friends along the way but I think they may have come back.  We must distinguish between a specific additional service provided to the benefit of a person by the local authority and a service that a local authority would normally provide <Col N="2241" /> as part of basic administration.  I am not opposed to the principle of charging fees, but I suggest that there should not be a charge for the registration of a certificate of compliance.  To impose such a charge would be mean and inconsistent.  Planning permission application fees will be charged anyway, as well as some form of building by-law fees.  A charge for the registration of a certificate is unacceptable in principle.</P>
      <P>My amendment would propose to alter the wording of subsection (2) (h) (iv) which deals with the carrying out of inspections and tests and the testing of samples taken pursuant to section 10.  I am proposing to insert the words &ldquo;reasonably required&rdquo; after the word &ldquo;tests&rdquo;.  Theoretically there could be an hysterical reaction by some people to a building considered by them as third parties to be grossly in breach of the building regulations.  They could persuade a local authority to avail of the powers under section 10 to conduct a series of fundamental tests which might involve cutting concrete slabs in order to examine foundations when such tests might not be reasonably required.  The law has to give some protection against vexatious interventions in the building process.  Here again I am being consistent in relation to our planning law.  There is provision in the amendments to the original planning and development legislation with regard specifically to An Bord Pleanála for a mechanism whereby a vexatiously motivated intervention could be prevented. The proposed addition of &ldquo;reasonably required&rdquo;, which ultimately will be a matter for a court to determine if there is dispute in relation to it, is an attempt to provide some sort of balance and I am offering it in that context.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I am amused to hear the Minister, so soon after admonishing me about wishing to increase the costs to house builders and to a typical constituent of his own who might be putting on an extension to his bungalow, so stoutly defending the charging of fees here.  However, I am happy to say that on this occasion I agree with him.  Local <Col N="2242" /> authorities have certain functions that they will have to carry out under this Bill. It is correct that the industry should make a contribution to that, provided of course the charges are reasonable.</P>
      <P>I do not agree with Deputy Quinn's first amendment.  Although it is simply a question of registering the certificate of compliance, the registration of that certificate of compliance should involve certain additional responsibilities for the local authority.  Both Deputy Shatter and I have amendments down which deal with the building control authorities carrying out checks, inspections and so on, again which will involve costs and staffing for local authorities.  Modest scales of fees are appropriate in these circumstances and I have no problem with that.  I agree that there should be a system of charging fees and on this occasion I am not supporting Deputy Shatter's amendment. Nor will I be supporting Deputy Quinn's first amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>On occasions one has to conceal one's amusement at the different approaches taken to different issues. Listening to Deputy Gilmore you would think that The Workers' Party had never opposed charges of any description which pay for local authority services.  Of course this is the sort of charge The Workers' Party like, the surreptitious one, the one that is introduced in legislation that the general public regard as too complex to read.  This is a nice, surreptitious way of supporting local charges, not quite the up front way of supporting the refuse collection charges or the water charges because that would be far too fundamentally exposing yourself to the political winds.  It is refreshing to hear Deputy Gilmore acknowledging that local authorities actually need money to provide their services.  I look forward to him being similarly forthcoming at meetings of Dublin County Council&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;on which we are colleagues. It is the surreptitious nature of <Col N="2243" /> this charge that I object to.  Let us look at what we are doing here.  This is not a planning application charge.  Deputy Quinn was right, in that except for certain waivers in this area there are charges now for planning application, building by-law charges and all sorts of other charges in the context of planning matters.</P>
      <P>Let us look at the other side of the coin. Under the Planning Acts, if a complaint is made to a local authority that a developer, for example, has not complied with his planning permission, the local authority do not charge to go out and check that the Planning Acts are being compiled with.  If I am living in a housing estate and the developer has not provided open space areas or has not completed the estate or if I complain that some of the planning conditions with regard to the building of my house have not been complied with, the local authority &mdash; it is the policing authority then and no longer the authority to which you are making application for something &mdash; do not charge people for carrying out their statutory duty of ensuring that planning permission has been complied with.  I would suggest that if local authorities started charging people who contacted them to complain that planning permissions had not been complied with, if they charged fees before they checked the building or sent someone out to inspect it or if they charged fees, for example, to bring proceedings under the Planning Acts to seek to require a developer to comply with the planning permission, there would be a national outcry and rightly so.  Who would be in the leadership of the outcry? The lads on the left.  The Workers' Party and the Labour Party would be holding hands with the protesters, saying how outrageous it is that the local authority are charging to fulfil their statutory obligations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not disagree with Deputy Quinn in the sense that it is quite reasonable that with certain types of planning applications charges be levied.  It is correct that they be levied in a number of areas.  They are being levied and that is welcome income for local authorities but <Col N="2244" /> we are not talking about that there; we are talking about something quite different. We are talking about simply taking a certificate that acknowledges, for example, the registration of certificates of compliance and recording in the building control authority the fact that the regulations relating to buildings have been complied with.  That is a bit like the local authority sending its planning officer out on site to check that the local estate, the shop or the industrial building is being properly built and the planning officer comes back to the local authority and puts a note on the file saying that he has made the inspection and everything is in order.</P>
    <P>Section 10 is a policing section.  It gives powers of inspection to authorised persons. It allows the building control authority to examine a building and, to use non-legalistic language, to check out whether it is being properly built, having regard to the requirements that have been laid down.  To justify a charge under section 10, Deputy Quinn said that you might get a vexatious complaint.  Of course you might.  Someone who is totally crazy might think that his next door neighbour's house is about to fall on his head when the house is soundly built. That person might complain that planning permission has not been complied with and he may ask the local authority to look at it.  The majority of people who raise problems of this nature have genuine, bona fide worries.  Are we going to charge everyone because of the odd lunatic who appears on the scene?  It is obviously left to the building control authority or the local authority to make their own assessment whether it is reasonable to carry out an inspection under section 10.  It does not say in that section that, upon any individual raising a complaint with a local authority, the local authority are obliged to inspect. That section empowers the building control authority to operate in a particular way.</P>
    <P>In a sense the inspection that will be carried out under section 10 has its mirror image in the Planning Acts where the planning inspector goes out to make sure <Col N="2245" /> that planning permissions are being complied with.  This is a different type of inspection at a different level.  I find it very difficult to see the logic of saying that in these circumstances the local authority should levy charges.  In the context of section 10 I am not sure how they can levy charges because the type of approach that may be required may vary widely in the context of examinations and inspections that are carried out and in the context of, for example, being permitted to take samples of materials carried out in construction works, checking out those samples and bringing equipment.  The equipment might be very small hand tools that someone carries in their back pocket or it might be a massive piece of machinery.</P>
    <P>I do not know how we are going to levy charges under section 10.  Are we going to classify a series of particular types of complaints and work out either the verbosity of the complaint or the level of work required by it, or is the time spent on site going to result in particular charges? If a building control authority want to get money easily will they be able to send out half a dozen people to a site to take samples when only one is required and have them do it for five days rather than half an hour?  I appreciate that the Minister is trying to provide a way of financing the work local authorities carry out.  He is engaging in a little of the surreptitious as well in this area because the Government do not want to come out front on how they believe local authorities should be financing their activities. Local authorities outside of the Dublin area, with the support of Fianna Fáil, are busy in their current estimates levying water charges, refuse charges and sewerage charges while in the Dublin area the Fianna Fáil groups are running for cover and not levying any charges.</P>
    <P>I am not saying that the Minister should or should not levy charges.  What we need to do is have a comprehensive look at taxation generally and on how we will fund local authorities in the future. However, this is more of the surreptitious; we plug in another bit of a charge for what is a policing function.  It <Col N="2246" /> is a bit like suggesting that if my house is robbed and I want the Garda Síochána to investigate it I should first pay them a fee or I should be charged a fee based on the number of man hours involved in investigating my complaint.  If they have to come up to my house to take fingerprints would that be the equivalent of taking the sample here and will they charge me per fingerprint?</P>
    <P>There is a lack of logic in the way this section applies.  It might be a politically neat way of getting some more money from local authorities but I do not understand how section 6 (2) (h) will work in practice.  Even if it does work I am very suspicious of anyone who brings a charging measure into this House and says &ldquo;there will be a modest fee.&rdquo;  That was said during the last century when income tax was being levied.  What fees does the Minister have in mind?  Paragraphs (i) to (iv) of section 6 (2) (h) spell out specific things the Minister can charge for but apparently under paragraph (v) the building control authority can charge for any other matter the Minister considers appropriate.  I ask the Minister to indicate to us what fees he has in mind under paragraphs (i) to (iv).  Will they be laid down as a specific fee in each case by his Department as part of the regulations or will the regulations contain an empowering mechanism whereby the local authorities can charge different fees for similar functions?  Will the Minister detail for us the other matters he considers appropriate which would give rise to charges under this Bill?  Is that merely a cover-all provision in case there is something left out which someone may discover later on can be charged for or is there something more the Minister envisages might give rise to charges?  I do not know the answers to those questions. Before we proceed further I ask the Minister to clarify what fees he has in mind. What is the modest fee?  Will it be £5, £10 or £40 to register a certificate of compliance? How much will it be and will it depend on the value of the relevant building?  I do not know the answers to <Col N="2247" /> that conundrum and I do not think anybody else in this House knows them either.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed and surprised to hear Deputy Quinn say he accepts all of this section subject to the amendments he has tabled.  We do not have any of the information I have sought.  If we take the view that this is a policing section, the section necessary if the local authorities can perform their functions so that certificates of compliance can be registered, it is necessary that all of these things happen, and there are obligations imposed on the local authority which relate to their policing this legislation.  I do not see how we can go along with these types of fees in these circumstances. On the other hand I would fully support the type of fees in the planning area for planning applications.  They are logical and right but they are not in the policing area while these are.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to clarify a couple of points for the benefit of Deputy Shatter. First, there is nothing surreptitious about what I am proposing.  I cannot think of anywhere more inappropriate to propose something surreptitious than in the national Parliament which is fully recorded and open to the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to explain to him the difference between water which everybody consumes, which PAYE taxpayers have already paid for through their taxes, which the Minister's Government at a previous time committed would be fully paid through the domestic rate support grant to local authorities and which is universal to all people, and the type of service we are talking about here.  Let us be quite clear what we are talking about. We are talking about builders who might have a very substantial scheme or a large project of one type or another and who have no difficulty in paying for a whole range of services in the lead up to the completion of that particular project. They pay architects, solicitors and a whole range of professional people for services which will lead towards the completion of that project.  Why should they <Col N="2248" /> not have to pay the public body who have responsibility for the enforcement and supervision of regulations which are made to protect the public good?  That is the difference here.</P>
    <P>I am surprised that Deputy Shatter, the Fine Gael spokesperson on the Environment, is not more familiar with the polluter pays principle of which this argument is an extension and is opposing the idea that fees should be charged for this purpose.  I want to repeat that it is reasonable that a fee should be paid.  It is also reasonable that that in turn would help to fund the local authority.  This Bill will have to be implemented effectively. Deputy Shatter would be the very first to accuse me of being unreasonable about where the finance will come from to enable local authorities to do their job properly.  Local authorities will have to have a policing role in this regard.  As I said earlier I have put down a number of amendments which I hope, if the Minister accepts them or they are agreed by the House, will strengthen that policing role. I do not think it is unreasonable that people who, at the end of the day very often make large profits from the buildings we are talking about here, should make a modest contribution to that policing service.</P>

      <P>I was sincerely hoping that this debate would not degenerate into the kind of ideological barracking as to who should or should not pay for services rendered.  This is how we slipped away from this legislation on the previous occasion.  I am not going to add to that except to say that Deputy Gilmore should take the Minister's advice and not be so easily provoked by Deputy Shatter.  He is rising the Deputy deliberately.  The Deputies can engage in such battles in some other place on another occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This comes down to the question of the little fee which will have to be paid.  As Deputy Gilmore rightly said work will arise for building control authorities in registering these certificates.  The appropriate level of the fee will not be unduly onerous in this case.  The Bill provides for requiring local authorities to <Col N="2249" /> register the certificates.  This will impose certain obligations on local authorities. We want them to carry out their functions properly in relation to certificates.  They will have to register them in a systematic manner which will enable them to be retrieved when they are required.  They will have to be stored properly and in a safe manner.  Those activities will impose a burden on local authorities.  They will have to provide accommodation, staff and record system and money will have to be found for them.  Many of the records and certificates will have to be retained for some time.</P>
    <P>The building control authority will not set the level of fees to be applied.  The Minister will determine the level of fees to apply and will have to carry full accountability for them.  Deputy Shatter will have ample opportunities to say if the fees are inadequate or not.  It will not be left to an individual local authority to decide to charge whatever they think fit or in whatever location they consider appropriate.</P>
    <P>The question of paying fees for inspections and tests is an important issue.  They may be required if it comes to light &mdash; I hope it will not &mdash; that a certain building in the course of construction or a completed building, is other than in accordance with the building regulations.  I am sure Deputy Shatter will agree that local authorities should be in a position to make those inspections and tests.  Deputy Quinn, who is expert in this regard, will agree that those tests have a cost factor attached to them.  On occasions complex technology is used in the tests and it has to be paid for.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quinn raised a question about a provision for inhibiting vexatious planning appeals.  I should like to point out to him that the planning code allows third parties the right of appeal but the building control regulations will not allow third parties to become involved in something that is a matter between the applicant&mdash;be he the builder, designer or the developer &mdash; and the building control authority.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2250" /> I should now like to deal with amendment No. 8, tabled by Deputy Quinn, and I hope to set his mind at rest in regard to the point raised in it.  That amendment attempts to ensure that a fee may be charged only in a case where an inspection and test pursuant to section 10 is reasonably required.  While I can sympathise with the motivation behind the amendment, I am legally advised that the insertion of the word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; will achieve nothing because it is implicit in the section that tests can be required only when it is reasonable to require them.  A building control authority must act reasonably in its use of any of its powers whether the word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; is inserted in the section or not.  I will inform local authorities, prior to the introduction of the control system at local level, of the concerns which have been represented to me in this regard and expressed in the House.  I should like to assure the Deputy that he need not be unduly concerned about the question of reasonableness being applied.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment expresses the concern voiced by the profession.  Local authorities are getting into the practice of <Col N="2251" /> doing belt and braces types of operations in relation to some legislation under which a certificate is required.  They require the certifier to guarantee that not only did the documentation or the proposal comply with the specific requirements of the planning legislation but that it covered a number of other matters.  I will explain this by giving an example. Planning permissions obtained from local authorities contain a standard type of condition that the consent of the fire officer must be obtained, that the consent of the chief sanitary officer must be obtained and that the consent of other local authority bodies, as distinct from the planning authority, must be obtained. Professional people are subsequently requested by those in Deputy Shatter's profession in the course of conveyancing to certify that all the conditions of a planning permission have been complied with.  One of those conditions may, for example, include the need to get the approval of the chief fire officer.  Obtaining the written approval from a chief fire officer is a bit like winning the lottery. Certainly, in the present climate it depends very much on the order of the day, the mood of the individual, or whether intemperate comments were made in the Dáil in regard to the safety of local authority three storey dwellings or not.  Those comments would have a decided effect on whether written approval is given.  I am not being facetious in making those comments.</P>
    <P>There is a tendency for local authorities to do &ldquo;belt and braces&rdquo; type operations in requiring applicants to comply with all sorts of legislation.  That should not be rolled up into one certificate.  Those who have requested me to table this amendment represent those who work at the coal face of the professional practice. They have told me that it is not that they are unwilling to obtain such certificates but that they do not feel it should be necessary to obtain an omnibus certificate with all the information required on one document.  It is their view that if one fails to comply with one of the four or five requirements one cannot certify <Col N="2252" /> that the planning permission has been adhered to.  I should like to ask the Miniter to consider this amendment and, perhaps, if he is not sufficiently briefed on the issue, to come back at a later stage.</P>

      <P>This paragraph will enable me in making building control regulations to streamline to the greatest extent possible the various requirements under both the building control and planning codes. I am taking the powers solely in the interest of minimising procedural and other matters which members of the public will be required to comply with.  I am not, therefore, prepared to accept the amendment as to do so would only preclude the possibility of cutting down on red tape.  I should like to point out that if the amendment was accepted the provision would serve little purpose in view of the limited scope to combine documents or applications arising from the requirements in the building control system.  I understand that there may be some concern that the wording might give some legality to the inclusion in a combined document of requirements relating to permissions that would not have any legal basis under the existing planning code.  That is not the problem.</P>
      <P>I have specific legal advice that if something is not valid under existing planning law its inclusion in a combined document provided for in this paragraph will not validate it.  That is the legal advice available to me and I trust it has been helpful to the Deputy.</P>

      <P>In subsection (2), to delete paragraph (j).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned, and I suspect Deputy Shatter shares my concern, that certain categories of buildings would be excluded.  My reading of the section, and <Col N="2253" /> perhaps the Minister will signal that I am interpreting it correctly, is that if we pass this section he and his successors would have the power to exclude a particular type of building from the provisions of this section.  If that is the case, and I am taking the Minister's nod to be in the affirmative rather than to be one of worry, I would be concerned that whole sections of construction would be excluded from the provisions in relation to certification, approval or scrutiny.  It has been suggested from time to time in the debate on this Bill, particularly in the debate on Second Stage, that, for example, domestic construction could be excluded.  I would be totally opposed to this.  I do not mind different categories of certification or different levels of approval, but I do not want any category of building to be excluded.</P>
    <P>We are learning from our mistakes: in 1962 and 1963 we excluded the requirement of planning permission for agricultural buildings.  If we were to introduce that Bill in the House today, everybody would agree that planning permission for any kind of agricultural installation should be required.  We have pretty well reached that position now.  I do not want this Minister or any other Minister to find himself in the position where he would be able to exclude certain categories of buildings.  The pressure on him to do so would be enormous.  To that extent a more precise amendment would, I suspect, seek to remove the word &ldquo;exclusion&rdquo; rather than to delete the whole section.  In looking at it again, I find I have no difficulty with the idea of differentiation in relation to the types of certificate which would be required or in relation to the scrutiny which would be required with regard to the different categories of buildings, depending on the complexity of construction.  The exclusion of any type of building from the provisions of this Bill is unacceptable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Quinn raised the problem which I was going to raise. Indeed this brings us back to the issue I raised some time ago.  I did not raise that issue in anything other than a serious <Col N="2254" /> way.  Deputy Quinn referred to three storey buildings.  I am not suggesting that we should not have three storey buildings either in the public housing sector or in the private sector.  There are many fine three storey buildings in this city which were built in the last century. I am seeking to ensure &mdash; and this section relates to it &mdash; that fire safety regulations will be in place, that where a fire takes place there will be means of escape and where a fire takes hold it will not literally take a stranglehold on the building within a matter of minutes because of the materials used.</P>
      <P>I have already given two examples of very horrific fires with tragic consequences, one of which occurred in the city and the other in the county of Dublin during the past ten days, both of which resulted in the deaths of young children. One of these fires raises serious concern about the methods of escape and the other gives rise to concerns over the materials used.  Like Deputy Quinn, I am anxious to ensure that domestic dwellings would not be excluded from the provisions of the fire regulations.</P>
      <P>The Minister did not respond to the issue I raised earlier in relation to the local authorities carrying out inspections of houses within their area of control.  I did not raise that as a whimsical or side issue but rather as a serious one.  What we have done is to use this debate to try to get the Minister to ensure that, if remedial works are necessary to resolve any problems shown up by the fire in Summerhill, the local authorities will do those works and take action.  I see the application of section 6 (2) (j), in the context of applying fire safety regulations to domestic dwellings being very important. Like Deputy Quinn, I am anxious to ensure that no class of buildings would be excluded from that provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of subsection (2) (j) is to enable the Minister to exclude from certain specified provisions of building control regulations any persons, bodies or buildings as he sees fit.  I envisage this power being used sparingly but it would add a degree of flexibility to the <Col N="2255" /> Bill which could be important in particular circumstances.  The provision could be used, for example, to exclude low rise housing from the provisions of the control system in the interests of reducing the volume of new work which would result.  It would also enable the impact and effectiveness of the control regulations to be assessed while confining them to the more complex buildings.  This would not exclude other buildings, with some minor exceptions, from the provisions of the building regulations.  I cannot accept the amendment, but it should be clearly stated that building regulations to be made under section 3 would apply to domestic buildings.</P>
      <P>I regret that Deputy Shatter keeps referring back to the unfortunate tragedies which recently took place in the city. We all express our sympathy to the unfortunate families who lost members and who were in any way inconvenienced by that.  Deputy Shatter intimated that Department engineers inspect houses in only a superficial way.  I would not like that to go on the record without rejecting it out of hand.  If Deputy Shatter represented a rural constituency he would be aware of how thorough the Department of the Environment's inspectors are in checking out houses, the method of construction, the way in which the roof was constructed, if the struts are in the right place, the cavities and the insulation. All he need do is ask any rural Deputy and he will give him a fair indication of the number of times they have had to listen to householders explain just how thorough the inspectors were.  I reject the suggestion out of hand.  I think the Department's inspectors are very thorough and do a good job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think it is appropriate for us to go into detail on the unfortunate tragedies to which the Deputy has referred on a number of occasions.  All I want to say is that there is no evidence to show that the deaths occurred because of the way the house was constructed.  I reiterate what Deputy Quinn said in that regard.  In effect, the house is no different from any other three storey house in the <Col N="2256" /> country.  No regulation will cover every eventuality, particularly where there is human involvement in terms of complying with practical safety precautions as distinct from structural matters.  We should leave it at that.  We all regret that tragedies do happen, but it is no harm to say that in my experience most of the fires which occur in homes result from the bad use of appliances and other things unrelated to the design and construction of the building.  I would just like to leave it at that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to dwell on this and my intention is to ensure that we do not have a repetition of those incidents. I want to disabuse the Minister.  I did not say anything of a derogatory nature about any engineers attached to his Department or to the local authority. I do not know where the Minister got that from.  I would assure the Minister of one thing in the context of the Summerhill tragedy and that is that I visited those houses and I know what I am talking about.  I have no doubt that due to the design of the houses and the absence of fire escape facilities from the top floor and the narrowness of the stairway leading from the second to the third floor, if another fire occurs in any of those houses there will be a further loss of life.</P>
      <P>I accept that a fire could occur from the bad use of an appliance.  I do not say that the fire would originate from any defect in the building.  However, if a fire occurs in any of those houses and adults or children are on the third floor, and if the fire reaches the staircase of the second floor, there is no way out except to jump. My concern is that there are very simple means of dealing with that problem which Dublin Corporation do not appear to be prepared to take.  I do not suggest that the houses are improperly built.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are asking local authorities under this legislation to be building control authorities and we are mirroring them with the fire authorities and the specific regulations we are talking about under paragraph (3) (j) in relation to fire safety. I am concerned that if a fire occurs in <Col N="2257" /> another of those three storey local authority houses or in a private house which is similarly constructed there will be further deaths.  I will not say anything more about it.  I am not trying to make political capital out of something which is a major tragedy.  I am anxious to ensure that it does not happen again in the city or county of Dublin due to the lack of fire escape facilities which was the problem here.</P>
    <P>The Minister seemed to say in reply to Deputy Quinn that it is envisaged that low level housing &mdash; I presume two storey or one storey housing &mdash; can be excluded from the application of paragraph (3) (j). Paragraph (3) (j) will lay down regulations about the type of materials used. The type of materials in use in the provision of a building will greatly impact on what might happen in the event of a fire occurring.  That is obviously a concern.  I appreciate that it may not be possible overnight to bring every type of building under the ambit of this legislation and that there may be a need for a lead in period for some aspects of it, but nevertheless the concern remains with regard to domestic housing stock.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 11:</P>
      <P>11. To delete subsection (3).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment gets to the point of whether the local authorities should assume any responsibility for ensuring that the information contained in a certificate is factually correct.  Deputy Gilmore's amendment No. 14 is probably a better amendment which does not require every piece of information to be accurate but enables the local authority to carry out checks on documents from time to time.  The intent behind my amendment, and I suspect behind Deputy Shatter's amendment, is to put some responsibility on the local authority <Col N="2258" /> to ensure that the documentation is factually correct.  We are all conscious of the frailties of the human condition and if the Minister opts for a system of self-certification, some sort of safeguard must be incorporated to curtail the actions of unscrupulous people who will certify buildings knowing that the certification is not correct.</P>
    <P>My amendment is to ensure that the local authority have some responsibility. Earlier we referred to the fact that the local authority would charge for the registration of documentation and would charge fees for carrying out inspection and so on.  In counterbalance, what my amendment and Deputy Shatter's amendment proposes is that there should be a form of obligation on the local authority. I would ask the Minister to respond to that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Quinn pointed out, my amendment No. 14 is related to this.  There are two issues here. The first is that we have now whittled the whole system of certification down to a very narrow form of self-certification and the question of third party certification has gone.  At issue here is what safeguard we will use to ensure that what actually goes into the file in the local authority complies with the regulations.  In my case where self-certification is used, for example in the US where it is used in relation to tax collection, there is a system of random checking so that people know that somewhere, sometime, a check will be made to make sure that everything is in order.  That principle should be applied.  My amendment No. 14 tries to ensure that that would happen and that the local authority, who after all act for the public, will carry out an active and effective role checking and monitoring to make sure that building regulations are complied with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second issue relates to the subject matter of Deputy Shatter's amendment, which is whether domestic dwellings are included in the provisions of this Bill. I am a bit concerned by some of the Minister's comments which strongly suggest that domestic dwellings are being <Col N="2259" /> excluded from the provisions of the Bill. I support Deputy Shatter's amendment that a specific provision be made to include domestic dwellings in the Bill so that there is no ambiguity about it and we are clear that the building regulations we are providing for will ensure that people in ordinary houses are living in dwellings that are properly built, complying with the regulations the Bill is enabling the Minister to make.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 11 and 11a are, in a sense, mutually exclusive. Amendment No. 11a was tabled on the assumption that amendment No. 11 would not necessarily be successful.  On that basis I formally propose that there be added to the wording of subsection (3) the words &ldquo;Notwithstanding the generality of this subsection, the Building Control Regulations shall provide for domestic dwellings.&rdquo;  Amendment No. 14, to which Deputy Gilmore has referred, would provide for an obligation to carry out checks in respect of work in progress and completed buildings and is also tabled in my name.  I would see the interaction between them as meaning that what is now going to be paid for is a service that is being properly carried out; that there is a specific protection there and that, at the same time, these regulations will provide for domestic dwellings and we will not find in the long-term that domestic dwellings are entirely or substantially excluded from their application.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I was wondering about that because when Deputies Quinn and Gilmore were speaking they were talking to amendments Nos. 13 and 14 which have nothing to do with amendment No. 11. Subsection (3) has nothing to do with the duties of local authorities.  Amendment <Col N="2260" /> No. 11 to subsection (3) will enable building control regulations to make different provisions in relation to buildings or classes of buildings or to buildings in different areas.  I consider this to be a sensible provision which would allow an approved system to be implemented in a particular area or areas and for particular buildings or classes of buildings while a self certification system could operate in other areas or for other buildings or classes of buildings.  It would also allow for certain classes of buildings to be excluded from the control system in the initial stages of introducing building regulations.</P>
      <P>I am not inclined to accept Deputy Shatter's amendment No. 11a because in starting up a particular scheme of control it may be necessary to exclude certain types of buildings, including domestic buildings, in the interests of curtailing, to a reasonable degree, the workload arising for building control authorities.  I would make the point that there are <i>de facto</i> controls on housing already in place including the new house building guarantee scheme and house grant inspections. The Deputy's amendment could also have the effect of forcing a building control authority to apply to itself for approval for the building of houses which it undertakes while wearing its housing authority hat.  For those reasons I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of my not pressing amendment No. 11a, would the Minister consider looking at this issue?  I appreciate there may be a need to progressively implement aspects of the Bill and that it may not apply universally immediately, but there are concerns in the context of subsection (3).  It appears that buildings of a similar class may be treated differently in different areas of the country and I do not see the logic in that.  There are problems with the wording of subsection (3) and in the way it may operate.  If one is building a factory in Ballina and a factory in Dublin I do not see why there should be different building control regulations applicable to <Col N="2261" /> each.  There will be a need for a uniformity of standard.</P>
      <P>In the context of ensuring that domestic dwellings are covered &mdash; and I do not want to keep harping back to the Summerhill tragedy &mdash; the problem about the local authority being the building control authority is that in the context of its own buildings it would be certifying its own work.  That is not logical.  The building control authority, when acting as a housing authority, should have to comply with the same standards it imposes and that need to be imposed on everyone else.  That must happen and there should be a statutory duty in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a need to put in place a statutory provision where domestic dwellings in the private sector are covered.  I appreciate the Minister is saying that there is a problem with this applying to local authorities.  I tabled the amendment in this way to allow the facility of raising the issue of ensuring that local authorities apply the same standards to themselves as are required in the private sector because, quite honestly, we have not always seen that in the past in certain areas.  If one wants to take something that is not a domestic dwelling, take the illogicality of siting a motor taxation building at the back of the Four Courts in Dublin without a single parking space for anyone who wants to get road tax or a licence.  While that building was being built the same local authority, Dublin Corporation, would have required any private developer building a similar office to provide car parking facilities.  So we have the unique application of one set of rules for the general public and another for the local authority, the planning authority. They designed a building to provide a service for people who drive cars, but they did not provide a single parking space for anyone who wants to use the building.  That is a simplistic example, but we are talking about more fundamental things under this Bill.  It is not always the case that local authorities apply to themselves what they are applying to others.  Often the standards they apply <Col N="2262" /> to others are right but they are not obeying them themselves.</P>
    <P>It is important that provisions be made to ensure that building control regulations extend to private domestic dwellings. If the Minister would consider coming back to us with a provision that within a specified period, within a year or two years of the passage of the legislation, regulations will be put in place to apply to domestic dwellings to allow for a progressive implementation of it, I would be quite happy with that.  I am concerned that in the context of cost saving and work saving, and ultimately at the cost of the fabric of what we are building, we may find domestic dwellings permanently excluded in practice from this legislation and from its application.  That is a major concern.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister appreciates the fact that the Deputy understands the legislation will be applied progressively. That is clearly stated.

They will apply to houses wherever they are located.  As far as parking is concerned, that comes under the planning legislation, and the Deputy appreciates that.</P>

    <P>This is all about ensuring that these certificates mean something, that the building control authority actually can monitor what happens and that the certificate does not just leave the certifier vulnerable or liable for not complying with the regulations, but that where a local authority have accepted a certificate and have accepted that a building is properly built, if it subsequently turns out the regulations were not properly complied with, the local authority, have a liability. I see no merit in our giving public bodies, be they Government Departments, local authorities or anyone else, statutory functions to protect the public and, indeed, charging for them if it turns out that that protection was not given and they are then immune from any recourse on the part of the general public who are affected directly by the failure of the local authority to fulfil their statutory functions. Hence the amendment I have tabled, and I await the Minister's response to that amendment.</P>

      <P>Let me say, before the Minister does, that perhaps I misled the House by speaking on the previous amendment about the substance of this amendment and amendment No. 14. Therefore, as I said earlier, my comments apply to this amendment and the other one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we are dealing with two extreme positions here.  On the one hand the Minister's amendment <Col N="2264" /> absolves the local authority of any responsibility in relation to the regulations and ensuring that the buildings and work comply with the requirements of the regulations.  On the other hand, Deputy Shatter's amendment gives the local authority all the responsibility, virtually, as I read it, to the point of absolving the certifier.  We have to find an accommodation between those two.  It is correct that the local authority have an important role to play here given that they are not going to be the certifying body now; they are not going to be the body giving the approval.  The role they have to carry out is one of inspecting, policing, carrying out checks and making sure in so far as they can that the certificates that are submitted to them mean that the regulations are being complied with.  The amendment Deputy Shatter and I have proposed as amendment 14 gives that responsibility to the local authority to carry out those checks and that would be clearly known to the people submitting the certificates in the first place.  That is somewhat different from a situation whereby if a certifier in some way misleads the local authority the local authority can then subsequently be liable for that.  I would be very cautious about a position where the taxpayer would end up having to pay for the fault of the certifier in the first place.  Certainly if the local authority failed in their duty to carry out the necessary checks on the entire system there would be a liability on the local authority, but I do not think a blanket liability should be conferred on the local authority, neither do I believe they should have no responsibility at all as appears to be the case from the Minister's amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment does not absolve the certifier in any way whatsoever but it would result in a dual liability, a liability on the part of the certifier and a liability on the part of the local authority.  It would seem that where a local authority or any Government body are given a public function to perform, in this case to protect, in effect, the general public, and if they fail to perform their <Col N="2265" /> function properly they should be liable. Indeed, when the State sought immunity for failure to perform functions in the context of a general State immunity against being sued, the courts in 1969 in the Byrne case made it clear that the State as such is not enabled to claim such immunity.  I am not suggesting the local authority should carry the can in the sense that if something goes wrong the person who certified should be let off the hook, but if somebody certifies something that is not accurate the local authority under this legislation have a duty to act as a building control authority and are given powers that Deputy Gilmore and I, in amendment 14, want to extend and make more express to carry out checks.  This amendment would give recourse against a local authority if they had not properly as a building control authority fulfilled their function.  This is the very essence of ensuring there is a protection for the general public.  The Minister gives a blanket exemption in his provision which means in effect that, no matter how negligent a building control authority are in the fulfilling of their functions under this legislation, an individual affected by that negligence will have no recourse against the local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not saying this will necessarily ever happen but if, say, an architect or surveyor who has somewhat fly-by-night practices and has been issuing certificates all over the place for a couple of years under this legislation leaves this country and goes to live in Australia or Timbuktu and nobody knows where he is, and it turns out that his certificates were not accurate but that the local authority accepted them, not having carried out any spot checks or monitoring, are we saying there should be no recourse in such case against that local authority as a building control authority who failed to fulfil their statutory functions?  I do not think we can say that.  My amendment is designed to ensure that there is a right of recourse.  This will simply ensure that building control authorities will fulfil their functions properly and not feel this is an area in which they can <Col N="2266" /> perhaps be somewhat lethargic in fulfilling their functions, because for example they are under-funded or have other priorities they wish to pursue.  We all know that at present in some local authorities there is a failure to comply with planning permissions.  It can be extremely difficult to get the necessary action taken to force cowboy developers to fulfil their palnning obligations and the bringing of court proceedings can be extremely slow simply because the local authority are overworked.  A local authority operating a whole series of different statutory functions as a building control authority may have other priorities.  If we are serious about this legislation there is no justification for the blanket protection afforded to that building control authority under section 6 (4) as we currently have it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment as submitted in Deputy Shatter's name is unacceptable. If self-certification were introduced it would have the effect of making building control authorities responsible for all defects in construction and output, to say nothing of the impossible workload it would generate for them. The consequences of accepting it would be to create potential liabilities for local authorities of such magnitude as to be a recipe for disaster in so far as the finances of the authorities are concerned.</P>
      <P>Deputy Shatter appears to want local authorities to unilaterally underwrite the vast bulk of construction activity.  That is simply not on.  The responsibility for building lies with those who design and construct buildings and not the building control authorities.  Subsection (4) is inserted so that with the self-certification system the liabilities of building control authorities do not extend beyond what is reasonable.  It is not reasonable to expect building control authorities to take on board a duty or duties which would bring with them inordinately extensive liabilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Maybe I should say one word about the liability matter because so many concerns have been expressed on this matter already in this debate.  I want to put it <Col N="2267" /> clearly on the record that the Bill stands apart from the issue of liability.  Liability is determined by the courts having regard to the law of contract and tort and these apply in the particular circumstances of the case in question.  Nothing in this Bill or in regulations to be made under it, will alter this.  I would ask the House to acknowledge the point and to accept that liability and related matters, such as ensuring against them, are really extraneous to the subject matter of the Bill.  I will have more to say about the liability issue so far as those who design and construct buildings are concerned when we discuss the amendment tabled in my name which is inserted as a new section 20 in the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to respond briefly.  I take the view that this particular subsection is an unacceptable blanket immunity to building control authorities. I do not accept that this has nothing to do with liability.  If it has nothing to do with liability, this subsection would not be proposed for the Bill in the first place. It has all to do with liability.  The building control authority, if they fail to fulfil their statutory duty, are liable for damage resulting from that failure affecting an individual in the context, in this instance, of a building which falls within the ambit of the building control regulations. The whole issue of immunity and the whole issue of liability are what this is about.  I do not think the two can be separated.  They are inextricably intertwined and, indeed, the Minister's amendment, No. 43, to section 20 reads:</P>
      <P>A person shall not be entitled to bring any civil proceedings pursuant to this Act by reason only of the contravention of any provision of this Act, or of any order or regulation made thereunder.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2268" /> That amendment is copperfastening a blanket immunity.  In other words, we are giving building control authorities statutory duties but if they fall down on them, the general public have no recourse at all.  I am pressing this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already expressed my view about Deputy Shatter's amendment but I am most unhappy with subsection (4) as it stands.  In that respect, Deputy Shatter is quite right.  That subsection allows local authorities to wash their hands of responsibility for the building control regulations.  We were discussing amendment No. 14 in the context of this section and I did not hear the Minister make any observation on it.  If the Minister were to accept amendment No. 14 or to give some indication that he was prepared to take it on board on Report Stage, it would go a long way towards setting down a method by which the local authorities could carry out a meaningful function in this whole area.  I would like to hear what the Minister has to say about amendment No. 14.  If subsection (4) is to remain as it is, it would be my intention to bring in an amendment on Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to say to Deputy Shatter that this is not blanket immunity.  It only operates in so far as self-certification is concerned.  That is the important point.  When somebody lodges a certificate with the local authority we want to ensure that suddenly and automatically the local authority do not attract all kinds of duties and liabilities because of the lodging of that certificate. That is all that is involved so far as amendment No. 12 is concerned and it should be understood in that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to amendment No. 14 to amendment No. 12 I should like to say to Deputy Gilmore that I find it slightly unusual to say the least.  Local Government legislation generally confers power on local authorities on the basis that these bodies, as responsible public authorities, will use the powers properly and with due regard to the objectives of the legislative code in question.  There is no requirement <Col N="2269" /> on the Garda Síochána, for example, to do random checks on motor vehicles to check tax but we know that such will be undertaken from time to time.  Fire authorities are not required by any specific provision in the 1981 Act to satisfactorily monitor fire safety provisions but do so because of their general enforcement powers and responsibilities.</P>
    <P>This Bill gives building control authorities inspectorial and enforcement powers which are to be used as the authority in question see fit and this is adequate.  In any event, from a legal viewpoint, I consider it would be extremely difficult for a building control authority to decide how much had to be done to satisfactorily monitor effectiveness; some might consider it would require very extensive checking if they were to properly discharge the function. This would have implications for local authority staffing and could lead to the type of delays in the building industry that should be avoided.  In all the circumstances, I cannot accept amendment No. 14.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I had hoped that we might have been able to finalise section 6 by 7 o'clock.  I do not think that is realistic at this stage but we are very close to it. The Minister would be well advised to take on board the sentiment of the amendment in the names of Deputies Shatter and Gilmore.  If the Minister is not disposed to amend in any way subsection (4) &mdash; as suggested in Deputy Shatter's amendment &mdash; it seems to me that with specific reference to self-certification, which is a new concept in terms of building control in Ireland, the local authority are not being required to carry any kind of responsibility whatsoever regarding self-certification.  Section 6 is one that will empower the Minister to write regulations and it will be he, or his successors, who will determine the level of supervision or the amount of random inspection that can be prescribed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I know it does not require it but we are talking about the perception of the law where we are moving from a system where 40 per cent of seven local authorities monitor and issue approval certificates in the form of by-law approval for buildings to a situation where theoretically the entire system could be operated under a self-certification system.  If the substance of subsection (4) were to stand, in the manner described by the Minister, without taking on board the amendment proposed by Deputy Shatter, we would be moving from one extreme position, relatively speaking, to another.  I agree with Deputy Gilmore regarding the provisions of amendment No. 14 which state:</P>
      <P>Building control authorities shall carry out such checks of certificates and documents lodged and work in progress and completed buildings, as they consider necessary to satisfactorily monitor the effectiveness of the control system in their area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is a perfectly reasonable provision to write in.  If it is belt and braces according to the Minister and if that provision is already there it will do no harm to restate it.  It would certainly reassure many people who are concerned that the local authorities will not be required explicitly, as distinct from implicitly, to take periodically 2 per cent or 3 per cent of all certificates lodged and to inspect them as to whether the design complies with the building regulations and to go to 2 per cent or 3 per cent of the sites with work in progress to ensure that the builders are constructing in accordance with the <Col N="2271" /> design.  That is the essence of the section. It is a very reasonable amendment to write into the Bill.  I cannot see what the Minister's objection is.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>

      <P>Before we yield on this amendment I suggest that the Minister specify 2 per cent or 3 per cent.  It would be for the Minister to indicate that in the regulations by way of circular letter.  An examination of the drawings would clearly indicate whether they complied satisfactorily with the building regulations. That is happening at present in respect of the building by-laws.  A building inspector could go out to a site and look at the quality of the foundations being poured or of the slab or the reinforcement.  That is happening at present.  I am simply asking that a provision of that nature be written in by the Minister in the regulations or as an adjunct to the regulations.</P>

      <P>In regard to this Bill the Minister decided that a committee should be set up under the chairmanship of Judge Frank Martin.  He has not yet spelled out the terms of reference of the committee but it is a step in the right direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point was made yesterday evening that the knowledge and experience gained <i>vis-á-vis</i> the outcome of the Guildford Four case obviously caused people to wonder what should be done and whether there was an urgent need in that regard. I said that there should not be a knee jerk reaction in this country as we do not want to imply that we are concerned about <Col N="2273" /> decisions of our courts or the abilities or equity exercised by the Garda in bringing cases to court.  However, we should look at the situation in great detail.</P>
    <P>Safeguards are very necessary and in need of upgrading.  This was supposed to have been done in the United Kingdom and yet we had the dreadful happenings in court cases there.  We must realise that the two ghastly and tragic bombings which brought death and destruction to two cities in the UK caused a ferocious backlash of British public opinion.  There was great pressure on the British police with the result that they over-reacted even though there was lack of evidence and that which was brought forward led to convictions which were false.</P>
    <P>There is still the unfinished business of the Birmingham Six case where everybody is of the opinion that they are innocent. As a result of public opinion in the UK, tremendous goodwill and meticulous work by the solicitors and lawyers representing the Guildford Four and the Birmingham Six, their cases were brought to the notice of various key people in the community, resulting in a half-successful outcome.  In this country many people expressed their concern about these cases but we must give credit to Members in this House and people throughout the community who formed various action committees to ensure that the miscarriage of justice would be rectified. However, we must not have an excessive reaction to these cases.  The Minister last week outlined his concern that we should be seen to do the right thing.  He appointed a chairman with experience, expertise and knowledge to head a committee, the membership of which would be drawn from a broad spectrum of society with the necessary back-up to ensure that we get a workmanlike report as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Deputy Jim O'Keeffe was concerned that the Minister had not spelled out in adequate detail the workings of the committee, the terms of reference, when they would be appointed and when they would be expected to report.  I hope the Minister <Col N="2274" /> will avail of the opportunity later, when addressing the House, to outline in some detail his intentions in regard to the workings of this committee.  Other areas of the law can be looked at while the committee are in session.  Therefore, I urge the Minister to make the terms of reference reasonably broad and to ensure that there will be an opportunity to look at cases in which there is a doubt as to a person's guilt.  Friends and relatives of convicted persons may wish to make a case in regard to their innocence.  With that in mind, the Labour Party should take stock of the situation.  I appreciate that Deputy Spring was fast off the block and brought forward a Bill but it is a cumbersome, direct copy of UK legislation which does not adequately cover the circumstances.</P>
    <P>There are a number of unique aspects in our circumstances which are probably not applicable to the workings of the Labour Party Bill.  I urge the House to reach a consensus on this matter and I hope there will be an acceptance across the floor that the Minister intends to ensure that the committee will report speedily to him.  I am sure he will introduce the necessary legislation in this regard.  The subject needs attention and there is universal agreement that there should be action.  However, the Minister's way is the most pragmatic course to follow.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will designate the middle of 1990 as the deadline by which the committee should report.  The action, determination, goodwill and the drive on behalf of the Birmingham Six should be escalated as far as possible to ensure that the whole situation is reviewed.  Deputy Andrews, in addressing the House last evening, made a number of very pertinent suggestions about the Birmingham Six case which would get the Home Secretary off the hook in relation to it.  He should accept, as Deputy Andrews suggested, that these unfortunate people should at least be given bail which would enable them to spearhead a campaign in relation to their defence.  They should have the opportunity to prove beyond all reasonable doubt that they were innocent <Col N="2275" /> of the crime and that they have been very badly and wrongly treated.</P>
    <P>The Home Secretary said he would not reopen their case unless new evidence was uncovered.  Surely, since the Court of Appeal ruled on the Birmingham Six case, the outcome of the Guildford Four case is new evidence?  The Foreign Secretary, Mr. Douglas Hurd, made some comments recently about the possibility that within the framework of the investigation into how the Guildford Four case was handled and processed, there might be a dimensional angle which would cover the Birmingham Six.  In that way there might be some form of understanding that new evidence had arisen which would lead to a re-opening or renewed hearing of the case.  The pragmatic proposal that the Birmingham Six should be released on bail, pending the outcome of the investigation of the Guildford Four case, and the likely continuing need to scrutinise those cases, would appear to be an acceptable solution, particularly bearing in mind the length of time these unfortunate people have spent in prison, now running to 15 years.  There is need for a magnanimous gesture on the part of the British Government to rectify the lack of credit now reflecting on their system of justice.</P>
    <P>Probably I should have said at the outset I intended sharing my time with my colleague, Deputy Flood.  I should like now to allocate him the remainder of time available to me.</P>

      <P>The Guildford Four case alone at times has highlighted the fatal weakness inherent in the British system of justice.  The degree of similarity between our system of criminal justice and that obtaining in England leads me to the inevitable conclusion &mdash; arising out of the Guildford Four case and others &mdash; that there is need for a critical, searching examination of ours.  I am very pleased that the Minister has already moved in that direction.  His decision to invite <Col N="2276" /> Judge Frank Martin to chair a committee of experts to carry out an examination of the issues raised, particularly by the Guildford Four case and in the context of our criminal procedures as a whole, is very timely.  I am sure this proposal is welcomed by all Members of this House, bearing in mind other Members' contributions to this debate, the introduction of the Bill by Deputy Spring and the amendment proposed by the Fine Gael Party.</P>
      <P>The Guilford Four case constitutes an appalling tragedy.  What is now clear is that police investigating that case appear to have given false evidence which, in itself, was bad enough.  It also appears that alibi evidence was suppressed by the investigating police.  Those two wrongs done to the defendants in the Guildford Four case gave rise to the convictions handed down with such disastrous consequences for the people themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I readily agree that the case itself does call into question aspects of the English legal system and the apparent absence of checks and balances, it highlights in a particular way the apparent need for the English police to be more aware that there are those among their numbers who will act unlawfully at times in the discharge of their duties.  Why they should be compelled to act in that unlawful manner is difficult to understand.  It appears to me that this may be because investigating police in the United Kingdom are subjected to such enormous pressures to obtain results when investigating certain types of crime.  We are all familiar with various press articles and media headlines in the aftermath of the outrages and bombings that have taken place in Britain.  These terrible deeds are perpetrated by people purporting to act on behalf of the Irish people.  Unfortunately, sometimes the media in the United Kingdom fail to draw a distinction between such perpetrators of violence, acting without the support of the Irish people, in the way in which I believe they should.  At times this gives rise, in turn, to the type of circumstances which arose in regard to the Guildford Four, their <Col N="2277" /> wrongful conviction and, I believe, others also.</P>
    <P>I might pose the question: could similar circumstances as arose in the case of the Guildford Four occur here?  One cannot say with absolute certainty that they would not arise here.  However, if they did, as the Minister has pointed out there is a remedy available here whereby the Government could advise the President to grant a pardon under Article 13 of our Constitution.  Of course, in circumstances in which somebody was wrongly convicted I am sure she or he might not be entirely happy with that procedure, that they would prefer that we had in being a system whereby doubt concerning their innocence could be removed, so that it could be clearly shown they were innocent of the crime of which they had been wrongfully convicted.</P>
    <P>For that reason and others I go along with the Minister when he said that Deputy Spring's Bill is precipitate.  The issues raised in the Bill are timely.  The contributions to this debate carry a great deal of merit, bringing into focus once again the serious issues which have arisen in Britain in the case of the Guildford Four and the others still remaining to be resolved.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice and Communications, with the approval of Government, has established a committee to examine, as a matter of urgency, certain aspects of our criminal procedures in the light of the issues raised by the Guildford Four case.  I understand that the Minister announced the terms of reference of that committee this evening which are: first, to examine whether there is need for a procedure whereby persons who have been convicted of criminal offences and who have exhausted the normal appeals procedures can have their cases further reviewed and, if so, to make recommendations as to what procedure should be provided and in what circumstances it should apply, and, second, given that uncorroborated inculpatory admissions made by an accused to the Garda Síochána can be sufficient evidence to ground a conviction, to examine whether additional safeguards are <Col N="2278" /> needed to ensure that such admissions are properly maintained and recorded and to make recommendations accordingly.</P>
    <P>As we are aware, His Honour, Judge Frank Martin, Judge of the Circuit Court, is to act as chairman of the committee.  I am advised that the other members of the committee will be: Mr. Edwin Alkin, office of the Attorney General; Mr. Henry Abbott, Barrister; Mr. Frank Ward, Solicitor; Mr. Hugh Sreenan, Assistant Commissioner, Garda Síochána; Mr. Patrick Terry of the Department of Justice.  I understand that Mr. Paul Murray of the Department of Justice will act as secretary to the committee. It would be my hope &mdash; one expressed already by other Members &mdash; that the committee will get down to their very important work and will report their findings to Government at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>All of us who have witnessed the difficulties which have arisen, particularly for Irish people in the United Kingdom, will understand that we need to develop a legal system here capable of responding to cases in which it can be clearly shown that there is or has been a miscarriage of justice.  It is right that we should endeavour to achieve this, particularly as we call on the United Kingdom Government to review their system of Justice to ensure there will not be a recurrence of the Guildford Four and other cases or that, if there is, the system will be capable of responding more promptly to the need to have them reviewed, thereby ensuring that justice is seen to be done.  It is unfortunate that it has taken so long for justice to be seen to have been done in the case of the Guildford Four, that the Birmingham Six and other cases still drag on while to anybody who takes the trouble to study the details surrounding such cases it appears highly probable that further miscarriages of justice have occurred.</P>
    <P>For that reason there is the need to be vigilant always within our jurisdiction to ensure that whatever changes we effect to our legal system are properly geared, so that in our rush to deal with the problems highlighted by the Guildford Four <Col N="2279" /> case, we do not import part of legal systems from other jurisdictions which may be flawed to some extent, which would appear to be the case with portions of the English legal system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I must tell the House at the outset that I intend to divide my time with Deputy Rabbitte.  Events have moved on since our discussion here last night.  Earlier this evening there was a brief meeting between the Leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Dick Spring, who is the proposer of the Criminal Justice Bill, and the Minister for Justice.  At that meeting they discussed the several suggestions which Deputy Spring had made in relation to the Minister's proposal of an expert committee to examine the issues raised by the Bill, and originally by the Guildford Four case. The suggestions which had been made by Deputy Spring were as follows: 1. Specific terms of reference for the committee; 2. A deadline on its activities; 3. A guarantee of publication of their report; 4. Representation on the committee itself.</P>
      <P>At the end of the meeting the Minister supplied Deputy Spring with a letter, the contents of which I wish to read into the record of the House:</P>
      <P>I refer to your letter of 28th November regarding your Party's Criminal Justice Bill.</P>
      <P>I enclose for your information the terms of reference of the Committee to enquire into certain aspects of criminal procedure.  I also enclose the membership of the Committee.</P>
      <P>The terms of reference have been carefully framed to enable the Committee to deal comprehensively with the issues raised by the Guildford case (given that it will still remain possible to secure a conviction on the basis of uncorroborated confessions) and I am satisfied that they achieve that purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will be anxious to obtain the recommendations of the committee as soon as possible.  To that end I intend to inform the committee, before they <Col N="2280" /> begin their deliberations, that I would like to have their report by the end of March next.</P>
    <P>As regards membership, I regard it as important in the interests of getting a report as quickly as possible, that the Committee should be a small group with practical experience or expert knowledge of the issues involved.  In these circumstances I am not prepared to add to the membership proposed.</P>
    <P>I will, of course, have no objection to publication of the report in due course.</P>
    <P>As regards my attitude to your Party's Bill, I take the view, for reasons which I have explained in the Dáil and which have been supported by others, that the Bill does not adequately deal with the issues involved.  Furthermore, it would be inappropriate in the context of a full and objective examination by the Committee of the issues involved to have a Bill already on the Order Paper.  I think the question of legislation should be looked at afresh when the Committee reports and this I will do.  For these reasons, I would not support an adjournment of the debate as you suggest</P>
    <P>Yours sincerely</P>
    <P>Attached to this letter was a short statement outlining the terms of reference and the membership of the Committee. I wish to read this also into the record of the House.  The statement is as follows:</P>
    <P>(1)  To examine whether there is need for a procedure whereby persons who have been convicted of criminal offences and who have exhausted the normal appeals procedures can have their cases further reviewed and, if so, to make recommendations as to what procedure should be provided and in what circumstances it should apply, and</P>
    <P>(2)  Given that uncorroborated inculpatory admissions made by an accused to the Garda Síochána can be sufficient evidence to ground a conviction, to examine whether additional safeguards are needed to ensure that such admissions are properly obtained <Col N="2281" /> and recorded and to make recommendations accordingly.</P>
    <P>The membership of the committee is as follows:</P>
    <P>His Honour Judge Frank Martin, Chairman;</P>
    <P>Mr. Edwin Alkin, Attorney General's Office;</P>
    <P>Mr. Henry Abbott, Barrister;</P>
    <P>Mr. Frank Ward, Solicitor;</P>
    <P>Mr. Hugh Sreenan, Assistant Commissioner, Garda Síochána;</P>
    <P>Mr. Patrick Terry, Department of Justice;</P>
    <P>Mr. Paul Murray, Department of Justice, Secretary.</P>
    <P>The reason it is necessary to place both of these items on the record of the House is that it is only possible to divine the Minister's true intentions in relation to this matter by considering his letter and the attached statement together.  It is clear to us arising from that consideration that this Minister for Justice has decided to embark on an exercise which will be largely cosmetic.</P>
    <P>He has, it is true, agreed to both a deadline and to publication of the report, but there his commitment to an open-minded approach ends.  This is apparent, first of all, from a consideration of the membership of the committee.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party have no wish to cast any aspersions on the character or integrity of the individual members of the committee.  On the contrary, the majority of the committee consists of outstanding public servants.  But by no stretch of the imagination could this be described as a broadly based committee whose primary aim as a group will be civil libertarian in character.  In fact, it will, I think, be readily apparent to most people that this committee will be balanced in the opposite direction &mdash; that is to say, it will be more concerned with the practical business of securing convictions than with the necessary task of making recommendations aimed at protecting the rights of accused persons at the same time.</P>
    <P>It is when one turns to consider the terms of reference of the committee that the Minister's intentions become fully <Col N="2282" /> clear.  There were two issues of principle raised by our Bill.  The first issue was to establish a right and a mechanism to reopen cases where serious doubt was thrown on any conviction.  The Minister for Justice has decided that the first task of this committee should be to examine whether or not there is any need to establish such a right at all.  Yet nobody in this House has argued against the principle that we were trying to establish in this regard.</P>
    <P>The second issue that our Bill raised was the issue of principle involved in basing convictions on uncorroborated confessions secured in police custody and subsequently contested.  The Minister has decided that the committee will not be allowed to examine this issue of principle at all.  He has decided instead to prejudge that issue and to ask the committee to undertake its task in the knowledge that uncorroborated confessions will continue to be sufficient evidence on which to base a conviction.</P>
    <P>In the light of the experience we have had of the Guildford Four convictions we have to regard it as completely unacceptable that the Minister should seek to pre-judge the views of an expert committee in this way.  The principle involved here must be examined and it must be examined by more than the faceless officials of the Department of Justice who have clearly been advising the Minister in this matter.  If these terms of reference are allowed to stand as they are, the expert committee will be confined to rehashing the recommendations of the Ó Britain report in relation to the recording of interviews and other matters and to examining such issues as the adequacy of Judges' Rules governing the treatment of persons in custody.</P>
    <P>All of these issues have been examined over and over again.  The Ó Briain Committee recommendations on recording of interviews, for instance, are now ten years old &mdash; and yet the Minister for Justice was able to tell us last week nothing about them except that consideration was now being given to the possible establishment of pilot schemes <Col N="2283" /> to test the efficacy of recording interviews.</P>
    <P>We have tried to approach this issue with an open mind.  We know that not every Member of this House will go along with the measures we have proposed <i>in toto,</i> and we know that the Minister for Justice would not necessarily be in a position to give our Bill a <i>carte blanche</i> welcome.</P>
    <P>I have to say that we did not expect the Minister for Justice to seek to perpetrate a con trick of this magnitude in relation to the fundamental issues involved.  Only a few nights ago this Minister was on television wallowing in the praise of those who believed he was about to undertake a fundamental and far-reaching examination of our criminal justice procedures. It is quite clear now that he proposes to undertake the least possible change and to ignore the climate of public opinion which would welcome a real commitment to the principle that justice in Ireland is not only done but is always seen to be done.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances I wish to advise the House that the Labour Party are formally rejecting the Minister's approach as inadequate and misleading.  We will be seeking a vote on Second Stage of this Bill at the conclusion of the debate this evening.  We ask for the support of every Opposition Member in that vote and we guarantee that if the Bill gets past Second Stage we will endeavour to meet the legitimate concerns that have been expressed in this debate on both sides of the House.</P>
    <P>We want to achieve, at the end of the day, a criminal justice system which is effective against crime but which never gives rise to the possibility of a miscarriage of justice.  We have all seen at first hand the pain and suffering that miscarriages of justice cause and we have already resolved, each of us in our own way, not to let it happen here.  The way to achieve this is to accept the principles of this Bill by voting for it on Second Stage and by carrying on to a rational, detailed and practical consideration of all the issues that arise on Committee Stage and beyond.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Kavanagh for agreeing to share his time with me.  I want to announce that my party will be supporting the position outlined by Deputy Kavanagh.  We are disappointed that the statement read into the record by the Minister seems to be a retrenchment of the impression he gave in his response to this Bill when it was initially moved.  The bringing forward of this Bill has provided the House with an important opportunity to debate the serious issues that arise from the Guildford Four experience.  I do not think anybody on any side of the House is seriously suggesting that the appalling miscarriage of justice revealed in the case of the Guildford Four could only happen in the United Kingdom.  The appalling vista which Lord Denning could not bring himself to envisage has since opened up in front of him and the far-reaching implications for the UK criminal justice system are still reverberating throughout the land.</P>
      <P>Nobody in the debate so far that I have heard has suggested that the same appalling vista could not open up before us in this jurisdiction.  Indeed some Deputies have instanced cases where reliance on confessions could have had terrible consequences.  Most pertinently, Deputy Spring instanced the Kerry Babies case, where a person described in the most vivid and graphic detail a series of events which we know never took place and which could have implicated someone in a most serious crime.  My colleague, Deputy McCartan, went further when he quite properly reminded this House of the early to middle seventies, the era of the heavy gang.  It was a period of gross abuse of civil liberties and of police interrogation procedures, to the extent that there is a widely held view outside this House that during that period there were serious miscarriages of justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is remarkable that while we correctly indict the English establishment for their reluctance to admit their error &mdash; at least in the case of the Guildford Four they have, however belatedly, admitted the error &mdash; there has never been such an <Col N="2285" /> admission in this country by any Government in respect of what transpired during the untrammelled reign of the heavy gang in the early seventies.  Deputies McCartan and O'Dea in particular made specific reference to the McNally-Breathnach case and the case colloquially known as the Nicky Kelly case.  In that case an error was never admitted and the Minister for Justice of the day exercised his right under the Criminal Justice Act, 1951, to release Nicky Kelly.</P>
    <P>Deputy Spring described the atmosphere in Britain following the Guildford and Woolwich bombings.  Politically it was made clear to the police that they had to get convictions.  The panic, chaos and atmosphere produced by these bombs is not entirely unknown to ourselves. This House was railroaded into enacting the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Bill in 1972 against the better judgment of a majority of this House at that time.  When our own city was bombed by terrorists, Deputies who had previously made out substantial cases against the wisdom of enacting that Bill, quickly retracted in the face of the public mood obtaining in Dublin at that time.</P>
    <P>Indeed the Emergency Powers Act was similarly born out of the same climate.  It is an Act which facilitates the form of police station oriented investigation which is so open to abuse.  The police in the Guildford Four case used and abused the terms of the Prevention of Terrorism Act for the same purpose.  This by no means seeks to play down the formidable and often dangerous challenge being posed for the Garda by the savages who are tearing this island apart.  Some members of the force lost their lives in confronting that challenge and it is correct that this House should salute them.</P>
    <P>There is an obligation on legislators, whether in the calm of the Chambers in Leinster House or in the House of Commons, not to enact legislation which is open to being abused in the kind of climate I have described.  I do not believe the Minister can assure this House that, especially during the period to which I have referred &mdash; 1973 to 1977 &mdash; there <Col N="2286" /> were no Guildford type cases in this jurisdiction. Accordingly, we now have the opportunity, either through amending this Bill &mdash; I think the Leader of the Labour Party indicated that he is open to such amendment &mdash; or through the mechanism proposed by the Minister, as I read his opening contribution, to ensure in so far as is possible that we prevent a similar miscarriage of justice occurring or recurring, as the case may be, in this jurisdiction.  It would now appear, from what we have just heard from the terms of reference which were made available this evening, that the confidence one could have placed in the expert committee is now seriously diluted and clearly the mandarins in the Department of Justice are back in the saddle.  So much for the short-lived reforming reputation of this Minister for Justice.</P>
    <P>The decision of the Minister for Justice, during the period to which I have referred, to introduce the interrogation squad, which became later known, after <i>The Irish Times</i> exposé, as the heavy gang, led to such serious allegations that Fianna Fáil at that time promised there would be a full, open inquiry if they were returned to power.  In the event, the Ó Briain Commission was established but with far more limited terms of reference than we might have expected.  Such as it was, the Ó Briain report which came to hand in 1978 made a number of recommendations, the more substantive of which have not been implemented.  The primary one was that an accused, when brought into custody for questioning for whatever reason, should be afforded the benefit of a custodian, somebody not lower than the rank of sergeant, who would tend to his welfare, make sure he was fed, would have access to legal advice and so on.  That primary recommendation of the Ó Briain report has never been implemented.</P>
    <P>The failure to implement that primary recommendation was exacerbated in the Criminal Justice Act, 1984.  Effectively that Act allows, as we know, for the interrogation of an accused for up to six hours but for his detention for a period that could indeed be far longer than six <Col N="2287" /> hours.  In order to balance that somewhat draconian measure, provision was made for full video taping of the interview that would take place with the accused.  That recommendation regrettably has never been implemented either.  If arguments about manpower or resources are being adduced as the reason for not implementing the primary recommendation of the Ó Briain report, they cannot be brought forward in the case of this recommendation with respect to video taping of an accused during interrogation.  It is especially regrettable that that has not been done.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to section 3 of the Bill which, in talking about miscarriages of justice, is of some relevance to a current case.  It is believed by 96 Members of this House and a great number of people outside that a serious miscarriage of justice has taken place in the case which has become known as the Tallaght Two. Section 3 provides that the Minister may, if he thinks fit at any time, refer a case to the court and section 3 (2) elucidates on that proposal.  As I have said, 96 Members of this House have signed a petition asking the Minister to re-open the case of the Tallaght Two.</P>
    <P>A young man is languishing in Pentonville Prison since last July awaiting extradition to this country for a crime to which three others have now confessed in as much as they have participated in a television programme and given news to the printed media to the effect that they committed the crime which is being laid at the door of the Tallaght Two.  I think one of the Tallaght Two has served three years and eight months of his five year sentence and the other is awaiting extradition to this jurisdiction for the same crime.</P>
    <P>As happened in Britain, forensic evidence has come to light which was not available at the trial or retrial of these two young men but notwithstanding that the Minister has apparently claimed he is powerless to re-open the case.  As I read it, this section would give the Minister the authority to re-open and look at that case in the light of that new evidence. <Col N="2288" /> That is the basis on which the Birmingham Six case was re-opened.  Notwithstanding the fact that forensic evidence which was not available during the initial trial and subsequent retrial of these two young men has now come to light and that there are sworn affidavits from three other young people who say they committed the crime, apparently the Minister is powerless to re-open the case, other than exercising his right under the Criminal Justice Act, 1951 and releasing them.  Quite properly the parents of these young people are not happy about this. They believe there was a miscarriage of justice and that these young people were convicted for a crime they did not commit.  As I read it, section 3 of Deputy Spring's Bill would allow the Minister the facility whereby he could order a retrial on the basis of the new evidence which has come to light.</P>
    <P>That is a current topical controversial example of a miscarriage of justice in this jurisdiction for which apparently there is no ready remedy available.  As well as the other reasons various speakers have adduced during the debate on the Bill this is another reason for supporting the Bill.  Deputy Spring, Deputy McCartan and others have outlined in graphic detail what happened in the Guildford Four case and why we have no cause to be complacent.  The Minister has admitted that we have no cause to be complacent that a similar situation could not happen, that is if it has not already happened, in this jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>I have some reservations about ruling out in all instances the reliability of admissions or confessions in all circumstances. There have been cases where people, out of remorse, have admitted and confessed to crimes years after the event.  When one looks at the length to which a small number of police in south-east England went to subvert the cause of justice, fabricate a case against the four people concerned and to extract confessions from them through brutality &mdash; section 2 requires that other material evidence in support be brought forward &mdash; I do not think it is beyond the bounds of imagination that a small number of <Col N="2289" /> dishonest policemen, which is a very mild term for them, would not go so far as to fabricate other material evidence if they thought it was necessary to secure a conviction. I have some reservations about this and initially I thought from the Minister's contribution that he would meet the Labour Party Bill half way.  I am sorry he has not done so.  The terms of reference which were read out in the House this evening leave a great deal to be desired.  It is regrettable that the opportunity presented to us by this Bill to tackle the possibility, even if it is no more than that, of a similar situation arising in this jurisdiction is not being faced up to more definitively in this debate.</P>

      <P>The discussion on this Bill this evening and last week has given us an opportunity to deal with some of the questions which were raised by the Guildford Four case.  I compliment Deputy Spring on having brought forward this Bill for the purposes of enabling this discussion to take place in a formal way during Private Members' time.  Before dealing with the merits or the demerits of the Bill I should like to take up a couple of points raised by Deputy Rabbitte.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He questioned the degree to which the Minister for Justice is committed to reform on the basis that he has not accepted this Bill as quickly as Deputy Rabbitte would have liked him to.  I think the presumption being made is that this Bill which simply incorporates to a large extent the English precedent in section 17 of the relevant Criminal Justice Act into our legislation forgets that there is a very fundamental difference in our legal system, that is, the existence of a written Constitution.  Set out in the Constitution is a separation of powers between the Executive and the Judiciary and the role <Col N="2290" /> of the courts, which is set out in the relevant Articles.  This makes the issues which are to be dealt with more difficult and complex in that it has to be properly ensured that a negation of justice, which is synonymous with the Guildford Four case, will not occur in this jurisdiction. In other words, he is not comparing like with like when he refers to the English and Irish legal systems.  Under our Constitution certain rights are guaranteed to the citizen and they are based on the constitutional case law of the High Court and the Supreme Court.  To say that our refusal to accept the Bill is an indication of our lack of reforming zeal scantily brushes over the real difference that exists between the two systems.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy complained that the main thrust of the Ó Briain report was not taken on board, the need to have a sergeant appointed as a guardian of a person held in Garda custody.  It is the case under the treatment regulations, adopted as a result of the House passing the Criminal Justice Bill, 1984, that the member in charge of the Garda station is required by law to ensure that those regulations are complied with in interrogation procedures in the station.  We are getting into the area of semantics if we claim that the terms of that recommendation were not adopted simply because the member in charge is not referred to in the regulations as the guardian.  I have had experience of dealing with an offender who was charged with explosive offences and who was detained in Garda custody.  From that experience I am aware that the treatment regulations are more than adequate to ensure that there is no question of untoward conduct adopted by interrogators in a Garda station.  We are not giving credit to the Irish legal system if we say that that recommendation was not adopted.  The spirit of that recommendation is operated in this jurisdiction and it has proved effective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Guildford Four case was about <Col N="2291" /> police giving false evidence and suppressing alibi evidence.  One must laud Deputy Spring for bringing forward his Bill in Private Members' time in an effort to ensure that at no stage and under no circumstances would such a perversion of justice occur in this jurisdiction.  I accept that in the past the proper rules and procedures were not applied in certain cases but those cases have been dealt with and the people concerned exonerated.  However, we must bear in mind that since those unfortunate happenings the Criminal Justice Bill, 1984, passed through both Houses of the Oireachtas and that treatment regulations were introduced.  In my view we have shown a commitment to take steps to deal with issues raised in the Ó Briain report of 1977.  That report was commissioned following a number of complaints about the treatment of people in Garda custody.</P>
    <P>Our legal system is different from the British legal system and, as former Deputy Kelly would say, we should not ape their legislative proposals.  If former Deputy Kelly was a Member today I am sure he would express a similar view.  We have a written Constitution, unlike the British, and we have a Minister for Justice who is committed to dealing with this matter.  He has set up a committee of experts to deal with these complex issues and that is an indication of his determination. He could have referred the matter to the Law Reform Commission, an excellent group headed by Mr. Justice Keane.  The commission have a heavy work load to deal with but they would have been in a position to present a report to the Minister on this issue.  The committee of experts, headed by the no nonsense Judge Frank Martin, will adopt a considered approach to this question and produce a report swiftly.  I have no doubt that when the report is published the Minister will proceed to deal with the complex issues which do not necessarily arise in British law.</P>
    <P>If the Guildfour Four case highlighted anything it was that if we are to provide a legitimate response in our criminal law <Col N="2292" /> system it must be one that is adequate, will stand up to legal scrutiny and be devoid of any taint of unconstitutionality. The separation of powers under our Constitution is fraught with difficulties.  The implications of a referral of a case back to the Court of Criminal Appeal by a member of the Executive, that is a Minister for Justice, would have to be well thought out.  We must ensure that the legislation enacted will give effect to the laudable objectives of the Bill before us and will withstand legal scrutiny as to its constitutionality.</P>
    <P>There is a need to ensure in our jurisdiction that non-judicial persons, like the Minister for Justice who is a member of the Executive, are not deemed to be acting either in a judicial or quasi-judicial way.  The 1924 Act deals with court appeals in criminal cases.  If, following a refusal by a trial judge to grant leave to appeal, a Minister for Justice refers the case to an appellant court the Minister could be deemed to be acting in a quasi-judicial way.  Under our Constitution judicial decisions are absolutely within the competence of our Judiciary.  We must be careful that our legislation does not impinge on that absolute sovereignty that the Judiciary have in these matters. I have no doubt that the committee of experts will tease out that issue.  The members of the committee are well qualified to prepare an informed and adequate report for the Minister that will help him prepare the necessary legislation.  I have no doubt that they will ensure that the objectives Deputy Spring seeks in his Bill will not be tainted by unconstitutionality.</P>
    <P>In this context we should consider the ingenious way we dealt with the Extradition Bill last year.  Following the passage of that Bill the Attorney General was able to deal with each case on the facts presented to him.  He was in a position to seek further evidence prior to any warrant for extradition being endorsed by a Garda superintendent, chief superintendent or a higher officer.  We ensured that matters dealt with by the Attorney General would not be subject to a judicial process because the documentation presented to him had not been endorsed <Col N="2293" /> and made valid in this jurisdiction.  We need a provision along those lines to ensure that a Minister for Justice is not deemed to be impinging on what is a judicial or quasi-judicial function.</P>
    <P>For a number of practical reason I am against the total abolition of statements where corroborative evidence is not available.  For example, in cases where an accused makes a statement voluntarily and makes an admission of guilt before the court, in particular, the Special Criminal Court, a lesser sentence is likely to be passed on that person on the basis that he was prepared to meet the case.  It would be assumed that those statements were made voluntarily unless evidence to the contrary is given to the trial judge which would lead him to rule that they were not admissible in evidence.  Not only would this be done away with under Deputy Spring's Bill, but the prosecution would not even be given the opportunity to argue that the burden of proof should be reversed.  Neither would uncorroborated statements be allowed.  It would be presumed they were involuntarily given unless the prosecution could produce evidence to show that they were given voluntarily.  Under no circumstances would those statements be allowed.</P>
    <P>This would encourage a burden of proof way beyond what would be required.  A defendant would also be precluded from meeting the case, if he wished to do so.  There are many cases where statements are given voluntarily and the defendant goes into court to meet the case but his counsel outlines mitigating circumstances which are taken into consideration by the judge in deciding sentence.  If this possibility were to be removed, other evidence, which might not otherwise have been provided by the prosecution, would then come before the court which would then go through the relevant proofs in relation to that evidence; a significant amount of time would be taken up in so doing and the defendant would not be given the opportunity to indicate to the judge that he was prepared to meet the case, that he was admitting <Col N="2294" /> his guilt but was outlining mitigating circumstances in order to have the sentence reduced.  In fact, he could end up getting a heavier sentence.</P>
    <P>This matter is fraught with difficulties and we have got to be flexible.  There is considerable constitutional case law to which we can refer, in particular, the case of the DPP <i>versus</i> Lynch where it was pointed out that at the end of the day it is a matter for the judge to decide. Therefore, if statements are given involuntarily it is up to the defence to bring this to the notice of the judge and if he is not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt, in other words if there is any doubt, he is to give the benefit to the defendant and not allow those statements to be admitted in evidence.  I think that is the proper criminal law procedure which has worked more than adequately.  Given that the treatment regulations are now in force, evidence to show that statements were involuntarily given can more than adequately be brought forward by the defence in the relevant case to ensure that those statements are deemed inadmissible.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I do not believe, given the way in which our criminal law system works at present, it is necessary to abolish uncorroborated confessions as a means of obtaining convictions.  If there were no treatment regulations, and we found ourselves in a position similar to the one we found ourselves in 1977 prior to the presentation of the Ó Briain report, where it is possible to say that there was ill-treatment and evidence could be given to show this, a case could be made for such abolition.  What I am saying is that it is possible to go about this in another way to ensure that a citizen's constitutional and legal rights are safeguarded in places of custody through the effective implementation of the treatment regulations made under the 1984 Criminal Justice Act.  In my experience, those regulations have proved to be effective.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, while we would all be in agreement with the laudable objectives of the Bill, the fact is our system is different from the one being <Col N="2295" /> operated in Britain.  We have constitutional case law to which we can refer and there is a separation of powers under the Constitution which is not the case in Britain.  The Minister is also setting up a committee of experts to look at this matter.  That is the proper and prudent thing to do.  We would do the citizens of this country a disservice if we were to precipitate a Bill which proved itself to be inadequate even in one case.  We should remember that we cannot afford to get it wrong even in one case.</P>
    <P>This is a matter of some importance and I do not believe the consideration of this matter by a committee of experts will prejudice the position between now and then.  The present safeguards, such as the treatment regulations, our constitutional case law and the evidence which may be brought before a trial judge, are more than adequate to deal with this matter. They would have been more than adequate even if we did not have the Guildford Four case.  In other words, we are imputing a difficulty which may not be there, given the constitutional case law available to us and every respected and competent defence counsel in the Four Courts.</P>
    <P>We must deal with this matter but I do not believe it is of a pressing nature because these safeguards are in place, which may not be the case in Britain.  I am not <i>au fait</i> with that system but the right way to proceed is for us to have this matter considered by experts well qualified in this field who will be well able to deal with all of the implications of changes in this area.  There is a need to ensure that members of the Executive are not deemed to have a judicial or quasi-judicial function.  If they are, this legislation will be deemed unconstitutional. We do not have specific case law in that area.</P>
    <P>We were able to deal with this matter with regard to extradition legislation on the basis that we could say with certainty that the evidence being considered by the Attorney General prior to the endorsement of a warrant was not the subject of a judicial process, in other words, it <Col N="2296" /> amounts to a pre-trial investigation into the validity or otherwise of a case being made against any person whose extradition has been sought.  In this instance, we are dealing with cases which have been tried in the courts, and which could be tried through an appellate court, where two bites at the cherry would already have been granted by our legal system.  We have to be very careful before we allow a member of the Executive to refer a case on which the Judiciary have already adjudicated.  We have to know the ground on which we stand to ensure we do not impinge on the authority vested in the courts and our Judiciary under the Constitution and in the 1924 Courts of Justice Act.</P>
    <P>I would say to Deputy Spring, a legal practitioner of great esteem, that his objectives in moving the Bill, which are to garner discussion and to focus our minds on the issue, have been met.  It should be left to the committee of experts who will report back under the chairmanship of Judge Frank Martin to produce a considered and adequate report so that we can bring forward legislation that we can all endorse which would stand up to constitutional or judicial scrutiny.</P>
    <P>I wish, with the agreement of the House, to give way to my colleague, Deputy Ellis, for five minutes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Spring in introducing this Bill has probably brought to the fore an issue about which some of us may have grave reservations, especially in view of what happened across the Irish Sea.  To take verbatim section 17 of the English Criminal Law Act, 1968, would not be in the best interests of the review.  Under Article 13 of our Constitution the Government have the right to ask the President to pardon an offender and this right has been used before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The introduction of this Bill give us an opportunity to look at the need for a review.  The Minister's approach is positive as is the fact that he has appointed a review committee of experts, of people who are well respected in the legal area, under the chairmanship of Judge Frank <Col N="2297" /> Martin, one of the most respected and competent judges in the State.  When we look at what has happened with regard to the Guildford Four, the Birmingham Six, the Maguires and others in British jails, in reviewing their situation we must look at the Garda Síochána.  There is not any member of the Garda Síochána who would subvert the course of justice by his actions.  There has yet to be proved a case against a member of the Garda Síochána in relation to irregularities with regard to the preparation or taking of evidence. There have been one or two incidents where people feel that justice may not have been done but it has never been found that the actions of the gardaí have been beyond the law or beyond their mandate to question people.</P>
    <P>We must welcome the Minister's announcement tonight that the committee will have to report by next March. That gives them about four months to prepare the report.  Because the report will be published, the ordinary public will have an opportunity to consider the recommendations and make submissions to the Minister and the Department and to their public representatives.  I have no doubt that the committee will not be found wanting in preparing a full report for the Minister.  The Minister in his positive action has shown that he also believes that it is now time to review our position. We would never like to have it said that we failed to legislate for a situation such as that which has arisen in relation to the Guildford Four.</P>
    <P>We saw what happened to the Birmingham Six in their appeal to a higher court.  It was unsuccessful probably due to the fact that the people responsible for the preparation of the evidence did not prepare it in line with the case stated. That is a grave miscarriage of justice. Thankfully we have not had the same problems here with regard to miscarriages of justice.  The number of cases where it can be proved that there was a miscarriage of justice here are very few.</P>
    <P>In the light of the Minister's action following the presentation of the Bill to the House, I would ask Deputy Spring to reconsider the position and allow the <Col N="2298" /> committee to carry out their review.  If following that review the Deputy feels it necessary to reintroduce the Bill, he can do so then.  Until the committee have reported it would be in the best interests of harmony in the House if the Bill was withdrawn.  I hope Deputy Spring can see his way to doing that tonight.  That would be positive thinking and it is the sort of action that would lead to harmony.</P>

      <P>I sincerely thank Deputy Spring for allowing me share his time in order to make a few points.  I compliment my colleague Deputy Jim O'Keeffe for introducing his reasoned and reasonable amendments to this Bill.  The first amendment is:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann declines to give the Bill a second reading until a report on&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the necessity for corroborative evidence, and</P>
      <P>(b)  the proposed power of the Minister for Justice to refer cases to the Court of Criminal Appeal, and</P>
      <P>(c)  other related issues</P>
      <P>shall have been made by the Law Reform Commission and its recommendations considered by Dáil Éireann&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The two most important points there are the related issues and the consideration by Dáil Éireann.  The related issues were that at least some of the recommendations of the Ó Briain report not yet implemented should be considered and that sections 18 and 19 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, providing for inferences to be drawn from the failure of the <Col N="2299" /> accused to account for certain matters, be reviewed.  The latter is a very important point as we know from reference to cases that have taken place across the Irish Sea in fairly recent times.  Another related matter is the failure of the Minister to implement section 27 of the 1984 Act providing for the electronic recording of questioning, thereby protecting the Garda and the accused.  Another related matter is the recommendations of senior counsel, Mr. Patrick McEntee, and the Judges Rules which appear to be a sort of rule of thumb guiding the people charged with making decisions, and protecting both the Garda and the accused.  The last related matter is the judge's charge to the jury which is something that should and could be reviewed in the context of this Bill on the basis that now would be a time to look at that issue and see whether improvements can be made.</P>
    <P>It was understood that the Minister had accepted in principle the Fine Gael amendments which seemed to meet the requirements of most sides in the House. The Labour Party had readily undertaken to take on board amendments at a later stage.  It would appear that the Minister in his appointment of the committee has narrowed the terms of reference under section 2.  For that reason the Minister has lost a great opportunity to meet the requirements of the Bill in a very real way and because of that restriction it is now necessary to press our amendments and follow through if necessary to support the Bill produced by the Labour Party.  This is simply the result of the restriction under section 2 of the terms of reference.  We have no quibble whatsoever with Judge Frank Martin who is renowned in his profession.  We have every confidence in his ability to do his job but we must point out that the terms of reference will restrict the ambit of inquiry of that commission to such an extent as to make the Minister's response unacceptable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to take this opportunity of thanking each of the Deputies who have contributed to this <Col N="2300" /> debate.  There were many points made in the debate with which I, for obvious reasons, do not agree.  However, I certainly respect the sincerity of the contributions that were made in the course of this debate over two weeks with the exception, that is, of one rather unfortunate remark from Deputy O'Dea but given the snide nature of that remark I do not think it even warrants comment on my part.</P>
      <P>Perhaps I should be complacent and satisfied with the response given by the Minister for Justice but I find it very hard to be satisfied on this occasion.  Perhaps there is some good news in that at least we will be back before this House within a matter of months looking at the whole question of criminal law, the law of evidence and trial procedures.  There is no guarantee in relation to that but certainly there is an aspiration in that direction.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister can justify coming half way to meet the demands of the Labour Party Bill.  Perhaps there is also truth in the adage that a week is a long time in politics.  The Minister who gave a very detailed statement to the House on Tuesday of last week seemed to express enormous generosity and enormous zeal for law reform, so much so that certainly in my discussions with people in the profession over the weekend I got the impression that they thought we had a new Minister for Justice in Deputy Burke.  Deputy Burke will accept that he would not, in the past, have been renowned for law reform or for aspirations in that direction but I think people genuinely believed, in relation to his contribution in this House at the opening of this debate last week that he was determined to grasp the opportunity the Bill presented to him to look at the whole situation in relation to the aspects outlined in the Bill.  He himself said, as most speakers who contributed to this debate have said, that there is absolutely no room for complacency in relation to the items covered by the Criminal Justice Bill, 1989 presented by me in this House. I certainly believe that if we wish not to be complacent we should have taken the opportunity presented by the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2301" /> The Minister has attempted to come half way, obviously under tremendous restraint within the Department of Justice in relation to what he has done.  I commend the Minister for the fact that there is a deadline in regard to the report which will emanate from the commission. The fact that it will be published is worthy of commendation.  Unfortunately, given the terms of reference, particularly the second term of reference in relation to convictions on the basis of uncorroborated confessions obtained in police custody, it would appear to unduly hinder the group of experts.  That is unfortunately a retrograde step in relation to the opportunity that is before this House to tackle the question of the obtaining of convictions on uncorroborated evidence. It is regrettable that the Minister had not been more open-minded and at least allowed the group of experts to report back to us and not fettered by the term of reference, as the Minister outlined to me this afternoon, that it will still remain possible to secure a conviction on the basis of uncorroborated confessions.  It is unfortunate that the Minister did not leave it to the group of experts to make recommendation on that aspect.</P>
    <P>An opportunity has been missed in relation to the group of experts because in his contribution last week the Minister outlined that he would be looking for a group of experts with relevant experience in these areas of law.  Unfortunately the committee is not broad based, whatever one might try to say about it.  Sadly, the criminal Bar is not represented on the committee.  This is a grave error of judgment because anybody in this House or legal circles will accept that we have at the Irish Bar practitioners who can hold their own with practitioners in criminal law the world over.  Other than the judge himself, who is a former practitioner, there is not a practitioner who has appeared either before the Central Criminal Court or the Court of Criminal Appeal.  We are lacking the breadth of vision that this committee would certainly need.  In that respect it is unbalanced. It is very unfortunate that the <Col N="2302" /> opportunity this Bill presented was not grasped.</P>
    <P>I was prompted originally, with the assistance of my colleagues in the Labour Party, to put this Bill before this House by the experience of the Guildford Four case.  Everybody in this country by now knows the facts of that case so obviously it is not necessary to reiterate them.  Suffice it to say that we learned from that case that miscarriages of justice can and do happen in one of the most sophistiated criminal justice systems in the world, the UK system.  If that is true, as we know it to be, we here cannot close our eyes to the possibility that the same deficiencies exist in our system to allow miscarriages of justice to take place.  Obvously we cannot afford to be complacent.  We cannot turn aside from the task of addressing those deficiencies with all the urgency at our command.</P>
    <P>Some people were of the view that this is an anti-Garda Bill.  I certainly would like to put it on the record of the House that this is not an anti-Garda Bill.  If anything it is totally misconstruing the Bill to interpret it in that way.  For my part and for the part of the Labour Party, nothing could be further from the truth. We have here a police force of which I believe we can be truly proud and no greater tribute can be paid to them at present than that their expertise is being employed in Namibia, a country in deep trouble.  That is fitting tribute to our gardaí and obviously it is a reflection of the standing in which they are held on the world stage.  The reality of the Guildford Four case was that the pressure of inflamed public opinion following a major atrocity was sufficient to inspire a conspiracy which reached several levels of the system of administering justice and that conspiracy resulted in the loss of liberty for 15 years for four innocent people.</P>
    <P>I listened to the Minister last week in this House and later that evening I heard him on television speaking in relation to the many matters of justice that were being discussed.  I did feel at that time that he was going to grasp the opportunity which presented itself.  Unfortunately <Col N="2303" /> that is not to be the case and, obviously, the Labour Party cannot withdraw the Bill before the House tonight.  In relation to the amendment put forward by Fine Gael I felt at the time it was put on the Floor of the House and described by Deputy O'Keeffe; that it lacked a certain degree of urgency but when I am faced with a choice between the Minister's expert committee and the amendment in the name of Deputy O'Keeffe it certainly brings to mind the work that the Law Reform Commission have done for this country in the last number of years.  That work has been excellent in its content and in its research and as a valuable facility for updating the laws here.  In the present situation the Law Reform Commission would perhaps present us with a far more comprehensive review of the matters <Col N="2304" /> under discussion in the Criminal Justice Bill, 1989.</P>
    <P>In that respect I would say to the House that I will support the Fine Gael amendment as opposed to what the Minister is suggesting.  It is regrettable that the Minister could not take the opportunity to give us a broader committee with more unfettered terms of reference.  In what he has done today in relation to restrictive terms of reference, in relation to what I would see as a non-representative group of experts, the Minister has fallen far short of what he outlined to the House and what looked like being a positive contribution to this debate on Tuesday of last week.  I regret that the Minister seems to have lost the initiative, whatever happened in the past seven days.  It is regrettable and I believe it is a missed opportunity.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The stage we had reached in this discussion was that the system of certification was to be effected by way of self certification.  Section 6 (4) effectively absolves a local authority from any responsibility for ensuring that the building regulations are as certified.</P>
      <P>The proposal contained in amendment No. 14 &mdash; which we were also discussing with amendment No. 12 &mdash; was that local authorities would carry out checks of certificates and documents and would monitor the effectiveness of the control system in their respective areas.  That was to ensure that we avoided circumstances in which a certificate of compliance would simply be brought into a local authority, lodged or filed away there and that would be the end of the story.  We wanted to avoid circumstances in which, if anything happened subsequently, the relevant local authority would not be accountable. If we do not have such a system of safeguard, the people concerned may have disappeared so that the owners of the building &mdash; be they householders, business people or whoever &mdash; would then have no redress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was disappointed to hear the Minister talk in negative terms about amendment No. 14 in the names of Deputy Shatter and myself.  We had a discussion about it prior to Private Members' time.  In the interval I was hoping the Minister might have had an opportunity of reflecting on what had been said and would be in a <Col N="2310" /> position to respond more positvely to that amendment now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Minister responds I want to make three points. I presume the Minister has availed of Private Members' time to check out some of the points raised prior to our resumption.</P>
      <P>I want to add two additional points. First, I too have consulted with some people who are here who have the broadest possible spectrum of representation &mdash; the Institute of Engineers, the Institute of Architects and people working in local authorities.  I should like to place on the record that there is broad agreement among them in regard to the validity of the amendment in the names of Deputies Gilmore and Shatter, on the basis that its provisions meet all of the concerns expressed.  As evidence of the unanimity expressed, they have cited the fact that such certificates as have been lodged with the major local authorities in Dublin and Cork in respect of the Multi-Storey Dwellings Act might well be in Chinese, or constitute extracts from the Koran as far as local authorities' officials are concerned; they are not being scrutinised in any shape or form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having regard to general human frailty &mdash; of which the Minister will be aware&mdash; as will any of us who has cousins in the United States &mdash; I should point out that the IRS in the United States probably is more feared than a combination of the CIA and the FBI by the ordinary American citizen.  In the United States self-certification obtains in respect of taxation &mdash; they do not have a PAYE system &mdash; with each individual having to fill up their personal taxation return form and do so with scrupulous regard to accuracy.  I invite Members to put themselves in the position of a professional on the design side or a reputable builder on the construction side, having to adhere to the requirements of the building regulations &mdash; which is what the provisions of this Bill require.  They would do well to remember that less than 1 per cent of federal income tax returns, self-certified, are scrutinised by the IRS.  The minority are scrutinised <Col N="2311" /> with rigorous precision and attention to detail.  This encourages the 99.9 per cent of people who are never investigated to adhere rigorously to the requirements of accuracy and truthfulness.  A professional designer or reputable builder who knows that his package of documentation lodged with the local authority may be subject to detailed scrutiny will be very concerned about its accuracy.</P>
    <P>The wording of the amendment in the names of Deputy Shatter and Deputy Gilmore may not be entirely acceptable to the Minister but this wording will simply reinforce regulations which the Minister will have to draft anyway.  He has some room for legal manoeuvre.  I would urge the amendment on the Minister because I do not see it as illegal in any manifest way.  However, if it appears so to him, then let him remove the illegalities and bring in an amendment on Report Stage which is the same in essence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I am anxious not to repeat what we said earlier, Amendment No. 14 in my name and that of Deputy Gilmore seeks to give some substance to the certification process.  It became popular in a recent American election for one candidate to ask &ldquo;Where is the meat?&rdquo;.  Here is the meat of the certification procedure. This provision for carrying out checks will mean that instead of lodging the certificate, which in some areas will be seen as a meaningless formality, people will know there is a risk that if the certificate is inaccurate checking procedures will find it out.  This is a serious amendment which has general support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 12 gives a right of recourse in circumstances where the local authority, acting as the building control authority, have not done their job.  There is a linkage between the two.  There is little point in conferring powers to monitor and carry out spot checks if an authority, to save money or for other reasons, decide not to carry out such checks and do not do their job properly.  There is a linkage between amendment No. 12, under which the local authority have a <Col N="2312" /> liability in the circumstances detailed in the subsection it seeks to amend, and the express obligation to carry out checks of certificates and documents, work in progress and completed buildings.  I would hope that the Minister would take a somewhat different approach from that he took earlier.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I considered the matter during the recess and I want to be as helpful as possible.  I would say to Deputy Quinn that I do not think I have any greater reliance on the professionalism or the reliability of certifiers and those who would be issuing and submitting certificates of compliance than he would. We are not at cross purposes there.  I have a very high regard for the level of professionalism in the disciplines we are talking about who would be involved in certification.  There is some implication in what has been said that people less worthy than those whom we would expect to be dealing with these certificates of compliance might be seeking to get around the regulations.  I do not think that is the case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The possibility of human error is always there.  We as a people do not regard ourselves as being tolerent of shoddy workmanship and people who are unreliable.  We have a very good record in regard to our professionalism in these disciplines, both at home and internationally. I would not like any impression to be given that there are people seeking to do other than what is proper in this area.  There is nothing in section 6 or anywhere in the Bill which would prohibit a building control authority from carrying out inspections of a certain percentage of the buildings which <Col N="2313" /> they would consider appropriate.  They would, however, be expected to discharge in a reasonable way the responsibilities which inevitably come with the powers conferred by this Bill.  I do not accept that the phrase suggested would add to this responsibility in any meaningful way and I regret that Deputies are persisting with the amendment.  It is superfluous and certainly out of line with other legislative codes for which I as Minister for the Environment am responsible.</P>
      <P>There are other reasons for opposing the amendment.  I have pointed out more than once that the persons actually involved in the construction process are those whom I regard as primarily responsible for the design and construction of a building.  The role of the State, discharged in this instance by the building control authority, is very much subsidiary to that carried by designers and builders. That principle must be enshrined and understood clearly.  This is the philosophy underlying the Bill and I would be very reluctant to amend it in any way which could be considered as altering that general principle.  The amendment we are debating would tend to do that and could also, wittingly or unwittingly, impose a burden of liability on local authorities which would be unfair and contrary to the public interest.  Do we wish to drag in that type of duty and responsibility for local authorities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought the Minister said liability did not arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it does not.  It stands on its own.  The whole thrust of the amendment has been to drag in local authorities to do things other than they should do.  Consequent on that is the liability.  I do not think that was ever intended and it certainly would be contrary to the legislative framework that exists in so far as the performing of responsibility of local authorities at present is concerned.  What would <Col N="2314" /> happen if someone was to argue that a particular building defect was attributable to a breakdown, however isolated, of the control system?  Would the building control authority then be responsible and liable for making good any damage&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;even though the defect was clearly due to the fault or oversight of the builder or the designer?  The advice given to me is that that is the position that this amendment would create.  I feel duty bound to oppose the amendment which could have that effect.  If that is the effect and if the indication I get from Deputy Quinn is that he does not wish that to be the case, then he must take the advice tendered that that would be the result of the amendment as put down by Deputy Shatter and Deputy Gilmore. Consequently I have to let it stand at that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I am extremely disappointed with the Minister's response. Those of us who spoke from the Opposition benches have attempted to be very reasonable in setting out our case.  We are almost at the end of the debate on section 6 of the Bill.  If we are left with a situation where all that is going to happen is that a certificate is going to be submitted to the local authority, stuck in a file&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>That is exactly what the Bill now provides for.  The local authority will have no obligation or responsibility to see to it that the regulations are being complied with.  The Minister can say that the local authorities are free to check the document that has been submitted and to carry out whatever inspections they may wish to carry out.  Local authorities are trying to carry out functions under a whole myriad of legislation, dating right back to the last century.  I think the local <Col N="2315" /> authorities have responsibility under more legislation than any other public authority in the State.  Here they are trying to carry out a whole range of functions. They are not, in reality, going to carry out the checks, inspections and so on that are necessary unless they are required to do so under the Bill.  I am certainly not happy with the position whereby we would end up here with a system of self certification, with no responsibility given to the local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister outlined the philosophy underlying this.  Having regard to what I read on the last debate on this issue &mdash; I do not want to get into a philosophical argument &mdash; it seems that the Minister is enunciating some kind of extreme Reaganite philosophy in this, that none of the State agencies will have involvement, that we are going to let it all happen and the local authority will simply be a receptacle for the certificates when they <Col N="2316" /> are submitted.  In those circumstances, I wish to press amendment No. 14.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 13 to amendment No. 12:</P>
      <P>After subsection (6), to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(7)  Persons or classes of persons submitting certificates of compliance shall submit to the building control authority evidence that they hold professional indemnity insurance appropriate to the building being certified.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment arises from the decision today to introduce a system of self-certification. In other countries, where <Col N="2318" /> systems of self-certification apply, there is a legal requirement that the certifiers should have insurance cover.  This amendment seeks to require those submitting certificates of compliance to produce to local authorities evidence that they have professional indemnity insurance in order to ensure that any of the subsequent owners of buildings will have some come-back should anything go wrong.  This is a fairly standard procedure in other countries where self-certification applies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill is concerned with building regulations and the means by which these regulations can be implemented.  It has nothing to do with insurance or insurance related issues such <Col N="2319" /> as liability.  It would, therefore, be wholly inappropriate to introduce such extraneous concepts into it.  This does not mean that persons who are not competent will be designated as certifiers.  I should like to remind the House that I am taking power in subsection (2) (c) of this section to designate the persons or classes of persons by whom certificates of compliance may be given.  I will ensure that only those persons who can adequately perform this certification function will be allowed to do so.</P>
      <P>As I have already indicated, I will be asking the building regulations advisory body to advise in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I am about to be hit by a feeling of political depression. When we were dealing with the Derelict Sites Bill the Minister constructively took on board amendments proposed by this side of the House.  The most depressing response we have had so far this evening was the last one from the Minister.  It is very much back into the realm of, &ldquo;Come on lads, give me a reason why I cannot go along with this amendment&rdquo;.  The Minister's back-up officials have provided him with the reason.  In the last division the Minister voted against the idea that local authorities should in any way be responsible for anything they might do in this area.  Now we have local authorities who may or may not, on their own initiative, monitor some of the works that are being carried out to check that they comply with the regulations.  They will accept certificates, and can do so unquestioningly, because it does not matter a damn whether they question their validity or not because they have no great liability in regard to them.  The Minister has told us that the certifiers are full of integrity and they are the people who have to get everything right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People who work in the different professions believe that those involved are full of integrity.  Those of us who are members of different professions try to <Col N="2320" /> work with a great deal of integrity and confidence but, unfortunately, on occasions we all come across people who do not have integrity.  Occasionally, surprise, surprise, we come across people who lack a great deal of competence. That is one of the reasons why solicitors are required by the Incorporated Law Society to have professional indemnity insurance.  If, for example, they make off with their client's funds, or behave in a negligent way, they are insured.  The person who is damaged by their actions has recourse.  Even if the solicitor disappears they may have recourse.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that the building regulations will provide for the certification of different people, be they individuals, persons or, as the Bill refers to, classes of persons able to certify.  What happens if the person certifying is a man or woman of straw?  What happens if they are in &ldquo;hock&rdquo; up to their kneecaps, if the house they are living in is mortgaged or of little capital value?  What happens is they do not have any real assets or, if they have them, they are not in this jurisdiction? What use is a certificate to a person who has moved into a building that collapses into the street or which is seriously defective?</P>
    <P>It is not good enough for the Minister to come back with the rather silly response that the legislation does not have anything to do with insurance.  I would have expected, if the Minister was to produce a reason why the amendment should not be accepted, that it would be a reason of more substance than the one he offered.  I do not with to bring any acrimony into a debate which, despite the technicalities, the difficulties we are dealing with and the differences of views, has lacked acrimony, but at 9.50 p.m., having started the debate at 4 p.m., some of us are entitled to be a little outraged at the rather foolish repsonse from the Minister.  I do not mean that in a personal way but in the sense of the advice that the Minister was given.</P>

      <P>The problem concerns the individuals who will not go to the expense of obtaining insurance cover.  The responsible people who get their certification right all the time will have insurance cover but the irresponsible person, the person who has problems operating in the area of his or her profession of certifying, will make a mess of it and will not have insurance cover.  It is possible that those people will not be in a position legally to compensate those who are detrimentally affected by their incompetence in dealing with the certification procedure.</P>
      <P>It seems that the intent is to put in place a Building Control Bill which lacks any real means of come back for a consumer who looks to it for protection.  I can understand the Minister wanting to protect local authorities from large claims arising out of their failure to operate the Bill properly although I think he is wrong. As a matter of principle, he may want to take the view that it should always be the certifier who is the responsible person and in no circumstances should local authorities be held liable.  That is wrong as the fact that one could be held liable will make a public body operate more effectively and efficiently than they would if they had a general immunity.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">

      <P>The rebellion in Eastern <Col N="2322" /> Europe is taking place because the populations of those countries have long since lost their confidence in any of their public bodies to carry out any of their functions properly.  All of their public bodies were immune from any recourse by the ordinary citizen when they proved to be incompetent in what they were doing.  If the response is that it would be the builder, the surveyor and the architect against whom one would have recourse, surely there should be substantial certainty in knowing that one would have recourse against the person who certified that what had been built complied with the regulations.  The only way there can be such certainty is by making it a requirement that the person designated as being able to certify should have professional indemnity insurance.</P>
      <P>I am sorry the Minister responded to this proposal by simply saying that this legislation has nothing to do with insurance.  When a new solicitor's Bill is brought before this House and Deputies on all sides speak about the need for professional indemnity insurance to ensure that clients who are badly treated have recourse, I do not expect the Minister for Justice to stand up and say that professional indemnity insurance has nothing to do with that either.  If he does he will be laughed out of the House.</P>

      <P>I find it extraordinary that the Deputy should introduce the question of that other discipline, the solicitors, into this debate.  I think the Deputy is skating on rather thin ice in that regard. He should not pursue it.  It is my understanding that the Deputy has been trying to put a smokescreen across this legislation in this regard ever since the first vote this evening.  Be that as it may, the approved certifiers could be disqualified from submitting certificates through the vehicle outlined in section 16 (7).  I think this would be adequate to deal with the matter in so far as getting certifiers to agree to do the job in a proper fashion is concerned.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister was prepared to consider some of the amendments we are proposing we could make a lot of progress.  The way I see it, this Bill seeks to protect the consumer.  What is the consumer left with to protect himself or herself?  They are left with the certifier, the builder, the architect, the surveyor or whoever was responsible for the building in the first place.  There would be no third party certification and no responsibility would be placed on local authorities.  Now we find there would be no requirement on the certifier to have <Col N="2324" /> insurance.  Where then would the consumer, the house buyer, turn to if something were to go wrong?  This section is being frittered away, the building regulations to be made under it will be meaningless and worthless.  I very much regret this.  If the Minister is prepared to give some consideration to the need to provide some protection and is prepared to come back on Report Stage with something of his own if he is not happy with the amendment, I will not press the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me make one final comment on this.  It might be interpreted that the Minister is being unreasonable in this matter.  If the certifier is negligent the owner of the building stands to lose a lot. He is the one who will be hurt.  If the building has to be changed, improved or even knocked down it is the owner of the building who is going to suffer the loss.  I see it in a slightly different way.  In those circumstances it is incumbent on the owner to ensure that he has a certifier of competence and good character.  The owner, who is the one person likely to suffer any loss would always have the opportunity to ask his certifier if he was indemnified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Suppose the owner is not the builder?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The argument can be reversed.  Why should we deem the local authority to be the ones to suffer liability or why should it be seen that it is the local authority who are seeking the certificate of indemnification?  If I were the owner, the employer and the one putting up the hard cash for a job I would have a quality architect and engineer.  If I were to ask him for a certificate of compliance I could easily say to him that I want his certificate of indemnification and if he cannot give it to me I will not take the risk with him. I like to see it that way and that is doing it in a much more even handed way in so far as local authorities are concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>We might try to confine ourselves to the amendment.  It is now 10 p.m. and we have been here longer than we intended.  Two things need to be said. First, what the Minister says is correct. What we are arguing for and the essence of the amendment could be taken on board and made part of the regulations. It could be made part of the regulations. <Col N="2326" /> It may very well be a recommendation that will come from the body which the Minister will set up to certify the certifiers. That may require that evidence of professional indemnity insurance for some categories of buildings would be required.  We have no undertaking that the BAC will do that and the amendment does not make it mandatory.  The Minister will write regulations having regard to this.</P>
      <P>There is some room for manoeuvre. The whole essence is, how does one guard the guardians?  I would draw the Minister's attention to the Cremer and Warner report which said in relation to the future of multi-storey buildings in report No. 87024:</P>
      <P>CWL recommend that the Government seek to enact legislation which requires all future multi-storey buildings to be designed to prevent both progressive (and disproportionate) collapse.  Local Authorities should be provided with the resources to monitor any self-certification system that new legislation may introduce, and be able to check, more fully, construction of new buildings, thereby providing a deterrent against inferior building practices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is it in a nutshell &mdash; a deterrent against inferior building practices.  We are not trying to crucify the local authorities. I know that senior officials are running around the Custom House telling the Minister not to let this section go through or else there would be a string of exposed local authorities who are not getting enough money as it is and there will be a whole pack of cards that might fall and that whatever else the Minister concedes, he should not concede on this. I can understand how that could be a worry, but that is not what we are about. We are about getting a balance between consumer protection and maintaining a high standard of construction across the country, and not just in the seven areas <Col N="2327" /> where in Dublin city we have a vibrant industry at the moment, all subject to building control.  I would hate to think what sort of cowboys would be in the city centre at the moment if we had the sort of self-certification system the Minister is talking about without the minimum deterrent we are looking for.</P>
    <P>The Minister should seriously consider introducing an amendment on Report Stage.  We will certainly do some more work on this and it is my intention to try to put down an agreed amendment for Report Stage to take on board some of the concerns that are being expressed. Deputy Shatter, Deputy Gilmore and I seldom agree, and certainly our parties do not always agree, but on this issue there is unanimity from this side of the House and that sort of unanimity should be taken on board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Quinn is an experienced parliamentarian accustomed to and versatile at using the ploy of Opposition unanimity in trying to move the Minister.  The Deputy has done this not always successfully but reasonably successfully on other occasions.  When the Deputy talks about unanimity on the other side of the House, that is not an indication of propriety in any sense of the word.  The Deputy has it wrong on this occasion in trying to offload the responsibility from where it should properly be.  If Deputy Gilmore buys a building without having put in place some checks and without having carried out checks on the person whom he regards as confident and from whom he is asking a certificate of compliance, then he is the one who is being negligent in protecting his own investment.  In fact Deputy Shatter made that point for me earlier today.  The Deputy strongly represented that point of view in another set of circumstances. The Deputies should take note of what Deputy Shatter says about people doing their own thing properly in their own best interests.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of amendment No. 13, based on that argument, we do not need these regulations at all. If one recognises the need and if the certifier is the person who will be the pinnacle of the procedure, then the certifier needs to be in the position where there is professional indemnity insurance.  Deputy Quinn made reference to the report of the task force on multi-storey buildings.  That report on page 32 says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is recognised that implementation of <Col N="2329" /> Building Regulations is of little value unless they can be effectively enforced. ... However, the effectiveness of the system is dependent on a high level of technical competence and professional responsibility among those certifying and would need a high degree of policing to support certifiers in carrying out their duties diligently.</P>
    <P>Apparently we will not have the high degree of policing because the Minister will not accept amendment No. 14 and we will not have the enforcement assured because we will not have indemnity insurance.  Rather than having to press this amendment this evening, will the Minister tell the House he is willing to go back to the Department and discuss the issue of professional indemnity insurance with a view to coming back on Report Stage to indicate that he is either willing to table an amendment to deal with it or that it is a matter that will be addressed in the regulations?</P>

I am quite happy to think about any amendment again but I do not want to mislead the House by indicating that I will bring in an amendment to satisfy the Deputies on Report Stage.  I will look at it.  I would hope that there would be reciprocity attached to this and that the Deputies might reflect on some of the points I made both on section 16 (7) and on the question as to where we really want the liability to rest.</P>

      <P>(2)  An Bord Pleanála, after consideration of an appeal under this section, shall either (as it thinks proper) refuse the appeal or allow the appeal subject, where it thinks fit, to the attachment, amendment or deletion of conditions.</P>
      <P>(3)  The Minister may, by regulations, specify&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the manner in which an appeal is to be made pursuant to this section.</P>
      <P>(b)  the time within which such appeals may be made,</P>

    <P>This is a new section which is being inserted to provide for the making of appeals to An Bord Pleanála where an applicant is not satisfied with the decision of the building control authority on an application relating to a fire safety certificate, to a certificate of approval or to a dispensation or a relaxation of certain provisions of building regulations.  The Bill as initiated did not provide for the making of appeals to An Bord Pleanála and the inclusion of a provision along these lines was strongly advocated by the building industry during consultations on the Bill.  It shows how available the Minister is to listen to good advice on these matters.  The view put forward was that not alone should a right of appeal exist on the grounds of natural justice but in the interests of consistency appeals should be heard by a centralised body which would be competent to adjudicate on the issues arising.  I accept the arguments and I am convinced that the use of An Bord Pleanála as the appropriate body will ensure that appeals will be properly and consistently determined.

    <P>The effect of this amendment is to delete subsection (5).  There are two reasons for this, the first being that I consider it is superfluous because of the wording in subsection (6).  Subsection (6) requires appropriate compliance with the terms of an enforcement notice and goes on to indicate when the notice will take effect in the different circumstances which may arise.  Subsection (5) also deals with when a notice will take effect where an appeal is lodged, but this also is provided for in subsection (6).  More importantly, subsection (5) as it stands in the Bill as initiated could serve to give effect to an enforcement notice irrespective of a decision of the District Court to annul it.

      <P>In page 11, lines 17 to 20, to delete subsection (8) and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(8)  Where a person fails to comply with the requirements of subsection (6), the building control authority may enter into any building or works to which the enforcement notice relates, and may enter any land necessary for that purpose, and therein take any action or do anything required by the notice.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment provides that the building control authority can enter into <Col N="2336" /> land as well as buildings for the purposes of subsection (6).  I consider it advisable to insert this amendment to preclude the possibility of the authority being denied access to a building by virtue of not being able to cross land to gain entrance.</P>
    <P>A typographical error is also being corrected &mdash;&ldquo;persons&rdquo; in line 17 is being changed to &ldquo;person&rdquo;.  A reference to &ldquo;works&rdquo; is also being inserted after building in line 18.</P>

      <P>This amendment inserts a reference to &ldquo;works&rdquo; after building and this is consistent with the previous amendment.  In addition, the word &ldquo;therein&rdquo; is being replaced with &ldquo;in relation thereto&rdquo; and this broadens the scope of the actions for which the building control authority may recover costs.  Costs will now be recoverable even if the actions must occur outside, rather than inside, the building or works concerned.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 22:</P>
      <P>In page 11, before section 8, to insert the following new section:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;8.&mdash;(1)  A person on whom an enforcement notice is served may, within fourteen days of the service of <Col N="2337" /> the notice, apply to the District Court to annul, modify or alter the notice on all or any of the following grounds&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) that the alleged failure to comply with the requirements of building regulations is not such as would warrant the service of an enforcement notice;</P>
    <P>(b) that compliance with the terms of the enforcement notice would occasion unreasonable expense;</P>
    <P>(c) that the time allowed by the building control authority for compliance with the notice is unreasonably short;</P>
    <P>(d)  that the appellant is not the person on whom the notice should have been served;</P>
    <P>(e) that the design or the building complies with the requirements of the building regulations.</P>
    <P>(2) Notice of an application pursuant to subsection (1) shall be served on the building control authority concerned and that authority shall be entitled to appear, be heard and adduce evidence at the hearing of the application.</P>
    <P>(3) On the hearing of an application pursuant to this section, the court may, as it thinks proper&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) confirm the enforcement notice, or</P>
    <P>(b) confirm the enforcement notice subject to such modifications, alterations or additions as the court thinks reasonable, or</P>
    <P>(c) annul the enforcement notice.</P>
    <P>(4) The jurisdiction conferred on the District Court under this section shall be exercised by the Justice of that Court having jurisdiction in the area where the building or works concerned are situated.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2338" /> This section sets out the procedure by which a person may apply to the District Court to have an enforcement notice annulled, modified or altered, the grounds on which it may be done and the powers of the court.</P>
    <P>The section is being substituted in its entirety for two reasons.  The first is to provide that simple compliance with building regulations will in itself be grounds for an application to the District Court.  This provision is now included at subsection (1) (e).</P>
    <P>My other reason for introducing this amendment is that I consider the impact of these decisions can be of general interest because of the national importance of building regulations.  It is desirable, therefore, that there should be a degree of standardisation in such decisions and I believe this can be best achieved by allowing an appeal to the Circuit Court from a District Court decision.  The section as now drafted will allow for such appeals.</P>

      <P>The Minister a short time ago drew our attention to the distinction between building regulations and building control and the advisory body he is proposing to set up, as I read section 13, confine themselves to advising him on the building regulations.  It would be desirable to have a body who would deal not only with building regulations but also with the whole area of building control. In view of the lengthy debate we had on section 6 which was essentially about the question of control, an advisory body whose terms of reference are wider than dealing just with the technical matters of building regulations and drawing on the many professional organisations, local authorities and various bodies who are involved in this whole area would be desirable and I hope the Minister takes it on board.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 42 in my <Col N="2347" /> name is more or less the same as Deputy Gilmore's.  It is a semantic difference, that is all.  To add to what Deputy Quinn said, the real meat and substance of what we are doing under this legislation is going to be contained in the regulations. It is not just the question of dotting an i or crossing a t.  These regulations are as fundamentally important in the area of building control legislation as were the regulations made under the Criminal Justice Act, 1984 in the area of criminal law.  When that Bill first came before the House it was subject to regulations and the usual annulling motion.  On reflection it was agreed, following debate in this House, that an affirmative motion would be the better way of dealing with it.  I ask the Minister in the context of this Bill to consider taking on board either Deputy Gilmore's or my amendment.  In giving the Minister that time to consider the matter, I propose withdrawing this amendment tonight and resubmitting it on Report Stage in the hope that the Minister will accept it at that stage.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="2348" /> In submissions made by the professional bodies and others in the building industry, concern was expressed that the provisions of the Bill as it stands might have the effect of extending their liability beyond that which exists at present.  They also expressed concern that a simple breach of the regulations might be used to found an action for damages, even where it was clear that they have been not negligent as such.  While I am advised that these fears are in all probability groundless, it is not difficult to see their origins given the climate of litigation in which today's society finds itself.  I wish to put on record that it is far from my intention that the Bill should extend civil liability in any way or that a statutory breach of the regulations, while being admissible as evidence in a civil court case, should be capable of being used to found a civil action.  Accordingly, I propose to insert this amendment in the Bill to make it absolutely clear that a simple contravention of any of the provisions of the Bill or the regulations will not automatically confer a right of action in civil proceedings.</P>

      <P>Deputy John Bruton gave me notice of his intention to raise on the Adjournment the subject matter of the importance of filling vacancies in the Higher Education Authority. Deputy Bruton has some ten minutes to present his case and the Minister has five minutes to reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Sir, the Higher Education Authority have a very important function to perform.  They advise the Government on the priorities for expenditure in higher education as we well know.  The Government had the opportunity under the EC Structural Fund to increase the level of investment in higher education and it is important that this should be done in a properly planned way and with the best possible advice available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Higher Education Authority consist of 18 members plus a chairman.  A quorum within the Authority for a meeting to take place legally is six.  At present there are only seven valid members of the Higher Education Authority out of a total possible membership of 19.  The bulk of the vacant places became vacant in May 1987.  The Minister has failed to fill those vacancies.  Four further vacancies fell due on 1 November.  Needless to say, the Minister, not having made up her mind for two and a half years to fill the other vacancies, has not filled these either.  We now have a situation in which there are only seven members valid to attend the body for which the quorum is six.  I understand that one of the seven members has not been a regular attender. It is probably correct to say that the person in question has not attended most of the meetings recently so the reliable <Col N="2353" /> membership is a bare quorum of six.  If any one of those members is ill or cannot attend and if the other regular non attender continues regularly not to attend meetings, the Higher Education Authority, duly called, cannot legally transact business.  This arises because the Minister for Education has apparently been unable to make up her mind as to who she wants to fill Government nominated places on the Higher Education Authority. This has created a situation which holds the Higher Education Authority up to ridicule.  It indicates that the Minister does not take the functions of the Authority seriously.  The Minister, as I said already, is unable to make up her mind about a relatively simple matter such as the filling of vacancies of this kind.  This has caused considerable concern among the staff of the Authority who fear that the Minister's procrastination in regard to filling vacancies indicates that, in fact, the Authority do not have a secure future and that the Minister is allowing them to wilt and wither away.  These fears may be entirely groundless but they are fears that are perfectly natural in view of the fact that the Minister has left places vacant for so long.</P>
    <P>I have initiated this debate in the hope that as a result of the publicity which I believe this instance of Government indecision deserves, the Minister will, at last, do her job and fill these vacancies and allow the Authority to continue their work without having a shadow over them as a result of the Minister's indecision.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. F. Fahey) Frank Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. F. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Education indicated in replies in this House to questions from Deputy Bruton on November 14 that the Higher Education Authority Act of 1971 assigns wide ranging functions to the Authority in relation to the development and expansion of higher education; the Minister also stated that, in making appointments to the Authority, the Government will have due regard to the interests of all <Col N="2354" /> sectors of higher education and to the desirable balance between academic and non-academic members within the requirements of the Act.</P>
      <P>The Higher Education Authority were set up on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis in 1968, and given statutory powers in the Higher Education Authority Act of 1971.  The principal functions of the Authority are: to further the development of higher education; to maintain a continuous review of the demand and need for higher education; to assist in the co-ordination of state investment in higher education and to prepare proposals for such investment; to review proposals from universities and designated institutions for capital and recurrent funding; to allocate among these institutions the grants voted by the Oireachtas; to promote an appreciation of the value of higher education and research; to promote the attainment of equality of opportunity in higher education and the democratisation of its structures and, finally; to recommend to the Minister the overall provision of student places to be made within the higher education system having regard to the need to maintain a reasonable balance in the distribution of the total number of students between the institutions of higher education.</P>
      <P>The Authority's range of operation covers the universities and those institutions designated by the Minister for Education under the terms of the 1971 Act.  Their advisory powers relate to the whole of the third-level sector.  In addition, the Authority have a funding role in relation to the universities and some designated institutions.</P>
      <P>The Schedule to the Higher Education Authority Act 1971 prescribes that the members of the Authority shall be a chairman and not more than 18 ordinary members of whom at least seven shall be academic members and seven shall be other than academic members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present there are seven serving members of the Authority one of whom has been appointed by the Authority as <Col N="2355" /> deputy chairman.  This situation has come about due to the recent retirement of the chairman on reaching the statutory age limit and the resignation or expiry of the term of office of a number of ordinary members.  I would wish to stress that the Authority are empowered to act nothwithstanding one or more than one vacancy in their membership and also in the event of the office of chairman being vacant.  Therefore the work of the Authority has been able to continue as normal while consideration is being given to the question of the filling of vacancies.  This matter is in progress and the Minister expects to be in a position at an early date to announce the appointments to the Authority.</P>
    <P>I should like to apologise for the absence of the Minister who is out of the country.  As Deputy Bruton pointed out, four members of the Authority retired on 1 November and, consequently, that is not an unreasonable time lag.</P>

      <P>Deputy Ferris <Col N="2356" /> gave me notice of his intention to raise on the Adjournment the refusal of the Minister for Education to appoint secretarial assistance at St. Anne's school, Tipperary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me to raise the subject of the secretarial assistance required by St. Anne's secondary school, Convent of Mercy, Tipperary.  I made representations through the normal channels to the Minister on this subject following agreement by the school to allow the permanent secretary, Mrs. Feeney, to take a career break.  The Minister's reply was as follows:</P>
      <P>Dear Michael,</P>
      <P>I wish to refer again to your recent representations on behalf of Sr. Patricia, St. Anne's School, Convent of Mercy, Tipperary regarding the payment of a temporary school secretary, Ms. Ann Fahey.</P>
      <P>The position is that the running of secondary schools, including the provision of secretarial assistance, is a matter for local management, towards whose expenses the Department of Education makes a contribution, principally in the form of the Per Capita Grant.</P>
      <P>The Department's contribution towards schools' operating costs was augmented in 1978 in the case of larger schools by the introduction of a scheme of grants for the employment of clerk-typists. However, the deterioration in the state of the public finances meant that a decision had to be taken in 1982 to phase out the scheme.  This phasing-out is continuing, as the financial situation remains serious.</P>
      <P>In these circumstances my Department cannot fund the salary of a replacement clerk-typist, whether a post has fallen vacant altogether or the permanent employee is on leave of absence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2357" /> I am sorry not to have better news for you.</P>
    <P>With best wishes, Yours sincerely, Mary O'Rourke, T.D., Minister for Education.</P>
    <P>Following that reply, I sought to raise the matter on the Adjournment.  St. Anne's, the secondary school of the Convent of Mercy, has 444 students divided into three first year classes, two second year classes, three fourth year classes, three fifth year classes, two senior cycle classes and three sixth year classes.  The school has 26 full-time teachers, lay and religious, and has the facility of employing three part-time teachers.  The principal works 11 hours and the vice-principal works 15 hours.</P>
    <P>When Mrs. Feeney, the permanent secretary, left on her career break the school management decided that a part-time secretary was essential to serve the school properly.  As there would not have been a cost to the Department they were shocked to learn that the Minister and the Department refused to pay her replacement, Ann Fahey.  The management board, from their own resources, have tried to keep going in the meantime but, unfortunately, they will be forced to discontinue her services unless the Department agree to pay their share.  If Mrs. Feeney had not taken a career break her salary would have been paid unless, of course, agreement had been reached to phase out her services. However, no such agreement was reached.  Does this mean that it is possible for Mrs. Feeney to subcontract her services to Miss Fahey? Perhaps the Minister will consider that aspect and confirm that it can be done.  The Department and most sectors in the Civil Service allow people to take career breaks and, as good employers, the Convent of Mercy could not refuse the request from Mrs. Feeney.</P>
    <P>This has now become a matter of principle in the Department and not one of additional expenditure by them.  I hope <Col N="2358" /> the Minister will be positive in his response to a very serious problem which will affect the school, particularly at examinations, where it is essential to have secretarial assistance.  Otherwise an unfair workload and additional responsibility will be laid on the shoulders of the principal, the vice-principal and other teachers in the school who would be required to give secretarial assistance to the children and their parents in addition to their normal teaching responsibilities.</P>
    <P>As St. Anne's has an excellent record, this is a very unfair imposition by the Minister and the Department.  It could affect the morale of the teachers and create a major worry for the parents. The Sisters and teachers of the school would like me to thank the Department of Education for their otherwise generous financial assistance in the form of the <i>per capita</i> grant.  However, the unfair decision in connection with secretarial assistance is regrettable and I hope that the Minister will say whether it is possible for the school to allow the permanent secretary to be formally paid by the Department and she could, in turn, subcontract the services of the temporary secretary.  That would overcome the problem and conform with the Department's guidelines.  If the Minister agreed to that the school would appreciate the generosity of the Department which has always been forthcoming in all other areas of the <i>per capita</i> grant.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. F. Fahey) Frank Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. F. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>A scheme for the provision of clerical assistance in national and secondary schools was introduced on 1 April 1978.  The objectives of the scheme were to make better provision for the administration and servicing of schools and to create additional employment opportunities.  They were introduced as part of the job creation programme of the then Government and to provide limited State assistance in an area which had not previously benefited from any direct aid.  At the peak of the <Col N="2359" /> scheme there were 585 clerk typists employed.  Incremental scales of pay replaced the original flat rates of grant. These factors contributed to an escalation in costs.  What was originally conceived as a modest contribution to job creation in the educational sector soon became a sizeable area of State expenditure.</P>
      <P>It was in that context that a decision to phase out the clerk typists scheme by not filling vacancies was adopted in connection with the preparation of the Estimates for Public Services in 1983.  That was confirmed in the Budgetary Statement of the Minister for Finance on 9 February, 1983.  That decision was conveyed to the boards of management of national schools and the managers of secondary schools by circular letter in April 1983. The phasing out of these non-teaching posts in schools must not be viewed in isolation, but rather as part of the Government's overall strategy to contain public service numbers while, at the same time, maintaining essential services.  The Government had hoped that vacancies which arose under the phasing out arrangements could be filled by recourse to the social employment scheme administered by FÁS.  However, in practice, the union representatives on the social employment scheme monitoring committee objected to the use of the scheme in such cases.  Therefore, the social employment scheme has been of less benefit to schools than we had hoped.</P>
      <P>In the case of St. Anne's secondary school, Tipperary, sanction for the establishment of a clerk typist post was given by my Department with effect from 14 August 1978.  The present employee took up duty in that school on 19 January 1981 until taking a career break on 1 May 1989.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A scheme of career breaks for clerk <Col N="2360" /> typists serving in schools was introduced by my Department with effect from 1 March 1987.  The scheme was in line with the scheme of career breaks operated by the Civil Service generally and allowed for one or two breaks to be taken totalling a maximum period of five years.  The scheme was introduced to allow clerk typists take a break from employment without resigning from their posts.  At the end of the career break a clerk typist may return to her post or the career break may be extended as long as the total does not exceed five years.  Because of the embargo on the replacement of staff who resign the career breaks scheme could be introduced only on the basis that clerk typists taking such leave of absence would not be replaced.</P>
    <P>In the light of the circumstances I have outlined, I regret it is not possible for me to sanction a replacement clerk typist for St. Anne's secondary school, Tipperary, while the person employed is on a career break.</P>
    <P>I should say that the problems created by the employment embargo in the Civil Service affect schools throughout the country.  I sympathise with the case made by Deputy Ferris.  There are many similar cases around the country, not least in my constituency.  Unfortunately, because of the discipline imposed on us by the public service embargo, we simply do not have any room to manoeuvre in this case. Therefore, it is not possible to accede to the Deputy's request for a sub-contracting of the post not provided for under the embargo scheme.  Consequently, it is with regret that I must inform the Deputy that it is not possible to accede to his request.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 11 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 30 November 1989.</P>

      <P>A major package of incentives designed <Col N="2156" /> to promote investment in the expansion and renewal of the Irish merchant fleet was introduced in 1987.  This included the enactment of the Shipping Investment Grants Act, 1987 under which grants of up to 25 per cent might be made available to Irish shipowners towards the purchase of new or secondhand ships of less than seven years old.  To date grants of £3.16 million have been paid or committed towards the cost of six new ships.</P>
      <P>The rate of corporation profit tax payable by Irish shipping companies has been reduced from 50 per cent to 10 per cent and shipping companies are now eligible to avail of the investment potential of the business expansion scheme.  The latter facilitated the purchase of two vessels. The National Development Corporation can invest in viable shipping projects and the IDA can assist shipping-related service projects such as, for example, ship management and consultancy services.</P>
      <P>Within the European Community, the EC Commission presented in June 1989 a major package of proposals designed to improve the competitiveness of Community merchant fleets <i>vis-à-vis</i> their third country shipping.  The substantial decline in EC shipping capacity over the last decade resulted mainly from the worldwide recession in demand.  Hard-pressed shipowners were in many cases forced to reduce costs by transferring their ships to international registers which enabled the employment of lower paid non-European seafarers and were less stringent in safety enforcement.  The &ldquo;positive measures&rdquo; put forward by Commissioner Van Miert are currently under discussion at Community level and featured prominently at the recent Transport Council in Luxembourg.</P>
      <P>The principal elements of the package include proposals to:</P>
      <P>1.  Set up an EC register for all member state ships over 500 dwt.</P>
      <P>2.  Promote research and development in new technology on board ships.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2157" /> 3.  Reciprocal recognition of seafarers' qualifications by member states.</P>
    <P>4.  Reciprocal recognition of equipment certificates (for example, life saving appliances).</P>
    <P>5.  Tax concessions on seafarers' income and social costs in return for lower gross wage levels.</P>
    <P>6.  Improvement of the proportion of food aid shipments carried by Community vessels.</P>
    <P>7.  Expansion of port state control inspections to include working conditions of the crew.</P>
    <P>Ireland has welcomed the proposals and will make every effort during the forthcoming Irish Presidency to ensure that agreement is reached between the member states on the early implementation of as many as possible of these important measures.</P>
    <P>I shall be meeting with Commissioner Van Miert in the near future to discuss the package and to determine the most effective way of progressing the proposals.</P>

This amount includes expenditure proposed by Foynes Harbour Trustees on the erection of mooring dolphins and shore connections and new cargo handling equipment.  The Foynes harbour improvements have been included in the <i>National Development Plan 1989-1993</i> but the actual aid which will be provided cannot be decided until the peripherality programme is approved by the EC.  This approval is expected before the end of December 1989 and it is hoped to provide some EC aid for the Foynes developments in 1990.</P>

      <P>A review of the safety aspects of public passenger transport has, in effect, been on-going since 1987 when my predecessor established the ferry safety committee. The committee is chaired by my Department's chief surveyor and includes representatives from both Irish ferry companies.  The committee reviews safety procedures and standards on board Irish registered ferries, considers any measures necessary to improve safety and makes recommendations, as appropriate, to the ferry operators and to myself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The committee meets at least six times each year and its work is on-going.  To date the committee has examined the report of the formal inquiry into the <i>Herald of Free Enterprise</i> casualty and has recommended the implementation, where appropriate, of its recommendations here.  Regulations governing such matters as the closing of watertight doors, supplementary emergency lighting, closed circuit television surveillance, <Col N="2165" /> the weighing of goods vehicles and passenger boarding cards were subsequently made to implement the committee's recommendations.  The committee has also examined damage control arrangements and plans shipboard and shorebased management and stability standards in respect of Irish-registered ferries. Its work programme in the short-term includes review of life-saving and fire appliances, fire protection and detection, training and cargo handling and security arrangements.</P>
    <P>In addition to conducting specific reviews of safety arrangements on board passenger ferries, the committee also monitors closely developments at international level and particularly those agreed by the International Maritime Organisation, the United Nations agency responsible for safety of life at sea, in order to ensure the smooth and effective implementation of new or revised international requirements governing passenger ferries.</P>
    <P>Foreign registered passenger vessels operating from Irish ports are inspected regularly by my survey staff at least every six months, under the provisions of the Memorandum of Understanding on Port State Control.  The latter is an agreement between the maritime authorities of fourteen European countries aimed at ensuring that ships comply with international safety, pollution prevention and other standards.  All deficiencies found during inspection are reported to the Port State Control Computer Centre at St. Malo, France.  In addition, vessels may be detained to rectify deficiencies, allowed to proceed to the next port where the deficiencies must be rectified or given 14 days to rectify the deficiencies, depending on their gravity.</P>
    <P>Finally, my Department will examine as soon as possible the draft regulations introduced by the UK authorities in the wake of and any subsequent recommendations arising from the report of the formal investigation into the casualty involving the pleasure cruiser <i>Marchioness</i> which took place on 20 August last.  Where practicable, I would intend to implement similar initiatives here as <Col N="2166" /> part of an on-going programme designed to ensure that Irish registered passenger vessels and those serving Irish ports comply with the highest international safety standards.</P>

      <P>Developments in relation to the spillage have been outlined to the House on a number of previous occasions and in this regard I would refer the Deputy to the replies given to parliamentary questions by my predecessor on 18 February 1988 and 21 June 1988 and by the Minister for the Environment on 3 February 1988.</P>
      <P>The general environmental and health aspects of the matter lie within the remit of the local authority and health board concerned.  The Fisheries Research Centre of my Department have carried out a number of analyses of samples of eels, trout and sediment from the rivers in question at the request of those bodies and the results have been communicated to them.  It is for those bodies to assess and act on general environmental and human health implications.</P>
      <P>As regards the fishery dimensions which is my primary concern in the matter, there is no evidence that any fish mortalities have occurred as a result of the spillage in question or that there is any threat to fish life.</P>

      <P>It is assumed that the Deputy is referring to the ERDF Special Border Areas Programme 1986-1990.  This programme covers counties Donegal, Leitrim, Sligo, Cavan, Monaghan and Louth and provides ERDF aid of £24.754 million for energy and tourism measures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The energy measures aided under the programme are work in County Louth on <Col N="2170" /> the provision of the natural gas pipeline from Dublin to Dundalk.  The ERDF aid allocated to this project was £11.684 million. A further amount of £5 million ERDF aid was reserved under the programme for a possible westward extension of the gas pipeline.</P>
    <P>On the tourism side, the measures aided under the programme are tourism promotion, the provision of tourist amenities and infrastructure and access roads.  Lists of the projects approved for implementation under the programme was given in the reply to Question No. 46 on the Order Paper for 8 November 1989.</P>
    <P>ERDF aid of £0.550 million was allocated in the programme for promotional measures.  Many of these embrace more than one county and consequently it is not possible to provide a breakdown of the aid by county.  Aid of £0.025 million was allocated for the provision of informational plaques, and it is not possible to provide a breakdown of this amount by county either.  The following shows the amount of aid allocated to each county in respect of tourist amenities and infrastructure and access roads.</P>

However, in principle the system for payment of VAT at point of import would have to be discontinued.  In that event there would be a once-off cash flow loss of about £140 million (in 1988 terms) in the first year.  This loss is not included in my Department's figure of £600 million which is the estimated annual ongoing cost of approximation of indirect taxes under the EC Commission's present proposals.</P>

The Commission had proposed a standard VAT rate falling in the band 14 to 20 per cent.  More recently, it put forward the idea of a minimum VAT standard rate of 15 per cent.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 51 and 52 together.</P>
      <P>This year I succeeded in obtaining an increased allocation of intervention beef from the EC for distribution to the most needy welfare categories.  As a result it has been possible to extend the scheme substantially and accordingly some 120,000 people have benefited under the 1989 arrangements compared with less than 50,000 in 1988.</P>
      <P>The overall quantity of beef available is strictly limited, however, and thus it has been necessary to identify specific beneficiaries in consultation with the Department of Social Welfare.  The 1989 scheme, therefore, was restricted to: (1) recipients of long term unemployment assistance and equivalent FÁS trainees; (2)  recipients of long term supplementary welfare allowance; and (3) hostels and day-centres providing means for homeless people.</P>
      <P>The conditions of the free beef scheme, including the matter of eligibility, are reviewed each year and I will be seeking to extend its application even further in future years.  The increase in the numbers eligible for this year's scheme demonstrates the Government's clear commitment to expand the scheme to the maximum possible extent.</P>

      <P>Grants from funds available to my Department for assisting voluntary organisations in Britain which provide welfare services for Irish emigrants are made by me on the advice of DION, the London based committee which advises me on emigrant welfare matters in Britain.  The amount allocated for grant assistance was doubled from £250,000 in 1988 to £500,000 in 1989.  Applications for assistance far exceed available resources.  At present DION are examining a number of applications in connection with the allocation of the remainder of the 1989 funds.  I understand that one of these is from the Kerryman's Association.</P>
      <P>DION's priorities in targeting the available resources are:</P>
      <P>(a) Those organisations employing professional workers operating front line emergency services for emigrants arriving without accommodation and/or employment;</P>
      <P>(b) Information projects examining the needs of disadvantaged emigrants, and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(c) Ventures developing links between voluntary bodies helping Irish emigrants in Britain and local authorities and statutory agencies with <Col N="2179" /> responsibility for welfare and accommodation needs at local level.</P>
    <P>I understand that DION have received several applications for projects involving a capital element similar to the one sponsored by the Kerryman's Association.  It would clearly not be possible to fund all such projects from the DION grant.  I know also that many voluntary groups working with and on behalf of Irish emigrants in Britain agree with DION's approach as they believe that the funding of the capital costs of accommodation provision should properly be the responsibility of the relevant local authority.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">

      <P>Under existing legislation, unemployment assistance is payable from <Col N="2180" /> age 18.  The income needs of young people between the ages of 16 and 18 were examined by the Commission on Social Welfare which took the view that young people should be encouraged to remain at school as long as is practicable and the commission would not support any form of income maintenance which could in any way encourage them to leave the education system prematurely.</P>
      <P>The various benefit and assistance payments made by my Department and the health boards include increases in respect of dependent children which are payable until they reach the age of 18 or higher if they are in full-time education.  Supplementary welfare allowance may be paid directly to persons under the age of 18 who are not supported by a parent or guardian.  In addition, FÁS provides a Youthreach programme for school leavers under 18 years which guarantees them up to two years co-ordinated and integrated training, work experience and temporary employment.  The programme is full-time and available all the year round.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">

      <P>Payment of unemployment assistance at the long-term rate is payable in respect of any day of proven unemployment which forms part of a continuous period of interruption of unemployment during which the applicant has received payment for at least 390 days.  Section 135 (2) of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981 <Col N="2181" /> defines a continuous period of interruption of employment as any two periods of unemployment not separated by an interval of more than 20 weeks.</P>
      <P>In 1985 the legislation was amended to provide that periods of participation of up to one year in certain training and employment schemes were to be disregarded in determining whether any two periods of unemployment may be treated as continuous.  The schemes covered include the social employment scheme and any course provided or approved by AnCO, which since 1 January 1988 has been incorporated with the National Manpower Service and the Youth Employment Agency in FÁS.  The effect of this is that any person in receipt of the long-term rate of unemployment assistance who participates in one of the specified schemes for a period of up to one year will qualify for the long-term rate of unemployment assistance when he or she again &ldquo;signs-on&rdquo; within a period of 20 weeks from the date of finishing on the scheme.</P>
      <P>The purpose of disregarding such periods is to remove the disincentive which might otherwise exist for claimants wishing to participate in the social employment scheme or FÁS training courses. This consideration does not arise in the case of persons committed to prison.</P>

I have made arrangements to recruit further testers to bring the permanent corps up to 60 and additional temporary testers on a contract basis in order to reduce the waiting periods for tests to an acceptable level as soon as practicable.</P>

The local authority is then required to seek sanction for additional works over and above those specified in the contract. In accordance with the current national programme of community interest for roads, progress on major road schemes is vetted by a monitoring committee on which the Department of Finance is represented.</entry>
