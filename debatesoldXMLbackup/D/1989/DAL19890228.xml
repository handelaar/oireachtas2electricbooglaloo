    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he intends to convey to the British prime minister the fact that Irish public opinion deplores remarks recently made by successive politicians in the United Kingdom which have contributed to the atmosphere in which innocent people have been killed in Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the statement I issued on 13 February following the murder of Mr. Patrick Finucane.  My views were conveyed to the British government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach if that statement was the only way in which he conveyed his views to the British government?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, our Ambassador took the matter up with the British authorities in London.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach if there has been any reaction from the British government?  Does the Taoiseach <Col N="1586" /> feel that his statement has hit the mark in any sense?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope it was taken note of.  It was a very unhappy incident and I felt it necessary to underline the seriousness of anything any of us say in a Northern Ireland context.  I hope it had the necessary impact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach if he intends to have this matter raised specifically and explicitly at a meeting of the Anglo-Irish Conference because I suggest it is a channel through which sensitivities can be fully explored and explained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is one of the aspects of the conference that is of some importance.  The matter had already been raised by us through the Anglo-Irish Secretariat before the killing of Patrick Finucane.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach the guidelines, if any, which were issued to members of his Government on taking office, regarding involvement in firms in which they or their families may have a financial interest; the measures which are taken to ensure that these guidelines are adhered to; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if any Minister or Minister of State in his Government currently holds company directorships on (a) a remunerative basis and (b) a non-remunerative basis; the Ministers or Ministers of State who, on taking office, informed him that they were resigning company directorships; the directorships from which they resigned; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 3 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In accordance with the practice of successive Administrations over many years, Ministers and Ministers of State were <Col N="1587" /> informed, officially and individually, on taking up office, that they should not engage in activities that could reasonably be regarded as interfering or being incompatible with the duties of their offices; and that Ministers should draw to the attention of Government any matter before Government in which they or their family have a material interest, and should not participate in decision-making in the matter unless the Government decide otherwise.</P>
    <P>The Ministers and Ministers of State concerned resigned their directorships on taking up office.  Minister of State, Deputy Frank Fahey, who submitted a letter of resignation as director of a company in March 1987 is, however, still nominally registered as a director of the company which ceased trading almost two years ago, having discharged all its liabilities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his reply to Questions Nos. 2 and 3.  May I ask him if there is any procedure the Taoiseach follows to ensure adherence to the guidelines.  I appreciate that guidelines exist?  Is there any procedure whereby a Minister or Minister of State is obliged to inform the Government with regard to directorships held, whether remunerative or non-remunerative, and if he holds a register of such interests?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The procedure is that all Ministers are informed of the requirement and it is left to their judgment to comply with that requirement.  I do not keep any note or register of ministerial interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not agree that it would be in the best interests of all concerned if such a register was kept and if Ministers and Ministers of State were not only informed of the principles which exist but also be placed under an obligation to make known, at least to the Taoiseach, their interests and whether they had disposed of them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1588" />
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite sure any Minister would regard himself or herself as being honour bound to inform the Taoiseach of anything they thought might in any way affect this issue, but subject to that, as I said, the procedure is laid down, everybody is informed of the position and what they must do, and after that they are expected to adhere to it. That has been the way for a long time.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I have no reason to believe that it is not.  I will avail of this opportunity to remind everybody again of the obligations.  As the Deputy knows, there is always a possibility of the resignation of a directorship or something of that nature which might not necessarily be followed through as a formality.  In order to ensure that there is no question of anything of that nature occurring, I shall see that the instruction is again brought to everybody's attention.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will make arrangements for the Central Statistics Office to carry out a survey to ascertain the level of emigration in the past year (a) nationally (b) by county of origin and (c) by age group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. V. Brady) Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. V. Brady)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. V. Brady)</NameTxt>
      <P>The only reliable figures for net migration are those based on censuses of population. The Central Statistics Office, however, have for some years made estimates of annual net migration based on population estimates and data on births and deaths. Such an estimate for the year to mid-April 1989 will, in accordance with normal practice, be available during August next.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Central Statistics Office have been exploring the possibility of estimating directly emigration flows through additional questions in the annual labour force surveys which cover a sample of <Col N="1591" /> some 45,000 households.  The eventual outcome using this new format will be assessed over the next few years to see whether reliable estimates are possible on this basis.  In the meantime, no other change in existing well-established practice in assembling these statistics is envisaged.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised that the Taoiseach did not answer that question himself.  He was quite capable of doing so.  I wonder if the action taken in the context of the labour force surveys is such as to give the kind of information I have asked for.  I asked about emigration by county of origin and by age group. Secondly, apart from the initiatives mentioned by the Minister of State, which we already know, are there plans to take any other action to identify the level of emigration?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated in my reply, a change has taken place in the format used in 1989 as far as the labour force survey is concerned.  This refers specifically to people who have left households during the year.  It is envisaged that this information will be very useful and beneficial and will lead to reasonably accurate figures being available on emigration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister of State not think it unsatisfactory, to say the least, that it will not be until August of this year that we will have any information for a period ending in the middle of last year?  Would he not further agree that much more accurate and up to date information would be essential?  Finally, would he not agree that on the evidence of net passenger movement, the net outward movement in 1988 was some 40,000 greater than in the previous year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>The normal practice is to use the annual estimate taken.  I am sure the Deputy would quite understand and appreciate that it would be virtually impossible to have a census other than on an annual basis.  I am quite satisfied <Col N="1592" /> that the information I have already imparted will give the position so far as accurate figures are concerned.</P>
      <P>The Central Statistics Office are equally anxious that such information should be accurate to the level of 100 per cent. I share the Deputy's views with regard to the attaining of that situation.  I am quite satisfied that the position at the moment is reasonably accurate, but if we can do anything to improve it that will be done. This matter is being dealt with on a continuous basis.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister of State not agree that since he is relying on annual labour force surveys based on a sample of 45,000 households, it would be more directly relevant if a sample of a similar size were taken in relation to people travelling into and out of the country?  Would he not agree that that would give a far better and more readily usable picture of what is actually happening? Would the Minister not agree that it is nonsensical that one person coming into and going out of this country seven times a year is taken as 14 travellers?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Food, in view of the fact that Aujeszky's disease in pigs has been eradicated wholly from Denmark and partially from the United Kingdom and a national Aujeszky's disease eradication programme has recently been introduced <Col N="1595" /> in Holland, and in view of the fact that Aujeszky's disease is costly and that our future exports market for pigs and pigmeat could be affected if our European neighbours eradicate it, his Department's policy on Aujeszky's disease eradication in Ireland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy) Michael O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>When Aujeszky's disease emerged as a significant problem in pig production some years ago, my Department permitted the importation of an inactivated vaccine as a control measure. This vaccine has been widely used in pig herds here and vaccination has had the effect of limiting the effects of the disease. A new vaccine has very recently come on the market which has the advantage that it is now possible, on the basis of tests, to distinguish between the actual disease and vaccine virus.  I have recently issued licences for the importation of this new vaccine, which could be a useful aid to producers in eradicating the disease.</P>
      <P>I am conscious of developments in other EC member states, but as there is no evidence that the disease is transmitted in meat, trade in pigmeat is not at risk.  Developments in relation to this disease at EC level and elsewhere will continue to be closely monitored.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  However, according to the FAO and the World Health Organisation there is no evidence that natural hormone implants in beef cause any problems in humans but consumer demand insists that we produce hormone-free beef.  I am worried whether in relation to Aujeszky's disease and our pigmeat exports in the future, consumer demand will insist on Aujeszky-free pigmeat.  I am sure the Minister will agree that we need to increase our pigmeat exports to ensure a future for our producers and processors. Will the Minister assure me that he is contemplating a compulsory vaccination programme to bring us in line with our main competitors in Europe in relation to pigmeat production?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course the disease can be activated in the live animal and for that reason can affect the breeding and reproductive capacity of the animal. In that connection I want to assure the Deputy that the disease can be controlled by vaccination.  As recently as January 1989 we revised our licensing arrangements to provide for the importation and distribution of new G. 1 deletion marker vaccines which enable laboratory tests to distinguish between field virus and vaccine virus.  While we do not have the capacity or personnel to have a slaughtering policy, I assure the Deputy that if there is any trace or suspicion of this disease in animals, our present strict regulations will be even more strict.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to comment on the countries mentioned by the Deputy but the incidence of the disease in those countries has been very much higher than ours.  In all pig-related diseases we have the highest possible standards in terms of outbreak.  Therefore, it is not a question of bringing ourselves into line with the countries mentioned.  If we were to embark on an eradication scheme such as the ones applying in some of the countries referred to, there would have to be an extensive survey of the whole country to establish the level of clinical disease as well as that of inapparent infection and the presence of AD virus in animals but not giving rise to clinical systems of the disease.  As the Deputy will appreciate, such a survey would require enormous resources.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Food the way in which he envisages a planned beef industry, having regard to the seasonality of supply particularly when there is a question of serving the premium outlets in Europe, that is, the supermarkets and hypermarkets which require supplies all year round; and, considering the seasonality in Ireland, if the industry can develop the processing sector thus increasing the added value and job creation content.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1598" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The seasonal supply of cattle to meat factories is determined primarily by the relative profitability of the different cattle production systems. Last year I succeeded in getting EC Commission agreement to extending the date for eligibility for the suckler cow premium from 30 November to 31 January and the premium will be increased from £38 to £51 from 3 April.  With the termination, also from that date of the UK variable premium, for which only prime cattle qualified, the differential between factory prices for maiden and once-calved heifers should disappear.  These developments will improve the relative profitability of once-calved heifer systems of production and heifers which produce calves before 31 January will be available for slaughter during the following spring.</P>
      <P>Cattle supplies in Europe are expected to be tighter over the next few years and this should present an opportunity to any factories to obtain more year-round markets, thus reducing the problem of seasonality.  I believe that much can be achieved by meat factories through their pricing policies and I would urge them to look to their longer-term interests as well as their immediate ones in framing them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinPGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the number of cattle slaughtered in May last year was in the region of 27,000 and that the figure was 170,000 in October? At present winter fatteners are losing up to £100 per head and all the support systems are geared towards the grazing season.  Has he any plans to alleviate this?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy will listen to an objective presentation I will proceed.  By any standards last autumn's prices were a record and after the winter <Col N="1599" /> fattening season one would require a 10 per cent to 15 per cent increase over the autumn figure.  Given the record prices obtaining last autumn, it is pretty evident that it would literally have been taking a big risk to try to achieve that level of profit.  That is the first point.  Secondly, I am glad to be able to tell the Deputy, despite what one might call the reduction which is now evident arising from the record prices that there is a number of reasons for believing that cattle prices will improve in the very near future.  Let me indicate what these are.  First, the green rate adjustment of 1.55 per cent applied as and from 27 February and this of course will also affect intervention prices as well as reducing the negative effects of MCAs.</P>

Fourthly, and Deputies should be aware of this, farmers' optimism on the future of beef production is reflected in the prices they are prepared to pay for calves, which continue at a very high level.  Despite the fact that veal production is going down I am glad to be able to tell the House, following on a question asked of the Taoiseach in relation to cattle supplies &mdash; Deputies will recall that I told the House that the cattle population increased for the first time in five years last year &mdash; that in about one hour's time the results of another survey will be published by the Central Statistics Office which will contain very good news in relation to our cow, heifer and calf numbers and all other matters that Deputies are concerned about.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Director of ERAD has informed me that while the terminology used to date to express disease levels has been strictly in accordance with normal epidemiological procedures its complexities have given rise to a certain amount of misunderstanding.  The various procedures for reporting disease levels are currently being reviewed by ERAD with a view to establishing an appropriate and clearly understood measurement for monitoring the progress of the current round.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I note that the language used by the Minister, and the euphemism, has given rise to a misunderstanding. Therein speaks an awful lot but we will not go through that now.  Could the Minister indicate, as I feel he knows a little bit more than what he is telling me, which of the four sets of figures, the level of incidence or prevalence, the number of <Col N="1601" /> animals per thousand or the level of disease as measured by the number of reactors divided by the number of cattle, will we be talking about and will we be able to make a comparative analysis to enable us to know whether the new ERAD programme is being effective in eradicating the disease?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I have to admit that the Deputy appears to have a keen enough knowledge of the methods of measurement used.  As the Deputy knows, ERAD are carrying out a review to draw up the most appropriate method of disease measurement in which we all have a common interest.  As the Deputy has quite rightly pointed out, there are two different methods.  The level of incidence is measured by the total number of new cases identified during a specified testing period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should spare us the definitions.  I already know them. Which system?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The other method of measurement is the level of prevalence and as it happens both of these methods have their deficiencies and we acknowledge this.  Comparisons based on year by year figures are inaccurate regardless of what method of measurement is used.  It is for that reason that I have asked ERAD to undertake this review so as to draw up proper standards against which guaranteed and reliable measurement can be made when comparing the figures for one year against another</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Finally, can the Minister tell me if I am correct in taking from his replies, that as of now, with the new ERAD programme under way, there is no agreed method for the measurement of the level of tuberculosis in our cattle and that we do not know in what way the figure for the number of reactors will be expressed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an agreed method.  When I gave ERAD this <Col N="1602" /> responsibility to introduce a comprehensive programme, according to strict criteria, I acknowledged then, as the Deputy has pointed out, that this test is not satisfactory.  It was for that reason that I asked them to take a look at it.  I am not going to tell the Deputy that what is there now is entirely reliable.  I acknowledge there is some basis to her question and I hope shortly, as a consequence of the examination ERAD are conducting into the most appropriate method of disease measurement, that we will have a more reliable test.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>On 16 March 1987 my Department received from County Meath Committee of Agriculture a request for the inclusion in the disadvantaged areas of certain townlands in the district electoral divisions of Ballinlough, Boherboy, Burry, Castlekieran, Crossakiel, Crosskeys, Killallon, Killeagh, Kilskeer, Knocklough, Loughan, Moylagh and Oldcastle in the north-western part of County Meath which adjoins the Castlepollard area of the county.  On 27 January 1989, almost two years later, I received from Deputy Bruton a request on behalf of some 12 farmers with postal addresses in Castlepollard, Collinstown and Finea in County Westmeath that the area they farmed &mdash; which included lands in north-western Meath &mdash; be included in the disadvantaged areas.</P>
      <P>These lands will be examined in the course of the nationwide survey of areas which commenced at the end of January and they will be included in the general submission to the EC subsequently for approval if they are found to meet the criteria for inclusion as disadvantaged areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that inclusion in the disadvantaged areas is one of the most effective ways of getting money from Brussels into the hands of Irish people and assisting peripheral regions, more effective perhaps than money spent in other more indirect ways? Would he further agree that the Castlepollard area of north Westmeath has a particular problem of disadvantage in that it is not an area where there is heavy production and farmers are forced to rely on less profitable and more unreliable systems of agriculture?  Will he take that <Col N="1606" /> factor into account in dealing urgently with this application?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to the first part of the supplementary, not only do I agree, but it is a view I share with great conviction and one I have expressed constantly at the Council.  No matter what else you try to do in disadvantaged areas by way of Structural Funds, there is nothing as effective as the headage payments, what are called compensatory payments under the headage schemes. Nothing else will enhance income and secure farm incomes as much as those.  I assure the Deputy that because of that, taking the second point, I have reactivated the application either for extension of disadvantaged areas or for reclassification of mildly handicapped into severely handicapped.  We are again, as in other questions today, <i>ad idem</i> on this.  I hope we will get this examination concluded and get the necessary funds from Europe as well to include places like Castlepollard which, I must say, I do not know in detail, but we will know a bit more&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his detailed reply.  I want to put on record what is common knowledge not only in the county but in constituencies all over the country, that it is the complete demise of agricultural advice when figures have reduced from 24 to 11.  Will the Minister accept that the agricultural advisory service as we knew it under the old county committees of agriculture has completely collapsed in County Cavan, that advice is not now available to farmers who are restricted with quotas in milk production and are looking for alternative farm enterprises and who are now in need of <Col N="1608" /> advice more than at any other time since the foundation of the State?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would accept that the old way has changed for the agricultural committees.  Secondly, Teagasc have set as an essential priority the education and training of young farmers particularly.  That is evidenced from the fact that now over 85 per cent of young farmers starting agriculture have formal qualification by comparison with a little over 20 per cent eight or nine years ago. The Deputy is right.  The priorities have changed, and I am quite satisfied that with the service Teagasc are now implementing and the value for money being introduced we will see a totally new approach.</P>

      <Col N="1611" /> With regard to a specific query in the question from the Deputy I can tell him that, subject to the approval of the EC, it is proposed to introduce from 1 April 1989 a 25 per cent grant scheme for the replacement and renewal of greenhouses and to avail of natural gas as recommended in the programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's reply in so far as he states that a programme has been drawn up.  Nevertheless, at this time, would the Minister agree that the progress is a bit slow? The latest figure for the importation of vegetables and fruit, May 1988, was 453,506 tonnes valued at £187.9 million. In view of the fact that we have land capable of growing these products and have established An Bord Glas, would the Minister not say what the target is? By how much within the next 12 months is it proposed to increase the number of jobs or to create jobs in the horticultural business?</P>

The estimated value of horticulture in 1989 is £140 million.  We estimate that 350 full-time jobs were created in the sector in 1988.</P>

The expansion into areas such as Counties Mayo, Galway and Roscommon in recent times is much appreciated.

      <P>I agree that the income disparity which emerges from the survey conducted by Teagasc is a matter of very considerable concern.  In many ways it is in line with the disparity throughout the country, where the small income farmer is very much at a disadvantage by comparison with the big income farmer.  Regarding the mid-western region, two things will be evident.  In the immediate area we have put in place one of the pilot programmes for integrated rural development.  We are the only country in Europe to have done so and we are thus ahead of any other country.  When the Commission introduce next year proposals for rural development generally across a range of areas including agri-tourism, headage payments for horses etc. &mdash; Commissioner MacSharry will have this responsibility &mdash; we will already have in place the necessary programme in areas like this.  Regarding disadvantaged areas, I could not but agree with Deputy Clohessy.  Every Deputy from the region has been in touch with me in that connection. We will be trying to extend the existing disadvantaged areas there, as elsewhere, and to reclassify mildly handicapped areas as severely handicapped.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland's national quota was distributed in relation to the level of producers' milk deliveries in 1983.  Each milk purchaser obtained a basic quota of 1983 deliveries from producers plus (i) 497 gallons for suppliers with 1983 deliveries of less than 14,000 gallons and (ii) 3.55 per cent of 1983 deliveries for suppliers over 14,000 gallons. These were national criteria and not applicable to any particular area of the country.  Dawn Dairies was treated in exactly the same manner as all other milk purchasers in the country.  The percentage increase over 1983 deliveries obtained by any purchaser was, therefore, based on the concentration of smallscale producers, rather than the purchaser's geographical location.</P>
      <P>The only way in which this dairy or any other purchaser could be granted additional quota at this stage is from a national reserve, set up either by Government funding, or by deductions from the quotas of other purchasers and producers, neither of which is a practical possibility.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that it is a matter of critical importance.  In 1987, of all the countries in the EC, I managed to get agreement uniquely for Ireland to introduce a milk restructuring scheme which would confine priority to the sales of milk quota without land to small producers and young producers thereby guaranteeing that the power of the cheque book would not determine capacity to acquire quota.  That restructuring scheme is being implemented <Col N="1621" /> rigidly by all the dairies.  Deputy Leonard is right to point out the problems of small producers particularly.  I am very concerned about them and I am determined to ensure that what should have been done five or six years ago will now be implemented very strictly.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of the 1987 budget the then Government decided to abolish Bord na gCapall because continued expenditure on the Bord could not be justified in the current financial situation. The essential functions of the Bord, that is the maintenance of the Irish horse register and the list of approved stallions, have since been carried out by my <Col N="1720" /> Department.  The register is the stud book for non-thoroughbred horses and its maintenance is fundamental for the continued breed improvement of the industry.</P>
    <P>In 1966 a survey team established by the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries recommended the establishment of an Irish Horse Board to co-ordinate the activities of the various associations dealing with equestrian matters and to set up a national training centre for riders and instructors.  As a result Bord na gCapall was established under the Horse Industry Act, 1970, in order to promote and develop the non-thoroughbred horse industry and to advise the Minister on matters relating to breeding, sale and export of horses.</P>
    <P>One of the Bord's earliest achievements was the setting up of a farriery apprenticeship scheme under which over 70 young people became qualified farriers. The Irish Thoroughbred Breeders' Association and other interests have now organised a new farriery apprenticeship scheme.  This is a welcome development which, I hope, can be further developed to meet the demands of both the thoroughbred and non-thoroughbred horse industries.  Under the Bord's tutelage a number of people were prepared for and passed their equestrian science examination.  This function has now been taken over by Teagasc.</P>
    <P>The Bord's most important and significant achievement was the foundation of the Irish horse register in 1974.  This incorporated the approval of stallions for breeding and was essential for maintaining the high standard of the Irish sport horse.  During the Bord's existence the number of sport horses increased by 50 per cent &mdash; from 21,000 to 34,000 &mdash; and the value of exports reached £3 million. Since the Bord ceased its operations the value of these exports has continued to rise, to £4 million in 1988.</P>
    <P>In 1983, following considerable adverse publicity, the Bord was restructured and staffing levels were reduced from 34 to 15.  Following the then Government's decision to abolish the Bord, these remaining staff received <Col N="1721" /> redundancy payments in April-May 1987 and provision was made for preservation of the pension entitlements which will increase in line with future pay awards.</P>
    <P>Subsequently I appointed a new board, comprising of three civil servants from my Department, who were charged with the winding-up of the Bord's affairs.  Considerable progress has been made in this regard and the remaining tasks include the disposal of the Bord's leased stallions, its main assets.  The present lessees of the stallions have been offered first option to purchase them but if satisfactory sales are not concluded it is the intention to offer the horses for public tender.</P>
    <P>Conscious of the needs of the industry generally I felt it necessary to redefine policy against the background, on the one hand, of restoring confidence to the sector and, on the other, that in the present economic climate the scope for financial incentives was limited.  In the event, I believe a fair balance has been struck in the new national programme which I announced last November.  For the benefit of the House I would like to mention again the objectives of the programmes. These are: to maximise output and exports by exploiting to the full our national resources in breeding stock, soil, climate, expertise and reputation; to maximise returns to breeders and to develop further the equestrian and leisure side of the industry.</P>
    <P>Many of the qualities and much of the international reputation of the Irish sport horse derive from the breeding system whereby Irish Draught and Irish Draught-type horses are crossed with thoroughbreds.  The complementarity of traits between the Irish Draught and thoroughbred and the associated hybrid vigour result in horses having strength, courage, stamina and good temperament. The continued breeding and production of such horses is dependent on the maintenance of a viable nucleus of the Irish Draught population.  However, the future of the breed may be endangered if insufficient numbers of mares are being bred pure to maintain population size and enable selection with the breed for quality improvement.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1722" /> A grant of £400 will be paid to the breeder of each pure Irish Draught foal registered in the Irish Horse Register. This will compensate for the difference in value between pure Irish Draught and thoroughbred crosses.  The scheme will operate for a five year period commencing in 1990.  Conditions for this scheme are being drawn up and will be announced shortly.  In association with the Irish Draught Horse Society, I will be taking initiatives to increase the number of progeny by top mares and to conserve rare blood lines utilising artificial insemination and embryo transfer technology.</P>
    <P>Beginning this year, headage payments will be made in respect of eligible registered mares in all disadvantaged areas in which cattle headage grants are paid at an increased rate of £70 per head for up to eight mares and £66 for the next 22. These payments will be calculated separately from any other headage payments to which the producer may be entitled.</P>
    <P>As part of the new western package, my Department are finalising a new scheme to provide incentives in the less favoured areas of the country towards the cost of providing facilities which will enable them to diversify into alternative farm enterprises.  My intention is that this scheme will include for the first time grant aid towards the cost of basic housing for non-thoroughbred sport horses.</P>
    <P>Again, as part of the package, I hope to make an early announcement on a scheme to encourage agri-tourism which would include grant aid for farmers investing in facilities for leisure activities, such as pony trekking and horse riding.</P>
    <P>The Irish Horse Register will now be administered on a permanent basis by my Department.  I have, in fact, arranged for the instalment of new modern computer facilities to ensure its efficient operation.</P>
    <P>Accurate identification of individual animals and complete accurate recording and registration of pedigree and performance data are fundamental to successful breed improvement, marketing and trade.  Operation of the register by the Department should ensure that:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1723" />  (a)  Standards and procedures will be followed for the registration and documentation of horses which will allow the register to be approved under proposed EC zootechnical legislation;</P>
    <P>(b)  A reliable basis is available for payment of grants.  The requirement that the grants should be paid only on registered animals will have the very beneficial indirect effect of increasing the proportion of horses registered. The result will be a widening of the base for genetic improvement and an increase in the range of Irish sport horses for marketing;</P>
    <P>(c)  A reliable data base will be built up for objective evaluation of the breeding merit of animals which is a prerequisite for constructive breeding programmes;</P>
    <P>(d)  The Connemara and other Irish pony societies who currently maintain non-computerised stud books will be encouraged to join the Irish Horse Register;</P>
    <P>(e)  The register will be the authentic source of all genealogical and zootechnical information included in the passports of all Irish sport horses and ponies.  </P>
    <P>Selection and approval of stallions to sire animals for registration in the Irish Horse Register, the publication of their pedigree and breeding value in the register of approved stallions are also crucial for breed improvement of Irish sport horses.  This task which will also be undertaken by my Department, will involve: the organisation of centres for carrying out inspections and suitable riding-jumping tests, in association with industry representatives; ensuring that best estimates of breeding values, based on all available progeny and performance test data, are used in selection; investigating, in association with the industry, how some proven National Hunt thoroughbred stallions might be approved for inclusion in the Irish Horse Register.</P>
    <P>Given the current state of development <Col N="1724" /> of artificial insemination and embryo transfer technology and the potential of these techniques for genetic improvement, conservation of rare blood lines and eradication of sexually transmitted diseases, I intend to sponsor new legislation to facilitate their development and application in the non-thoroughbred horse industry.  I would encourage the industry to utilise these techniques.  European Community legislation on animal health, zootechnical and genealogical conditions governing intra-Community trade in horses is currently being drafted. The objective is to liberalise trade in horses, horse semen and embryos.  Close liasion with the relevant interests will be maintained in relation to these.</P>
    <P>In association with the horse industry and Teagasc, initiatives will be taken to develop advisory and training programmes to improve fertility, breeding merit, feeding and husbandry of sport horses.</P>
    <P>The introduction of the single European market in 1992 will bring great opportunities.  Effective marketing will be required if the horse industry is to take advantage of the opportunities opened to it when barriers to free trade are removed.  In the horse industry marketing encompasses a wide range of activities from the production of the foal, through schooling and training of the animal, to the sale of the finished riding horse for export.  I envisaged the establishment, with national and EC aid, of a small number of equestrian centres, strategically located, so as to provide high quality facilities for the final preparation, evaluation and marketing of sport horses. The establishment of these centres should result in: more foreign buyers thus increasing exports; promotion, publicity and the orderly development of markets; greater awareness by producers of the requirements of the market place; greater opportunity for breeders to reap a high proportion of the final value of sport horses.</P>
    <P>The activities of Córas Tráchtála Teoranta and Bord Fáilte in promoting the sport and leisure horse area are invaluable to the industry and I have requested <Col N="1725" /> both organisations to review the scale and intensity of their marketing and promotion of the sector.</P>
    <P>A feature of the non-thoroughbred horse industry in Ireland is the large number of representative bodies catering for the various interests.  I propose to forge stronger links between my Department and these interests through an advisory committee which would advise me on policy and on planning and co-ordination of the different elements in the national programme.  I intend to appoint the most capable people available but I have, however, decided to give representation to the main organisations. My Department will write to them for nominees to the committee.</P>
    <P>I believe that the new national programme for the development of the non-thoroughbred horse industry will prove much more effective than any pursued by Bord na gCapall.</P>
    <P>One of the main areas of potential to enhance farm incomes will be the programme for rural development to be launched by the Commission next year. In fact, we in Ireland are already moving in advance of that launch and we are the only country in Europe which has pilot scheme programmes in various parts of the country.  The potential for generating new or extra income for small farmers through the non-thoroughbred horse programme is very considerable.  Linked to the agri-tourism scheme which I will shortly be announcing, pony trekking, riding and holiday competition can be a major tourism attraction in rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>With all the curbs on production being imposed by the Commission in the dairy, beef, sheep and cereals sectors it is essential that we exploit every opportunity in this area where there is shortage rather than surplus and no restriction on production. The programme I am putting in place now will give us a headstart over other countries and I am determined that we will stay the course and negotiate any obstacles with courage and skill.  The prize money and the awards will richly repay our efforts.</P>

      <P>I am delighted to have the <Col N="1726" /> opportunity to contribute to this debate on the dissolution of Bord na gCapall.  It is rather tragic that we should be discussing the dissolution of a board from which so many of us had such high expectations. I am sure the Taoiseach is far from happy with this situation, but I must be frank and say that it was my Minister for Agriculture and Food, encouraged by me and others, who took the first step that has us here this afternoon.  We were the envy of many European countries and of the US in having a semi-State board whose sole functions were devoted to the furtherance of the half bred industry.  I refuse to use that awful expression &ldquo;the sport horse&rdquo;.  Everyone in Ireland loves horses whether they be people who are actually involved in breeding such as the farmer breeder and the professional breeder, whether it is the child in the pony club, or in the show ring or the man, woman and child on the hunting field and in the show jumping arena, whether it is the eventers or the dressage people.  We have many organisations devoted entirely to various aspects of equestrian sport. As a nation, we love our horses, not to mention our racing fraternity, many of whom never see a race course but whose visit to the local bookmakers is part and parcel of the day's routine.</P>
      <P>In every walk of life there is a love of horses.  I freely admit interest here.  The horse and before that the pony has given me some of the greatest pleasures of my life and some of my happiest moments.  I often look back with a wry smile to when I was 13, 14 or 15; I had reached a stage in my life when I thought the only friend I had was a pony.  I felt no one else was listening, and looking back on it, how right they were.  The pleasure the pony or the horse has given to the small child, right through to the professional sportsman and woman today, is inestimable and we cannot do it justice in the few words we will be able to say today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister had the benefit of a Civil Service-prepared script which contained some very interesting points which I will take up.  There is also a lot with which I do not agree in it.  If I can be forgiven for speaking more from the heart than from <Col N="1727" /> the head here this afternoon, the Minister will understand why.  I have a deep interest, I am actively involved and I am delighted to admit it here.  We are into conflicts of interest and declarations of interest in a big way at the moment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the flavour of the month, but I am delighted to be able to admit a deep interest.  Would that my lifestyle gave me more time to pursue that interest.  Regrettably it does not, but as I got great pleasure in my childhood from ponies and horses, I am delighted to see my children having the same interest and getting the same pleasure. We should all be endeavouring to ensure that pleasure from ponies and horses has as wide an appeal and accessibility to people in as many walks of life as possible. That is what I would like the Minister to ensure in his role as custodian of the Irish half bred, as Minister for Agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fully support the need to dissolve Bord na gCapall.  We all had high expectations and aspirations in relation to Bord na gCapall when it was formed under the Horse Industry Act, 1970.  Some excellent functions were carried out by the board and I concur with the Minister that their role in relation to the Irish horse register was a wonderful service to the industry.  I am slightly concerned &mdash; perhaps we can put it down to teething problems, but it has gone on for a bit long now &mdash; about what is happening to the horse register in the Department at the moment.  Suffice it to say that there does not seem to be a demand from the industry to have their animals registered.  It behoves us all to heighten an awareness of the necessity to have every half-bred produced in this country and indeed our Connemara ponies and draught horses registered and with a passport.  We could rationalise our passport system.  I have on my desk at this moment a green passport, a green passport with a gold stripe <Col N="1728" /> and a pink passport, all referring to the same animal at different stages.  That is not the fault of the civil servants who are handling this at the moment.  The problems in relation to this are historic. However, we need to rationalise our system of registration and above all ensure that there is a demand from the industry to have clear identification and registration of all animals.  Apart from the necessity for us to trace through performance recording and performance rating of our animals for export and those who go on to represent the country abroad, after 1992 we will need to have passports for all these animals if we want to trade and increase our export trade in half breds generally.  The European horse Directive to which the Minister referred briefly is to be welcomed in that the Community is turning its attention to a most important leisure activity and an area where there is enormous potential for increase in output and increase in its contribution and to our GNP and to that of member states generally.</P>
    <P>Many aspects of what is now proposed are extremely worrying.  I would appreciate if the Minister could give specific attention to what is being talked about in Europe at the moment in relation to this Directive.  I will come back to that in a moment.</P>
    <P>At a time when there was never a greater demand for Irish half bred horses and despite the dissolution of Bord na gCapall, our exports are increasing and foreign visitors come to buy Irish bred Irish horses.  Indeed such is the name of the Irish horse abroad that one only has to pick up the British publication <i>Horse and Hound</i> and look to the back of it to see the advertisements for horses for sale in the UK and every other one is described as Irish bred or Irish.  I would ask the Minister to invoke the Trade Descriptions Act on these people, because effectively most of these are not Irish bred horses.  They are using the flag of convenience of labelling them Irish to increase their value.  They are doing a tremendous disservice to the name and reputation of Irish bred horses and half breds generally.  This should be looked to <Col N="1729" /> immediately because the good name that the farmer producer and the Irish rider built up over the years in relation to the Irish half bred should not be allowed to be abused in this way any longer.  If every animal can be sold without penalty as Irish bred, when it is not, the name of the Irish horse will suffer and its reputation will decline accordingly.  Hence the industry and exports will suffer.  I draw the Minister's attention to that situation to see if there is any way we can invoke any specific piece of UK or Community legislation to ensure that does not continue.</P>
    <P>As I said the disillusionment of our breeders has never been greater, ironically, at a time when the Irish half-bred has never been in greater demand.  We must look at the problems of the industry, define them, identify them clearly and move forward from there.  One of the greatest problems the Minister has as Minister for Agriculture and Food &mdash; perhaps he has not been actively involved in this himself &mdash; is deciding who he can listen to, which aspect of the horse industry representatives he can trust &mdash; and I will call a spade a spade &mdash; and who represents what in the industry.  Having enjoyed their company and been involved to a greater or lesser extent at different levels over the years, I can frankly say that I do not blame the Minister if, even two years into his job as Minister for Agriculture and Food, he is still confused and still does not know who represents what.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I could say as a preliminary response that each and every person I meet represents the whole industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should tread very carefully.  The one reason we could perhaps forgive inactivity during the past two years &mdash; except for the announcement before Christmas to which the Minister referred again this afternoon &mdash; when very little happened, is that unless the Minister was one of their number and knew them over the years, he could be forgiven for being confused and not <Col N="1730" /> knowing whom to listen to.  They are all experts on everything and they all represent the entire industry, but the Minister should beware because those who purport to be national groups representing the industry as a whole may not do so.</P>
      <P>The Minister should not let any one aspect of the industry or any one organisation bend his ear or monopolise him to the detriment of others.  In theory, the Equestrian Federation of Ireland are the advisory committee the Minister should be looking to but I know &mdash; and many of that organisation would admit this, whether openly or not I am not sure &mdash; that they do not represent the entire industry.  The largest and perhaps most important sector of the breeding industry are not represented on the EFI.  I and others in the industry worry most about the advice the Minister will get on the breeding area.  We are not sure who has the Minister's ear at the moment, who is bending his ear and in which direction he is being pulled and dragged, but we have no doubt that he is being pulled and dragged and I sympathise with him.</P>
      <P>A national organisation, an extremely reputable body, are of the opinion that they should be able to dominate any advisory committee the Minister might set up since in their view, they represent all aspects of the industry nationally.  The Minister must be very careful about this. The Minister's secret in getting the committee right will be to resolve the problems in the breeding area and to resolve the decline over the past 12 or 15 years in relation to the half-bred brood mare. There has been a reduction from 15,000 to, I think, under 5,000 half-bred mares breeding at present; there were fewer &mdash; and I stand to be corrected on this but I think my information will stand up &mdash; than 2,000 half-bred foals registered in 1988 and there are fewer than 5,000 breeding mares.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The International Union for the Conservation of Nature, IUCN, have laid down criteria for endangered species and I put it to the Minister that the half-bred mare, and particularly the draught mares which are breeding in this country, have <Col N="1731" /> fallen way below the criteria the IUCN consider acceptable for the future of any particular species.  While I am not talking about a species as such when I talk about the half-bred mares, nevertheless I am talking about a very important section of the Equidae, of horses generally, and because of that I should like to underline the critical importance of the Minister getting right advice on how to resolve the problems in relation to the breeding aspect of the industry.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred in his speech to the advisory committee he intends to appoint.  I want to ask him to stop and think, even if we have to wait a little longer &mdash; we are already two and a half years down the road on this &mdash; and not to appoint the committee himself.  He should ask the industry to self-select what they consider to be a representative committee. There are many reasons this would be far better than a politically appointed committee, and whether the Minister or I are sitting on that bench, the same will hold.  Over the years political appointments to Bord na gCapall &mdash; and there have been Coalition Governments as well as Fianna Fáil Governments &mdash; have not been a success because the people who are most likely to bend a Minister's ear, or to get to him, are those most likely to have visions of self-enhancement through their role on that committee, or the board as it was previously. I am afraid that is not acceptable.</P>
    <P>As I have said, every aspect is organised by the breeders and if they were told to set up on a national basis and include for example, the western breeders, the north-eastern breeders and other excellent groups, to represent all breeders and to join with other representative groups, the industry could hire and fire each year at their various annual general meetings. It would not be at the whim of the Minister of the day to appoint people for three or five years.  Both the Minister and I know that if one makes appointments which turn out to be unsuccessful &mdash; and every Minister has done this regardless of his political leanings &mdash; there is no question of turfing these people out after <Col N="1732" /> a couple of years; they will be left there until their five years' appointment is up. This has been the problem not alone with Bord na gCapall but with many other semi-State boards to which there have been political appointees.</P>
    <P>I plead with the Minister, in relation to the committee which he referred to and which he intends appointing &mdash; if I interpret him correctly &mdash; to consider asking the industry to self-elect, or at least &mdash; I do not know how many people the Minister has in mind but let us say there will be 12 members &mdash; to tell the industry they may appoint nine members and he will reserve two or three appointments to the committee.  It is preferable, both from the industry's point of view and politically, to let the industry self-select and then hire and fire if people fail to deliver or measure up to the expectations of the different groups.  The responsibility for that should be left with the industry itself.</P>
    <P>An ironic aspect of the failure of Bord na gCapall has been that they took over all the functions of the various voluntary groups who represented the different strands in the industry.  As long as people felt an official body was doing A, B and C, they made no effort to carry out those functions themselves.  Before Bord na gCapall were set up there were various representative groups some who even started off their own stud books, and a lot of work was done on a voluntary basis, but that was swept away the day the Horse Industry Act, 1970, was enacted. We have to get back to the stage where the industry accept responsibility for their own output and future policy.  There should be a committee to advise the Minister but they should be appointed by the industry and if individuals fail in their responsibilities the industry should get rid of them.  The Minister is not going to fire people after two or three years and if I or anyone else happened to be Minister for Agriculture and Food we probably would not be in a position to do so either.</P>
    <P>The key to the success of what happens now in the wake of Bord na gCapall <Col N="1733" /> depends entirely on how effective this advisory committee will be.  If they are a disaster we will be going nowhere fast and an essential industry effectively will have a major problem in the year ahead.  If this committee &mdash; which I know will not be a statutory committee, and effectively will be fairly toothless &mdash; know what they are about and can give the Minister of the day sound solid advice, the industry will be in good hands for the future.</P>
    <P>I am not being political because anything I say about political appointments would apply equally to a Fine Gael Minister for Agriculture.  I plead with the Minister to be absolutely sure that he gets the advisory committee right because on them depends the future direction, policy and advice any future Minister may get in relation to our half-bred industry generally.</P>
    <P>All was not wrong with Bord na gCapall and both the Minister and I have pointed that out.  The Minister pointed out their succeses but he omitted to acknowledge that there were any problems. I can only assume, as the Minister is proposing this Bill to the House, that he accepts there were problems with Bord na gCapall.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister.  I notice he has reneged.  That was not missed by me.  Many might ask, reading the Minister's speech and reference to the good things about Bord na gCapall <Col N="1734" /> and the goodies there will be in the future, why there was a need to dissolve the board at all.  As the Minister has admitted and as I know, there were many problems with the different boards: this was not specific to one particular board. There were, however, excellent board members as well, solid individuals, men and women, appointed by different Ministers since 1970, who had nothing in mind but the further advancement and betterment of the industry as a whole and this was so in the contributions they made at the different board meetings.  Unfortunately, that was not the case with all the members of all the boards.</P>
      <P>As in most cases, some of the more high profile figures could look to the board and use it for their own self-advancement, perhaps over and above the advancement of the industry as a whole.  There was a funny little scheme operating a short while before the board was dissolved which, however, kept in line with one of the functions given to the board under the 1970 Act &mdash; and 11 different functions were detailed.  One of the functions was to promote and develop the export trade in horses other than thoroughbred horses,` to provide for persons outside the State an information service of such kind as was considered appropriate in relation to horses. Another function was to promote the organisation of sales of horses other than thoroughbred horses and to co-ordinate and undertake publicity on horses.</P>
      <P>Some members of the board took those words literally.  They promoted and developed an export trade in horses but this was only the export trade of certain people's horses, as the Minister and I both know.  At one stage, if you did not pay £100 to the club as a farmer-producer, no itinerary included your yard, so you had not a chance.  There was no chance of people who came to purchase Irish-bred horses seeing what you had produced or raised up to that date.  If you did not have £100 in the kitty, you were not visited &mdash; end of story.  An old pals act was operating in that regime which did little credit to the industry or to the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1735" /> There was also a very bright stallion scheme dreamt up whereby the board contributed X per cent of the cost of purchase of a stallion.  The Minister and I both know what happened in that regard and there is no reason why we should be coy about it this afternoon.  If I was selling a stallion to the Minister, I was visited by the purchaser and by a member of the board who had me firmly in tow.  I was not allowed certainly out of hearing distance of him and rarely out of his sight. As the board were putting up a contribution towards the purchase of the stallion, there was a cosy agreement that the actual cost of the animal was increased by the amount that the board would subvent. The difference between what the vendor wanted and what was agreed to be put through as the purchase price was divided up.  This cosy set-up was quite widespread.</P>
    <P>There was another example I witnessed myself at the Dublin Horse Show a couple of years ago.  An employee of the board heard that a Wexford farmer-breeder had an animal for sale and also that next morning at 8 a.m. in the veterinary paddock a certain interested American gentleman was coming to try out this horse.  The representative of the board collared the Wexford man in the bar at the RDS, under the clock, the night before and asked what he expected to make of the horse.  He was told that the owner would be satisfied to take £10,000, would be very happy with that.  He would have a little profit which he could reinvest. The representative of the board asked the owner to leave it to him.  He said that everything he got over £10,000 would be divided and that there would be an agreement on it.  Perhaps with some naiveté, the Wexford man agreed to this. The then representative of Bord na gCapall asked the American purchaser for £23,000 or £24,000 for the animal that the farmer had honestly valued at about £10,000.  Rightly, the American visitor told him to keep the animal &mdash; in less polite language than that, I can assure the House.  That was the end of that deal and the farmer brought home the animal <Col N="1736" /> worth £10,000.  The board representative was doing an enormous disservice, not just to that farmer but to the reputation of all traders of Irish horses in this country. That practice went on wholesale.</P>
    <P>As the Minister knows, people were hired, fired and hired again by the board. It was a fascinating scenario.  At one stage, even though it had been democratically set up, the board effectively operated like a triumvirate.  It appears that decisions were taken before the board met and that three rather domineering and strong-willed people presented the decision and dare anybody question them or disagree with what they said, the wrath of the triumvirate descended on that person from above, as it were.  There were no discussions. What was decided behind closed doors outside the meeting was what happened.</P>
    <P>If we are to be honest and to point out the excellent successes in limited areas of the board, we must give some of the reasons those of us with a passionate interest in the long-term profitability of this industry could no longer sit on the sidelines and accept what was going on, why I and others of my colleagues brought to the attention of the then Minister for Agriculture our disapproval of what was going on.  There was seethíng disapproval throughout the industry. Apart from what was said in this House, outside the board altogether there was seething disapproval and the wheeling and dealing was bringing the Irish half-bred industry into such disrepute that something had to be done.</P>
    <P>I shall not dwell on the negative side; we could all regale the House with different stories on specific industries but there is no point.  I concur with the Minister that one of the great successes of the board was the register.  That was an excellent success but because of the disrepute caused in the industry by certain activities by certain members of the board during the last year or two of the board's existence, the green passport was being devalued.  If a foreign visitor came and wanted to purchase a two or three year old, or a made animal, and asked for the passport and what the animal was by, the <Col N="1737" /> retort at the time was &ldquo;What would you like it to be by, Sir?&rdquo; If it happened not to be by what was then fashionable, because a mare would have been covered several years previously, it turned out not to be registered.  The green passport went over the ditch and you started off from scratch.  You brought in your vet, filled in your identification chart, paid your fees and you had a new passport and the animal was said to be whatever you liked at the time.  That was the disrepute brought to the industry by some members of the board &mdash; and this was by the activities of a very few members of the board. It caused a problem with an excellent system of registration.</P>
    <P>I do not envy the Minister his job in getting his advisory committee right; if ever he wants to have a private chat with me on that subject I am available.  Apart from getting his advisory committee right, he must ensure the future of the Irish horse register, that it is kept scrupulously up-to-date and that there is a value on the green passport.  Above all else, everybody should want and need a green passport and there should be value in having every animal registered and its performance recorded and rated from there on.</P>
    <P>I referred briefly earlier on to the European horse directive and the various demands that will be made on us in relation to registration and passports post-1992.  The Minister should now state that no animal foaled from 1989 onwards should be exported from this country or even allowed to go abroad, if it does not hold a current Irish horse register passport.  The Minister should implement that scrupulously.  It still will not get all into the fold, but the serious breeder will persist and the monkey business in relation to passports will be stopped. There were proposals that from this year the Minister should not allow any animal to be exported or go abroad without a passport.  An SJAI passport is essential for competing, which may have breeding recorded or performance rated but the change cannot be implemented from this year on in relation to all animals sold abroad because many have not been <Col N="1738" /> registered and it will only encourage deviousness in terms of efforts to comply if you say that any animal exported from this year must have a passport.  Certainly, any animal born this year should not be allowed out of this country without an Irish horse register passport and if that was made abundantly clear the serious producer and the farmer-breeder who want to stay in the industry and who have a love of horses will comply without any difficulties.</P>
    <P>The register was a great success. Apparently the Minister transported an awful lot of the registration system into the Department of Agriculture.  I will not go into the saga in the Equine Research Centre, it is history and the Minister knows my views in relation to it.  To be blunt, I would like the Minister to have requested tenders from different bodies such as the IFA, the SJAI and Wetherbys as well as considering the Department of Agriculture and Food officials.  The Minister should have looked at what was on offer in terms of keeping the register and what would have been the best interests of the register's stability and its standing in the future.  That was not done and the register is now in the Department of Agriculture and Food.  We should all ensure that it is an enormous success, that they register animals and issue passports. I am afraid I was the butt of ridicule over Christmas when I preached the necessity of having passports and to register stock.  One particular lady threw a letter across the table to me which indicated that weeks and weeks of effort in trying to get a passport out of the Department had come to nothing because apparently the section ran out of paper.  I put down a Parliamentary Question in this regard asking about the problems of supply of stationery.  In the vernacular that means that they ran out of paper.</P>
    <P>We cannot have an efficient system if we do not even have proper passport covers and paper on which to print them in the Department of Agriculture.  I never again want to be in a position of trying to defend the Department or a system if we have the idiotic problem of running out of stationery.  The Minister could have <Col N="1739" /> asked the SJAI for a supply because they had plenty of similar stationery.  They issue passports too and have plenty of passport covers albeit there is a stripe on one and none on the other.  The Minister should have swallowed his pride but, for historic reasons, he would not even pretend he had a problem.  He did have the grace to answer my Parliamentary Question indicating that they had a problem with stationery.  There were weeks and months of delay in issuing passports and then we preach to the industry to register and to have their passports in order.  Please never let that happen again. It may be a small point but I was extremely frustrated and if that were to be symptomatic of the efficiency of how the Department were dealing with it, I am afraid I will get very cross in the future.  However, to be fair, apart from that particular hiccup, I have found them very efficient in my personal dealings with them, and they have responded to my questions and helped me with advice.  I am sure other Members have also found this.  The Minister knows that the small things make the difference as the big things usually have to be right.  If they are not, the Minister should land like a ton of bricks on his officials.  The small things may not be brought to the Minister's attention but they do make the difference in terms of public perception.</P>
    <P>Apparently the computer system used in the Department for the register cannot &ldquo;talk&rdquo; to the computer system in the SJAI.  The SJAI only computerised in the last year or two and &mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>They are different systems and it will be very expensive, difficult and inefficient.  Both bodies were only computerised in the last two years, virtually simultaneously; they inter-relate to a great extent but I do not know how they could end up with two computer systems who do not &ldquo;talk&rdquo; to each other. It is another symptom of bureaucratic <Col N="1740" /> inefficiency.  I am not saying it is specifically the responsibility of the officials of the Department of Agriculture and Food nor can I blame the SJAI but, between them, they have made a total hames of what should be an inter-related computer system when both were installed simultaneously. I think the SJAI went along with the system which the Equine Research Centre had said they would use when the Minister announced he was giving the register to them.  The SJAI put in their order and installed very expensive hardware.  The Minister then changed his mind and said he would keep the registration in the Department of Agriculture and Food.  He took on the system worked by Bord na gCapall.  Now the system in the Department is similar to that used by Bord na gCapall and there is another in SJAI, neither of which &ldquo;talks&rdquo; to the other.  It is yet another example of bureaucratic bungling.  I do not know who is to blame but it is a mess.  I will leave it to the Minister to resolve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also a problem in relation to the stallions' register, their inspection and AI.  The Horse Breeding Bill, 1985, has been on the Order Paper since 1985, and I am now giving notice that even though a colleague of mine in the former Government sponsored the Bill, if there is any attempt to proceed with the Bill, Fine Gael will oppose it tooth and nail.  I want to give notice of that now lest we come here some Tuesday and find that there is a Second Stage debate on it.  It is not that the Bill is so important that we cannot do without it but it is a fact that with the dissolution of Bord na gCapall there will be no other legislation which will allow us control or will allow ministerial involvement in the half bred industry.  In the absence of replacing this antiquated and antediluvian legislation with something updated and better, I want it left on the Statute Book.  I will be opposing any effort to repeal the Horse Breeding Act which will be done by way of the Horse Breeding Bill, 1985.  One of the main reasons we will not support the Horse Breeding Bill, 1985, is that there is provision in the legislation for ministerial control in relation to stallions, and the <Col N="1741" /> whole area of their inspection is dealt with in the Bill.  With the dissolution of Bord na gCapall and the Horse Industry Act repealed, the only legislation on the Statute Book will be the Horse Breeding Act.  I will not allow the Horse Breeding Bill, 1985, to remove what could be our only line of defence between the industry and outside influences.</P>
    <P>This is relevant in relation to the whole problem of stallion inspection and AI.  I notice the Minister promised &mdash; should I say threatened?  &mdash; legislation in relation to AI at some time in the future.  I do not know how close this is.  Does the Minister realise that the thoroughbred industry have rejected AI as an option?  Perhaps their system of monitoring and identification is the best in the world.  They have Wetherbys who can scrupulously identify pedigree records and trace all thoroughbred animals that have been bred in this part of the world and the United States have a similar system.  The thoroughbred industry, with their almost foolproof system of monitoring and identifying breeding and specific animals have rejected AI as a future in terms of breeding policy.</P>
    <P>The Minister intends to allow the Irish half bred industry to be the guinea pig in relation to AI and embryo transfers.  The Minister is probably also aware that there is a private initiative in operation at the moment in relation to AI and embryo transfer.  I do not think they are publicly funded and I would ask the Minister to confirm whether they are.  I would ask the Minister to get the facts and figures in relation to the fertility rate achieved in the AI programme undertaken in recent times by that private company.  We are talking about appallingly low levels of fertility, less than 12 per cent in some instances.</P>
    <P>The half bred industry is bedevilled with low rates of fertility, less than 50 per cent, and this is an indictment of all who have been involved in policy making and in directing the industry during the years. It is also an indictment of Bord na gCapall. To go from the natural procedure to the AI procedure using our half bred industry as a guinea pig, given that <Col N="1742" /> Wetherby's and the thoroughbred industry have said they cannot identify and monitor the AI procedure, would be an appalling retrograde step for three reasons.  First, monitoring and identification would be virtually impossible given the propensity of the people involved in the Irish half bred industry to avoid most systems of rules and regulations. I would hate to be charged with the responsibility of monitoring what goes on.  The second reason is the very low level of fertility.  A third reason would be that we have a small pool of brood mares.  There are less than 5,000 quality half bred brood mares left.  I am taking a chance in calling each of those quality half bred brood mares.  If a substantial proportion of these were to be used in any AI experiment, even embryo transfer techniques, which proved to be unsuccessful we would effectively be taking them out of the market for the production of foals for whatever number of years the experiment goes on for.</P>
    <P>The Minister will be told that the semen used on a particular mare is from a certain horse but I ask him how he will be able to prove this.  If we were to be quite blunt about it, there has been difficulty with the present system for registering foals &mdash; the covering certificates that stallion owners have to issue and the checking of books &mdash; where there has been the natural physical act so that one could see what was happening.  Even with all of that it has been almost impossible to keep tabs on the industry in respect of what a foal is said to be by.  The Minister now suggests that we adopt a system which the thoroughbred industry has rejected because they cannot monitor or control it despite all the strict procedures in place.  The Minister wants our half bred industry, involving less than 5,000 mares, to act as a guinea pig, but he should think again.  I am aware that the European Horse Directive goes into this area in a big way and this has probably spurred the Minister into action in respect of this matter.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to talk to those involved in the thoroughbred industry and to Wetherby's and not just to have <Col N="1743" /> the Civil Service advising him and to try to understand the difficulties being experienced and to make a considered opinion as to whether we should proceed in this way at this point.  If we had 15,000 brood mares as we had in 1970 when Bord na gCapall were established it would be a different kettle of fish entirely as we could afford to use a couple of thousand in an experiment and this would do no harm to the overall pool of produce. Given that our pool of brood mares has dwindled to such an extent, to the point where we could almost speak in terms of the extinction of the species, we cannot afford to experiment in an untried and very unproven arena.</P>
    <P>We should leave countries, such as Germany which has 50,000 brood mares, to experiment with AI and to improve the techniques so as to ensure there would be high rates of fertility.  Let them also improve the monitoring and identification techniques and let us then piggyback on their experience given that they have the necessary numbers of mares and finance to carry out these experiments. Let us learn from them as to whether AI can be used successfully in terms of identification of the produce in years to come and to implement what they come up with.  I am not ashamed to say that we should piggyback on the bigger and larger nations who have larger pools of brood mares.  We have too small a pool of brood mares to risk carrying out such an experiment on something we do not know anything about and which to date has proved very unsuccessful.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to speak to the private companies.  To date it has been an abysmal failure.  The fertility rates are appalling.  That is not just my word.  The Minister should speak to the vets involved and to those international vets who have visited this country to see what is going on.  He should also speak to the Swiss to get their views on AI and the problems they have encountered with it. We should not get involved in this arena with our eyes closed.  We should learn from those nations who can afford to make mistakes, unlike us, who have a <Col N="1744" /> greater pool of brood mares, and to piggyback on their experience, only then moving forward on this issue.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the Horse Breeding Act and the efforts being made to repeal it.  I am opposed to this.  I wonder whether the AI procedure is legal at present.  If we were to look at the provisions contained in that Act and the strict controls in place in relation to the registering of stallions to be used in covering mares &mdash; I think that legislation was enacted in 1935; I stand to be corrected on that but it is very old legislation &mdash; I wonder if the AI procedure is legal.  The Minister referred to the introduction of legislation.  Perhaps there are more reasons than one as to why he feels legislation is necessary.  It may be that those using the AI procedure at present are acting outside the law.  Perhaps our inspectors in the Department of Agriculture and Food should take a look at this matter.  I put it to the Minister that there is an area that we are not monitoring properly.  Identification, monitoring and registration are as important as having an advisory committee.  The proper implementation of the register is as important.</P>
    <P>I wish there was a debate raging in the horse industry in relation to the proposals contained in the European Horse Directive on the importation of stallions and semen of warm bloods generally.  Again, we have to come back to the fact that we only have 5,000 half bred mares in the country and I am being generous with that figure.  The Americans, the British and Swiss all come to this country to buy Irish bred Irish horses, sound in wind and limb and with great stamina &mdash; the progeny of the cross between the Irish draught mare and the thoroughbred horse.  They come to buy what I call Irish bred Irish horses.  I do not know of any foreigner who comes to our shores looking for Irish bred warm bloods.  Perhaps some do but I am not aware of them.  I suspect that they go to Germany or the Netherlands if they wish to buy warm bloods.  At the same time I do not think we can stand in the way of technology.</P>
    <P>With the advent of free trade and the <Col N="1745" /> single European market post 1992 we have to take a look at this area and make our minds up.  It is, as one might say, make our minds up time.  If we were to have warm bloods standing in this country or to use the semen of warm bloods &mdash; my arguments in respect of the monitoring of the AI procedure apply even more in respect of imported semen &mdash; it would only be a short time before all of the Irish half bred mares would have warm blood in their pedigree.  If it subsequently turned out to be a mistake to do this and we found we had departed altogether from having the traditional Irish bred Irish horse which is in such demand throughout the world, it would take generations of breeding to get that blood out of our pedigrees and we would have ruined our core stock of breeding mares.  The Minister has to tread with enormous caution in this area.</P>
    <P>There is one way in which we may be able to do this and that would be for the registration system to allow strict colour coding of the passports of different groups of Irish bred horses.  We could use sections A, B, C and D.  Section A of the register could relate to the pure Irish draught mare and the produce of the appendix draught mare if they pass inspection and are deemed eligible to be included in the draught register.  Section B could be a first cross.  You could have a particular colour stripe across the green passport.  The first cross of the draught mare and the thoroughbred may be the second, up to the seven eighths half-bred. You could have a third section, C, for the cross of the Irish-bred Irish mare with a warm blood, so a green passport with a red stripe would identify very clearly any Irish-bred warm blood horse as distinct from an Irish-bred Irish horse.</P>
    <P>The Minister regaled us with the increased export figures.  Indeed, he and I both know the value is probably far more than what he has there.  There is a tendency to undervalue the exports because of the VAT implications of other countries, so he could safely double it and we would not be too far out.  With the increase in exports visitors coming to <Col N="1746" /> buy these horses would at least be able to identify from what would then be compulsory passports the line of breeding when an animal was produced in front of them.  We could then have a section for our Connemara ponies and so we could have sections A, B, C and D or variations of what I am proposing of a colour coded register, to keep a very clear distinction between the Irish-bred Irish horse and the Irish-bred warm blood.  I would like to talk to the Minister some time about this area because there are enormous possibilities here.  If we do not get this right we could destroy the pool of brood mares in this country, our foundation stock.  The pool is so small we cannot afford to experiment and then be sorry a few generations later, because there is no going back and the Irish half-bred will be gone.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am following the Deputy with great interest.  She will appreciate that what she said is a terrible indictment of so many people and their motivations in the industry if it is true. You do not seem to be able to trust anybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Take the introduction of warm blood.  I do not think there is any malice aforethought or bad motivation. Given the success of the Germans, for example, on the Grand Prix circuit there are people who genuinely think that the be-all and end-all is the warm blood. Fashions come and go in this as in any industry or walk of life.  Other countries with a large pool of brood mares can affort fashions or trends and if it does not work out they can excise the damage, get rid of it.  We have not enough means to take the risk that this trend will be unsuccessful, but if under Community law we have to open our frontiers with no technical barriers at all to warm blood semen and stallions, we must be sure that the progeny are clearly identified and separated from the Irish-bred Irish horse. That is all I am appealing about.  There is no malice aforethought.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>God knows, there are many other areas we could talk about in the horse <Col N="1747" /> industry in relation to what the Minister is saying and perhaps I would agree with him.  In relation to my last point on the warm blood, I feel that these who are proposing this do so in the best interest of the future progeny and the production, particularly of show jumpers and perhaps eventers to some extent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree there is a small opinion in show jumping that the warm blood strain is the strain to introduce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>It is fashionable at the moment.  I think the figure is about 50,000 brood mares in Germany but it is all warm blood we are talking about there. They have a very strict culling policy at the yearling and two-year old stage for the stallion.  Anything that does not pass a very strict inspection is gone to the meat factory or gelded or whatever.  It is not allowed to remain an entire, and the same with the mares.  They have such a strict policy there that even with the huge numbers they are dealing with, intensive culling at the different stages and inspections, the numbers that reach the top are not that impressive taken against the numbers that are bred.  When you think of the number of our horses that reach the top and have done so over the years, our breeding policy is far superior.</P>
      <P>Perhaps I exaggerate when I pretend we even have a breeding policy.  I am sure the Minister will agree with me that as a rule we bred from the maim and the lame, those that could not be sold or those that broke down.  Anything that could be put in the back pocket was put in the back pocket if that is what you were about, and you bred from the mare when nothing else could be done with her and so forth but despite an inverted breeding policy, so to speak, we had enormous success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now that we are looking at a positive policy and are going to put down on paper the direction we are going, we must be terribly sure it is right and is going to work, given the success we had up to recent years with no policy at all.  We have the soil, the climate and the core of <Col N="1748" /> the stock in terms of the draught mare. I welcome the Minister's initiatives in relation to the foal premium on the draught side.  I hope he will be able to expand that into the half-bred and not restrict it.  He is talking probably about 60 to 70 foals per year.  Lest people thought there were hundreds of foals or benefactors for this £400 draught premium, let me say it will affect 60 to 70 foals per annum.  Notwithstanding the fact that the Minister is getting away lightly, it is an excellent concept except it has not been extended far enough.  It is the half-bred mare and her progeny we must look to in regard to it.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the stallion book.  There have been major problems about that. We need a book; we need some sort of register available or document stating the stallions in the different counties for covering either the draught mare or the half-bred mare.  Many a farmer-breeder just wants to know where is the nearest stallion to him and if he is not too scientific or technical he goes to the nearest one regardless.  If he is persistent, if the mare does not hold he will go back a second time.  The problem is most of them will not bother to go back a second time; hence the very low fertility rate of under 50 per cent.</P>
    <P>For years the stallion book has not been updated.  About a third of the stallions in it at one stage were dead but still they appeared every year in it until somebody bothered to check whether they were still around.  Others were so old they were irrelevant to any breeding policy.  We had the spectacle last year of five or six Bord na gCapall stallions being put down.  Some may have considered that an over-reaction but when the taxpayers' money was being spent we had to be sure that, technically speaking, we were getting the best possible value for money.</P>
    <P>I welcome the suggestion that proven National Hunt sires should be included in a register or some sort of book that will allow their progeny out of Irish Horse Register mares to be registered themselves. One of the greatest scandals at the moment is that this is not implemented <Col N="1749" /> already.  The half-bred season starts a little later than the thoroughbred season and I would say virtually no half-breds are covered at this moment.  Next month or so everything gets under way with the half-breds.  Traditionally, National Hunt stallions cost far more than those in the stallion register of Bord na gCapall.  If any brood mare owner thinks it worthwhile to cover a half-bred mare by a National Hunt stallion standing at any stud I ask the Minister to ensure that he is allowed to do so.  I do not think there is any risk of them going to an unsuitable horse without sufficient bone because if the owners are going to pay the extra money they will do what is best and will know enough about it.  If technically they do not know what they are about they will go to the £50 or £100 a jump horse in the stallion register down the road, not a registered National Hunt stallion.  If they go to the wrong horse and produce an unsuitable foal without sufficient bone, that will not sell.  There is nothing like the experience of not being able to market your produce for putting manners on you and teaching you the right thing to do.  Performance rating will very soon limit any mistakes that may be made in that regard.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the Minister need not go to the trouble of saying he is going to select &ldquo;proven National Hunt sires&rdquo;.  If they are proven in the National Hunt sense they are going to be very expensive and so effectively very few half-bred mare owners will go to them anyway.  I would allow any National Hunt sire to cover a registered mare and the progeny of that to be put in the register and the Minister will save himself and his officials a great deal of trouble and to-ing and fro-ing. However, I would continue to publish a register because it is needed for the farmer-breeder, the man who has the love of the horse in his bones for whom mechanisation, tractors and technology will never replace the horse in his life.  You need a register of what is available locally for that person to keep the tradition and the love of the Irish horse and the breeding of the Irish half-bred alive.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1750" /> I would request that in regard to stallion owners who now wish to purchase stallions &mdash; there are a few around because there has been an upswing in trade; a good half-bred commands reasonable money and exports have increased &mdash; there be some system akin to that of the purchase of land subject to planning permission.  Now they cannot purchase a stallion subject to inspection. I had three queries in the past six months, and I am sure many other Members of the House had many more, from stallion owners or potential stallion owners who wanted to go either to the North or here in our country to purchase a stallion but were afraid to put down their money in case subsequently that horse would not pass the inspection and they would be left with an expensive horse the progeny of which would not be eligible for the register.</P>
    <P>We need some system whereby a prospective purchaser can avail of the services of an inspector of the Department of Agriculture and Food to give a pass or a preliminary pass to an intended purchase to ensure that money is being spent in the right direction.  If assurances cannot be obtained that the horse will subsequently pass inspection, it will not be bought.  Many small communities are being deprived of the benefit of potentially very good sires because the farmer will not put down his money and risk failing inspection the following spring at the annual stallion inspection.  There is a logistical problem.  Most prospective purchasers spending £8,000 or £10,000 and more on a stallion would gladly pay £50 or £100 to have a Department of Agriculture inspector inspect a stallion within three weeks &mdash; or a finite time &mdash; before the deal is closed.  This would give either preliminary sanction or sanction to the registration of the stallion.  We need a system like this to ensure that there are no hiccups or logistical problems in furthering our breeding policy in relation to stallions.</P>
    <P>The Minister might explain his intentions in relation to stallion owners who are now standing Bord na gCapall stallions. Letters have been issued in recent <Col N="1751" /> times suggesting that these stallion owners should now purchase the Bord na gCapall stallions &mdash; I think the cost is to be three years of the premium they were paying to Bord na gCapall.  The Minister has a legal contract with the individual stallion owners.  Is he breaking what I thought to be an irrevocable agreement with these stallion owners?  What is the legality of what is involved?  I put down a Parliamentary Question and got a rather curt reply to the effect that the legality was not a matter for the Minister.  The gist of it was &ldquo;do not be troubling me with trivia &mdash; go and find out for yourself&rdquo;. Perhaps the Minister would tell me what legal agreement there is between him as Minister for Agriculture &mdash; it was Bord na gCapall &mdash; and these stallion owners who are now standing Bord na gCapall stallions.  Is it the position that they have to buy these stallions and that there will be no more State-owned stallions with the dissolution of Bord na gCapall?  The Minister's proposals in this area are far from clear.  Many stallion owners are looking to the legal contracts drawn up many years ago to see what the legal position is and whether there is a binding agreement on which the Minister cannot renege.

      <P>I will try to wind up my remarks, even though it is a most important area.  I must mention the role of McKee Barracks and the Army Equitation School.  We are talking about the half-bred horse.  The role of the Army Equitation School is to show off to the best possible advantage our half-bred horses, both at home and abroad.  They have done a wonderful job under very difficult circumstances.  I would ask the Minister personally to take an interest in the future of the Army Equitation School, with his responsibility for the half-bred horse in mind.  I would ask the Minister to ensure that our Army riders have sufficient money to pay entry fees to different shows in order that they may show off the half-bred horse we care so much about.  I would ask him also to ensure that his colleague, the Minister for Defence, is aware of his concern as to the future of McKee Barracks and the role of this extremely important equitation school in showing off the half-bred horse.  It has come to my attention recently that Army riders can only attend shows, in terms of eventing and show jumping, if the riders themselves pay the entry fees and travel costs out of their own pockets.  I do not consider that appropriate and it is a matter which needs to be resolved immediately.</P>
      <P>The farrier scheme was a great success under Bord na gCapall and I commend all those involved.  Many rural communities would be in serious trouble today but for Bord na gCapall-trained farriers.  I hope the present arrangement is as successful in servicing the industry as was the Bord na gCapall scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will not go into the serious problem of the small number of draught mares &mdash; 500 registered mares plus an appendix. The Minister pointed out that he initiated a scheme before Christmas.  That is excellent, as far as it goes.  I am asking him to extend the scheme to the half-bred industry.  The draught mare is the core of the half-bred industry.  It is the cross of <Col N="1753" /> that draught on the thoroughbred and the cross on another thoroughbred again that we are talking about.  It is the seven-eighths that will be the Irish horse of the future, a seven-eighths of bone and substance, sound of wind and limb.</P>
    <P>The National Stud has to date dealt only with thoroughbred horses.  I would ask the Minister to consider opening a half-bred or draught section there.  It is funded by the taxpayers' money and its own commercial semi-State business.  It has done a wonderful job for the thoroughbred and it is a showpiece we are all proud of.  Let us have a centre of excellence in relation to the half-bred industry there.</P>
    <P>The objectives of the Hunter Improvement Society are objectives which every Minister for Agriculture should come to understand and promote.  If we do not have the right half-bred brood mare and the half-bred filly kept in the country and identified as being what we want for the future, and if farmer breeders are not given incentives for holding on to their two year old fillies and to breed them, we will have major problems.  The pool of mares will dwindle and in years to come we will have nothing to talk about.</P>
    <P>I was delighted to read recently of the establishment of the degree of bachelor of equestrian science at Thomond College and I congratulate those whose initiative it is.  I await with interest further developments.  We should be the world centre of equestrian education.  Our young people have the Irish certificate of equestrian science, ICES, and the Irish diploma of equestrian science, IDES, but now there is this degree course, which should be the envy of the world.  We should have foreign students clamouring for our equestrian education facilities. It could spawn a business and be self-financing if given a high enough profile.</P>
    <P>Proper identification involves the register. It also involves looking at freeze breeding and micro-chip implanting.  I am not talking only about competition and show horses.  We have the urban horse to consider.  The horse breeding directive which the Community will be foisting on us in the years to come deals with all <Col N="1754" /> equidae, down to the ass and the donkey and the urban horse in the housing estate in town.  The more we can get young people even in urban areas to appreciate, love and look after their horses, the fewer problems we will have in those communities.  We must have a clear and unequivocal method of identifying all horses in town and country.  There is a freeze branding exhibition to be held in the RDS shortly.  We must look to a national system, whether by freeze branding or micro-chip implanting or a combination of both.</P>
    <P>There are so many other aspects with which I could deal, so many other points made by the Minister I could take up, but I am mindful that I have spoken for quite some time.  I have waited quite a while for an opportunity to put my thoughts on the future of the half-bred industry on record.  I appeal to the Minister to ensure that whatever decisions are taken now will be in the best interests of the half-bred industry, that the people from whom the Minister seeks advice, give it, not from a self-enhancement point of view but from the enhancement of the industry generally.  Above all I would appeal to the Minister to allow the industry itself select the advisory committee and to give the compilation of the proper register urgent attention.</P>

      <P>This Bill is dishonest in that it purports to dissolve Bord na gCapall although that board effectively has been wound up already without any reference to this House.  What we are being asked to do today is merely rubber stamp that decision.  It is a procedure which shows little respect for the House. It is not acceptable that Ministers should be able to abolish, by the stroke of a pen, a body established by the Oireachtas.  We had a similar experience last week when the Government announced the decision to abolish Fóir Teoranta, another body established by legislation, when there was no consultation with or announcement made to the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are being asked to approve a Bill whose provisions are in direct contravention of an undertaking given in the <Col N="1755" /> Fianna Fáil Manifesto prior to the last general election.  Lest the Minister has forgotten what was said in that document I will remind him that, under the heading of agriculture, it was specifically said a key element of the Fianna Fáil approach would be the development of the half-bred horse industry by a reorganised Bord na gCapall.</P>
    <P>At the Fianna Fáil Ard Fheis over the weekend there were plenty of attempts by Fianna Fáil to redefine the meaning of words.  For example, the Taoiseach and others assured us that people living on paltry sums were not really living in poverty.  Now, from this Bill, we note that in the new Fianna Fáil dictionary the word &ldquo;reorganisation&rdquo; actually means &ldquo;abolition&rdquo;.  This Bill also reflects current Fianna Fáil preoccupation with what the British Prime Minister would refer to as rolling back the frontiers of the State, in other words, contending that the State should withdraw as much as possible from social and economic activity, allowing free market and private enterprise to have full rein.</P>
    <P>For example, a number of public agencies have been abolished, such as the Health Education Bureau.  The role of the National Social Service Board has been greatly diminished and the State has sold its shareholdings in a number of oil exploration companies.  The State's shares in Tara Mines will be sold as soon as a bidder can be found.  The Joint Hospital Services Board has been sold to the private sector; Fóir Teoranta is to be abolished as is Bord na gCapall.  There appears to have been no real thought given to these decisions, no analysis as to whether they are in the public interest. The only interest of this Government appears to be their ability to impress bankers, stockbrokers and international moneylenders by being able to say to them: look, we have cut another £1 million here and another £0.50 million there in State expenditure.</P>
    <P>Given the potential of the half-bred horse industry for our economy in general and for agriculture in particular, there was a strong case for the retention and <Col N="1756" /> reorganisation of Bord na gCapall.  There is no doubt that there were many problems encountered with Bord na gCapall, that they did not achieve the success they should but the objective of any Government concerned with the development of this sector of agriculture should have been the reorganisation of the board.  For example, significant State effort goes into the marketing of livestock through CBF. We are to have a statutory board for the development of the horticultural sector. Why then should the horse industry not have its development board?  While I have every respect for civil servants in the Department of Agriculture and Food &mdash; and the Minister mentioned the establishment of an advisory committee &mdash; I am not sure they are best suited to performing the task previously undertaken by Bord na gCapall.</P>
    <P>Everybody acknowledges that the non-thoroughbred horse industry has tremendous potential which has not been realised.  There are approximately 5,000 people involved in non-thoroughbred horse breeding.  Despite considerable sums invested the results have been most disappointing.  For example, the half-bred mare herd now produces approximately 2,500 foals only per annum, not all of which are of the required quality. Exports of horses, which once were at a leval of approximately 10,000 per annum, are down considerably.  The Minister informed Deputy Mac Giolla, in reply to a parliamentary question on 17 November last, that the number of registered Irish draught horses had declined each year between 1985 and 1988, informing him that while there had been 92 in 1985 that figure was down to 63 by 1988.</P>
    <P>There is no evidence of any sense of commitment or urgency on the part of the Minister or his Department to providing breeders with the necessary assistance and encouragement.  For instance, owners of Connemara registered mares in disadvantaged areas can benefit under an extension of the EC headage payments. Headage payments can be received for up to eight mares per holding &mdash; if the units have not been fully utilised in respect of cattle &mdash; but the Department <Col N="1757" /> have refused absolutely to extend that incentive to half-bred mares, apparently because they would have to pay up to 50 per cent of the cost of headage payments.</P>
    <P>The difficulties experienced in forming an equestrian team for last year's Olympic Games and the lack of success of that team is an indication of the wider problems facing the non-thoroughbred industry.  That is why we should think twice before agreeing the provisions of this Bill.</P>

      <P> (i)  in relation to the breeding, sale and export of horses and associated activities,</P>

      <P>(c)  to establish, equip and operate or cause to be operated on its behalf a national centre or national centres for training in equitation;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(d)  to consult with the relevant equestrian organisations (if requested by them) about the choice of international equestrian competitions in which to enter Irish national teams or members thereof and, where such teams or members and the competitions for which they are entered are approved of by the Board, to assist <Col N="1758" /> the teams, or members, as the case may be in either or both of the following ways, that is to say, the provision of money to meet, in whole or in part, the costs of entering and taking part in the competitions or the provision of horses for use by the teams or members, as the case may be, in the competitions;</P>
    <P>(e)  to encourage the holding of international equestrian competitions in the State and to assist, whether by the provision of money or otherwise, in the holding and running of such competitions;</P>
    <P>(f)  to provide for the training of persons in the giving of instruction in equitation;</P>
    <P>(g)  to co-ordinate and undertake publicity on horses;</P>
    <P>(h)  to promote the organisation of sales of horses other than thoroughbred horses;</P>
    <P>(i)  to promote and develop the export trade in horses other than thoroughbred horses;</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the Dáil do now adjourn.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In moving this motion under Standing Order 30 I know that I speak for all in this House in expressing sadness at the loss of their jobs by 485 workers in Johnston, Mooney and O'Brien and 100 workers in other bakeries up and down the country in the last few days.  It costs so much to create jobs nowadays &mdash; £10,000 or more if those jobs are created through the IDA &mdash; that the loss to the economy of jobs of this magnitude is a very severe financial blow to everybody in the House.  However, the loss is immeasurably more severe for the families directly affected for whom there now opens a vista of idleness and emigration.</P>
      <P>This tragedy can be traced to the failure of the Cabinet to devise any coherent or even consistent response to the crisis that has been evolving publicly before our eyes in the bread baking industry.  In fact, this failure is directly traceable to an inefficient allocation of ministerial responsibilities by the Taoiseach.  On coming to office the Taoiseach gave responsibility for the flour industry, and it would appear in part for the bakery industry, to one Minister, the Minister for Agriculture and Food but he gave responsibility for the IDA, for competition policy, for prices and for all matters that affect the survival of those jobs to another Minister, the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  That inbuilt institutionalised confusion created by the Taoiseach has led to a paralysis as far as policy making is concerned in regard to the baking industry and is the direct progenitor of the problems that we see unfolding before us at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach's inability to get his Ministers to work together to evolve a <Col N="1760" /> strategy for the baking industry is something for which he directly and personally must be held to be culpable by the House and has led directly to the tragic news that we heard this morning.  The most eloquent commentary on the Government's reaction to this grave situation is to be found in a quotation in this evening's <i>Evening Press.</i>  The Minister for Industry and Commerce, who had a lot to say about the baking industry a few weeks ago, was asked for his comment on the loss of 485 jobs in Johnston, Mooney and O'Brien and this was the response reported:</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce was unavailable for comment this morning.  His press office was taking no queries on the crisis and attempted to switch the responsibility for the problem over to the Department of Agriculture and Food&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This would be funny if it was not so tragic.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce is trying to run away from the problem and the Minister for Agriculture and Food has run away from the problem long since.  We have a situation in which they all seek to shift blame to one another in respect of this tragic closure.  The dogs in the streets could have told the Government two months ago that this problem was going to be on their table this day but they have been evading it ever since.  This is impermissible behaviour on the part of a collectively responsible Government and there is one man, and one man only, who is responsible for this political failure and <Col N="1761" /> that is the Taoiseach, Deputy Charles J. Haughey.  It is his job to make sure that his Ministers work together to evolve a strategy for this industry and he has failed just as much as his two Ministers have failed.</P>
      <P>There is, of course, other evidence available of confusion in the Government's thinking on this issue.  In December, with some fanfare, the Government introduced a retrospective freeze on the price of bread the effect of which was to raise the price of bread in the shops, guarantee larger profits to those bakers who were able to sell bread below those prices and, it was hoped, stabilise the situation.  At that stage the Government, obviously, believed that such a minimum price was a wise and good thing.  At that time the Minister for Industry and Commerce spoke of the fears expressed of considerable job losses in the baking industry.  What has happened since?</P>
      <P>In February all that concern seemed to have evaporated because the Minister considered in that month that the order should be revoked.  He said the order would produce a degree of rigidity in the marketplace which would be inappropriate and unfair to the consumer. First, it was necessary to protect jobs &mdash; that was the Minister's view in December &mdash; but in February he said the order created unnecessary rigidity.  Is the man capable of making up his mind?  Are the Government capable of making up their minds on a simple issue of economic policy, whether or not to have a minimum price on bread?  They could not make up their minds and people are paying the price.</P>
      <P>Of course, an investigation had taken place between December and February and the Minister claimed that that had shown that there was no evidence of below-cost selling.  On that basis he felt he could revoke the order but yet the Minister admitted in the Dáil on 16 February, in regard to the findings of the Director of Consumer Affairs, that</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The director did, however, consider it appropriate to undertake an investigation into the true production costs <Col N="1762" /> of an 800 gramme sliced pan.  This would enable him to establish the prices at which an economic return can be made from the production of bread.  It will be some weeks before this complex exercise can be completed. </P>
    <P>In other words, the Minister admitted that he did not know the true cost of a loaf of bread.  How could a Minister assert that somebody was not selling bread below cost if the Minister admits that he does not know the cost of bread? I believe that the Minister, again, has shown monumental incompetence and internal confusion in so far as his thinking is concerned.  The fact that he continues to be allowed to get away with this is an indictment of the Taoiseach for retaining his services.  I ask the Minister a simple question: &ldquo;If you do not know what the cost of bread is, how can you say whether goods are being sold below cost?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is obvious from the events I have just described that the Government have no policy, no plan, no clue about the bakery industry.  Jobs will disappear but the Government will be satisfied to continue fatuous buck-passing between Minister Burke and Minister O'Kennedy, and if they can find somebody else to take the ball from them I am sure it will be passed to him or her.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not good enough and I hope the debate, which the Chair has so kindly allowed to take place, will force the Government at last into facing their responsibilities in so far as this industry is concerned and come forward with clear proposals, a Government plan, under the responsibilities vested in them by law for the development of the baking industry.  I propose, and my party have already proposed, a four point plan to provide hope and a secure future for the bulk of the baking industry.  The first thing we need to do is to provide for amalgamation and rationalisation within the industry.  At present we have a large number of small bakeries all producing a wide range of products, all duplicating <Col N="1763" /> one another, distributing those products. What is needed if our small Irish bakeries are to survive is that they be amalgamated, that they specialise, each one, in a particular product line, that they have a single distribution network and that they have together the market power to stand up to the multiples that they do not have individually.</P>
      <P>The Government have a role to play in this.  Under section 26 of the Industrial Development Act, 1986, the Industrial Development Authority have been given power and responsibility to promote mergers in industry.  I tell the Minister that he should direct the IDA tonight, if he has not done so already, to undertake a programme of assistance through loan guarantees and otherwise towards the amalgamation and rationalisation of the structures of our existing baking industry. It is only through rationalisation that those industries will be capable of surviving in the face of the competition that they now must encounter.</P>
      <P>Second, I call on the Minister to take steps to assure consumers of the quality of bread in our shops.  At present there are many suggestions that this low cost bread has excess moisture content and is deficient in protein.  These allegations may or may not be true, but the Minister has the power under section 10 of the Consumer Information Act, by order, to require bread manufacturers to display on the packages information in regard to all those characteristics of the bread they are producing so that somebody buying a package of bread will know what its content of moisture or protein is. Thereby the Minister can ensure that if people buy low cost bread which is low quality bread at least they know what they are doing.  At the moment they do not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Third, I call on the Government to prepare a long-term development strategy for the Irish baking industry.  Major advances in recent times in enzyme technology, a branch of bio-technology, have resulted in much lengthened shelf life for bread.  Bread is now claimed to and can, with modern technology, survive fresh on <Col N="1764" /> our shelves for much longer periods than hitherto.  This has two implications for this country.  It means on the one hand that it is now possible for bread to be imported.  It is also possible for bread produced in one part of the country to be sold at the other end of the country. It also means that Irish bread can be exported and, in my view, the object of a long-term strategy in the baking industry should be to so rationalise it that instead of Irish bakeries fighting a defensive stragegy <i>vis-à-vis</i> the domestic market they are looking to the export markets with the aid of the State agencies and finding possibilities of selling Irish bread overseas. If there is such a big difference between the price of bread here and in supermarkets in Britain, twice those obtaining here, why should not Irish bakeries avail of the better prices across the water?  That would be a positive response, one so sadly lacking from this Government to the present crisis, a response founded on seeking openings overseas.</P>
    <P>Fourth, I call on the Government to introduce an outright ban on predatory pricing and the abuse of dominant positions in the industry.  There have been suggestions, unproven but very persistent nonetheless, that some of the multiples are abusing their dominant position.  If that is the case the law should be used to put an end to it and that can be done by incorporating Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty of Rome directly into our Irish law because those Articles ban predatory pricing.  We should make them part of Irish law and enforce them with criminal sanctions.  A Bill to do just that came before this House two weeks ago, the Enterprise (Competition and Consumer Protection) Bill, 1989, presented by the Progressive Democrats.  In section 2 of this Bill it was proposed that any abuse by one or more individuals, trade associations or companies of a dominant position within the State or a substantial part of the State shall be unlawful in so far as it affects trade within the State.  Fine Gael proposed similar measures by means of amendment as long as 18 months ago and <Col N="1765" /> have another Bill, the Economic Development Bill, which will be coming before the House in the next few weeks proposing exactly the same measure.  Yet that measure which would for the first time in Irish law have done something to stop the abuse of dominant positions was declared by the Government, if it were passed, to be a confidence issue.  They said it was a matter of confidence that that Bill be defeated.  They did not want in our law a provision to render dominant positions unlawful.  They declared it a matter of confidence, and with the support of the left wing parties that measure was voted down.  An opportunity was lost in that Bill which could have been amended to deal with any other difficulties that the Left might have had with it.  An opportunity of dealing with that matter was lost by the voting down of that Bill by Fianna Fáil and others under their influence.</P>
    <P>I believe those four points represent a comprehensive programme to strengthen the baking industry and are much more effective than the pathetic vaccillation between price freezes on the one hand and masterly inaction, visible inaction, on the other which currently represents the response of Government.  I believe and hope that this debate which the Ceann Comhairle allowed will, by providing an opportunity for all sides in the House to express their concern about this situation, lead to the adoption by the Government of the four constructive proposals I have put forward.  It is on that basis that we can go forward.  I do not believe in reverting to minimum price orders, which in fact are not capable of being implemented under existing law because existing law only sanctions maximum price orders, but rather a constructive strategy banning predatory pricing, ensuring the quality of bread, instituting a long-term strategy for the industry and giving IDA a system for rationalisation.  That four-point strategy represents a constructive answer to this crisis and I hope it will be acted upon by the Government and that we will not have more closures next week followed by more closures the following week.  It <Col N="1766" /> is only if this House can be seen, through this motion, to take action on this matter that that can be stopped.  It all hinges not so much on the Minister here at the moment, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, but on the Taoiseach.  It is ultimately his responsibility to get the Ministers at last to work coherently together to deal with this debacle.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this matter.  As the House is aware, I have been consistent in raising this matter over the last fortnight.  Indeed the Ceann Comhairle allowed this matter on the Adjournment Debate on 16 February when I made many of the arguments that we have just heard.  It is sad that we have to make them here again this evening in the light of a very serious number of closures in the bakery industry.</P>
      <P>It is absolutely clear now that the failure of this Minister for Industry and Commerce in this matter has caused grave problems to the bakery industry.  As a matter of fact he has displayed a very serious error of judgment with regard to the bread price war that is in train at the moment.  The failure of this Minister to act can now be measured in our very substantial job losses throughout the bakery industry which has been highlighted by the closure of one of our oldest established bakeries, Johnston, Mooney and O'Brien, with the loss of over 485 jobs.</P>
      <P>The Minister must take responsibility as he is the primary individual in this Government responsible for this area. There may be confusion which has been brought about by delegation of authority within the Government but I am satisfied that this is the Minister responsible.  He is the Minister charged with job creation on behalf of the Government and indeed he is in control of many State agencies which should help to bring that about. He cannot sit idly by and say he has no responsibility in this whole debacle we are now facing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister introduced a prices order because he believed that a short-term price war in the grocery trade would lead to significant job losses in the bakery <Col N="1767" /> and flour milling industry.  They were the Minister's words.  The response he got from Dunnes Stores was to immediately break the prices order.  I ask this House, on that happening why did the Minister not prosecute the people responsible for totally ignoring a law laid down in this land?  The Minister took a very cowardly approach to the whole matter and revoked the order he had set in place. Where is the consistency from the Government and the Minister on this matter?</P>
    <P>The Minister then followed on by stating he was satisfied that stability had occurred in the marketplace and that there would not be any undesirable and uncontrolled developments.  Surely his whole judgment in this matter is flawed. His attitude of hiding in the wings and the scandalous double standards he has displayed on this issue in my opinion, and in the opinion of the Progressive Democrats, puts into question his whole ability to function as a Minister for Industry and Commerce.  The implications are far more wide-ranging than the issue we are discussing this evening.</P>
    <P>It has been mentioned already, and I believe from the information I have received, that serious question marks now arise as to the quality of bread being produced in this country.  I referred to this matter on 16 February.  It is well known that much of the flour being brought into this country is unusable or largely not wanted on the British market and is of far less nutritious value than the bread the Irish consumer has enjoyed up to now.  The Minister was at pains to point out that this is in the interests of the consumer.  It is certainly not in the interests of the consumer.  The consumer is being duped in this whole matter and is being forced to accept a very inferior quality of bread.  Bakeries that have produced good quality bread, which is a large part of the staple diet in this country, are going out of business and, as a result, the quality of bread will be drastically reduced.</P>
    <P>It is not right to say that rationalisation in the bread industry means that all the <Col N="1768" /> small bakeries must disappear.  That is not true.  There are many small bakeries operating in small towns and cities who have a market and are operating successfully within that market.  They have invested large sums of money in the business to keep jobs in the industry and to supply the consumer in their areas with a very good quality sliced pan.  It is misleading of the Minister to suggest that the consumer is benefiting.  We know today the reactions of the consumer.  They have stated that they are not just interested in cheap bread at the price of job losses, job losses which are resulting from the Minister's failure and total abdication of responsibility in this matter.</P>
    <P>We have heard mention earlier &mdash; and I welcome Deputy Bruton's comments &mdash; of the Enterprise (Competition and Consumer Protection) Bill which was introduced to the Dáil.  It is ironic that all the arguments made on this side of the House with regard to that legislation are relevant to what is happening in the marketplace.  There is clear abuse of dominant position by Dunnes Stores and other multiples in the marketplace who are lowering the price of bread to the detriment of a whole industry.  They want to gain control of the production of bread and its wholesale and retail operation in this country.  That is not in the interests of the consumer and it is not in the interests of competition.  As a party we have consistently favoured open competition but we have also said on many occasions &mdash; and the Minister has tried to misrepresent this point of view &mdash; that there must be ground rules in operation to allow for fair competition.  The defeat of that Bill by the Government, in combination with the Labour Party, The Workers' Party and others in this House, was a total disregard for the type of legislation that was necessary.</P>
    <P>When I raised this matter on the Adjournment debate the Minister's reaction with regard to job losses and what was happening was to spend 15 or 20 minutes complaining about the Bill the Progressive Democrats had introduced in this House.  That was a very poor response from the Minister who was <Col N="1769" /> hiding behind words.  He may have some smart words to say in this House but it is to the employees of these companies that he and the Government will have to answer, not just to me and others in this House.  Those people want to see the Minister taking action in this area.  They see the inactivity and the double standards he has displayed.  Are we not going to face up to our responsibilities in this area?  We want to see an end to monopolies because they are not in the interests of the consumer but are we to replace them with the law of the jungle as this Minister seems to want?  That is exactly what is happening outside the walls of this building this evening.  It is not a desirable course of action and it is not in the interests of employees, employers or the consumer.</P>
    <P>There must be ground rules.  As I stated two weeks ago, ground rules have already been established.  Half of our economy operating in the international sphere are operating under these ground rules.  That is the most dynamic and progressive end of our economy.  Why will the Minister and the Government not allow the domestic economy to operate under the same rules?  It is quite obvious to everybody in this House, and indeed to people on the street who fully understand this issue, that the Government will have to bring in legislation along the lines of what they conspired to defeat two weeks ago.  That is the only long-term solution to the type of predatory policy and the type of abuse of dominant position that is evident in the marketplace.  That must be our response as legislators to that sort of behaviour.</P>
    <P>It is within the ambit of this House to set down the parameters of how business should operate and to allow open and fair competition.  I am not interested this evening in listening to the Minister trying to point out that I have adopted some kind of a contradictory position.  That is not true, and full well the Minister knows that.  More importantly, those operating in the bread industry and the consumers at large also know it.  It is quite clear what the Minister should do.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1770" /> I have made attempts in the past fortnight to get the Government to see reason in this matter.  We are now faced with asking the Government and the Minister what do they intend to do with regard to the bakery industry.  Will the Minister say that he will allow this to continue, and that the job losses that are occuring would occur anyway?  What we are seeing are enforced job losses.</P>
    <P>There has been rationalisation in the industry over the past number of years but it has occurred in a reasoned and calm manner and I have no doubt that further rationalisation within the industry will probably be necessary and indeed will occur.  However, it must occur in an atmosphere of calmness and stability and in a planned way and not in the way we are seeing at present.  I assure the Minister that many supermarket chains are forcing their suppliers throughout the length and breadth of the country to come to new agreements to sell bread to them at ridiculously cheap prices or even at cost so that they can compete in the marketplace. These suppliers have nowhere else to go; in fact, up to 80 to 90 per cent of their production goes to the multiples. They know that if they do not supply the multiples effectively they will be put out of business.  Therefore, they are forced to comply with what I would call false costs, and they have to show false costs simply to struggle to stay in business.  Is that the way we want to see business operate?  Is this a fair way to do business?</P>
    <P>Is this what the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> means?  Is this the overview of the Taoiseach and the Minister for Industry and Commerce who have nothing to say on this matter, but who have been forced to respond because this House saw fit to allow a motion on the matter to be debated here this evening?  Is this the way the Minister for Industry and Commerce is running the Department &mdash; not having the gumption to stand up to them but acting cowardly in the face of pressure from people such as Dunnes Stores?  It is obvious that as a result of the price freeze they had put pressure on to have the Minister withdraw the order.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1771" /> I would like to quote the Dunnes Stores response: &ldquo;We did not agree with the order but yes, I suppose we broke the law&rdquo;.  Does that mean that any future price orders the Minister may see fit to introduce will be a waste of time?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I have quoted from <i>Business &amp; Finance</i> of 23 February 1989.  Are businesses to understand that in future prices orders can be ignored because we have a weak Minister for Industry and Commerce?  Will they simply say they will do what they like, that the Minister will simply revoke the order and they will carry on as they see fit?  Let me say that is exactly what has occurred when the Minister withdrew the Minimum Prices Order in the face of a company flagrantly breaching the order.  Is that to be the future line of operations?  Of course, it tells us that the type of legislation we have is completely ineffectual.  It clearly says that we do not have sufficient legislation in operation to deal with these matters.  I would like to hear what the Minister proposes to do about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not looking for a short-term solution. I believe the Minister &mdash; unless he has come up with some ingenious response to the immediate situation &mdash; has to introduce a minimum prices order again to create a breathing space in the market so that a planned and orderly rationalisation process can occur.  What is happening at present is highway robbery &mdash; the robbery of jobs from people who have committed all their lives to working in the industry and are now out on the side of the road and many with literally no opportunity of re-employment. I heard a very apt comment today that if this Minister was announcing the creation of 485 jobs in Dublin what a great coup it would be with great pomp and ceremony surrounding its announcement, but it is interesting to see the quietness when 485 jobs in addition to at least 175 jobs, that I am aware of, have already been lost up and down the <Col N="1772" /> country.  The comparison is rather interesting. I think it points out the way the Minister for Industry and Commerce views the importance of one of the major portfolios.  We see the great job creating Minister.</P>
    <P>As for the <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> we can tear it up and throw it away because the Government are not interested in creating an ordered environment for maintaining existing jobs, and that has been one of our greatest problems. We have been creating jobs in industry against the tide but we have been losing jobs at the rate of knots and the Government seem paralysed and unable to put in train a plan to sustain the existing jobs we so badly need.  This is the responsibility of the Minister for Industry and Commerce but he is trying to cloud the issue by pretending that it is in some way the responsibility of the Minister for Agriculture and Food.  Certainly, I believe that the Minister for Agriculture and Food should have some view on the matter &mdash; and he, of course, is quite obvious by his silence, but he has far more important matters in Thurles to deal with.</P>
    <P>Companies and people who abuse their dominant position in the marketplace must be called to task.  They cannot be allowed to run riot over an industry having no regard for the huge job losses their behaviour might cause.  That is not competition.  I will not stand here and allow this Government to cloud the issue if that is to be their only response.  Fair and open competition can exist if this Government have the nerve to introduce the necessary legislation but so far they have shown they have not got it.  Time is of the essence and the Government have to behave in a responsible manner.  In the long term the Minister must bring legislation before the House similar to that which was defeated two weeks ago. The ground rules for fair and open competition must be established or similar situations to what exists at present will continue until we bring about the necessary legislative changes.  I await the Minister's response.  I must point out that the people who are employed in the bakery <Col N="1773" /> industry, in flour milling and in retail outlets are awaiting his response.  He should address his comments to them this evening.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I thank you for allowing this debate to take place because it gives us a better opportunity to debate the matter than the Private Notice Questions which are down in the names of the various parties.</P>
      <P>This is a particularly sad day.  Not only are we seeing the disappearance of 485 jobs in Ballsbridge but we are seeing the demise of the last of the three great traditional bakeries that epitomised Dublin: Kennedys have long since gone; Bolands went two or three years ago and now Johnston, Mooney and O'Brien.  There are a number of lessons that all of us &mdash; I mean all in this House and not just one side or the other &mdash; would be very unwise not to take full heed of.</P>
      <P>First, the Government are responsible for the present situation in the general baking and food industries.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce, who is here this evening on behalf of the Government, has a specific responsibility in the way in which he handled, or mishandled, the question of minimum and maximum price orders.  I would be unfair, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, if I were simply to concentrate the criticism on the present Minister for Industry and Commerce because sitting beside him should be the Minister for Agriculture and Food who has overall responsibility for the milling, baking and flour industries and their related downstream value added process, the baking of bread.  However, having regard to the disastrous way the Minister handled the winding up of the Thurles sugar factory it is no wonder he is not in the House this evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us not personalise the criticisms against any individual Minister.  This is a matter for collective Government responsibility and the Government must take responsibility and the blame for what has happened in the past couple of months.  As Deputy Cullen and Deputy Bruton have said, it is not without fair warning that these things have happened. <Col N="1774" /> The point I want to make is that all the talk here tonight is not going to bring back the jobs of 485 workers who were given two weeks' notice that their jobs were gone but this seems to be Government policy on every other industrial sector.  If this is the way the Government propose to respond to the changes occurring in our society from within and without, then we are in for very rough times indeed.</P>
    <P>With the closure of Boland's Bakery three to four years ago, the Department of Industry and Commerce, the IDA, and the Department of Agriculture and Food knew exactly the difficulties in the bakery industry, yet little or no effort was made to get the sort of rationalisation, matchmaking and amalgamation which were essential if we were to retain a fairly professional baking industry.  I use the word &ldquo;professional&rdquo; advisedly.</P>
    <P>A large new entrant into the baking industry, led by the well known multiple whose name I am constrained from mentioning which had its own retail units, was not the first to get in an untrained unprofessional into the bread making business.  That body was preceded by a major hotel chain which carried the name of the owner.  They were the first to get into the business of trying to cut out the professional baker.  Both those companies started the process whereby today, because of the changes in the process and in technology, our baking industry in baking the large 800 gramme sliced pan is completely vulnerable.</P>
    <P>The <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> a programme which has gone very flat in the last couple of days, like a cake without baking powder in it, talks about linkages, about ensuring that job creation opportunities will be maximised, about there being a partnership between the State and the private sector and about creative efforts to find new possibilities for job creation.  Yet, for a basic industry baking a staple commodity such as bread, an industry known to be vulernable for a variety of reasons, nothing was done.  The Minister and the Department with direct responsibility to the Government were at the front line of the early warning system <Col N="1775" /> that sent out distress signals to the effect that the traditional Irish, large size, pan baking industry was in crisis.  The Minister, in reply, is duty bound to give some indication to the House what actions he took above and beyond imposing and then removing the price order.  What actions, if any, were taken by the Department and the Department of Agriculture and Food to come forward with the kind of strategy about which Deputy Bruton talked?</P>
    <P>I was mildly surprised to hear Deputy Bruton go on in such a coherent way suggesting that what was required was an extraordinary degree of sophisticated State interference in the banking industry. That is not the Deputy's normal line of argument, but he recognises that in this instance the private sector left to its own devices will produce the laws of the jungle which Deputy Cullen on behalf of the Progressive Democrats has so roundly condemned.  The Government within the framework of discussions between the unions and the remaining sections of the private sector have to work out some kind of coherent strategy for this industry.</P>
    <P>We are not just talking about the basic 800 gramme sliced pan.  It is not without significance that the owners of Johnston, Mooney and O'Brien are major flour producers and flour millers and retailers in that area.  They saw the baking industry as a natural and logical outlet for their primary product.  If we do not have a coherent strategy then the continued importation of flour from other countries, particularly from Britain, will mean that not just the Irish baking industry will be at risk but also our flour milling industry.</P>
    <P>It is accepted that changes are inevitable. Yesterday on the radio the general secretary of the Bakers' Union recognised that the new bakery which was going to be built by Johnston, Mooney and O'Brien would have resulted in considerable reductions in the labour force because of improvements in technology and productivity.  Instead of the general secretary being able to talk about that new bakery he was confronted with the <Col N="1776" /> shock announcement of the closure of the bakery.  There is recognition on all sides of the industry that changes will occur but to date there seems to be an extraordinary inability in the private sector to implement the sort of planned rationalisation which is the alternative to the commercial law of the jungle which the Progressive Democrats and Fine Gael are saying they are against tonight, without the positive intervention of the Government either directly or indirectly through the State agencies.</P>
    <P>Tonight it is not the position adopted by the Labour Party, The Workers' Party, the Fine Gael Party or the Progressive Democrats which is to be challenged. It is the actions of this Government to date and the apparent confusion between Government Departments which share the responsibility for the pricing mechanism, for job creation and for the agriculture and food industry. It is ironic that only last week the Minister for Industry and Commerce blithely announced to the nation that he could proceed with the closure of Fóir Teoranta because there was absolutely no need for this kind of rescue agency.  Is there no need for this rescue agency now in the light of the disappearance of 485 jobs?</P>
    <P>This same Government have promised marvellous things in this city.  In relation to the Custom House Docks site we were repeatedly promised upwards of 1,500 jobs on site.  In that catchment area there is a maximum grand total of 205 jobs in the Custom House, of which 41 are filled by local people including 14 apprentices all from the north side of the Liffey and the remainder from outside.  We have this much trumpeted achievement by the Government in part of the inner city area which was to produce hundreds of jobs. This has been in the newspapers day in and day out.  Side by side we are losing nearly three times the number of jobs being created and the Minister is trying to walk away and disclaim any responsibility.</P>
    <P>The actions of the Government to date in relation to the baking industry, and specifically in relation to the bread war, are riddled with indecision and with a <Col N="1777" /> lack of clear thinking in relation to whether there should be some kind of price control mechanism.  There seems to be a timidity about taking on a large multiple which dominates the retail area in this country.  It seems to be a law unto itself, in terms of its relationship with the Dáil and the Oireachtas not to say anything about the relationship of that multiple with its many suppliers.  Deputy Cullen articulated the concern of many people about that aspect of the operation of this kind of large retail multiple.  Is the Minister really that scared of dealing with this large multiple?  Is that the extent of their power and influence in this land at this time?  Will the Minister say who in this Government is responsible for the preparation of a strategy to produce jobs in the bakery sector?  Is it the Minister or his colleague, Deputy O'Kennedy?  If both Ministers are responsible, when did they last sit down and talk about this?  At the very least, is there a working party in both Departments working on this problem? There must be a few spare working parties somewhere.</P>

      <P>That is right and they have left a lot of documentation which was extremely useful, otherwise the Government would not have come up with any ideas.  They have now completed some of their task and they could be put to some good use again.  Surely, if such a body is not in place there is a need for one with a determined timetable in relation to when it will complete its report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last matter I want to raise relates to the dominant position that different companies have in our economy and what action, if any, the Government will take. We have to conclude where we started. We started this debate tonight because of the shock announcement of the loss of 485 jobs.  This is a devastating blow to the people directly involved.  It is a devastating blow to many of the suppliers of that particular company.  I would ask the Minister for Industry and Commerce &mdash; according to the reports in the press <Col N="1778" /> that company is completely solvent and the major shareholders have reported good trading over the last few years &mdash; to assure the House that not a single supplier, not a single worker, not a single trader with a professional trading relationship with this company, will be left short of a penny for any longer than they would otherwise be, by the shareholders and directors of this particular company.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The basic item we are discussing here today is bread.  It is perhaps strange that in some parts of this world when the price of bread is increased there are riots in the streets, and we are debating a problem which appears to have arisen because bread prices have come down.  This has caused a considerable amount of confusion, particularly among the people who use bread to a far greater extent than most others, that is, those on low incomes, whether derived from low pay or social welfare. It is important to ensure that the confusion is not deepened by what is said in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt that there are thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of people outside this House who want to buy cheap bread.  It is important, therefore, that this House &mdash; at least those of us who are on the Left, as has been referred to by others parties &mdash; make it clear that we are not opposed to the provision of cheap bread for those who are obliged to buy large quantities.  What we are concerned about specifically is that bread is made, distributed and sold in a way which ensures that the consumer is getting a quality product, and getting what they assume they are paying for. There is no guarantee that the bread, whether cheap or otherwise, which is being supplied to consumers at this time is of the quality they assume they are buying.  That is an issue which the Minister should address.  What precisely are people buying when they buy a loaf of bread?  What is it made of?  How much <Col N="1779" /> moisture is in it?  What chemicals are in it?  What are they eating?  What are they buying?</P>
    <P>The second point we should bear in mind is that price competition will not necessarily result in the most efficient or highly technological producers surviving or providing bread in the long run.  I have no specific knowledge about the company which Dunnes bought out last year and who are presumably baking and supplying them directly with the cheap bread they are now offering for sale.  I do not know what kind of operation they have, whether it is efficient, highly technical or if it is like a number of back street operations depending on cheap labour, young labour and female labour which is sweated, for long hours, late nights and early mornings.  These are questions that have to be addressed when we are talking about this industry and supplying bread.</P>
    <P>I have spoken to people who need to buy cheap bread.  They said they do not want to buy a loaf of bread 10p cheaper if it means that their father, husband, daughter or whoever will lose their job as a result.  That is another aspect we have to keep in mind.</P>
    <P>Effectively, the Minister has washed his hands of the problem which the baking industry finds itself in.  There is no doubt that efficiency is required.  The socialist parties in this House, and the trade union movement outside of this House, have demanded efficiency, and the introduction of the best technology to produce goods, not just bread, because we and they see that industry can survive only if it is based on the most up-to-date and efficient use of technology.</P>
    <P>We do not make those demands simply on the basis that those who control the technology and the industry can, at the drop of a hat, throw 485 people out on the street.  That is not acceptable, particularly when the company sold the site on which it operates for £4.4 million less than a year ago.  It is not acceptable that the company can tell staff they are out in two weeks' time and the company walk off with £4.4 million, and whatever else they may acquire in terms of its sale by <Col N="1780" /> the liquidator.  The workers are left high and dry, some having given 40 years of their lives to the company concerned. That is not acceptable.</P>
    <P>There is no way any Government should stand over that kind of activity.  It is a very timely lesson for this House and for the people of this country in relation to 1992 when, we are told, there will be free and open competition between all the States of the EC.  Is this the kind of competition we will have?</P>
    <P>It is my belief that the Government must demonstrate to the baking industry that they are capable of ensuring that workers' rights to redundancy, fair play, notice, etc. are protected and defended. They must ensure also that the companies who are offering competition to established industries are not doing so on the basis of sweated labour, using part-time labour which is unprotected and which has no rights under social legislation.  This Government have to demonstrate that in handling the baking industry they are capable of ensuring that an adequate social dimension is included in any negotiations with regard to 1992.</P>
    <P>I can foresee a situation where there will be utter chaos coming up to 1992 and thereafter, with regard to the livelihood of tens of thousands of workers in this country unless this Government can demonstrate they have the capacity and the will to take on industry and insist that they abide by the common decencies. They must ensure at European Community level that there are adequate safeguards and protections introduced so that the law of the jungle is not spread throughout Irish society arising from 1992.</P>
    <P>I have got the impression from reports in the press during recent days on this problem in the baking industry that the Minister does not have a concern about the misery which is being created and caused to many workers, not only to those who have lost their jobs already and those who are threatened with losing their jobs, but to those who are still in the baking industry and who may lose their jobs next year or the year after.</P>
    <P>The Minister does not appear to <Col N="1781" /> appreciate that there is a real fear and problem in that industry.  Certainly none of the statements he has made to date would indicate that he has a concern.  He has indicated that competition must take its course but, as I have said already, there is no guarantee that competition as it is taking its course in the baking trade will necessarily result in the most effective or efficient baking industry.  What may well happen is that one or two multiples will control the industry through their buying power and will, in turn, be able to indicate the price they charge for the bread they make available.  It is commonly known that when multiples drop their prices on one staple item such as bread they cover themselves by increasing the price of other items.  That has been a common feature of the grocery trade for many years since the development of the multiple supermarkets in the State.</P>
    <P>The Minister has a lot to answer for in this House today, not only in relation to the jobs which were suddenly announced as having disappeared during the past few days, but also in relation to the future for those who are still in the baking industry. Like Deputy Quinn, I was surprised at the position taken by Deputy Bruton with regard to the baking industry.  I welcome it but it is a change of position by the Fine Gael Party.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose as they say one should not read too much into it. Nevertheless it is a surprise and I welcome the fact that he has taken this position. There is no doubt that there has to be State intervention in relation to how capital competes with itself in society; otherwise the economy would simply operate in the interest of profit and not in the interest of the citizens of the State, as it should do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has to take a number of steps in relation to the baking industry. First, he has to fix the price of bread at a reasonable level.  He has already indicated that an investigation is under way <Col N="1782" /> to decide what is a reasonable production cost for a loaf of bread.  That investigation should be completed as quickly as possible and a price should be fixed which will enable those already operating in the industry to meet that target and ensure that the multiples do not sell below that price.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the Minister has to intervene, through whatever agencies he chooses, to ensure that the workers of Johnston, Mooney and O'Brien get a fair deal from the closure of that company. To date they have been unable to find out the whereabouts of the the £4.4 million the company received for the sale of their site.  They do not know where that money is and they have failed to date to find out from the receiver where it is.  It is essential for the Minister to step in and ensure that the workers of the firm get a fair crack of the whip from their former employers.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, the Minister has to establish a long-term development strategy for the industry, as Deputy Bruton pointed out, and use whatever incentives he can whether it is a carrot or a stick, to ensure that the industry is in a position to compete not on the basis of producing a shoddy or cheap product but on the basis of producing a good quality product which is capable of being marketed because of its quality and the efficiency of its distribution, etc.</P>
    <P>Those are the three steps which the Minister must take but I would add in relation to the development strategy that it is not good enough just to ensure that capital is capable of competing and that it modernises facilities and factories.  The Minister must also ensure that the industry is developed in such a way that the workers who are displaced as a result of modernisation are not left high and dry in the dole queue.  Alternative jobs should be put in place to ensure they do not end up in the poverty trap in which tens of thousands have already found themselves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is beyond doubt that rationalisation is necessary in the baking industry.  I think this has been readily <Col N="1783" /> recognised by most people in this House, particularly by my party when our Deputy Leader, Deputy John Bruton, and spokesperson on agriculture and food, Deputy Avril Doyle, stated clearly the likely outcome of trends some months ago.  Our policy can best be synopsised by the press statement from Deputy Avril Doyle on 12 January 1988 in which she called on the Minister for Agriculture and Food and the Minister for Industry and Commerce to get together with the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade and urgently investigate the bread war before irreparable damage was done both to an important indigenous industry and the long-term interests of the consumer.</P>
      <P>That statement best sums up the situation we are faced with here tonight in that we are now talking in the aftermath of the closure of one of the most important industries in this city.  The Minister and his colleague the Minister for Agriculture and Food must now recognise as a matter of urgency that there is need for cohesion and a strategy in determining what should prevail in the area of competition in the food industry.  The Minister must determine as a matter of urgency what is competition and what is cannibalism.  If he allows the situation to run as it has for the past number of weeks I fear that not alone will 400, 500 or 600 people lose their jobs but thousands of people will become unemployed in the industry and the whole baking industry may rest in the hands of two or three people.  We will then have to ask whether the interests of the consumer or the industry concerned will be best served by allowing that to happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should first determine the actual costs involved.  In determining these costs he should take into account quality control, the ingredients used, whether home produced or imported products are used and the quality produce which will be available to the consumer at the end of the day.  If the Minister does not do this there is no possible way he can control the situation.  I implore the Minister, in the interests of the industry, to take into account the need to preserve <Col N="1784" /> this indigenous industry both from the consumers' and the bakers' point of view.  If he allows competition to be eliminated in the marketplace for whatever short-term reasons, ultimately the consumer will have to pay more.</P>
    <P>At this stage &mdash; and I have to revert to the order revoked by the Minister before Christmas &mdash; it would appear that the Minister has done a double-take and he now has to ask himself who is determining the price of bread.  Will the price of bread be determined by the Minister and his office in consultation with the Minister for Agriculture and Food or will it be determined by one or more multiples who obviously have their own best interests at heart in the long term?  If action is not taken in this matter in the very future we will have to deal with this issue in this House on an ongoing basis over the next six to eight months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this further opportunity of making the House fully aware of my position in relation to the current development in the bakery industry. I want immediately to refute the accusations made by Deputies Bruton and Cullen with regard to a supposed silence on my part on this issue.  As recently as last Sunday I spoke on the issue.  We had an Adjournment debate on it in this House and various other statements were made also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since I spoke last Sunday, one decision has been taken which has been referred to by a number of speakers this evening. I cannot allow the opportunity to pass without commenting directly on the decision announced yesterday to place Johnston, Mooney and O'Brien in voluntary liquidation.  The simple reality of the situation is that Odlums, the parent company of Johnston, Mooney and O'Brien, are a very profitable operation. I would suggest that a question mark must be placed against this group's longer-term intentions for their baking subsidiary, Johnston, Mooney and O'Brien. This company, we have seen in the recent past, have had a prosecution for breaches of the health regulations.  We have seen <Col N="1785" /> the sale by the group of the site of their present operations in Ballsbridge for a sum reported as £4 million plus.  That must have contributed in no small way to the company's bottom line.  We have not seen, however, any definitive commitment to the relocation of the operation by way of concrete proposals to establish a leading technology production unit capable of supplying not only the domestic market but also the export market.</P>
    <P>Is it not therefore reasonable to ask in the clearest terms whether the company are not being opportunistic in attributing cause of closure to a temporary price war of recent origin when the real reason obviously lies elsewhere?  Would it not have been more honourable for the company to acknowledge, particularly to their workforce, that they had long standing problems of such a nature as to raise serious questions about their plans for continued involvement in the bread area?  I take this opportunity in this House tonight, even at this late stage, to call on Odlums and ask if it would not be proper for them, including their flour mill operations, to reconsider their decision and invest in a modern, cost efficient, high technology bakery, making bread available to the Dublin consumer at reasonable prices.  In view of the fact that their company have been loyally supported by the people of Dublin over the past hundred years and also loyally supported by their employees over those years, I ask them to think again, and clearly, about the matter and not to take the opportunistic road and blame the short-term price war for what has obviously been a long-term strategy.</P>
    <P>Government policy in this area is to provide a legislative and economic framework that will allow competition in the marketplace to operate in a free and fair manner.  The Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order of 1987, which bans below-cost selling among other things, provides such a framework in the retail grocery trade.  A policy that stifles legitimate competition, however, will result in continued stagnation in the economic sector concerned.  Such competition cannot be held back in the long term; the <Col N="1786" /> longer it is held back the greater the shock when free and fair market forces are allowed to operate.</P>
    <P>One thing that struck me about this debate this evening and this whole issue of bread pricing is that there has been much talk about the bakers, and rightly so, much talk about the employees, and rightly so, but there has been very little talk in relation to the rights of the consumer. It was referred to by Deputy De Rossa more than most in the House.  The consumer also has rights in this issue. Surely he or she is entitled to buy bread, or any other item, at the lowest available price once it is not a predatory price.  We should never, as a Government, force any manufacturer to sell at a price which will be to the detriment of the consumer, once it is above the production cost.</P>
    <P>This issue started originally with the director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade still investigating whether there was a breach of the groceries order.  I considered it desirable at that stage, because of the fears, rightly expressed, of considerable job losses in the bakery industry and the failure to achieve a voluntary pause, to introduce a Retail Prices (Bread) Order in 1989.  This order fixed white bread at its pre-Christmas price. The order, contrary to the impression given by some, was not a minimum price order.  What it did was freeze prices so that there could be no upward or downward movement in relation to the prices charged on 20 December.  This type of order is necessarily inflexible.  It meant that if there was one outlet charging a lower price than another, it was not possible for the competitor to adjust his price.</P>
    <P>I should like to point out, in response to the various suggestions that I introduce a minimum prices order, that such power is not vested in me under the prices Acts. I simply do not have the power to make a minimum prices order.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Even if it were, and I would not use it if I had it, what price level would be chosen?  The current <Col N="1787" /> lowest retail price is 39p, which appears to be above production cost for Dunnes, and I shall come back to that topic in a few moments.  It is not my normal practice to mention companies but because of the particular circumstances it is hard to have a debate without doing so.  Fixing a price above that would be statutorily to guarantee increased margins for Dunnes, or for other producers.  Is that what I am being asked to do by anybody in this House?  Deputy Cullen now shakes his head.  He talked about my being cowardly and running away from things and asked me to make a minimum prices order.  He does not know the law.</P>

If I did so, the results could be appropriated as pure profit or used to cross-subsidise cuts in other retail prices. Is that what I am being asked to do? Furthermore, a price close to 39p, even if that were to be brought in, would not satisfy the current complaints from the bakery trade.  How long should such prices be fixed, if there were such an order?  Fixing artificial prices&mdash;&mdash;</P>

With every statement I have made on this issue and as late as last Sunday, I referred to the need for rationalisation because of the inefficiency in the market.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I have said previously that inefficiency of production is at the <Col N="1788" /> core of this whole issue.  I want to take the opportunity to reject something that has been said outside this House by the CII.  Unlike the normal representations one receives from that body, in this case they had been bleating about, of all things, a form of subsidisation which existed for years, brought in by successive Governments and supported by successive Governments, a subsidy that was for the benefit of the consumer, saying that in some strange way this subsidisation stopped rationalisation.  That is sheer unadulterated nonsense, coming from an organisation for which I have much time and respect.</P>
      <P>Inefficiencies in some bakeries, acknowledged by the Irish Bread Bakeries Association, must not be allowed to prevent the benefits from free competition flowing to the consumer.  It is my belief that many of the present difficulties have been brought about by the failure of some firms in the industry to make use of the most efficient means of production. Once again, I strongly urge those in the industry to modernise, in their own long-term interest and that of their employees.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bruton and other speakers referred to the quality of bread and said that there should be identifiable and proper labelling.  The 1982 food labelling regulation requires that a full list of ingredients &mdash; as well as a number of other items of information &mdash; be shown on bread.  All legal requirements in this regard are in full compliance with the EC provision as set out in the 1979 Directive on Food Labelling.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bruton and Deputy Cullen said that the dominant position of one company should not be allowed to distort the marketplace.  The fact is that the bread making capacity of the bakeries involved in Dunnes is of the order of 10 per cent of the market.  Under legislation dealing with monopolies, abuse of dominant position would not arise unless a particular supplier controlled over 50 per cent of the market.  That is not the case here and the company involved control about 25 per cent of the market.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade made a report on bread prices available to me today.  He states:</P>
      <P>In my investigation to date into the recent bread price war, my first objective was to establish whether Dunne's Stores or any other competitors were selling bread below net invoice cost in breach of the provisions of the Restrictive Practices Grocery Order, 1987.  I was quickly satisfied that there was no such breach and that bread sold retail at 35 pence was being invoiced to the retailer at 35 pence or slightly less. </P>
      <P>Of course bread is now being sold at 39 pence for a large sliced pan.</P>
      <P>The next charge was in relation to predatory pricing and I am concerned about this.  In that connection the director said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of all the foregoing considerations I have to say that I have found no evidence of predatory pricing <Col N="1790" /> on the part of Dunne's Stores or the relevant bakeries. </P>
    <P>There will be further reports but I want to emphasise that there was no belowcost selling or breach of the order.  The director also said that two firms of consultants engaged by him had examined the matter and found that there was no question of predatory pricing on the part of Dunne's Stores or the relevant bakeries.</P>
    <P>There is a genuine need for rationalisation but I want to make it clear to the House that in any area of rationalisation there will inevitably be a number of casualties, especially among the less efficient companies.  Let us all be clear that rationalisation causes casualities. This is the harsh reality and there is no point closing our eyes to it.  In today's competitive consumer bread market the introduction of new technology, efficient work procedures and an effective distribution system are essential for the survival of the industry.  There will be a greater specialisation and the companies involved have concentrated on the sliced pan.  However, there is a bright future for those who will concentrate on niche sectors of the market and there are &mdash; and will be &mdash; considerable jobs in that area.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to Odlums because they probably triggered this debate.  It is appalling for a company to treat workers and their families in the manner in which they have been treated.  They have a very profitable organisation, they have sold the site on which they were running their bakery but they have not made serious and determined efforts &mdash; I discussed this with the IDA earlier today &mdash; in relation to an alternative site.  I invite them to come forward with proposals for an alternative site for a high technology bakery because they owe that to the workers who have served them loyally and the people of Dublin who purchased their products for many years.  It is not sufficient for the Odlum company to pull back at this stage into flour milling and to ignore their bakery workers who have served them <Col N="1791" /> loyally and whose trade union representative last night said that the workers recognise that in rationalisation and a move to a new plant there would be job reductions.  That was a very positive and constructive approach and I congratulate the unions for it.  Odlums cannot pass the buck and take the opportunistic approach of a short term bread confrontation to try to hide the fact that they want to walk away from their employees.  They should meet their obligations to their employees and if they invest they will be assisted in every possible way by every existing aid of Government. What has happened is a disgrace.</P>

      <P>Last Wednesday night speaking to this Private Members' Bill I made three points: first, that the appointment of vocational teachers should be carried out in a manner which is both fair, impartial and above suspicion; second, that the appointment of vocational teachers should be carried out by people who are skilled in interviewing techniques and who have the professional training and background to ensure that the very best candidate is appointed to the job; and third, that these objectives would be met by passing the Bill before the House.</P>
      <P>It has been alleged that passing this Bill would result in the weakening of local democracy.  It has also been alleged that the Bill is too narrow and should include both secondary and primary schools.  I would like to deal with some of these points this evening.  I wholeheartedly believe in vocational education for a number of reasons, not least of which is that it is publicly controlled by elected representatives.  It is the only system of education which is so controlled.  The vast proportion of schools are privately owned and managed, though paid for by the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Higgins referred last week to the struggle which the VEC system had to undergo to get established and be maintained.  He spoke of the assurance which had to be given by the then Minister for Education, the former Deputy John Marcus O'Sullivan, to the Hierarchy in allowing the schools to be established. I found his remarks so interesting that I sought and obtained the letter to which he referred.  I have discoverd that the <Col N="1793" /> then Minister for Education not only gave the assurances to which Deputy Higgins referred but was also forced to give the following assurance.  I quote from the letter:</P>
    <P>By their very nature and purpose the schools to be provided under this Act are distinctly not schools for general education.  General education, after the age of 14 years, will continue to be given in primary and in secondary schools.  When we can afford to make more universal a system of general education for post-primary pupils it cannot be through the medium of these continuation schools. </P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Indeed, they did become schools for general education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>But the Minister must admit that the Minister of the day had to overcome a lot of opposition to his Bill, and it is to the credit of the former Deputy John Marcus O'Sullivan that this Bill was put through eventually and vocational education is so successful.</P>
      <P>The vocational system has always been under attack.  Unfortunately, the present Minister attacked the system at its jugular when she introduced expenditure cuts which have left the vocational system disadvantaged <i>vis-à-vis</i> other sections.  The cuts introduced by the Minister have resulted in larger classes, the loss of subjects, redundancies among teachers, and a dearth of remedial and guidance education. More importantly, the disadvantaged have been further disadvantaged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My party can justly and proudly claim to have come to the assistance of vocational education in Dáil Éireann.  It was a Fine Gael proposal carried by the House which subsequently allowed the teachers to negotiate with the Government on the cuts issue and to stave off the worst effects of the cuts.  For any Deputy, either on the Opposition or on the Government sides of the House, to suggest Fine Gael are damaging vocational education or local democracy <Col N="1794" /> by putting forward this Bill, I say they are mistaken and they should examine our record in regard to vocational education.</P>
    <P>I believe this Bill will strengthen vocational education and remove the taunt and allegation of political interference in appointments.  This can only aid the system.  The only point at issue is that the best person gets the job.  Selecting the best person for the job is a matter for the experts, and I suggest that we leave it to them.</P>
    <P>Both Deputy Quill and Deputy Higgins have commented that they wished to see the Bill broader based.  Deputy Quill referred to the Green Paper published by Deputy Hussey and Deputy Higgins referred to the thorny issue of the control of education.  He suggested that the Local Appointments Commission should be extended to both primary and secondary teachers.  To both of these Deputies I say that one must start somewhere.  In putting forward this Bill my colleague, Deputy Birmingham, has made an excellent start.  He has addressed an issue which is of crucial importance to our education system.  Without good teachers we will not have a good education service. This Bill will ensure that we would get good teachers, the best teachers; nothing could be more important.</P>
    <P>The question of the appointments procedure in respect of vocational teachers has been a source of controversy over the past 50 years.  As I said, it has taken courage and foresight on the part of Deputy Birmingham to address this issue.  I have here a quotation from the <i>Irish Independent</i> of Monday, 6 April 1959, which describes the appointment of vocational teachers as a discredit to democracy.  I have also quotations from editions of the <i>Irish Independent</i> and <i>The Irish Times</i> of last year in relation to a row which broke out in Dublin VEC regarding the appointment of a vice-principal at St. Kevin's Community College in Clondalkin.  In that case the recommendation of the selection committee was not accepted by the vocational education committee.  An article in <i>The Irish Times</i> stated:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1795" /> The row over the appointment of a vice-principal for St. Kevin's Community College in Clondalkin, Co. Dublin, and the allegations of political pressure being exerted by members of the VEC, ended yesterday when the VEC decided to accept the recommendation of the selection board. </P>

      <Col N="1796" /> There is no point denying that heretofore comments were riddled with innuendo that in some way local politicians, by a nod, wink or a stroke did in people when they applied for jobs as vocational education teachers.  In justice to those people, to the VECs, to county councillors and urban councillors throughout it should be clearly stated that since the foundation of the State their role in vocational education has been, to say the very least, magnificent, munificent and magnanimous.  Down the years VECs have contributed enormously not just at second level but in later years at third level.  They have produced from third level education colleges graduates who are sought throughout the world, men and women who can take their place with the best in various sectors of the economy, in education itself and in many other ways.</P>
    <P>Deputy Birmingham said the selection procedure had led to low morale within vocational education.  Is there now a suggestion or innuendo that the teachers who were selected by VECs were in some way incapable of carrying out their tasks, in some way loath to do acts which would not become their high calling, involved in some nod or wink way where they did not fulfil their role effectively or properly? I would regret any such innuendo.</P>
    <P>The proposer of the Bill says he wants to place the selection procedure of vocational teachers on the same level as pertains in the public sector generally. Deputy Birmingham has not yet objected to district justices, Circuit Court judges, High Court judges, Supreme Court judges or even the Chief Justice himself being selected by the Government.  His own Government selected them.  Deputy Birmingham, the proposer of the Bill, and those who support him have raised no objection to the role played by the Senate of the National University of Ireland in the selection of the presidents of UCC, UCD or other educational establishments.  Deputy Birmingham has raised no objection to the selection by the Government of the Chief Commissioner of the Garda or even an objection to the selection by his own <Col N="1797" /> Government of the Ombudsman who is entrusted with the role of deciding on applications to him by various people on their everyday lives where bureaucracy is concerned.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the matter of who appoints local councillors, be they urban or county councillors.  Local councillors are selected by the people and are answerable directly to the people.  They are rejected or selected on foot of their performance, and on foot of their performance their political lives are determined.</P>
    <P>What is the situation in other schools regarding the selection of teachers procedure? Secondary schools select their own teachers and the State has no input there whatsoever.  There is a system of selection in primary schools but, again, it is completely different from what Deputy Birmingham proposes in his Bill.  Is there a valid or good reason that the selection procedure in vocational schools should be different from the selection procedure in community and comprehensive schools?  One could go on and on.  There is an inconsistency.  We have zoned in on one system with much innuendo in relation to the role of those involved in the selection procedure, virtually all of whom have been so involved honourably over the years.</P>
    <P>There is no point in saying this proposal does not erode the powers of local authorities. Of course it does.  The fact that you take away the selection of teachers procedure from local authorities' representatives on VECs of necessity erodes that power.  Not only of necessity does it erode the power; it insults the integrity of many of the people who have been involved in VECs throughout the years. If one is to say these powers should be eroded in this fashion, could the argument not be made, for example, that voluntary hospitals should not have politicians of any hue on their boards?  One must be consistent.  If one goes down the line one finds oneself asking the question, &ldquo;Who guards the guards?&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>There has been tremendous success in regional colleges over a number of years, not least in my own county.  Tralee <Col N="1798" /> Regional Technical College is serving not just the county of Kerry but much of Munster in tremendous fashion and has, like other regional colleges, close links with the VEC.  Indeed, the VEC in County Kerry pioneered outdoor education at Cappanalea outside Killorglin. Every gesture and act of that committee down the years to the best of my knowledge, has, to say the least, been above reproach.</P>
    <P>Turning to the modern needs of vocational education, I say there is a grave need for greater interaction between colleges and industry.  If we are to talk about people being involved in the selection of teachers procedure, we should look at the role industry has to play in vocational education, not just in terms of its direct input but in terms of the employment which industry can give to graduates from regional colleges and the selection procedure itself.  There is a very strong argument to be made for involving people engaged in the industrial world in the selection of vocational teachers and there is a great need for a greater link between regional colleges and the National University of Ireland universities and the technological universities. Graduates in certificate courses and people with diplomas coming out of regional colleges should be given a credit level and an opportunity to go on to obtain a degree in the field of activity where they have distinguished themselves.</P>
    <P>There is a growing realisation, which was contained in the manifesto of this Government prior to the last election, of a need to concentrate on the resources we possess.  Agriculture, forestry, food, fisheries, and horticulture must be targeted by RTCs as areas of future potential employment.  In these areas lies the success or failure of the economy.  In this regard it is crucial that we stimulate educational interest and awareness in all these areas.  As matters now stand we are, without question, lacking certain experts in these fields to take this country and its people into the next century. Technological expertise and the concentration of resources on these areas <Col N="1799" /> should be accompanied by an educational system in RTCs, and at first hand in vocational schools, in order that we would have people with the expertise to advise those who will be involved in these areas of activity.</P>
    <P>Vocational education itself was one of the great innovative ideas in this century. Its concentration on the personal skills of individuals, on their expertise in various crafts and their preparation for life has produced extraordinary success.  Times change just as people do and with changing times there is the necessity to diversify the sphere of activity in which colleges and schools are involved, a need for greater awareness of the fact that what did yesterday or the day before may not do today and certainly will not do tomorrow. A major study of the role of vocational education in Ireland would be most welcome.  It would concentrate upon those areas of growth in the economy which have to a large extent been ignored in previous years in order to create an awareness of the educational qualifications which would meet the needs of industry and growth areas in the future.</P>
    <P>Adult education has been one of the great successes of the past 20 years. People who would otherwise not have had the opportunity of realising the potential which they unquestionably possessed realised it to a large extent through adult education, which was ably assisted by the vocational education committees. These committees contributed in a large way to the success of many entrepreneurs in Irish business who gained their education at adult level.  Adult education was necessary because many people of the last and the previous generations did not get the opportunities which their children and grandchildren get today.  When we speak about vocational education we would be remiss not to recall what Sigerson Clifford described as dusting down the blackboard of the years and consider the tremendous achievements which have been made in this sphere of education. It would be unwise not to pay <Col N="1800" /> tribute to the vocational education committees which brought education not just to every family, deprived or otherwise, but also to adults who in their youth did not have the opportunity of being educated.</P>
    <P>It is grossly unfair to smear VECs by innuendo and to denigrate in such a mean way their role in education and their contribution over the years.  It is all very well to criticise others.  The easiest thing in the world to do is to say one person would be better than another at selecting people.  Politicians are not the only people who can be influenced by canvassing. They are not the only people who can be asked for favours.  I greatly regret the insinuation that it is all very well for politicians at national level to make appointments in the public sector but it is not all right for people who give of their time voluntarily to be involved in the selection procedure.  It ignores the reality of the democratic process and it insults it.  I do not believe the vast majority of the people who have been involved in vocational education committees through the years have been in any way motivated by a sense of greed, meanness, unfairness, a sense of injustice or inequity.  Far from it.  Most of those people have served voluntarily without pay, without praise and very often without thanks on these and other committees in the local government sector.  The system of local government should not be denigrated by innuendo or remark.  One must consider the contribution which has been made.</P>
    <P>The contribution of vocational education committees has extended far beyond the role envisaged by John Marcus O'Sullivan.  It has spread into culture, the arts, sport and every activity of Irish life.  It has contributed enormously to the proud tradition of Irish education.  It has given people an opportunity they might otherwise never have had.  The continuation of a adult education policy is something to which I am totally committed.  I am aware of people who, because of personal circumstances, were unable to be educated beyond national school level, men and women <Col N="1801" /> aged over 50 who, with the assistance of vocational education committees, were enabled to go on in life because of adult education courses.  There are people who have been tremendously proud and thankful for the opportunities which life presented subsequently as a result of such courses.</P>
    <P>Night courses have been run in virtually every vocational school in subjects ranging from handiwork to languages. The VECs have mobilised and utilised their resources and tried to make an input in a way other educational spheres never did.  Why then should one come into this House and suggest that these committees have acted wrongly in some way?  I am no apologist for the vocational education committees but I am trying to give an objective view.  The objective view must be that their contribution, their interest and their magnanimity in every area of educational life and outside it has been without question one of the great crusades and adventures in modern Irish education.</P>
    <P>If they are to change the selection process it should be done very carefully.  The role of public representatives and of those who have been involved for many years should in no way be denigrated.  The Minister has a representative on the selection boards and the advice of that member is very often taken above all and any other considerations.  If one were to say, as Deputy Deenihan did, that an alternative method of selection by the Local Appointments Commission would be more successful and would get what he described as the best teachers, the suggestion is that the teachers selected by the vocational education committees were not the best teachers.  One must follow that argument through and contend, on the basis of Deputy Deenihan's suggestion, that the teachers who were selected should not have been selected at all.  Have those teachers failed?  I do not believe they have.  Rather they have contributed enormously to the high standards of education obtaining in vocational schools and educational colleges throughout the country.  When one attacks those involved in the selection <Col N="1802" /> procedure the immediate suggestion has to be that the person selected was in some way inter-linked with what, by innuendo, is suggested as having been a less than fair appointment.  I do not think the teachers appointed by the vocational education committees have let them down.  I do not think they have let Irish education or their pupils down.  There is clear evidence all around us to suggest that the contrary is the case.</P>
    <P>Deputy Birmingham said he had found or detected a low morale in vocational education today.  Who told him that? Nobody ever told me so and I know many teachers and many members of VECs. Indeed, I know many CEOs of VECs in various parts of the country.  Nobody ever told me there was low morale obtaining in vocational education.  This appears to be a figment of the imagination conjured up with a view to making the sort of innuendos that are regrettable, unfortunate, misinformed and downright ridiculous. Deputy Deenihan said, in support of Deputy Birmingham's conjured up image, that there were redundancies abounding.  In an endeavour to conjure up an image of there being something drastically wrong in vocational education the facts are now being misrepresented.  The facts are that there was no compulsory redundancy in vocational education in recent years.  The only redundancies that took place were voluntary and even they did not happen unless requested by the VECs.  It is also fair to say that, in the operation of the voluntary redundancy scheme by the VECs, there was the utmost integrity maintained, the utmost feeling for the schools, the utmost care, concern and sympathy for pupils, and for the position of any teacher seeking voluntary redundancy. There has been no suggestion whatsoever, nor could there be, that because a given teacher had a certain political affiliation, or a knowledge of certain politicians involved in VECs, he or she was allowed voluntary redundancy. Voluntarty redundancy was granted by the VECs when they genuinely felt it would not materially damage the education in any school or college.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1803" /> If one wants to attack the selection procedures for appointment of teachers to work for a VEC the converse is the case, that there would also be something wrong with a teacher seeking retirement under the voluntary redundancy scheme. It must be realised that local knowledge of circumstances prevailing is of tremendous advantage in selecting a teacher, not merely of the school but of its pupils, their parents and its principal.  Local knowledge is of paramount importance. Local knowledge has meant local government, which has often been denigrated and, by innuendo, by the proposer and supporters of this Bill.  Local government has been tremdously effective over the years.</P>
    <P>At the outset I said that most people want to be fair.  I want to be fair as well. I want to be seen to be fair, if possible, although the latter is not as important as the former.  One should not be fair merely for populist reasons, not merely to be seen to be fair but rather being fair to everybody, not merely to the teachers, the pupils, the headmasters but also to those men and women who have served on VECs since their inception who have contributed enormously to what began as a seed and has grown into a great oak tree, unshakable in Irish education. Indeed it has not finished growing.</P>
    <P>I do not think the provisions of this Bill, or any similar one, should been seen to be the beginning of the end regardless of populism or anything else.</P>

      <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh an Bhille seo atá curtha os comhair na Dála ag mo chomhleacaí anseo, an Teachta George Birmingham, agus sílim gur tráthúil an rud é go bhfuil Bille a bhaineann le cúrsaí oideachais os comhair na Dála, agus go speisialta cúrsaí gairmoideachais, <Col N="1804" /> mar le cúpla bliain anuas, is fíor a rá go bhfuil gach gné de chúrsaí oideachais sa tír seo faoi ionsaí agus faoi bhrú.  An ghné a bhfuil baint agam féin léi de chúrsaí oideachais agus a bhfuil an-eolas agam uirthi mar gur chaith mé cúig bliana de mo shaol ag plé léi ná an bunoideachas, agus is cinnte go bhfuil sé sin faoi bhrú i láthair na huaire.  Nuair a chuimhníonn tú, uimhir a haon, ar na hathruithe a tharla le cúpla bliain, go bhfuil níos lú múinteoirí ag teagasc anois ná mar a bhí ag teagasc le roinnt blianta.</P>

      <P>By way of introduction I wanted to illustrate that education, both primary and post-primary, is under attack and severe strain at the moment. Ach mar a dúirt tú, a Cheann Comhairle, baineann an Bille seo go príomha leis an earnáil ghairmoideachais.  Rinne gach duine a labhair go fóill tagairt do John Marcus O'Sullivan agus an Rialtas a bhí ann ag an uair sin agus chomh fadradharcach agus a bhí siad, agus go raibh sé beagnach réabhlóideach ag an uair sin gur chuir siad an córas seo ar bun.  Mar dhuine as Dún na nGall caithfidh mé a rá go bhfuil an-chuid oibre déanta ag an coiste gairmoideachais agus ag an córas gairmoideachais do oideachas agus do scolaíocht i mo chontae féin chomh maith le ar fud na tíre.  Nuair a cuireadh ar bun é i ní raibh oideachas iarbhunscoile le fáil ach go hannamh.  Bhí sé le fáil sna coláistí deoise.  Bhí sé le fáil chomh maith ag na bráithre agus ag na mná rialta.</P>
      <P>I mo chontae féin is beag scoil iarbhunoideachais a bhí sa chontae.  Ní shílim go raibh mórán de na bráithre i dTír Chonaill.  Níl a fhios agam cén fáth nár éirigh leo dul chomh fada leis sin.  Bhí scoil amháin i mBéal Átha Seanaidh agus ceann i Leitir Ceanainn.  Mar an gcéanna leis na mná rialta.  Agus nuair a cuireadh an coiste gairmoideachais ar bun agus an córas gairmoideachais cuireadh scoileanna ar fáil ar fud na tíre, agus cuireadh oideachas iarbhunscoile ar fáil dona lán daltaí nach mbeadh teacht acu air ach amháin go raibh an córas sin ann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anois is é ceartlár an Bhille seo ná córas cheapadh múinteoirí san earnáil ghairmoideachais.  Sin go díreach an t-aon rud atáimid ag iarraidh a athrú. Dúirt an Teachta O'Donoghue nuair a bhí sé ag caint romham nach bhfaca sé aon rud mícheart leis an chóras mar atá anois.  Ach ba mhaith liom a chur in iúl dó, bliain i ndiaidh bliana nuair a bhí a gcruinniú bliantúil ag Ceardchumann Múinteoirí Éireann, an TUI, na daoine <Col N="1806" /> atá ag plé leis na múinteoirí, an chuid is mó de na múinteoirí ata sa chóras gairmoideachais, go bhfuil sé mar pholasaí acusan go ndéanfaí athrú ar an chóras. Níl siad sásta leis, agus sílim go gcaithfimid aird a thabhairt ar an mhéid atá le rá acusan.  I láthair na huaire tá bord ceapachán ann atá tógtha amach as ballraíocht an chórais ghairmoideachais.  Nílimid ag iarraidh aon rud iontach a dhéanamh.  Is é an t-aon rud atáimid ag iarraidh a dhéanamh nó go gceapfaí na múinteoirí gairmoideachais sa tslí chéanna ina gceaptar daoine cosúil le dochtúirí nó daoine atá ag obair sa bhord sláinte nó banaltraí nó ailtirí nó fiú amháin daoine a bhíonn ag obair sa chomhairle chontae.</P>
    <P>Is é an rud atáimid ag moladh sa Bhille ná go dtabharfaí an chumhacht seo do Choimisiún na gCeapachán Áitiúil. Anois, chomh fada agus is eol dom, tá an coimisiún seo ar bun ó 1926.  Sílim gur cuireadh Coimisiún na Státseirbhíse ar bun i 1924, ach ó 1926 na ceapacháin uilig a dhéantar ag an leibhéal áitiúil roimh an rialtas áitiúil agus comhairlí contae tá sé déanta ag Coimisiún na gCeapachán Áitiúil.  Ó shin i leith le seasca bliain atá siad ann agus i rith an ama sin tá anmhuinín ag pobal na hÉireann iontu. Feicimid go dtugann siad cothrom na Féinne do gach duine agus go gcuireann siad a gcuid agallamh ar dhaoine agus go ndéanann siad an ceapachán mar a mheasann siad bunaithe ar na cáilíochtaí a bhíonn ag na hiarrthóirí a chuireann isteach air.  Ní shílim go bhfuil aon duine ar an taobh seo den Teach nach n-aontódh go bhfuil an-chuid oibre, go bhfuil obair mhaith déanta ag Coimisiún na gCeapachán Áitiúil.  Agus sin go díreach an rud atá muidne ag iarraidh sa Bhille seo, go dtabharfaí cumhacht dóibh nó go gcuirfí freagracht orthu na gairm-mhúinteoirí a cheapadh mar an gcéanna.</P>
    <P>Tá sé ar eolas againn uilig go mbíonn amhras go minic, chomh fada agus a théann ceapacháin mhúinteoirí sa chóras gairmoideachais, agus tá a fhios againn uilig sa saol poiblí nuair a bhíonn folúntas le líonadh go dtagann daoine chugainn agus iad ag iarraidh orainn ár ndícheall a dhéanamh dóibh.  Ní shílim go bhfuil sé <Col N="1807" /> sin, fiú amháin, sásúil, ó thaobh na ndaoine a bhíonn ar na coistí gairmoideachais. Bíonn brú orainn, agus is cinnte nach bhfuil sé maith do na múinteoirí a chaitheann dul tríd an chóras seo.  Cuir i gcás an córas lenar bhain mé féin, an bhunscolaíocht.  Ceaptar múinteoirí ansin, agus sílim go bhfuil an bord níos leithne.  Bíonn an príomhoide ann agus bíonn ionadaí ag an easpag air agus bíonn ionadaí ag na tuismitheoirí air, agus b'fhéidir go mbíonn comhairle le fáil ag an chigire nó mar sin, mar a thuigeann an Teachta Fitzgerald.  Nó cuir i gcás, sna scoileanna cuimsitheacha nó sna scoileanna pobail, bíonn ionadaí ag an easpag, bíonn ionadaí ag an chóras gairmoideachais, bíonn an t-ardmháistir, bíonn ionadaí ag an Roinn, agus tá an bord níos leithne.</P>
    <P>Chomh fada agus a bhaineann sé leis an chóras gairmoideachais, tá sé anchúng. De ghnáth bíonn ceathrar ionadaithe ón choiste gairmoideachais, agus b'fhéidir cigire de chuid na Roinne.  Sin an dearcadh atá ag an cheardchumann agus sin an dearcadh atá le fáil i measc na múinteoirí féin a bhfuil teagmháil agam leo.  Sílim go bhfuil sé in am é a athrú agus na cumhachtaí, mar a dúirt mé, a thabhairt do Bhord na gCeapachán Áitiúil, agus sin go díreach an rud atá molta sa Bhille seo.</P>
    <P>I welcome the introduction of the Bill by Deputy Birmingham.  It certainly does not dispute the major contribution made by the vocational education sector to education here since it was initiated in 1931 but seeks to address the method of appointment of teachers and their promotion to posts of responsibility.  In any sphere of life man has his worth.  In the teaching profession more than most, this is measured by the esteem of his colleagues, the trust of his pupils and the personal integrity of the teacher himself in the performance of his duties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>His or her duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley" hpid="Mr. McGinley Mr. McGinley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it is almost evenly divided.  When I was teaching more than half of my staff were female and they <Col N="1808" /> were a very efficient staff.  Rarely does the dedicated teacher measure his or her worth in terms of financial reward.  They give freely of themsleves to the many demands placed on them.  Personal relationships built on trust and the element of fair play are all important in the smooth running of a school.  Where this trust and fair play are missing the whole structure breaks down and the school disintegrates.</P>
      <P>There is, perhaps, nothing more destructive of personal relationships than suspicion.  It poisons the goodwill on which our school system is built.  We, more than most, have seen the catastrophic effects of suspicion in a community. School is also a community where personal contact is ever present, and at a premium, and where relationships between its members are paramount. Anything that infringes on those relationships or causes suspicion between members creates an insidious growth which will eventually destroy the school body.  In my own experience of dealing with vocational schools and vocational teachers &mdash; and Donegal has the greatest concentration of VEC schools in relation to population of any county &mdash; there is no greater point of contention and suspicion than the present method of appointment. Whether political influence is involved in appointments and promotions is not the point.  It is the fact that people feel that politicians have an influence that creates resentment and suspicion.  I know of many admirable teachers dedicated to their profession, people of complete integrity, who would no longer demean themselves with the ritual parading before an interview board to be asked often meaningless questions unrelated to their professional responsibilities in an atmosphere where they feel that ability, experience and dedication matter very little, certainly perhaps less than their political affiliations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Appointments made under the present system are suspect, and all the more so because of the surplus of teachers available. What worried parent can be blamed for using his influence within the political system if there is the slightest chance that <Col N="1809" /> it may obtain a valuable appointment for a son or daughter?  What politician can be blamed if he repays an outstanding political debt by a word in the right ear? It is this type of suspicion, whether real or imagined, that permeates the system. It demeans a worthy profession, places a question mark over the integrity of politicians and gnaws at the self esteem of the appointee.  Above all it permeates the atmosphere of the staff room, creating resentment, suspicion and frustration. Inevitably this frustration transfers itself to other areas of school life so that a cynicism prevails.  This is not an atmosphere conducive to the education of our children, a consideration that should be of paramount importance.  Doctors, dentists, lawyers, accountants and other professionals have their work measured by the contribution they make to their profession and this worth will be reflected in their appointment to senior posts by proper professional bodies.  Who would accept that a senior hospital appointment be made by the local candlestick maker, with all due respects to him, simply because he has a political affiliation?  Is the education of our children so unimportant that appointments of their teachers and guardians be placed in the hands of people who, no matter how admirable in other respects, lack the insights necessary for proper judgment?  In my opinion there are only two acceptable methods of appointment, the one based on seniority and experience, the other on merit. Basing appointments on seniority is a question of filling dead men's shoes, but it has merit in so far as it is acceptable to the staff, eliminates the suspicion of political interference and will not poison the atmosphere.  It would also eliminate the costly exercise of appointments boards and the disruption to the school where as many as half the staff can often be attending interviews under the present system.  The alternative to seniority is appointment on merit.  In most spheres of life, especially commecial, this is the more acceptable.  But who is to judge the merits of a professional teacher?  Obviously it must be a body with a clear insight into the profession and what constitutes <Col N="1810" /> a teacher; it must be a body that is independent and professional in its own right, a body with the requisite expertise.  I can think of nobody more suited to the task than the public appointments board.  The present method of appointment is archaic, unprofessional and demeaning to a body that has contributed so much to a first class educated youth.  Not alone should appointments be fair, they should be seen to be fair.  This Bill is designed to remove any suspicion in the appointments of vocational teachers and to have their appointments treated the same way as other professions, namely, the medical, accountancy, dental and so on.  For that reason I commend this Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>I have had considerable problems in making up my mind whether to support or oppose this Bill because it is taking from the VECs the power to establish their own selection boards for appointments and promotions within the system. The VEC system has been of outstanding benefit to the country since the 1930 Act was passed.  Its most outstanding feature is that it is not selective.  All are welcome and all are catered for, unlike the private secondary school system which selects its pupils and rejects the others as if all are not entitled to equality of education.  The VEC system is totally non selective.  It takes the best and the weakest.  It has devised systems to cater for the teaching of all types of pupils and has done an excellent job.  The 1930 Act has proved time after time that it is capable of dealing with the most dramatic changes in our society.  It allows for progressive changes in curriculum and teaching methods in line with changing circumstances.  In particular the VEC system is unique because of its democratic nature, and it is the only democratic and secular education system we have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One would therefore expect it to be nurtured by the State and given every assistance because of the difficulties it <Col N="1811" /> always has in dealing with pupils of differing capacities and different levels of advantage and so on.  In fact it is now under increasing attack, being more and more deprived of funds and competing more and more with better funded comprehensive and community schools.  Last year it had forced on it the totally unjustified pupil teacher ratio increase up to 20:1 on pressure from the private secondary fee paying area which felt that the VEC had an advantage over them when in fact it was under a grave disadvantage.</P>
    <P>The VEC system is under attack. Therefore, my instant reaction is to defend this system to the last from any attempt to remove from some of the VEC committees powers they already have.  However, the teacher selection system is also under greater scrutiny than ever especially by teachers.  This is largely because of the large number of unemployed teachers, temporary and part time teachers, and the demand for every available post.  Teachers must be satisfied that they are selected purely on merit.  They must be satisfied that they are not subjected to or even appear to be subjected to, religious or political bias.  I had occasion to question the previous Minister for Education a couple of years back on the Catholic Primary School Managers Association guidelines for the selection of teachers in which they said that only practising Roman Catholics would be considered for new appointments as teachers.  The Minister defended that.  Even though the teachers were paid by the State it was a matter for the Catholic primary school managers to decide on the selection of teachers.  I thought that was totally wrong at the time.</P>
    <P>My experience of the VEC system started in 1979 when I was elected to the City of Dublin VEC.  I was on the school board of a couple of schools and I was also on the management board of Bolton Street College of Technology.  I was a member of many selection committees which selected teachers, held interviews and so on.  There was always pressure on <Col N="1812" /> members of the VEC to be members of the selection committees because there were so many ongoing interviews regarding promotions and appointments and many lasted a day or two days.  Although it was very difficult for me to get time off I never let them down.  I was a member of these boards from 1979 until 1985.</P>
    <P>In 1985 local elections were held and a new VEC was elected.  There was then a different political majority &mdash; Fianna Fáil had a majority on the committee.  Since 1985 I have not been invited to attend one selection board.  That is a tribute to all the other members of the VEC.  They are all able to attend the selection boards and there has never been any difficulty in making up membership of these boards as there had been with the previous VEC. At that time I was often under great pressure to attend but since 1985 I have never been invited to, advised of or told about one selection board.  I have no complaints about the appointments in the area but I am merely making the point that from 1985 to date I have not been put on any selection board.</P>
    <P>It appears that when people are being interviewed they are aware of the political connotations of the board.  No matter how honest and straightforward that board is they would have some qualms as to whether they said something the board would remember as not being in accordance with their political beliefs; they might have said something outside, in a letter to the papers or something of that nature.  When people go before interview boards they remember things like that and like to make sure they have a clean sheet.  The danger in regard to selections arises with political or religious bias.  The Local Appointments Commission have an enviable record in regard to fairness of appointments and for the benefit of teachers and pupils all teacher appointments should come under the Local Appointments Commission.</P>
    <P>As I have said already, I had occasion to question the former Minister for Education, Deputy Hussey, in regard to religious discrimination.  Fine Gael, in this Bill, are tackling the question of possible political discrimination but they are <Col N="1813" /> running away from the blatant religious discrimination which teachers regularly suffer and which has made the headlines of newspapers and so on for a number of years.  I would hope they will accept an amendment to this Bill allowing the Local Appointments Commission to handle all teacher appointments.  I do not see why the VEC should be selected while the primary sector is allowed its own discriminatory system of selection.  I will be proposing an amendment, if the Bill goes to Committee Stage, that all teacher appointments be handled by the Local Appointments Commission.</P>

      <P>Deputy Mac Giolla was not invited to participate on any of the interview boards and he wanted to make that position clear.  I am disappointed with that.  I did not, even during my term as chairman of the City of Dublin VEC, attempt to exclude Deputy Mac Giolla.  I have to say further, and I want to make this quite clear, that at no stage did I as chairman attempt to impose my will as to who should or should not be on the interview boards.  If it had come to my attention that Deputy Mac Giolla should be on the interview boards I would have readily and positively responded to that.  I would have called for Deputy Mac Giolla if I had known what he has since put on the record of the House.  When he <Col N="1815" /> and I met on one occasion outside Cathal Brugha Street to discuss structures and personnel in the VEC I was satisfied we had reached an agreement.  However, if Deputy Mac Giolla had assumed that we should have had further discussions, then I would admit that I was remiss in not pursuing those discussions but I want to make it unequivocally clear now that this was not my understanding.  If it should have been my understanding, then I have no difficulty in apologising to Deputy Mac Giolla for that.  I hope he will agree that I have never tried to stifle the contributions he wanted to make at committee meetings, If he thinks otherwise he can stand up and contradict me.  I was always interested and willing to listen and at committee meetings I showed that I wanted his input to policy.  I hope he agrees with me on that point.</P>
      <P>During the course of Second Stage, Deputy Birmingham adverted to the long-standing irritant which he stated as the need to, and I quote from the Official Report, Volume 387, column 979:</P>
      <P>...assert and vindicate the professional status of the vocational school teacher. </P>
      <P>As I interpret it, this is the recurring theme of Deputy Birmingham's contribution. He seeks to assert that while the democratic process is at work in the appointment of teachers, it is not the ideal or desirable process to bring the best calibre of teaching pool within the vocational education sector.  I believe this is the fundamental point Deputy Birmingham is attempting to make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I immediately take issue with this assertion on the calibre of vocational education teachers because the implication is that the calibre and quality of teachers providing a vitally important and increasingly innovative service at present, as I am sure in the past, is not what it should be.  That is the clear implication of his remarks, but if I am wrong let him prove that to me.  I believe such an implication does a disservice to the many vocational teachers, not alone in Dublin with whom I am most familiar, but around the <Col N="1816" /> country.  They have pioneered new courses, they have been innovative and they have faced up to enormous challenges in the delivery of the education service.  Perhaps Deputy Birmingham did not intend his remarks to be taken in this way, and I have to accept that is a possibility, but certainly the implication is clearly there and I know that it would be deeply hurtful to the highly professional people involved if it was deliberately intended.  However, I am prepared to accept tonight that it was an inadvertent implication on the part of Deputy Birmingham.</P>
    <P>There are a number of recurring themes elaborated on by Deputy Birmingham. In fairness, certain aspirations are quite laudable, in my experience as a former chairman and now a member of a vocational education committee but, at the same time, other views he has elaborated on have quite serious implications. I can cope with that.  The Minister readily recognises that education is a constantly evolving service in terms of its structures and procedures.  It has to be so primarily because it is constantly addressing and facing up to new challenges. There are challenges in terms of social skills, personal development, the quality and type of education, the intellectual development of the student and indeed the demands of the marketplace whether for second or third level students.  While I believe it is not only right but essential that we should have ongoing discussions on the need to adapt, change, update, review and revise the way in which we do things in education &mdash; my colleague, the Minister, subscribed to this when in Opposition and I know she subscribes to it today &mdash; I would caution that we do not throw out the baby with the bath water.</P>
    <P>I have already conceded that Deputy Birmingham raised a number of points worthy of the Minister's consideration. However, I have to state I was disappointed that he did not address himself in detail to the significant contribution that vocational education has made from <Col N="1817" /> 1930 to the present day in bringing technical, technological, academic and community education to the masses.  This cannot be denied or refuted.</P>
    <P>If the selection process for teaching personnel is as flawed as some perceive it to be &mdash; I have to concede that the Deputy was quite guarded; he used the word &ldquo;perception&rdquo;&mdash; I am baffled as to how the teachers involved over the years, and particularly in recent years, have come to the fore in the innovation and pioneering of new courses or the revision of courses and their voluntary input into the review of the curricula and syllabi which is an irrefutable fact.  I am speaking from immediate personal experience when I say that the curriculum and development unit established by the City of Dublin VEC and sanctioned by the Department is noteworthy.  Many new and imaginative courses addressed at students who have not a very strong academic bias resulted from this.  The career foundation programme is one example of their work and it is still in operation in a number of city vocational schools.</P>
    <P>I will admit that the take-up has not been as spectacular as I would have hoped because I believe the philosophy behind it is commendable.  It sought to address a very serious academic, socioeconomic problem.  Despite what I might call the disappointing take-up, it has come forward with some very imaginative programmes.  Let me add that at a presentation of certificates in one of our schools in Dublin city next Friday the daughter of a very famous national media personality will be presented with her certificate.  In fact, the person making the presentation, is nationally renowned and is the mother of the girl.  I think that speaks for itself.</P>
    <P>We have come forward with very imaginative programmes.  There are others, such as the humanities programme. In Dublin where I got my basic experience in vocational education we had the development of the humanities programme.  We had the accelerated development of the vocational preparation and training programmes to which both Deputy Birmingham and the <Col N="1818" /> Minister referred.  These programmes sought to address a student population that did not have a very strong academic bias.  These were initiatives taken by teachers, post of responsibility holders and principals with the support of committees, to try to deal with a very serious social problem in the educational arena. We should commend them wholeheartedly for doing that.  We should pay tribute to them and record in this House the kind of expertise that was brought to bear in the formulation of those courses. To do otherwise would be to do a disservice to the VEC system.</P>
    <P>Deputies on the other side of the House adverted to the fact that the VEC schools very often have to provide an educational service to those who are not as academically strong as others and whose social and economic backgrounds are sometimes disadvantaged.  This is very often but not always true.  Where it is true the commitment of the teaching staffs to address these problems by providing an interesting, educationally useful and directionally challenging and vocationally desirable set of programmes should be lauded.</P>
    <P>The Bill before the House aspires to objective selectivity as the most laudable procedure for the appointment of VEC teachers, yet the point is being made that there can be no objection in principle to putting teachers on the same footing as everyone else.  I subscribe fully to that very laudable aspiration if it was as simple and clearcut as has been stated.  I have to put it to the House that when we talk about objective selectivity in terms of appointing VEC teachers to schools where in many instances there are very special and localised needs, one can arrive at many interpretations as to what objective selectivity is in terms of our selection procedure.  It is a very complex issue and we should not over-simplify it. Deputy Birmingham said at column 983 of the Official Report of last Tuesday:</P>
    <P>Because the selection boards who make the appointments are not professionally qualified, it is very difficult <Col N="1819" /> for appointments to be made purely on the basis of merit. </P>
    <P>That is not entirely accurate.  There are many people involved with committees around the country who are qualified.  In Dublin there are very highly qualified members of the committee.  The Deputy followed on by saying:</P>
    <P>There will, of course, be advisers present, but they are present as advisers and the actual decision-making may be made entirely by people other than those who are professionally qualified. </P>
    <P>This is inaccurate also.  My understanding is that an inspector has to be present as a voting member at all such interview boards not alone for teachers but for very many interview boards, whether at second or third level, and for highly technical and technological staff in the administrative area.  There seems to be a rather dismissive attitude in the Bill to the role of the CEOs and the education officers who are advisers to interview boards. Such an attitude does a disservice to these officials.  I have found that not only is the advice of these specialists invaluable in terms of the needs of a particular school but that the advice of the principal is also invaluable and he is always present at such an interview board.</P>
    <P>You may shake your head.  I am speaking as a former chairman of a committee and in my time&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

      <P>In my time as chairman of the VEC, when appointments were being made, principals were always present except where it was the appointment of a principal.  The principal's views were taken very seriously into account. The Minister in her contribution referred at column 966 of the same debate to mutual suitability.  In a way the Minister understated that aspect.  This is at the <Col N="1820" /> kernel of what vocational education is all about.  It is invariably vitally important in assessing a candidate's suitability for the job to have this concept in mind.  This concept, which has been in operation since well before my time, involves supplying the candidate with information regarding the post.  In order to select a candidate in this context he must have detailed knowledge of the post, his duties and the environment in which they will be performed.  As the Minister said, the further removed a selection process is from the operation of the system, the less likely one is to get the best candidate.</P>
      <P>As a person who went through the academic process, I put a high store on qualifications.  Generally speaking we put a high store on qualifications.  If somebody has a MA or a PhD as opposed to a BA, we tend to assume that this is the right candidate for the job.  When we are dealing with vocational education, when we are dealing with very localised problems that have to be addressed by professional people, it is not good enough to say that Mr. MA or Mr. PhD is the automatic choice for the job.</P>

I take this opportunity to invite Deputy Mac Giolla to participate on those interview boards. This can be arranged at the next committee meeting.  I am inviting the Deputy because I believe he will share fully with me the kind of all round concern there is in relation to the suitability of a candidate. This applies equally to doctors and to other professions.  Doctors with extremely high academic qualifications may not be the suitable people to administer to the health of the community.</P>

    <P>I will now deal briefly with democracy in education.  I will not go into this in detail, but I want to refer to the previous Government's <i>Programme for Action in Education 1984-1987.</i>  It was their view that a full partnership with all the <Col N="1821" /> interests involved would promote democracy in education.  The action programme called attention to the importance of the ideal of participative citizenship in education so that young people would understand clearly, and identify with, the workings of democracy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the adjournment of the debate I had just outlined the objectives of Bord na gCapall established in 1970.  I am now asking if the Minister is seriously suggesting that his own Department can undertake all these functions in addition to the many functions they already have.  The danger is that with the abolition of Bord na gCapall and with other more influential areas of agriculture competing for the attention of the Department of Agriculture and Food, the non-thoroughbred area will be allowed to deteriorate even further and will virtually wither and die.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I acknowledged earlier, no one would dispute that Bord na gCapall did not have the success they deserved. There seems to have been a number of personality clashes in the organisation and a conflict between the board members and some of the staff.  The press drew great hilarity from a series of events in 1987 when it was disclosed that a <Col N="1822" /> number of stallions bought by the board were found to be defective in an area of some importance to stallions.  This episode was seized upon by the Minister who used it to justify his U-turn on the Fianna Fáil pledge to reorganise the board.  The matter was not nearly as clearcut as the way in which it was presented by the media or the Minister as anyone who had any real knowledge of breeding would acknowledge.</P>
    <P>One of the main reasons for the board's difficulties was that they were under-funded and under-resourced.  In 1985, for instance, the last year for which an annual report has been published, they got less than £500,000 from the State and had only a staff of 15.  This is probably less than it costs the State to keep Government Ministers in State cars and supplied with official drivers.  It was a tiny sum given the scale of the task they faced. This is the usual attitude of Fianna Fáil and Coalition Governments to the State sector.  They refuse to provide adequate finance and resources and complain then that they cannot do the job.</P>
    <P>There is another important aspect to this Bill.  Although it is entitled, Bord na gCapall (Dissolution) Bill, it actually repeals the entire contents of the Horse Industry Act, 1970.  A particularly important aspect of the 1970 Act was Part III which dealt with the licensing of riding establishments.  If the 1970 Act is repealed, presumably Part III is also repealed and there would be no provision for the licensing of riding establishments. This would be very serious.  The 1970 Act set out matters to be taken into consideration when deciding whether to issue licences.  These include measures related to fire protection, treatment of horses, disease control, etc. There is also the question of safety.</P>
    <P>Horse riding is a growing leisure activity and one that should be encouraged. There is an area of tourist potential there to be developed.  Horse riding can also be a dangerous business, especially if the horses are not properly trained and if it is not done under qualified supervision. It is surely in the public interest that there should be provision for the <Col N="1823" /> licensing of these establishments, yet if this Bill is passed there will be no statutory provision for such licensing.</P>
    <P>The final point I want to make is that the treatment of the employees of the board was very shabby.  Many of the employees had served the board loyally for a long period but their interests received little attention when the Minister made a decision to chop the board and, indeed, they could not even get a meeting with him to clarify their position. We are unhappy with the Bill, with its contents and the way it has been brought to the House long after the board has been scrapped.  Unless we get satisfactory answers to the questions raised, we will be voting against this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinPGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>To a large extent, the Bill before us tonight seeking to dissolve Bord na gCapall is only of minor importance. The fact is that Bord na gCapall have effectively ceased to exist for a number of years.  This Bill only recognises this reality, even if it does so belatedly. It is important, however, that we ask ourselves why Bord na gCapall should be dissolved.  Bord na gCapall is by no means an old institution that has become irrelevant because of changing circumstances.</P>
      <P>They were established by my father in 1970, 19 years ago, with a clear intention of tackling the problems and promoting the interests of the half-bred horse industry. They were not established on the spur of the moment.  They were based on recommendations of a survey team on the horse breeding industry and had the specific aims of dealing with the licensing of horse riding establishments, the registration of horses, the provision of a national trading centre and miscellaneous problems associated with improving the image of the Irish horse industry both at home and abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact that we are here tonight dissolving the board is a reflection of their failure to deal effectively with these issues and to meet the challenges for which they were created.  It is important that this House asks why this has come about.  One of the essential problems with <Col N="1824" /> Bord na gCapall has always been the makeup of their board.  Bord na gCapall have always been poorly served by some members of their board.  For example, there was a consistent failure to provide any kind of leadership or drive which is so important for their successful operation. The board were composed of many people who either had vested interests that prevented them from giving their best or who had no interest in advancing the half-bred industry.  Party politics was again allowed to destroy what could have been an effective institution.  People were appointed to the board as a reward for political favours or support rather than for their interest in or commitment to the ideals of Bord na gCapall.</P>
    <P>I recall when such an appointment was made of an individual who clearly had no qualifications, interest or input into the half-bred industry.  It was widely accepted at the time that this appointment was due to his participation in a conspiracy to unseat a Fianna Fáil colleague. The general public viewed this appointment to the board as a joke but it angered people and members of the horse breeding industry.  It can also be said that Bord na gCapall lost credibility when they purchased stallions that were only half equipped for the onerous task which lay ahead.  It was akin to buying a <i>Citroen deux chevaux</i> with one <i>cheval</i> missing.</P>

      <P>The national programme for development has very admirable objectives.  I would definitely like to see it succeed.  Talking to people in the half-bred industry, I was astonished to hear that there were only approximately 120 draught foals bred last year.  I am also aware that Europeans, and in particular, the Swiss, who are constant visitors and who purchase many of our top quality bloodstock, are finding it increasingly difficult to get what they are looking for. We should learn from our mistakes in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a few fundamental things that could be done to get it right.  Some <Col N="1825" /> kind of national leadership should be given and there should be a small working group carefully selected with specific instructions and guidelines.  This selected group should be made up of people who have the interests of the half-bred industry at heart and who can be held accountable. The conservation of the Irish draught bred is at risk and the £400 grant which is being made available has to be welcomed.  One of the reasons for the decline in this area was a lack of profitability and this £400 grant should encourage people to keep half-bred mares.</P>
    <P>Another area which will have to be given serious consideration is the performance testing of young stallions.  This area has been less than satisfactory in the past and our objective should be to breed nice horses with good jumping ability and temperament and all the other necessary attributes.  Teagasc should be involved in the performance testing of stallions and I understand that they have done much valuable work in this area at Kildalton in County Kilkenny.  However, I believe they lack facilities and the Minister should try to accommodate them in this regard.</P>
    <P>This is a very valuable industry and there is definite room for expansion in improving breeding and increasing numbers. I wish the Minister every success in his new development programme.</P>

      <P>Having some knowledge of the board I must concur with the comments of my colleague Deputy Avril Doyle, and the previous speaker that for one reason or another the board did not work well.  There was much self advancement by some members who were not over-concerned about the long term interests of the horse industry and this showed up in some areas under their management.  Basically the industry was allowed to run down and the selection of stallions left much to be desired.  The present position in the industry is diabolical in that the average age of stallions is 17 or 18 years.  That is a frightening statistic and now that the industry is being put back into the hands of private enterprise all these mediocre stallions will have <Col N="1826" /> to be weeded out immediately by the Department.  If this is not done we will be in big trouble because the customers who come from overseas will go elsewhere. As Deputy Doyle pointed out, the number of stallions is dropping dramatically and this is very worrying.</P>
      <P>Most credit for the success of the industry to date has to go to very dedicated people with whom I worked in the Department of Agriculture.  They carried out much dedicated work in trying to maintain a reasonable level of quality in stallions, carrying out inspection programmes and ensuring that Irish draught mares were in fact Irish draught mares.  I should like them to continue that work while at the same time carrying out tougher inspections.  There are many moneyed people in the industry and it would be in their interests as well as in the interests of the country that only quality animals would be purchased.  As was pointed out already, the Irish horse register is very important and thankfully this register has been preserved and protected. The Department now have the onerous job of keeping the register and ensuring that it is accurate.  As I have said on many occasions, progeny testing is a must, not merely from the point of view of the offspring but also from the point of view of the mare and the stallion.  The Department, and probably our universities, will have to get involved in this area because this is very vital work which will have to be carried out if we want to stay at the top of this league.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Doyle said, the advisory body should be self selected.  They will probably be a small advisory body and if the Minister and his officials are to get the right advice the only people who will give him that advice are people who are steeped in the industry, the people who depend for their livelihood on the rise or fall of the industry.  I am sure that as a Tipperary man, the Minister knows these are the people who will come together, make the right decisions and can be relied on to say the right things.  I welcome the introduction of the £400 grant but as I have said already it will not give the desired results if we do not upgrade the <Col N="1827" /> quality of our stallions and draught mares.  The advisory body will not achieve very much if the Minister does not abide by the decisions of the advisory body.  I should like any body who are set up to have teeth, in other words, that they will be in a position to advise the Minister and will do so in the full knowledge that their advice will by and large be taken by the Minister.</P>
    <P>This is a very expensive way of life. Some stallions cost in the region of £20,000 and it is easy to understand why some people are reluctant to get rid of mediocre animals.  They hope that inspectors will let their animals through and I believe it is in the interests of the industry for the Department to become quite ruthless in culling.  As I said recently at a function which was attended by people involved in the horse industry, the industry needs to be co-ordinated, revitalised and reconstructed.  That is my advice to the industry.  We must realise that we now have a world platform for our industry.  It is an international industry. Thanks to entrepreneurs like Noel C. Duggan, flocks of overseas buyers and competitors come to this country looking for a quality product.  Quality is the only requirement these people look for; price is not important.  When we talk about the horse industry in this House we forget that unlike, for example, dairy production, there are no restrictions, levies or quotas.  There is a world market for our product and that market is made up of moneyed people whose only requirement is quality but if we do not provide that quality we will not be able to participate in that market.</P>
    <P>I must refer again briefly to those who helped and advised us when we had to make some decisions.  What took place in Millstreet, County Cork, is a model for the future.  This happened under the aegis of one man, Noel C. Duggan, who set up his own equestrian forum in Millstreet.  As far back as 1969, he hosted the first international conference.  He had two Euro-championships in 1980 and 1981 and since then he has held ten international shows in that wonderful arena. <Col N="1828" /> He now has the Young Irelander for three year olds, the Boomerang Final for five and six year olds, the Denny's Gold Medal which is a versatile show, with dressage and eventing.  This has been the work of one family.  If we could get a few more people like that, the Minister would not have so many problems.</P>

As the Minister is probably aware, we now have, emanating from all that as a logical outcome of his work, the new company, Millstreet Horses Limited applying for FEOGA grants and it is hoped that those grants will go through.  That is the future that is there for the horse industry if the Government take the right advice.  Mr. Duggan was in every sense of the term a small businessman, with no particular background in horses.  However, he took the right advice, worked hard, did all the things he was supposed to do and did them properly.  He is now a very wealthy man, thanks to all that.  There are many more who could do the same.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>When I told some colleagues I was coming in to speak on this Bill, I was told to be careful because I might get a kick in the House.  That is a risk that must be taken.  Deputy Gibbons's speech recalled to me one of the first debates in which I ever took part after being elected in 1970, when the Bill which is now being repealed was being put through.  It was being put through with high hopes that at long last, after many long years of neglect, the half-bred industry would be set fair for a new deal, that that neglected sector of the agricultural industry would be put on a proper footing once and for all.  It was hoped it would get the attention it obviously deserved and needed, that it was a sector that could respond to attention by becoming viable, productive and profitable, thus providing alternative farm income for a great many farmers.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Gibbons has reminded us, the Bill that came before us was the result of the report of a survey team which had been set up by another Minister for Agriculture now in high places, the Taoiseach, to investigate the half-bred industry. The survey team examined that industry in considerable depth and produced a comprehensive report.  The kernel of the recommendations was the setting up of Bord na gCapall on a statutory basis.</P>
      <P>It is obviously a matter of some regret and considerable disappointment that Bord na gCapall have not survived.  We could spend much time analysing the reasons for this.  There is a mixture of reasons: reasons of differing personalities on the board, perhaps a clash of interest between the board and the industry, perhaps a lack of funding.  In the heel of the hunt, the blame for the failure of Bord na gCapall must, I think, lie with the parent Department which have to have an overall responsibility for statutory boards operating under their aegis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The demise of Bord na gCapall has been in train now for some ten years or so.  I must say that what was happening <Col N="1830" /> was apparent.  There was wide unease in the industry about the trends that were taking place within the board.  It is a matter of regret and I think, a matter of bona fide criticism of the Department of Agriculture and Food that that trend was allowed to continue to the point were the board became a fatality.</P>
    <P>To all intents and purposes, we are now back at the position that preceded the report of the survey team set up in the late sixties by the then Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Haughey.  It is an incredible admission of failure on the part of all concerned, but principally on the part of the Department of Agriculture and Food, that should have happened.  I would class this failure, while not being a failure in terms of magnitude and expense to the country, as a failure on a par with the failure of the TB eradication scheme.  There was a total lack of direction and control of something that manifestly needed a hands-on approach from the Department because of the particular sensitivities of the half-bred industry and of the personalities that are involved in that area of agricultural industry.  It is a great pity we are now back to square one, because the half-bred industry is a valuable national asset.</P>
    <P>One of the objectives in setting up the board was to restore the Irish draught-type horse to a healthy state.  Even 19 years ago there was considerable worry that the traditional Irish draught-type, the foundation of the Irish sport horse, was being eroded in terms of numbers and quality.  It was seen in those days as one of the prime objectives of Bord na gCapall to arrest that decline and restore that kind of animal to a position of numerical strength and appropriate quality. I am afraid that has not happened. The Irish draught-type inevitably has become more and more scarce in the meantime.  I have attended shows and have seen classes advertised as being for Irish draught animals where quite clearly the majority of the animals were half-bred horses and not draught horses at all.</P>
    <P>We have reached the situation where the traditional, true type of Irish draught <Col N="1831" /> horse is now a comparatively rare specimen. Whatever regime will be put in place to look after the half-bred industry from now on, an urgent requirement should be to try to rescue and promote the expansion of that type of horse.  It is, as I said, the foundation animal for the sport Irish horse which has been such a popular animal for very many years in the past.  I do not know if the typical half-bred we knew in the past will be the type of animal sought from now on for competition because the demands of modern competition, either in show jumping or eventing, will require a horse with more quality than the traditional half-bred from an Irish draught mare and a thoroughbred stallion.  I read an interesting comment during the week that the competition horse from now on will probably be the produce of a thoroughbred stallion and a half bred mare and it will be a three quarter bred or better.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Nevertheless, to get to that stage one must have a foundation stock of draught mares and the only way that can be ensured is to provide a financial incentive.  Very often the people who keep horses do so because they have a taste for the horse first and foremost.  In the modern farm there is literally no room for a horse as part of the modern farming activity.  It is a hobby with the owner, it may be traditional in the family and something for which the owner has a taste.  Many farmers keep horses, it is very doubtful if it is an economic proposition but they are loath to let go a family tradition.  Inevitably with succeeding generations and commercial pressures the family tradition attenuates and the horse will eventually disappear unless there is an incentive.  I know there is an incentive payable in disadvantaged areas, but having regard to the fact that horse breeding is not, by and large, a big activity in the disadvantaged parts of the country the premium should be extended to the country at large.  The amount of <Col N="1832" /> money involved would not be large because the numbers involved are not large.  If we reach the happy stage where the numbers become large and the amount of money becomes a problem, our difficulties will be over and we need not continue the incentive.  I strongly urge the Minister to look at the narrow limits of the incentives available and to extend them to cover the entire country.</P>
      <P>I also urge the Minister to appreciate that the problem of saving the Irish draught mares &mdash; if they can be saved at this stage and there must be a question mark over it &mdash; is certainly an extremely urgent one.  They can only be saved by the problem receiving the careful and serious attention of the Department which, in turn, will have to be supplemented by a substantial cash incentive.</P>
      <P>Everything else that was hoped for from Bord na gCapall is, unfortunately, disappearing with the repeal of this Act. Deputy Sherlock referred to the disappearance of the licensing sections. However, riding schools have become self-regulatory and they are run by a body enjoying the acronym &ldquo;Aire&rdquo;.  I do not know whether that is good or bad&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a successful institution. I do not know whether self-regulation is a proper substitute for statutory regulation in an area such as that but certainly self-regulation is well managed by the body concerned and they are entitled to take great credit for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is with some feelings of nostalgia that I speak 19 years on, having participated in my first debate in Dáil Éireann on the setting up of Bord na gCapall.  I now find myself participating in a debate on their dissolution.  Apart from feeling nostalgic we must all share in the sense of failure that something that was launched with great optimism has now collapsed and the consequences could be serious for a significant part of the agricultural industry. However, more than being a part of the agricultural industry, the half-bred industry is part and parcel of what makes <Col N="1833" /> this country different.  It would indeed be a great pity if the Irish sporting horse which has had a supremacy in the western world for many decades will now become &mdash; if not a thing of the past &mdash; something of less quality than we were used to and an animal which is no longer able to compete with the warm blood from Holland and Poland.  I see that Polish horses are now being advertised in British equestrian magazines and, in terms of numbers, the warm bloods come from mainland Europe and Poland.  They will probably swamp the Irish horses and take the market that was traditionally ours. The fact that that has already happened is a measure of the failure of the experiment put in place in 1970.  Recriminations in regard to the failure are pointless but I hope the reasons for the failure are analysed, identified and avoided in whatever new regime is intended.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank Members of the House for their contributions which, I must say with genuine conviction, I very much enjoyed and appreciated as they were from people who obviously have a deep interest and a real affection for the issue we have been addressing.  We have just had a little nostalgic journey with Deputy Cooney.  I remember the event as well, it was not my first debate in the House but I remember we all looked forward to what we thought was the beginning of a well organised and properly motivated programme as the Minister of the day &mdash; Mr. Jim Gibbons &mdash; introduced the Bill.  We all had the same high hopes in putting in place the legislation which we are now, ironically and unfortunately, moving to repeal.  In doing so we are all of one mind that the reasons are based on the experience of a failure that could not have been anticipated.  There is a certain sense of irony that the son of the then Minister has made a very practical and significant contribution this evening. Even Deputy Martin Gibbons &mdash; if I may put it that way &mdash; acknowledged that the expectations at the time the board were established had not been realised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1834" /> I do not propose to go back over what Deputy Doyle so eloquently and effectively underlined.  She rightly pointed out that I deliberately did not refer to all these things.  However, she more than made up for the omission on my part.  As Deputy Gibbons said, Bord na gCapall failed to deal effectively with the role with which they were charged.  Deputy Doyle referred to the key priorities such as the role in the promotion by the board of the half-bred industry and marketing exploitation.  They did indeed concentrate on exports but of a very selective few on behalf of an even more selective few.  That is regrettable and I intervened at one point to say that much of what Deputy Doyle said seemed to be an indictment of all who were associated, not just with the board, but with the industry at the time.  I remember her questioning me in the House at the time and Deputy Gibbons put it appropriately this evening when he said it was not <i>deux chevaux</i> but one <i>chevau</i> missing.  I remember Deputy Davern holding forth here with typical robust Tipperary eloquence on the condition of those who found themselves less than effectively endowed for the purpose for which they were meant to be employed.  In that connection I ask Deputy Gibbons to convey our best wishes to the man who introduced the Act we are now repealing, he is not to blame.</P>

      <P>If he were here he would be doing the same thing.  Deputy Gibbons referred to progeny testing and the education and training for the care, maintenance and development of this very special animal, the non-thoroughbred horse.  One of our priorities has to be the establishment of performance centres and progeny testing centres &mdash; we can also have marketing centres which I will come back to in a few moments &mdash; for which I will be able to provide that kind of essential guarantee for the breeder, owner and potential purchaser.  Reference was made to Kildalton.  In that connection let me say, and here I make <Col N="1835" /> no criticism, that it was not one of ACOT's functions to train people in the breeding of the half-bred horse which we hope will become a major source of income for farmers.  ACOT did not conduct such courses but I am glad to tell the House that I have specifically asked the chairman and director of Teagasc to ensure that they do conduct appropriate courses in husbandry, and in the caring, breeding and training of horses which will have their roots and base, and qualifications exclusively in this country.</P>

      <P>Let me indicate one of the things that hurt me some time back during the Belgian Presidency of the EC. My colleagues are aware that I am reasonably familiar with that country for one reason or another.  Informal meetings are held every six months and these present the country holding the Presidency with an opportunity to point out to the other member states what they see as some of their main achievements in their own country.  I thought I knew Belgium fairly well but it was not until I visited some of their equestrian centres that I realised that they were parading our bloodlines to their advantage.  What they had done with our bloodlines was a clear demonstration of what we had failed to do.  I put it as simply as that.  I came away convinced that if this is what they could do with our bloodlines, then surely we could do it also given our tradition and, one might say, affection for the horse.</P>
      <P>Deputy Doyle went into great detail in her contribution but it is only fair in the time available to me to try to deal with most of the points made in relation to this matter.  It has to be said that she made a number of very valid points.  I think she would acknowledge that because many of these are of wide ranging impact it would not be possible for me to answer each and every one now but I can assure her that the general points will be borne in mind when deciding on policy and we can consult each other on these for the advisory committee. I would like to have an informal arrangement with the House in respect of policy for the advisory committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having said that, let me deal with a number of the specific points made.  In relation to the register maintained within the Department, it is vitally important that this division &mdash; there are not too many of us involved &mdash; be visible and personable.  I have promoted it as widely as I can.  I cannot introduce all those who <Col N="1837" /> work in this division by name but the Principal Officer is Mr. Frank O'Donnell and I know of no other group &mdash; and I appreciate that Deputy Doyle has acknowledged this &mdash; who devote so much time and energy to their duties.  I ask the Deputy to make people aware that this division exists.  I accept the points made in regard to the register and passports but it is important that people do not feel they have to go through a layer of bureaucracy.  If they cannot find the people responsible directly who are few in number they could try to get on to my own office but I hope this will not be necessary.</P>
    <P>The Deputy is quite right in saying that problems have been experienced with the computer facility.  I am not going to try to shift blame but we have re-equipped the computer facility in the Department. I have appointed a new director and have assigned additional staff to this facility to help clear the backlog which arose due to the relocation of the horse register section. The Irish horse register section computer and that of the SJAI were incompatible. We are operating the same system as was operated by Bord na gCapall.  Therefore, we have not changed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>It was the announcement that Johnstown would be the centre that put them in that direction.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>They never suggested they got a bum steer from me, far from it.  My discussions with them were open and above board and no one in the equine centre would suggest otherwise. For reasons of their own, and they were good reasons, they decided to abort the discussions and it was not for me to make any comment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>They thought they were complying with what the Minister was suggesting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think they had some communication with some bigger brothers than themselves and it was this that made the difference.  Deputy Doyle must know this.  She happened to mention a name this evening and that is a clue to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Doyle also referred to the shortage of paper.  She was quite right. The problems arose as a result of there being uncertainty over who would run the register.  Clearly people did not order the stocks of paper that would be necessary for the issuing of passports and, as a result, stocks became depleted.  Perhaps public servants are a bit more prudent than the rest of us and they did not order stocks of paper in the knowledge that something else was being put in place, which as it happened did not turn out <Col N="1839" /> to be the case. What happened to the Deputy's friend was as a consequence of this but I am glad to be able to tell the Deputy now that the issue has been resolved and that this problem will not arise again.  I would not like to blame those prudent public servants who saw no reason to order paper which would not be used.</P>
    <P>In relation to the advisory committee, I note that Deputy Deasy, who was very good with this kind of thing, has left the House but he is the man, and I tend to have considerable sympathy for him, who said &ldquo;Do not let them select.&rdquo;&mdash; I was very much persuaded by what he said because he had some hard experience in this area.  &mdash;&ldquo;They will pick people from among themselves for the wrong reasons.&rdquo;  I am trying to get the balance right.  I hope the committee will be self-selective and will comply with the criteria set down.  A letter is issuing indicating that arrangements are now being made to set up this committee in which I give reasons and say what they are to do, and there is no need to go back over that. They are being invited to nominate representatives, one each, for membership of the committee.  These will be supplemented by representatives from the Department and others the Minister may deem appropriate &mdash; not too many, I assure the House.  They are told it will be appreciated if their organisation &mdash; we are leaving it to them as Deputy Doyle suggested &mdash; would consider at their earliest convenience who shall be represented on the committee, and their decision is sought at an early date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The letter states that the Minister's only concern is that only people who are fully conversant with all aspects of the non-thoroughbred horse industry both here and abroad and who can be expected to make a positive contribution to the further development of the industry are nominated for membership of the committee.  If they are not <Col N="1840" /> fully conversant with all aspects of the industry and are there just to represent a narrow sectoral view, we will not get an effective advisory committee.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>OK, I will make it 14. We are talking about political nominations in the broadest sense.  We are all politicians, a word often used in a very negative fashion, but in terms of people who have political responsibility our role is to do as may be appropriate.  After all, Government elected by the Dáil appoint judges.  That is their role.  Someone has to appoint them and that is a political appointment if anyone wants to call it so.</P>
      <P>I know from some very distinguished leaders in the legal world, such as the late Taoiseach, Jack Costello, whom I was privileged to know personally, that they tried the other way.  They appointed people who said they were representative of the Bar Council and the Incorporated Law Society, but it became a most vicious, introspective contest and they never could do anything properly where Government had a role.  Right or wrong, politicians can be criticised.  At least we can answer here and we are answerable and I hope that will happen here.  Since there are internal pressures within all the committees, I hope they will not select someone who eases the path for their own organisations but rather that they will select people who can contribute positively to what we all regard in this House as important.  I can assure the House that what has been expressed this evening is the view I have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me refer to the horse register.  I am not going to lay down strict rules, but I envisage that a subcommittee of the <Col N="1841" /> advisory committee would oversee its operation and suggest whatever changes are desirable having regard particularly to some of the practical points made this evening.  All of those views such as the passport markings Deputy Doyle mentioned, will be taken on board.  Many, if not all, of the other areas of concern will be examined by this committee.  I propose to appoint them for an initial period of, say, about three years which I think is about right although I have no hang up on this.  It has two advantages. They probably will outlive the Dáil &mdash; that is giving information &mdash; and whatever Dáil comes back will be able to review them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>A nod is as good as a wink.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Carey and I will probably think there is money on that prospect.  Leased stallions have been mentioned.  In terms of contractual obligations Deputy Doyle can be assured that the present leases and the legal obligations involved are and will be honoured. This does not constitute a breach of the existing contracts.  In fact, in a number of cases there are no contracts in existence because they have already expired.  No long-term contracts were made by Bord na gCapall &mdash; the longest was for five years.  Other schemes also operated.  We are giving them the first option nonetheless, but there is no breach of contractual or legal obligations.  If there is not a reasonable outcome from that first option, they have to go on the basis of disposal, as I mentioned in my introductory speech.  Leasing schemes are formally operated by my Department for other species such as bulls, rams and boars and they are all being wound down as economy measures.  We are doing the same here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding registration of animals bred by AI and ET, we are in a new area on which I am considering whatever advice is available.  I do not want to take issue on the basis of knowledge here or to take issue on an intransigent position, but most of Deputy Doyle's comments seemed to be related to the failure of AI <Col N="1842" /> in the thoroughbred area and of embryo transfers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>No. A private company are operating at the moment in this country in the half-breed area and their fertility rate has been abysmal.  In the thoroughbred arena, particularly in Switzerland they have ventured into this area and found it most unsuccessful and because of monitoring and identification of progeny they have abandoned it as an option for the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Just for the moment. That is why I misunderstood the Deputy. There may be difficulties identifying animals bred by AI and embryo transfer. In any event, such animals will not be registered until they are blood tied.  That at least will cope with that risk.  As regards AI and ET generally, I will be asking the committee to consider all these matters and to take the best advice available to them both nationally and internationally and to report to me immediately in that connection.</P>
      <P>We need a higher awareness of the register.  Because of the scheme I have put in place I hope the Irish draught will no longer be an endangered species.  I can tell Deputy Cooney the grants extend to the whole country, not just to the disadvantaged areas which in themselves already encompass 62 per cent of the country.  He and Deputy Doyle talked about the self-advancement of the previous board.  It is fairly evident the case has been proved.  In the words of the old Latin maxim, <i>res ipsa loquitur</i>, the facts speak for themselves.  I have nothing further to add.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Hegarty mentioned the problems of the original board and self-advancement and said he was concerned about weeding out medicore stallions. That will be a very essential feature because if we do not have selective progeny performance and testing, people will think we are going nowhere.  I hope the new advisory body will focus on that.  Regarding his reference to Noel C. Duggan, I could not agree more.  One man can achieve so much, but there are <Col N="1843" /> others who have the same abilities.  This is a measure of what can be done.  The Deputy is right about the FEOGA grants and I will be promoting them and similar grants vigorously.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cooney talked about the parent Department here.  At the end of the day we have to answer.  Public servants do what we ask them to do.  Collectively we were the people who watched failure for too long.  The one thing we have in common is the previous Government came to the decision.  I changed it not a whit.  I adopted that decision.  Despite what someone mentioned as a strange use of words in our manifesto &mdash; I think Deputy Sherlock said that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This is the section which dissolves the board and transfers its remaining assets and liabilities to the Minister for Agriculture and Food, not in my personal capacity, but in my corporate capacity.  It provides that I may sell or lease the board's assets or otherwise dispose of or keep such property. The assets actually consist of the 34 lease stallions to which we referred and some <Col N="1846" /> office furniture and equipment.  The cost price of all of the stallions was £87,000 but, dependent on their age and condition, their value is now open to negotiation. As I indicated to the Deputy, we have given first option to the existing lessees.  If the offer is considered to be grossly inadequate then it is intended that the stallions will be offered for sale by public tender.  In that event the lessees, too, would be free to compete in the sale by public tender.  The lease agreements are for a minimum period of five years, the latest of which will expire in 1992.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, before section 4, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>4.&mdash;(1) (a) As soon as may be after the debts and other liabilities of the Board have been discharged, the Minister shall cause to be prepared an account of all moneys received or expended by the Board in respect of each year in the period beginning with the year 1987 and ending with the year in which the aforesaid debts and other liabilities are discharged.</P>
      <P>(b)  The Minister shall cause to be prepared a report of the proceedings of the Board in respect of each year in the period aforesaid.</P>
      <P>(2)  The accounts caused to be prepared under subsection (1) (a) of this section shall be submitted as soon as may be by the Minister to the Comptroller and Auditor General for audit.</P>

      <P> (a)  the accounts audited under subsection (1) (a) of this section, together with the reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General thereon, and</P>
      <P>(b)  the report referred to in subsection (1) (b) of this section.&rdquo;.  </P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister would be good enough to quantify the expression &ldquo;as soon as may be&rdquo; because there have been difficulties encountered for many years with the annual accounts of Bord na gCapall.  Indeed on one occasion there was a two-year lag in the production of their accounts.  Could we have an assurance from the Minister that <Col N="1848" />&ldquo;as soon as may be&rdquo; would be within a very reasonable time?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a well established phrase in law which has been subject to judicial determination.  Therefore, it does not allow the Minister to take <i>carte blanche</i> as to when the accounts would be prepared.  It means within any period a court would hold to be reasonable. The Deputy can be assured that it does not give the Minister <i>carte blanche</i> to, as it were, pick his time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>

      <P>Perhaps I might ask the Minister if the provisions of section 2 (5) would include the transfer of the liability to the Minister to pay the £100 premia &mdash; on which Bord na gCapall have reneged &mdash; to various mare owners throughout the country.

I will not attempt to prejudge anything in the cases to which the Deputy refers; that is a matter I am not prepared to prejudge at this point.  I am merely saying that such legal liabilities as were there remain and are now the responsibility of the Minister.</P>

      <P>When replying to my question raised on Second Stage, the Minister referred to the provision which deals with the licensing of riding establishments but I should like to know if that section is being repealed when we are repealing the entire Horse Industry Act, 1970.  I should like to point out to the Minister that the section deals with issues other than licensing.  For example, it deals with fire protection, the treatment of horses, disease control and the question of safety.  The Minister has not answered that question to my satisfaction.</P>

      <P>I do not know if the Deputy was present when I referred to the point he made on Second Stage about the licensing of riding establishments and told the House that that part of the original Act was never brought into effect under an order.  Therefore, there is no lapsing of what was not brought into effect, namely, the licensing of the riding establishments.  A voluntary scheme has been in place for this purpose under the auspices of the Association of Riding Establishments but that is purely voluntary and no order was introduced giving effect to the licensing regulation. There is no change involved.</P>

      <P>This is indeed a sad occasion and, lest Deputy Sherlock and others may have forgotten, I should like to point out that the original proposal to abolish Bord na gCapall came from the former Minister for Agriculture.  It follows, therefore, that without hesitation I support the Bill before us.  Effectively, it is a tidying-up operation of what has been put in practice.  However, the occasion <Col N="1851" /> cannot be let pass without thanking those who served the board diligently since 1970 until two years ago and whose commitment was towards the enhancement of the industry.  There were members on each of the boards whose sole commitment was towards the enhancement of our half-bred industry and carrying out the functions of the Act we are repealing. I should like to record my thanks and gratitude to the members of the different boards.</P>
      <P>The importance of the half-bred industry, a blue chip industry which employs 26,000 people here, to agri-tourism and sport and leisure activities in general has to be recognised by the House.  I should like to point out that the future of the draught mare, especially the quality half-bred mare with bone and substance, the unambiguous identification and registration of progeny, the production of sound competition animals &mdash; horses and ponies &mdash; and the monitoring of Eurodirectives so that people can fully understand their implications for an industry which is so dear to us, are some of the issues facing the new non-statutory advisory committee.  Minister, beware of a committee all of whom might be political appointees.</P>
      <P>I welcome what the Minister has said in response to the Second Stage debate and I look forward to developments in regard to the appointment of the committee. Will the Minister indicate to the House, or to those of us who have an interest in the industry, from which representative bodies within the horse world he will be inviting nominations for a position on this committee?  It should be self-selected and I understand that the Minister has accepted that proposal.  I thank him for doing that.  I should like to thank the Minister for taking on board many of the suggestions made by the Opposition. I hope that together we can ensure that there will be a healthy future for an extremely important industry.</P>

Unfortunately, and this has been agreed by all, it was not.  By way of confirmation of what I said earlier I should like to state that I see the passing of this Bill as the beginning of a great programme.  We are going to put a lot of deliberate strategies in place under this legislation.  The Deputy is correct in stating that 26,000 people are employed in this industry.  It is important to point out that this is perhaps the most labour-intensive industry in the country with one person employed for every two horses.  I do not think any other industry has a higher degree of labour intensity than that.  When we have 56,000 people employed it will be a measure of what can be done in that industry.  I should like to thank Members who contributed to the debate.  I look forward to progress.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>When I moved the Adjournment of the debate on this Bill I was about to elucidate to the House how the Government arrived at a decision in relation to the relocation of the headquarters of the proposed development corporation.  A very interesting scenario developed when the Minister for Defence was in Australia on official business.  His colleague from Limerick West, the Minister for Justice, Deputy Collins, was in Dublin and the Government made a decision in relation to the location of the corporation.  Why was that decision made at the Government meeting?  That is something I cannot answer.  One can only conclude that the Minister for Justice, Deputy Collins, did a certain amount of arm twisting in the absence of his colleague to get this headquarters located at Foynes.  Not alone did he pull a smart stroke on his colleague in west Limerick, <Col N="1853" /> he then proceeded, behind the back of his colleague, the Minister for the Marine, two days in advance of the announcement of the proposed location of the headquarters, to announce that it was to be located in Foynes.  Since then the Minister for Justice has been touring his constituency telling the people of Foynes about the tremendous job opportunity this decision will bring to the Foynes area and the enormous number of people who will be employed, raising false hopes in west Limerick.</P>
      <P>This is very irresponsible behaviour on the part of a Government Minister.  It is irresponsible to act in such a fashion and to mislead the local population.  This Bill clearly states that the staffs of the existing authorities in Limerick, Foynes and Kilrush will all be absorbed under this legislation. If these people are to be employed, where is the tremendous potential for job opportunities?  The reality is there is none.  The Minister for Justice is bluffing in west Limerick and it is time to call his bluff.</P>
      <P>Indeed, two or three years ago when the then Minister, Deputy Mitchell, introduced a Bill the present Minister strongly objected in this House and through the media that Foynes did not want to become involved in any type of estuarial authority.  How come the Minister has changed his mind so quickly in relation to this matter?  How is it that there is such a sudden conversion?  One would have to seriously question the judgment of the Minister if he is so quick to change his mind when he appeared to hold such strong views just over two and a half years ago.</P>
      <P>The headquarters are supposed to be in Foynes.  This is very unusual.  This is just a sop and now the Minister is trying to justify his support of the inclusion of the Foynes Harbour Commissioners in the overall development corporation by the Shannon Estuary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I spoke in the House the last time, I outlined in detail my attitude to the overall Bill.  At this point I would like to go through the Bill section by section. <Col N="1854" /> The title of the Bill is &ldquo;Harbours (Shannon Estuary Development Corporation) Bill&rdquo;.  We already have a development company in the region in the form of SFADCo, Shannon Free Airport Development Corporation.  That semi-State organisation has responsibility for development of industry and tourism in the region.  Here we are talking about a development corporation with similar responsibilities in many areas.  Section 4 deals basically with the functions of the corporation and gives them functions, such as investment in marine related industrial, tourist, recreational and amenity facilities, such investment to be in activities to be carried out in or adjacent to the waters of the Shannon Estuary. It goes on to talk about promoting and assisting to develop the use of the corporation's functional area by commercial and trading enterprises for such activities as are likely to increase the use of that area for activities of a marine related nature.  The only part I feel directly relates to a Harbours Bill is section 4 (1) (c) which states that the Harbours Bill is:</P>
    <P>to manage, maintain, operate and develop the existing harbours, </P>
    <P>and I would go further and say to develop additional harbours if the business of that waterway requires such further development. I believe that additional function to be an overlap of the responsibilities of semi-State companies that already have control in that area.  There could be confusion and it is unfortunate that this extended function is included in this Bill.</P>
    <P>In section 3 the Minister talks about the establishment of the body corporate. We find out the basic details as to how that body will be formed and there are legal details in relation to that section.</P>
    <P>In relation to section 4 (3) I am very concerned about the overall position of the estuary and the application of the Structural Funds to estuary development and how SEDCo will co-operate with SFADCo in regard to submissions for Structural Fund grants.  There could be serious complications there.  Section 4 (3) states:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1855" /> Nothing in subsection (1) (b) of this section shall empower the Corporation to provide financial assistance, or to subsidise in any other way, projects for facilities which may be undertaken or provided by any other body in the Corporation's functional area, or otherwise to carry out functions assigned by statute to any other body. </P>
    <P>If SFADCo feel that they have a valid application to make for financial assistance from the European Structural Fund, how do they do it?  The Bill says that nothing here shall empower the corporation to provide financial assistance or to subsidise in any other way.  This is very confusing and could lead to a hindrance of development of ports, which is what this Bill should be encouraging, and add to the bureaucratic layer of trying to process this and get it cleared by SFADCo.  This process would not lead to efficient, quick overall development and it is something the Minister must look at very closely in reconsidering that section.</P>
    <P>Section 4 (4) states:</P>
    <P>The Corporation shall not, when carrying out any of its functions referred to in subsection (1) (a) or (1) (b) of this section, incur expenditure (including borrowing) without having&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i) satisfied itself that any proposed investment is capable of achieving a commercially acceptable rate of return on capital employed, taking account of all possible costs and potential risks, </P>
    <P>One would have to question how this will operate because we are talking about appointing a board, and it is not clear that there will be members on that board capable of making the decision that this subsection requires, particularly in relation to port development.  This is a weakness in this subsection.</P>
    <P>Subsection (4) (ii) relates to seeking the prior consent of the Minister in relation to borrowing in excess of £200,000.  That is a very small amount of money when one views the cost involved <Col N="1856" /> in the structural development of ports.  I keep referring to development of ports because it is a serious concern for the Shannon Estuary.  That figure is rather restrictive.</P>
    <P>Section 5 gives a clear definition of what the functional area of the Bill is.  It is just the Shannon Estuary area.  As a representative from County Clare I would like to say that Clare County Council are particularly concerned about this Bill and the responsibilities that this Bill could indirectly place on it because Clare County Council is the one local authority that has a very extensive shoreline on to the estuary from Loop Head almost to Limerick City.  We are talking about 90 miles of shoreline.  Clare County Council are concerned about the extra costs and responsibilities they could incur as a local authority providing the essential infrastructure in that area in terms of roads, water and sewerage, without giving them any definite say on the proposed corporation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>One out of 13, and yet they are responsible for over 50 per cent of the shoreline of the estuary.  Is that what one would call proportional representation?  It is very unbalanced representation, but I will go into the finer details of representation later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already dealt with the location of the principal offices in Foynes, County Limerick.  The reality is, as I said the last day, the board of Foynes Harbour Trustees are not anxious to get involved in this.  The last thing they want is the offices of this proposed authority located in Foynes.  They just do not want to be involved.  It is ridiculous that somebody would, through legislation, locate these headquarters in an area where the people do not want to be involved.  It is very foolish to put any piece of legislation through this House specifically identifying one location as the proposed headquarters over and above another.  It should be a matter for the members of the corporation at their first meeting to <Col N="1857" /> decide where the headquarters should be. I object to naming one location in this Bill over and above another.  This should not be statutory.  It should be more flexible and should be decided by the corporation.</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides for the dissolution of the Limerick Harbour Commissioners and the Foynes Harbour Trustees and the Kilrush Urban District Council as a harbour authority.  Why is not Clarecastle included in this section?  There is an authority in that area &mdash; the Clarecastle Harbour Commissioners.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am suggesting that they should not be discriminated against when they are anxious to be included.  The position is somewhat different to that in Foynes where the people are anxious to remain independent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1858" /> There will be 13 members on the corporation &mdash; a very limited membership. Every member of the corporation should be appointed by the Minister in accordance with this section.  The corporation will consist of the chairman and not more than 12 other members.  There will be one member from each of the local authorities of Kerry, Clare, Limerick Corporation, Limerick County Council and Shannon Free Development, and two persons the Minister believes to be representative of port users &mdash; that is a very loose interpretation.  In a later subsection the Minister goes on to interpret what a port user is.  The inclusion of a genuine port user who really knows all about ports as against somebody who just uses the port, could make a major difference to the dynamism, efficiency and overall effectiveness of the board.  That would want to be far more clearly specified.</P>
    <P>There is a very unusual provision in section 8 (1) (d).  It refers to the persons who immediately before the establishment day held the posts of Secretary of Foynes Harbour Trustees and Harbour Master of Foynes Harbour Trustees.  The secretary and the harbour master of Foynes are given special recognition in this Bill.  Why are these two positions given special recognition?  Why is special recognition not given to the Limerick Harbour Commissioners or the Kilrush Urban District Council?  This is a question that must be answered because this is clearly an unfair section which does not involve the other harbour authorities on the estuary.  It is grossly unfair that one authority should be elevated and recognised on a statutory basis over and above other authorities on the estuary.  I totally disagree with this paragraph.  I understand the people in Foynes do not want it and that the Secretary of Foynes Harbour Trustees is not anxious to be the secretary of a Shannon Development Corporation. That is the ludicrous situation that exists.</P>
    <P>The overall membership of the corporation does not lend itself towards proper estuary development.  The manner in which this Bill proposes, to appoint people is totally unsatisfactory. <Col N="1859" /> What is needed is a broader based representation. The extraordinary thing is that all the harbour authorities on the estuary, and indeed the local authorities, are very dissatisfied with this Bill.  There is a need for the Minister and his Department to reconsider the entire membership of the corporation.  It does not take into account Kilrush Urban District Council and the Minister makes no provision for representation of that urban district council in the Bill.</P>
    <P>As the Minister is aware, Kilrush was a very busy port when smaller boats were in use, but in later years it has not been as busy as one would have wished.  At the same time, there is a facility there that can be substantially improved and extended.  It is very unfortunate that this facility on the lower part of the Shannon is not represented on the proposed corporation. I am asking the Minister this evening to include at least one member from the Kilrush Urban District Council on this new corporation.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Limerick Harbour Commissioners, it is unthinkable that no accommodation is made in this Bill for any of the people on this commission. Limerick Harbour Commissioners have provided a very fine, extensive and developing service on the estuary over the years and it is entirely unacceptable that they are not even representated on this board.</P>
    <P>The Bill is full of discriminatory clauses and sections that do not lend themselves in any way to the proper development of the Shannon estuary.  I think it is extremely unfortunate that this type of detail has been included in the Bill.  In the section outlining the membership of the corporation, the Minister further defined a port user as a person with wide experience of, or capacity in, finance, commerce, shipping, law or management. I would like the Minister, when replying on second Stage, to give us greater detail of what he would take into consideration when appointing somebody with experience of, or capacity in, finance, commence, shipping, law and management.  These are wide ranging <Col N="1860" /> categories, which remind me of the vocational panels in the Seanad.  It is amazing what limited experience can bring one into one, two or three panels. I think the same situation could develop here and this would be extremely unfortunate for the Shannon Estuary Development Corporation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am only making a comparison.  Situations may arise which would not be in the best interests of the corporation.</P>
      <P>In the same section the Minister outlines the procedures for the local authority nominations.  He refers to the quin-quennial elections but what would happen if, for example, the Minister for the Environment decided that local elections shall not be held for six or seven years?  Would the five year rule still apply?  If it was decided to have local authority elections after four years, would this section still apply and how is it proposed to accommodate the situations that may arise under the Local Government Acts?</P>
      <P>Section 10 deals with disqualification from appointment.  I think the section is reasonably all right but I am somewhat concerned with section 10 (3) (b):</P>
      <P>Where a person is disqualified under this section by being adjudged bankrupt or making a composition or arrangement with his creditors, the disqualification shall cease, in the case of a bankruptcy, when the adjudication is annulled. </P>
      <P>I can see the reasons the Minister has included this, but the reality is that an adjudication can be annulled in a case where the bankruptcy was not caused by misfortune and without misconduct on the person's part.  There could be a contradiction of terms.  I would be very wary of the first part of that subsection and I ask the Minister to reconsider it.</P>
      <P>Section 10 (4) states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A member of the Corporation shall <Col N="1861" /> hold office on such terms and conditions as the Minister may determine. </P>
    <P>This is very questionable.  The Minister could decide on the most extraordinary terms and conditions and if somebody was prepared to accept office under those conditions, he could accept office.  The House should get a very clear explanation from the Minister what he and the Department consider the conditions that the Minister may determine.</P>
    <P>Section 11 deals with the resignation and removal of members of the corporation. Section 11 (2) states that a member of the corporation may at any time be removed from office by the Minister if: &ldquo;his removal from office appears to the Minister to be necessary for the effective performance of its functions by the Corporation.&rdquo;  Would the Minister tell the House what he means?  I think the wording is highly questionable, gives undue power to the Minister and does not lend itself to great stability within the corporation.  In fact, I would go further, I think it is much too loose and that the Minister needs to be specific in this section.  Let me suppose that in 25 years' time there is a Minister who suffers from idiosyncrasies and has certain hang-ups about individuals, he might decide for the most ridiculous reason possible that a person is no longer fit to be a member of the board because under section 11 (2) it appears to the Minister that he must be removed for the effective performance of the corporation.  We need to be much more specific in this section.  I notice that the Minister will fix the date of the first meeting and has set out the usual procedures to be followed.  However, it is interesting to note that in section 12 (9) (b) dealing with disclosure of interest that a member:</P>
    <P>shall, at the first meeting of the Corporation at which the proposed contract is discussed, disclose to the Corporation the fact of the interest and the nature thereof, and shall take no part in any deliberation or decision of the Corporation relating to the contract, and the disclosure shall be <Col N="1862" /> recorded in the minutes of the Corporation. </P>
    <P>The fact that a member is not actually taking part in the deliberation or voting on the decision while still present means that the member can influence how other members will act at the meeting.  I think the section needs to include words to the effect that the member having declared his or her interest must withdraw from the meeting because other members may be conditioned by his presence.  This is essential because decisions will be made on major commercial issues or issues involving vested interests.  Therefore, I think it is vital that the member who has a declared interest should withdraw from the meeting.</P>
    <P>Section 14 deals with the transfer of staff from the Limerick Harbour Commissioners, the Foynes Harbour Trustees or the council of the urban district of Kilrush.  I understand from the various interests involved that this section is totally unsatisfactory.  The staff within these authorities are particularly concerned about their future under the proposed legislation.  They are concerned about their existing terms of employment and how they will be incorporated in the new corporation.  They are also concerned about redundancy payments, pension rights, and working conditions.  It is very important to deal with this because the staff in the existing three bodies are appointed under different conditions. There is not a uniform local authority appointments scheme operating in relation to all.  Is a corporation now to be formed with people employed under different terms of reference and conditions? The Minister should clarify this. It is a very grey area which is leading to great uncertainty and insecurity in the staff of those bodies.  There is an onus on the Minister to clarify this at an early stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I know there are always <Col N="1863" /> many requests particularly on Tuesdays for the Adjournment.  I thank the Chair for his indulgence in recognising that this is a very important matter and for allowing me to raise it this evening.</P>
      <P>On Monday, 20 February it came to public attention that the VHI were changing the circumstances of their insurance and they were no longer giving satisfactory cover to people faced with substantial medical bills arising out of road traffic accidents.  I am specifically relating to rule 6.15 and rule 1.8 of the VHI under which victims of road traffic accidents are now being told that under the Health (Amendment) Act, 1986, whereby hospitals were entitled to charge those victims for hospital maintenance and other medical bills, VHI would no longer in all cases pick up those tabs even though those people might have been in the VHI.  This is very upsetting to many people in that they do not know where they stand in relation to cover for the simple reason that the VHI in clarification in a statement issued on 21 February said that the VHI will provide the normal benefits</P>
      <P>through the discretionary powers contained in Rule 1.8.  This rule has been included specifically for this purpose and reads &ldquo;VHI reserves the right to waive the strict compliance with any of the Rules in exceptional circumstances and in the interest of an insured member&rdquo;. </P>
      <P>What they are now saying is that there are now discretionary powers under which they may or may not pay the bills. An accident is not something that occurs by design but victims of accidents now do not know whether or not they are covered.  This is unacceptable and can only result in the VHI losing more members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where someone with full comprehensive insurance cover has an accident the insurance company will pay the bill, but because of this decision it seems that people will be forced to come up with very substantial up front cash outlays and they have no guarantee that they will <Col N="1864" /> be covered.  Where a person with only third party insurance cover has an accident which is his own fault he will not be covered by third party insurance.</P>
    <P>There are two types of cases, one where the motor insurance company will eventually pay and the other where they definitely will not pay.  I want a categoric assurance from the Minister that where there is no motor insurance liablility the VHI will cover the person, as 34 per cent of the population are in the VHI, and that where someone is not in the VHI and is in a public bed, the State will pick up the tab.  I also want a clear cut commitment that people will not be faced with the hardship of substantial cash outlays.</P>
    <P>My case may seem unreal but I will give a couple of cases where this will be a very practical concern.  It has been brought to my attention that members of personnel working in our emergency services, the fire brigade for instance will be in difficulties.  The fire service because of its nature has staff on a part time basis; they are on an on-call basis.  What is their position?  As of Monday, 20 February the VHI were saying one thing in their statement and on Tuesday <i>The Irish Times</i> of 21 February in referring to the assistant chief fire officer of County Cork said:</P>
    <P>Mr. Donal Doonan, assistant chief fire officer for County Cork, said that when he rang the VHI in Dublin yesterday to ask about accident cover for himself and colleagues whose work involved intensive travel by road, he was informed by a senior supervisor that the change in the rules meant &ldquo;absolute exclusion&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;When I asked what would happen where there was no third party involved, I was told `Well, under the circumstances, you'd have to fall back on the State and go public'.&rdquo;  Mr. Doonan claimed. </P>
    <P>This is no way to treat our essential emergency public services personnel whose life and limb are put at risk in the course of their duty.  Are these people to <Col N="1865" /> be left high and dry by the Minister and the VHI?</P>
    <P>This is a problem that can be easily resolved.  There are many cases where the motor insurance industry have lobbied this House for changes to help themselves. I refer to the very substantial pressure that was put on all parties to abolish juries in civil liability cases. Because of that pressure we have a committee in the Department of Industry and Commerce which deals with for instance cases of refusals of car insurance for young people and so on.  Why could this Minister before a decision was taken not call in the Federation of Irish Motor Insurers and thrash out some agreement whereby in the event of a hospital bill some arrangement would be made so that the VHI would pay it or the bill would be left in abeyance until the motor insurance company would pay it so that whatever happens the victim would be covered one way or another?  It is simply a matter of getting heads together and streamlining the procedure.  That procedure should be based on the following principle: If a motor insurance company accepts responsibility for repairing a car it is only reasonable that they should be responsible for repairing the occupant of the car.  There should be clearly established cases where there is responsibility for the motor insurance company and a victim should not be asked to pay the bill.  In cases where people are not covered, for instance a person with a third party liability involved in an accident which is his own fault, the VHI should honour all of those cases and where a person is not a member of the VHI the State should pay the bill.  In case this seems academic, I will refer to a bizarre case which was outlined in a letter I received from a parent:</P>
    <P>In May-June 1987 my son was &ldquo;knocked&rdquo; down and hospitalised at Mullingar and then Temple Street.  I had Plan B VHI cover.  The situation re non-payment by the VHI applied and thereby followed a series of unbelievable events.  Temple Street <Col N="1866" /> Hospital issued bills to me to the value of £2,800 approximately, VHI would not pay and then they (Temple Street) issued a civil bill.  Then they wrote at a later date to state that they would waive the action and await the outcome of civil proceedings but that their bill would now be £6,000 approximately. </P>
    <P>Arising out of this the question must be asked why is it that when it goes to litigation they want £6,000 when there are no costs involved for the hospital concerned? The second question that arises is that this person was a category 2 person and had a hospital services card.  Why is the full economic cost being charged to this patient who has statutory entitlement to a free hospital bed under the 1970 Health Act?</P>
    <P>To add insult to injury she goes on to say that not only did she get letters from the hospitals but that the consultants went after her separately and were not prepared to accept the circumstances of waiting until subsequent litigation would take place.  This was all because her son was unfortunate enough to be a pedestrian on a particular street at a particular time and knocked down.  In my view this is not acceptable.  The outcome of this episode, which is typical, is that she and her family have left the VHI because they are not prepared to accept this type of treatment.</P>
    <P>Recently we had a debate in this House in relation to another aspect of the VHI recovery programme.  I will deal with it very briefly.  It related to the drugs refund scheme.  A very strong argument was put forward by the Minister and the Department that they would not countenance continuation of that scheme because for long term illnesses there would be a predictable need for this medication, that next year and the year after an asthmatic would need this medication, that that was not an actuarial risk, that it was not real insurance because these were predictable needs.  How more unpredictable can one get than to be involved in a car accident? It is quite extraordinary that the VHI and the Minister are having it both ways so <Col N="1867" /> far as both predictable and unpredictable illnesses are not being covered.</P>
    <P>The Minister said &mdash; and it is quite extraordinary &mdash; in the same article in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 27 February 1989 that he did not know how hospitals and health boards would react if no VHI funding was available for accident cases and if patients asked for their bills to be deferred until their cases went through the courts.  The new practice has interesting implications which the Department should be looking into immediately. Here we have the Department sitting back again with no preparation or no anticipation of these decisions at a time when it is clear that the whole basis of the VHI goes back to the Voluntary Health Insurance Act, 1957.  This is very important because this Minister seems to be unaware of the provisions of the establishment of the VHI.  Section 4 (1) and (2) states that:</P>
    <P>The Board shall make and carry out a scheme of voluntary health insurance for defraying, to such extent as the Minister may from time to time specify, the cost to persons paying subscriptions to the Board in respect thereof, and to dependants of such persons, of such medical, surgical, hospital and other health services as the Minister may from time to time specify.</P>
    <P>The Board may make and carry out such other schemes of voluntary health insurance as it may think fit, subject to the consent of the Minister in regard to the scope and extent of the benefits. </P>
    <P>This legislation is not in any way ambiguous. It says that the VHI cannot alter their plans without ministerial approval. Either the Minister is not discharging his duty or he is not fully aware of the fact that he is ultimately responsible.  Therefore, this is very appropriate.  The Health (Amendment) Act, 1986, specifically entitles the authorities of the hospital to charge the cost of providing treatment where there is a likelihood of damages or compensation from a third party.  There <Col N="1868" /> are two roles in which the Minister is involved, first, because his hospitals are producing these bills the problem has arisen and, secondly, he is responsible for the VHI.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister to initiate talks immediately between the VHI and the motor insurers to ensure that the public know that whether they are in the VHI or are public patients, they will be fully protected from the stress and tribulation of these bills.  If the VHI are saying that the sole problem here is that, say, someone has an accident and is injured and the hospital come up with their bill, the VHI pay the bill, a settlement is made on the steps of the court for the victim, the motor insurance company pay the victim but the victim does not pay the VHI that is fair enough but why is it in every other respect in relation to civil damages that we have a standard accepted practice whereby solicitors can issue letters of understanding, whereby a solicitor where he is confident that he will win a case can issue to any third party a letter of understanding stating, &ldquo;we are expecting a claim to be successful&rdquo;?  He would then go along to a bank and say &ldquo;I will personally authorise clearance of, say, £4,000 to pay this&rdquo;.  If the VHI could only make payments in instances where there is a letter of understanding that would get over the problem.  I have spoken to members of the Incorporated Law Society and they said it would not be difficult, given the nature of other types of claims where there are other types of bills and services provided in the event of accident, to devise such a system.  All in all, and I do not wish to detain the House too long, it is unacceptable that the public should be treated in this cavalier way.</P>
    <P>I am not satisfied with the Pontius Pilate way in which the Minister has tried to wash his hands of this problem.  I now call on the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Leyden, to give an assurance that, first, where there is a motor insurance liability people would not be forced to pay cash outlays and, secondly, where there is no motor insurance cover that people will be <Col N="1869" /> assured, if they go public, they will be fully covered and if they are in the VHI their bills will be honoured fully.  If that can be done and a streamlined arrangement for payment can be brought into effect through practical negotiations which ensure that the VHI are not left holding the baby it would be a welcome step.  I call on the Minister without further delay to attend to this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Leyden) Terry Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Leyden)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity, on behalf of my colleague, the Minister, Deputy O'Hanlon and the Department, to clarify the position.  I would like to remind Deputy Yates that at the start of February 1989 this House passed the following resolution:</P>
      <P>Dáil Éireann acknowledges that under the legislation establishing the VHI responsibility for the management of its affairs is vested in the board, subject only to the approval of the Minister for Health, and accepts that the Minister had no alternative but to approve the board's recovery programme which was prepared in accordance with the best actuarial advice available and designed to ensure the continued viability of the VHI. </P>
      <P>I am therefore most surprised that an issue which relates entirely to the detailed management of its own affairs by the VHI Board should now be raised in the House in this manner but nevertheless I am pleased to clarify the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>VHI rules have always excluded from cover, those expenses which were recoverable from a third party, except in so far as the board, at their own discretion, should decide otherwise.  The board have over the years adopted a practice of paying such claims, subject to an undertaking that the member would include medical costs in a third party claim with the motor insurance company and refund the VHI benefit if that claim was successful. The board have now decided to cease this practice as they have found considerable difficulty over the years in recovering the moneys due to them in <Col N="1870" /> such circumstances.  To facilitate this, a rule has been inserted specifically excluding road traffic accident injuries from cover.</P>
    <P>On 21 February the VHI board issued a press statement clarifying the operating practice which they now propose to adopt, which includes the following:</P>
    <P>Where there is no other insurance or possibility of third party recovery, the board will provide the normal benefits through the discretionary powers contained in rule 1.8.  This rule has been included specifically for this purpose and reads: &ldquo;VHI reserves the right to waive the strict compliance with any of the rules in exceptional circumstances and in the interest of an insured member.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In other words, the VHI board have given a commitment that no members will be left without cover for necessary treatment arising out of an accident, in circumstances where there is no third party liability and no other insurance applies.</P>
    <P>I would also point out that accident and emergency treatment is generally carried out in public hospitals and is available to all who require it.  The charges which, under the Health (Amendment) Act, 1986, can be made by public hospitals for treatment arising out of a road traffic accident, become payable by the patient only if and when compensation is received from a third party.</P>
    <P>I would stress again that the VHI Board will continue, as before, to accept responsibility for the medical costs of their members arising out of road traffic accidents where these are not recoverable from any other party.  However, the board do not believe it is appropriate, particularly given the need to secure the board's viability after their recent financial difficulties, that the VHI should meet costs for which other parties are legally liable.</P>
    <P>I want to point out, by the way, that this principle is exactly the same as the principle enshrined in the Health (Amendment) Act, 1986, which was <Col N="1871" /> introduced by the Coalition Government. The basis for that Act is that injuries caused by negligent drivers should be paid for by motor insurers and not by the State.  Consequently, the Act empowers health boards to charge the full cost of treating such injuries where compensation is payable.  In exactly the same way, the VHI Board are making sure that motor insurers and not the VHI meet the costs for which they are properly liable. Since the House accepted this principle in relation to the public health services we must be consistent and accept it also in relation to the VHI.</P>
    <P>Deputy Yates does not appear to realise that nobody can be charged anything under the terms of the Health (Amendment) Act unless compensation is involved and the payment of such charges can only be collected when compensation has been paid.</P>

      <P>In relation to the points made by Deputy Yates about the case sent to him by a constituent regarding Temple Street Hospital, under the legislation hospitals are entitled to the full economic cost.  The statutory entitlements do not apply if the Health (Amendment) Act applies and that is made clear in the Act introduced by the Coalition Government.  The Act provides for charges &ldquo;notwithstanding anything in the Health Acts&rdquo;.  In fairness the second bill referred to in the example given by Deputy Yates related to the actual costs arising from the accident.  I should like to stress that bills do not have to be paid until compensation is paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make it clear that the bills apply as stated.  The hospital have to present a bill so that it can be taken into account in assessing the damages from a particular accident.  I know numerous cases &mdash; and I am sure the Deputy knows of numerous instances under the 1986 Act &mdash; where constituents received bills but because compensation was not involved they were not liable. This happened recently and the position was very easily clarified by the health board.  I hope this clarifies the matter and makes it crystal-clear for the Deputy.  I thank Deputy Yates for raising this matter.</P>

      <P>Development of the food industry will benefit mainly from grants for marketing and processing projects under the FEOGA Guidance Fund.  The industry will also receive aid under the Regional Development and European Social Funds for infrastructural development and worker training measures.  It is not possible to indicate the proportion of the Funds that may eventually accrue to the industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to the possibility of securing restrictions on the import of cereal substitutes into the Community during the current GATT talks.  As negotiations are still taking place on the direction and approach to be adopted in the talks during the next few years, it is premature to speculate on concessions on any specific issues at this point.</P>
      <P>In its negotiating approach, the Community has included a proposal for a readjustment of external protection under which it proposes to deal with distortions caused, <i>inter alia</i>, by imports of cereals substitutes.  This will be pursued in the course of the negotiations.  I would, however, remind the Deputy that present arrangements for the import of substitutes were agreed in earlier multilateral/bilateral negotiations and in all probability, therefore, any restrictions that might be secured during the current round of negotiations would have to be compensated for elsewhere.</P>

The operation of the scheme is being kept under continuous review by the local Garda officers, who are always ready to meet with the neighbourhood watch committee to hear any suggestions they might have for improvements to the scheme.  As the concerns of the committee no doubt relate to local policing issues, which are essentially matters for the Garda authorities, I am confident that a meeting with the local Garda officers will satisfactorily deal with any matters that the committee wishes to discuss.</P>

      <P>The implications of the recent judgment by <Col N="1640" /> the High Court in the case to which the Deputy refers is a matter, initially, for the Incorporated Law Society of Ireland to consider.  The Law Society is vested, under the Solicitors Acts 1954-1960, with all necessary statutory powers to regulate the education and admission of persons as solicitors.</P>
      <P>I understand that, since the Law Society's Law School was set up in 1978, all candidates who attained the required standard in its entrance examinations were admitted to the Law School, without restriction of numbers.</P>
      <P>The educational and training requirements for admission to the profession of solicitor is one of the matters being examined by the Fair Trade Commission in the course of its current study of the legal profession.  I propose to await the outcome of that study before considering whether there is any action with regard to access to legal education which it would be appropriate for me to take.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 53 to 57, inclusive together.</P>
      <P>The meteorological service has been the subject of a comprehensive review in order to identify, <i>inter alia</i>, the scope for reducing costs and increasing revenue. The organisational changes necessary to implement the findings of the review are concerned mainly with the creation of improved structures and a general rationalisation of operations, including some staff upgrading, with a view to achieving a more efficient and cost effective service. These changes cannot appropriately be described as involving either a centralisation or a decentralisation of the service.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that there is scope in some areas for increasing the revenue earned by the meteorological service and this is being actively pursued.  There is no question of providing additional Exchequer funds for the service.</P>

      <P>My Department were informed last October by a company which was then a licensed tour operator and travel agent that it had ceased trading having met all its obligations to its customers under overseas travel contracts. Subsequently my Department learned that there was a difficulty with the return travel arrangements of two of the clients of the company who were on holiday in Majorca.  Alternative return travel arrangements for these two persons were made at my Department's request.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the company's representative in Majorca learned that there was a difficulty with the return travel arrangements for the two clients she attempted to contact her employers but was unable to do so.  She then contacted my Department for assistance and advice and was assured that alternative travel arrangements were being made for the clients. She also expressed concern about some expenses she might have to incur in looking after the clients in the meantime and she was given an assurance that if she incurred any expenses and her employer <Col N="1643" /> was not in a position or willing to reimburse her the Department would do so from the funds which would become available under the statutory bonding arrangements.</P>
    <P>After her return to Ireland the representative submitted details to my Department of the expenses which she had incurred on behalf of the two clients who had been stranded.  Officials of my Department met with her to discuss the matter and explained that it would be necessary in the first instance to give the company an opportunity to reimburse her before the statutory bond could be called. My Department sent details of the claim to the company on her behalf and following some discussions and correspondence were advised only last week that the company was unable to meet her claim.  The statutory bond was called immediately and my Department have since made a full refund to the person concerned of the amount claimed.</P>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity to compliment the person concerned who acted in a most responsible and professional manner as a travel representative in lending assistance to the clients who were unfortunately stranded abroad.</P>

      <P>Apart from any difficulties which the present price war may be creating in the industry, it has been apparent for some time that inefficiences and overcapacity also exist in the bread baking sector.  While certain rationalisation and amalgamations have already taken place, some bakeries continue to operate with old equipment and out of date work practices. The safeguarding of jobs in the industry in the long-term can only be achieved by further rationalisation, the creation of more viable units with new technology and the introduction of more efficient distribution systems.</P>

      <P>A number of inter-departmental committees were established in the period in question to examine various policy issues as part of the annual review of Departmental expenditure.  The main issues addressed by these committees were PRSI for public sector employees; statutory sick pay and the routing of disability benefit through employer pay roll systems; the future administration of the supplementary welfare allowance <Col N="1653" /> scheme; the rationalisation of means testing and the future of credited contributions.</P>
      <P>In addition, as part of the ongoing administration of the different schemes operated by my Department, committees are frequently established on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis to examine particular problems of day to day operations.  An example of such a committee comprises officials of the Department and of the Revenue Commissioners who are examining and solving problems relating to the PRSI scheme for the self-employed.</P>
      <P>A third category of committee is where I establish formally a group to report back to me on particular issues.  In this context on 30 November, 1987 I established a joint working group made up of officials of my Department and the Irish Dental Association.  The function of the group, which reported to me on 26 July 1988, was to examine all aspects of the social insurance dental benefit scheme.</P>
      <P>I recently established a supervisory committee for the loan guarantee fund set-up as part of the Government's action plan on moneylending.  The committee held their first meeting on 20 February 1989.</P>
      <P>This committee are to draw up a scheme as part of the Government's action plan to tackle the problems of moneylending to enable people on low incomes, who are in difficulty with moneylenders, to gain access to conventional credit at normal rates.  The loan guarantee fund will be used to guarantee loans made to those assisted by the scheme.  The scheme will also provide for education in money management and debt counselling</P>
      <P>In general, because of the nature of most of the committees established, they cease when the task given to them is complete.  I have not abolished any commissions, committees, inter-Departmental committees, working parties, or State sponsored bodies under the aegis of my Department during the period in question.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no provisions for increases in social welfare payments in respect of common-law wives.  Under the unemployment assistance scheme, however, an adult dependant increase is payable in respect of a person over the age of 16 looking after a child of the applicant and maintained by him.  There is no such provision under the blind pension scheme.  Therefore when the person concerned transferred from unemployment assistance to blind pension he <Col N="1655" /> automatically lost the increase in respect of his common-law wife.  However, he was advised that she could claim unemployment assistance in her own right. She subsequently did so and is currently in receipt of unemployment assistance at the rate of £37.80.  The total payment to the household at present is therefore £96.80.  Under the measures provided for in the Social Welfare Bill, 1989, this will increase to £102.80 from July 1989.</P>
      <P>The question of extending the arrangements for payment of adult dependant allowances with blind pensions to cover this sort of situation would have significant implications for the scheme because of the way means are assessed under the scheme at present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>On 23 January 1989 I met a delegation from the Union of Professional and Technical Civil Servants to discuss the problem of the black economy in the forestry industry where, it was alleged, many persons are working and claiming unemployment payments and/or evading tax.</P>
      <P>My Department have been aware for some time that employment in the forestry industry is an area prone to abuse of the social welfare system.  That is why the forestry industry in County Wicklow was selected for investigation in 1987 by the Joint Department of Social Welfare/Revenue Inspection Unit set up in September 1986.</P>
      <P>It is also the reason for including forestry among the four industries scheduled in the Social Welfare (Notification by Employers of Commencement of Employment) Regulations, 1988 &mdash; S.I. No. 296 of 1988 &mdash; which came into effect on 1 January 1989 and which requires employers in the scheduled industries to notify the Minister of the commencement of employment of each employee taken on after that date.  Details returned in relation to employees include name, address, and RSI number.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Union of Professional and Technical Civil Servants put forward three <Col N="1657" /> recommendations on how, in their opinion, the problem of the black economy in the forestry industry should be tackled.</P>
    <P>The first recommendation involved the introduction of a withholding tax system for all contractors and sub-contractors in the absence of a tax clearance certificate. The Revenue Commissioners are currently considering the merits of this recommendation.</P>
    <P>The second recommendation proposed that a certified statement including names, home addresses, RSI numbers and amounts paid be obtained by forestry for contractors, sub-contractors and employees in all cases.</P>
    <P>As I have already mentioned, forestry is one of the four industries scheduled in the Social Welfare (Notification by Employers of Commencement of Employment) Regulations, 1988.  Notifications required under this legislation should be an important factor in curbing the operation of the black economy in this sector.</P>
    <P>These existing regulations, however, apply only to persons employed under a contract of service.  Many persons in the felling and harvesting of timber are employed as sub-contractors, that is, under a contract for service, and as such they are not covered by the regulations, except in relations to employees taken on by them under a contract of service.</P>
    <P>The Social Welfare Bill 1989 circulated to Deputies on 27 February 1989 will bring sub-contractors within the scope of section 15A of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981, and this provision will enable me to extend the existing regulations to require notification to be made in respect of those employed under a contract for service.</P>
    <P>The third recommendation by the union was that my Department and the Revenue Commissioners be notified by the Forestry Section of the Department of Energy of all available information as a matter of form.</P>
    <P>In this regard I have to say that my Department gets full co-operation from the Department of Energy in the matter of any relevant information.  Since the <Col N="1658" /> setting up of Coillte Teoranta I have been assured by that semi-State body that the level of co-operation which existed between the Forestry Service and my Department will be maintained.</P>

      <P>Under the dental benefit scheme the fees of certain items of treatment are paid entirely by the Department whilst for certain other items the fees are met partially by the Department and partly by the patient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the changes recently announced fees for all items have been increased by 2.5 per cent with effect from October 1988.  In addition, other improvements are being brought into effect from 1 March 1989.  These include provision for dental examinations every 12 months <Col N="1659" /> instead of 18 months at present and provision for additional items of treatment in line with ongoing developments in dentistry. Provision was also made for increases in fees for certain items of treatment where existing fees had got out of line with increases in dentist's costs.</P>
    <P>To meet a portion of the cost of the improvements charges are being applied to patients for certain additional items of treatment.  These are the less common and more sophisticated items of treatment in respect of which claimants have a greater element of choice.  They do not apply to basic items of treatment.</P>
    <P>The additional items for which claimants will be required to meet part of the fee are acid-etch and pin-retained fillings where charges of £2.50 and £5.50 respectively will apply and endodontic treatment and apicectomy where charges of £7.50 and £9.50 respectively will apply.  The income from these charges will be used to meet part of the cost of the improvements in the scheme and the increased fees to dentists involved.</P>

      <P>In order to qualify for a free fuel allowance, a person must, among other things, live alone or only with certain categories of persons.  Furthermore, the allowance is not payable to persons who are in accommodation with subsidised heating.</P>
      <P>The person concerned is not entitled to a free fuel allowance as her daughter, who resides with her, is in receipt of unemployment assistance and does not come within the categories of persons whose residence is disregarded for the purposes of the &ldquo;living alone&rdquo; condition of the scheme.  As announced in the budget speech the presence of a recipient of unemployment assistance would not in itself disqualify a person, otherwise entitled, from receiving the free fuel in the next heating season.  However, it also appears that the person in question is living in local authority accommodation where subsidised heating is provided by the State and consequently, she will not qualify for this allowance.</P>

      <P>Tax evasion within the forestry industry has been the subject of on-going investigation over the past number of years. While it has not been possible to quantify precisely the extent of tax evasion and social welfare abuse within the forestry industry, this industry along with a number of other sectors, has been the subject of investigation by a Joint Revenue and Social Welfare Investigation Unit which was established in September 1986.  The unit is staffed by Revenue and Social Welfare officers and has carried <Col N="1667" /> out investigations of the forestry industry and other sectors, for example, the security industry, where there is evidence of social welfare and tax abuse.  In its first year of operation 148 cases in the forestry industry were investigated.  The unit will continue to investigate cases in this sector.</P>
      <P>The tax clearance scheme introduced for State Bodies awarding public contracts extends to the forestry industry. All such contracts in excess of £10,000, which are awarded by the Forestry Service of the Department of Energy and more recently by Coillte Teoranta, The Irish Forestry Board, are only available to those in receipt of a current tax clearance certificate.  To obtain a tax clearance certificate, a contractor must satisfy the Collector-General that all tax liabilities, personal tax, PAYE and VAT are paid up to date.</P>
      <P>More recently the Revenue Commissioners have established a practice of liaison with Coillte Teoranta in an effort to further combat tax abuses among contractors and subcontractors in the forestry industry.</P>

      <P>The direct cost of issuing these new notes was approximately £650,000 per annum.</P>

Provision for access for the disabled to buildings is set out in Part S of the Proposed Building Regulations and consideration is being given to importing the appropriate parts of the National Rehabilitation Board's booklet <i>Access for the Disabled &mdash; Minimum Design Criteria</i> as a method of complying with the Regulations.  The Building Control Bill currently being debated at Committee Stage in the Dáil will give statutory effect to the proposed regulations.

      <Col N="1688" /> In broad terms, my areas of responsibility in relation to the handicapped are twofold.  The Government decided in 1977 that a quota of 3 per cent of disabled persons should be employed in the public sector.  The quota applies to disabled persons regardless of their handicap.  The embargo on general recruitment to the public service has slowed progress in achieving the quota target.</P>

    <P>Of the total number 122 cases of salmonellosis reported for the Southern Health Board in 1988, 120 of these cases were in respect of the Cork area.  All of the 120 cases reported for the Cork area were of samonella enteritidis.</P>
    <P>Bacteriological examination of poultry and epidemiological data point to the consumption of infected poultry as the cause of the outbreak of salmonella food poisoning in the Cork area.  I reiterate that the public need have no concern about the consumption of poultry, provided products are cooked thoroughly.</P>

      <P>A limited cook/chill food preparation system was introduced in Wexford Hospital 13 years ago at an approximate capital cost of £40,000.  The Wexford system serves a number of hospitals at present.  The capital cost of providing a cook/chill system to cater for the new Wexford and Ardkeen hospitals would cost £300,000 each.  The health board have proposed the installation of a cook/chill system in South Tipperary at a cost of approximately £0.75 million.  The board expect that the revenue savings resulting from the introduction of a cook/chill system would offset this capital expenditure in a relatively short period of time.  My Department is currently considering the board's proposals to install cook/chill systems in South Tipperary.</P>

Those children who were considered most needy were selected for enrolment.  The applicant was one of a number of children referred to the special class whom it was not found possible to enrol at the time.  However, it is understood that the school has been in contact with the child's parents concerning the provision of updated assessments.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 174, 178 and 179 together.</P>
      <P>The task of the visiting teachers for the visually impaired is to advise parents and teachers on the educational problems associated with visual impairment. Mobility training is a specialised field and is not combined with the qualification of teaching.  Formal mobility training involves long cane work, guide dog work, etc.  The special schools for the visually impaired, which are both day and residential, have the services of trained mobility officers.  However, since mobility training is primarily concerned with activities or daily living in the community generally it is most appropriate that such training should be provided as an out of school experience and in real situations in the child's own environment, by people who work at local level.  It is my view that the officers of the National Council for the Blind, who work locally and provide mobility training for visually impaired adults, are best placed to provide similar training for children in their own locations.  Such services come within the remit of the Department of Health.</P>

      <P>The position is that the number of pupils with serious hearing impairment is several times greater than the number with serious visual impairment. Furthermore the prime function of the visiting teachers for the hearing impaired is to teach language.  The number of totally blind children of school going age and whose intellectual ability is greater than moderate mental handicap does not exceed 50.  Virtually all of these children are educated in special schools for the visually impaired.  In the circumstances, I am satisfied that the difference between the number of visiting teachers catering for the hearing impaired as compared to those with visual impairment is merited.</P>
