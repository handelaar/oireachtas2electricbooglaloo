      <P>It is proposed to take No. 12.  It is also proposed that the Dáil shall sit later than 5.30 p.m. today and business shall be interrupted at 7 p.m.  It is further proposed that under Standing Order 41, statements shall be made now regarding the Taoiseach's meetings with President Bush and Chairman Gorbachev and the debate on No. 12 shall resume not later than 12 noon.</P>

      <P>I have another proposal on which I need agreement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>If I may anticipate that proposal about the statements, I want to indicate my extreme dissatisfaction in regard to the way they are being made. Yesterday you asked Deputy Barrett to leave the House because he asked a question in regard to this matter.  This was on the basis of the decision taken this morning.  I wish to complain about the lack of information from the Government to the House and through the media.  This applies to the Minister for Agriculture and Food, the Minister for the Marine and the Minister for Defence although, when they do appear, they make absolute asses of themselves.</P>
      <P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The House has made a conscious decision to order this business and it was on the basis of this decision that you asked Deputy Barrett to leave the House yesterday when he was legitimately supporting my request to have questions dealing with this matter taken yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to bring about a rehash of yesterday's business but I must inform the House that the Taoiseach's statement will be made under Standing Order 41 which prescribes that notice be given to me. That notice was given to me yesterday and it was on that basis that the question by Deputy Dukes was ruled out of order as anticipatory of this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>As I told you yesterday, Sir, we will debate that issue in another place.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot understand what Deputy Dukes is talking about regarding the Government coming <Col N="1351" /> before the House and giving it information. I would have thought that we had been very forthcoming with the House on both those issues.  First we arranged a three day debate on the national plan so that every Deputy in the House would have the fullest possible opportunity to discuss the provisions of the plan.  Secondly, there is no particular obligation on me to make statements about either of these two visits but, in order to be helpful to the House, I decided that I should do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, there is no particular parliamentary requirement on me to report on these matters but, in order to be as helpful as possible to the House, I have adverted to the normal procedure of statements.  I do not understand how that can be reconciled with Deputy Dukes's statement that we are not coming before the House and giving it all possible information on these issues.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business and relating directly to what the Taoiseach has just said and the practices followed in relation to questions here, a question was put down for answer yesterday to the Taoiseach about a matter connected with item No. 12&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Please, Deputy Dukes, we will not debate this matter now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am making this point because the Taoiseach is claiming some credit for openness in coming before the House.  The question to which I referred was transferred to the Minister for Finance and would not normally be answered by him until sometime after this debate had taken place.  The Deputy in question, Deputy Shatter, asked for a written answer to the question and that revealed information that was very pertinent&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>If that question had been answered, we would have had that information from the Taoiseach during the course of his one and a quarter hour contribution yesterday when he did not say one single word about this waste of taxpayers' money in a totally frivolous way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I would also like to refer to the fact that yesterday in the course of his contribution the Taoiseach failed to tell the House that the seven sub-regional working groups and advisory groups had not submitted any final reports to the Government prior to the submission of the national plan&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>On a final point of order, Sir, prior to Easter on a number of occasions, both Deputy Dukes and I asked the Taoiseach about the Dublin consultants' report.  On the Order of Business, he indicated that that report would be completed shortly and he clearly indicated or implied that the final <Col N="1354" /> Dublin consultants' report would be part and parcel of the national plan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I now want the Taoiseach to explain to the House why the national plan went to Brussels, why the Dublin consultants' report has not yet been completed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Shatter is totally out of order but I cannot permit these ridiculous suggestions to go unanswered. I think Deputy Shatter is apparently suggesting that the Government should not have lodged the National Development Plan in Brussels on time because the consultants' employed, not by the Government but by the local authorities in Dublin, had not submitted their report on time.</P>

      <P>There are two items I want to ask the Taoiseach about. The first relates to the Government's decision to abolish An Fóir Teóranta. The Taoiseach indicated before the Dáil went into recess that we would have a debate on that decision.  I ask him to indicate when or how soon that debate will take place.  Secondly, I have sought on a number of occasions to have the Committee Stage of the Child Care Bill taken as quickly as possible because of the major importance of that Bill.  Can the Taoiseach indicate when we can expect to have it before the House?</P>

    <Title>Taoiseach's Meetings with President Bush and Chairman Gorbachev: Statements.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to inform the Dáil on the details of my visit to Washington over the St. Patrick's Day period and my meeting with President Bush, members of his administration and members of Congress.  I would also like to report on my meeting at Shannon on 2 April with Mr. Gorbachev, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet.</P>
      <P>I went to Washington in the first instance in response to an invitation issued to me by the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Mr. Wright, to be the guest of honour at a lunch hosted by him on Capitol Hill, for colleagues of the House and the Senate, on St. Patrick's Day.  During my visit I was received by President Bush.  I had discussions with Speaker Wright at the House of Reprepresentatives and with Secretary of State Baker and Secretary of the Treasury Brady.  I also met with a group of the Friends of Ireland in the House of Representatives.</P>
      <P>In addition, I met with Senator Kennedy and with other important members of the House and the Senate at a dinner, which the Senator was kind enough to give at his home in my honour.</P>
      <P>I hosted a working lunch, which was attended by Washington media representatives and editorial writers, at which I took the opportunity to brief members of the Washington press corps.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Together with the lunch offered by the Speaker in my honour, the high point of <Col N="1361" /> my visit was the opportunity it offered me for a meeting with President Bush at this early stage in his Presidency.  I was received very warmly by him; I found him particularly friendly and well-disposed towards Ireland, and I was very glad to have such a useful opportunity to hear his views and to brief him on our concerns.</P>
    <P>During my talks with the President we covered a wide range of issues, including the general international situation; the situation in Southern Africa and Namibia; the United Nations and UN peace-keeping, and the situation in Lebanon. The President spoke very favourably of Ireland's role in international peace-keeping, and he expressed to me his personal regret at the loss of life among our soldiers in Lebanon.</P>
    <P>We also had a very useful discussion on the international economic situation. The President spoke of the dangers of protectionism and the importance of maintaining good lines of communication between the major world economic powers in order to avoid a counter-productive and damaging growth of protectionist pressures.  For my part, I took the opportunity to assure the President that, as a small, open economy with a very great dependence on foreign trade, we would be concerned at any growth in protectionism and in my view there was no support in the Community for any concept of a &ldquo;fortress Europe&rdquo;.  I assured him that within the Community our voice would be used to encourage open trading policies.</P>
    <P>I was very glad to be able to brief the President on recent improvements in our own economy.  We talked, too, about the persisting unemployment problems, notwithstanding our success in turning the economy around in other respects; and I explained to the President about the consequential emigration and the problems which arise for young, undocumented Irish people working in the United States.</P>
    <P>I also took the opportunity to brief the President on the Northern Ireland situation and our approach to it.  I indicated that progress had been achieved <Col N="1362" /> through the Anglo-Irish Agreement, although we believe that a good deal more needs to be done; and I told him of my standing invitation to the leadership of the Unionist community to engage in political dialogue.  I expressed to him my appreciation of US support for the Anglo-Irish process and for the International Fund.</P>
    <P>These issues were covered also in my meeting with Secretary of State Baker, and I had very wide-ranging and useful discussions with him.  I spoke to him about our interest in obtaining landing rights for Aer Lingus at Los Angeles, and I understand the administration is currently engaged in an overall review of air transportation issues within which this matter will be considered.</P>
    <P>In my meetings with the Secretary of State and with Secretary of the Treasury Brady, I took the opportunity to raise some difficulties for US investment in Ireland arising from changes in tax legislation in the United States.  I also raised the so-called &ldquo;super-royalties&rdquo; issues, and emphasised that it is in the mutual interest of both countries to resolve problems for US firms operating in Ireland.  I found Secretary of State Baker, Secretary Brady and their officials were open and sympathetic to our concerns, and I believe they now have a good understanding of the problems posed for us and our concern to see changes in the PFIC rules and in the super-royalties question. In particular, it was agreed that arrangements would be made for us to put forward our views in detail to the Treasury Department on the super-royalties issue which is still only at the proposals stage.</P>
    <P>I was very glad to avail of a St. Patrick's Day visit to meet many of our friends in both Houses on Capitol Hill.  I found them, as always, interested in Ireland and eager to assist us in our concerns.  The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Mr. Wright, received me for discussion, and then kindly hosted a special lunch in my honour, to which he had invited a large and representative group of members of the Congress and Senators.</P>
    <P>Earlier, I had had discussions with the <Col N="1363" /> Friends of Ireland.  I briefed them on the progress we have made in dealing with our economy and the situation in Northern Ireland.  I was able to thank the members of the Friends of Ireland for their excellent St. Patrick's Day statement and for their continuing interest in the situation in Northern Ireland.  I expressed my appreciation for their part in securing the immigration legislation passed by Congress just before the end of the last session.  I am confident that they will continue their good work in the current session.  We discussed US tourism to Ireland; they undertook to keep in touch with the administration on the question of landing rights at Los Angeles, and they are pursuing their efforts to have the PFIC rules changed to take account of our concerns.</P>
    <P>In general, I must say that I am satisfied with the results of my visit.  I found in all my meetings, with President Bush and his administration as well as on Capitol Hill, a great warmth and a willingness to hear what I had to say and to see how our concerns might be taken into account.  I assured the President that he would be welcome to visit Ireland at any time, and I hope Secretary of the Treasury Brady will visit us duing the course of the year.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to mention that I availed of my meeting with Speaker Wright to renew an invitation which I had already extended last year to him to lead a delegation from the Congress on a working visit to Ireland later in the year.</P>
    <P>My meeting with Mr. Gorbachev took place at Shannon Airport at his invitation on 2 April.  I was accompanied at the meeting by the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Brian Lenihan, Deputy Albert Reynolds, Minister for Finance, and Deputy John Wilson, Minister for Tourism and Transport.  Mr. Gorbachev had with him Mr. Shevardnadze, member of Politburo, and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Kamentsev, Deputy Prime Minister, and Mr. Yakovlev, member of Politburo.</P>
    <P>The meeting was concerned with developments in the USSR and in international relations, matters of bilateral <Col N="1364" /> interest and Irish affairs.  I took the opportunity to congratulate Mr. Gorbachev on his progress with perestroika or economic and political restructuring, which both influences and is influenced by international developments.  Recent elections have demonstrated the support for perestroika by the people who, in fact, want the process speeded up.</P>
    <P>In a detailed discussion of disarmament, which arise from the new approach of the Soviet Union in international affairs following on perestroika, the Soviet Leader was critical of the pace of arms reductions.  I said that Ireland as a country without a nuclear or other arms connected industry could speak as a disinterested party.  We have a very strong wish for disarmament, globally.  World expenditure on armaments wastes resources, hinders economic development, hurts Third World countries and lowers the standards of living of people everywhere.  I said that, in co-ordination with our partners in the European Community, we would urge our position in the United Nations, in European Political Co-operation and other fora open to us.</P>
    <P>At our meeting in Shannon, there was considerable discussion on the situation in the Middle East which the Chairman referred to as explosive.  There is now an opportunity of untying the knot on the basis of international co-operation.  I said that we favoured an international conference with participation of all interested parties and a role for the PLO as a spokesman for the Palestinian people, with guarantees for the security of all the countries concerned.</P>
    <P>I said that Ireland, through the UNIFIL operation, was helping to maintain stability in the area and would welcome any help that could be given to ensure that the force could carry out their mission without danger or interference from anybody.  The Chairman said that they would look at the position sympathetically and keep our interests in mind.</P>
    <P>On Northern Ireland, I said that the problem there had an impact on our internal situation and complicated our <Col N="1365" /> relations with the United Kingdom.  Until it is solved, our relations with the United Kingdom can never be normal, as they should be, between two neighbouring friendly democratic States.  I said that political progress must be in the framework of Ireland as a whole.  I also thanked the Chairman for his interest in the Guildford Four and Birmingham Six, on which we hoped a solution could be found.  The Chairman took note of our position.</P>
    <P>On bilateral relations, I raised the Aer Rianta-Sheremetyevo co-operation at Moscow and Leningrad airports which was very successful.  I said that we would be glad to help in the process of perestroika, in air transport, marine matters, fisheries, ships repairing and service industries generally.  We saw the Soviet Union as having a need for consumer goods, especially food, which we can supply.  For us, the oil situation is of some concern.  Mr. Gorbachev agreed that the possibility of exchanging oil for commodities would deserve attention and practical examination.  We agree that all the possibilities should be explored further in detail by a group of Ministers who will be visiting Moscow later this year.</P>
    <P>On the European Community, I said that Ireland would not support the idea of a &ldquo;fortress&rdquo; Europe.  Ireland was in favour of developing international trade to the greatest possible extent.  As a member of the Community, we were interested in trade with all countries.  Mr. Gorbachev developed his ideas about the need for a closer relationship between the European Community and the countries of Eastern Europe, linking trade and international accord with the progress of perestroika and political development in the Soviet Union generally.</P>
    <P>I conveyed the good wishes of the Irish Government and people to Mr. Gorbachev for his work on economic and political restructuring at home, for global disarmament and for the reduction of world tensions.  Our meeting lasted more than an hour and was open, friendly and substantive.  I feel I was reflecting the view of the Irish people as a whole, when <Col N="1366" /> I said to the Soviet President that his visit was a great honour for our country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously we must all be pleased that the Taoiseach of our Government is pursuing international relations in quite this way and that these kinds of contacts are taking place between our Government and two of the most powerful Governments in the world.  There are some things about which I should like to ask the Taoiseach, although I know he will not have an opportunity of replying in the course of statements.</P>
      <P>The first concerns the position of undocumented Irish immigrants in the United States.  When the Taoiseach returned from the United States on, I think, 18 March last he was reported to have said that fairly considerable progress had been made on the question of Irish illegal immigrants and he is reported to have gone on to say that the issue is not so much an administration issue, it is really a legislation issue.  I should like to know whether the Taoiseach raised any of that with President Bush or with any of the other people he met in the United States.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is in my statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Further than that.  It is rather disingenuous of the Taoiseach to make the point that it is really not so much an administration issue but a legislation issue.  We all know that it needs legislation.  We all know that any further progress of the kind we would like to see will require legislation, but it is obvious that the chances of securing the kind of change in legislation that we would like to see would be vastly improved if the administration were working with Congress, rather than as we have seen on a number of issues in the United States, the two working against one another in different directions.  I wonder if the Taoiseach has been or is in a position to form a view as to whether it is likely that President Bush and senior members of his administration would be disposed to be sympathetic or supportive of the kind of <Col N="1367" /> initiatives which have been taken on so many occasions by a number of our friends in the two Houses in Washington, some of whom the Taoiseach met during the course of his visit.</P>
      <P>I note that the Taoiseach and President Bush had useful discussions on the international economic situation and on world trade.  An area of considerable concern to us and one which might well have figured in the Taoiseach's discussions is the issue of farm trade.  On Friday last in the context of the GATT round the partners there agreed to a freeze on levels of farm support and levels of export support for farm products.</P>
      <P>I had the opportunity last Friday of having a discussion on this matter with Commissioner MacSharry.  As I said yesterday, for other partners involved that is the beginning of a much longer process which in their view should lead to the complete dismantling of systems of subsidy and support for farm produce.  In that we will be a very interested party, all the more so because while that is going on and while some of the partners in the GATT are preaching the doctrine of free and untrammelled trade, they are in fact taking measures at home to expand their own levels of production.  That is particularly the case in the United States where the &ldquo;set aside&rdquo; programme is itself largely being set aside.  The prospects are for a substantial increase in cereal production in the United States.</P>
      <P>We also see moves to begin a new wave of expansion in dairy production.  That must be a matter of great concern to us because we have seen the European Community play a very constructive role in bringing order and stability back into world dairy markets and it would be very damaging and very galling for us in the European Community, who have been through so many difficulties in that area, if we were now to find that the apostles of untrammelled trade and lower export supports and so on were again to create a situation where they destabilised the world markets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last there be any misunderstanding, I would have to make it very clear that <Col N="1368" /> there is not any obvious advantage for the countries which unfortunately have to be recipients of food aid in a return to the kind of instability in world dairy markets which we saw during the seventies. If anything, there is an advantage for them in having a well ordered stable world scene where the rest of us can get on with proper development aid and emergency aid in the knowledge that it will not ruin markets either for us or for those of the developing countries which are now beginning themselves, to appear on the market.</P>
    <P>During the course of his visit I wonder if the Taoiseach had any opportunity to look at some aspects of the Northern Ireland situation other than the ones he mentioned here.  I find it extremely disturbing to see the facility with which a number of States in the United States have adopted the so-called MacBride principles.  I find it all the more disturbing when I look at the people in the United States who are advocating the MacBride principles because I would have to say that very many of them are not in any way real friends of Ireland or of the Irish people.</P>
    <P>My approach in that regard in meeting United States Senators and Congressmen and State legislators, as we all do here and elsewhere from time to time, has been to say to them that by far the most constructive approach that well disposed, friendly United States legislators can take is to make it quite clear to the United States administration that there are two Governments, the ones directly involved, who have between them a binding agreement, the Anglo-Irish Agreement of 1985, and that if they believe either or both Governments are not doing enough to bring about fairness in employment in Northern Ireland, then pressure should be put on the two Governments to use the structures in the Anglo-Irish Agreement to achieve that aim and not to have this rather quirky and eccentric approach that we now see being adopted in a number of American States.</P>
    <P>I wonder, a Cheann Comhairle, if again during the course of this contact, or perhaps in the course of other contacts, <Col N="1369" /> the Taoiseach had the opportunity of raising questions with the United States Administration about the United States funding of the UNIFIL operation.  The Taoiseach will know that there have been difficulties in the past.  He will know also that both his own Government and the last Government had some difficulties in relation to the funding of our UNIFIL contingent because there was a delay on the part of the United States in making its full contribution.  I note that the Taoiseach and President Bush discussed the value of the UNIFIL operation, and I would agree with the Taoiseach that we have every reason to be proud of the contribution that we and our troops have made in that respect.  It is necessary that the Taoiseach should use every opportunity to encourage the United States administration to support that operation fully and completely so as to avoid any recurrence of the kinds of difficulties we had in past years because the United States were slow in making their full contribution to the United Nations funding.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Taoiseach's meeting with Chairman Gorbachev, the Chair will forgive me if I say that what the Taoiseach has said today confirms me in the belief that my questions of yesterday should not have been disallowed.  In the event, my questions did not anticipate anything that the Taoiseach said.  They had to do with two issues which the Taoiseach has not mentioned at all.  I asked the Taoiseach yesterday &mdash; and I will ask again, Sir, and hope that when my questions come before you they will not be disallowed on the grounds of repetition because the Taoiseach has not given us any information about these &mdash; if the Taoiseach had any opportunity to raise with Chairman Gorbachev a number of issues that are of concern to us and that I believe are within his power to affect in some way.  There is first the position of Soviet Jews who wish to leave the Soviet Union.  I would put this and other issues very clearly in the context of the Helsinki Declarations and of the objectives that have been expressed <Col N="1370" /> there.  We all know that there is a substantial number of people being prevented from leaving the Soviet Union who cannot in any way be described as enemies of the Soviet Union or of wishing to damage the Soviet Union but they find extreme difficulty even to the point where they are now nicknamed refusniks.  We should all encourage Chairman Gorbachev to take a much more open view of requests by people of that kind.  It is surely one of the hallmarks of a confident and free country &mdash; and we know it to our cost &mdash; that its citizens are enabled to leave it at any time they wish.</P>
    <P>There is another area in which Chairman Gorbachev could be asked to take steps where it might be of use to us.  We have seen far too often, and I regret to say that I am sure we will see it again, finds of armaments and explosives that have been manufactured either in the Soviet Union or in some of the Warsaw Pact countries.  One of the favourite weapons of the terrorist today is the Kalashnikov AK7 assault rifle.  That, so far as I know, is manufactured in a number of places within the Soviet sphere of influence. Semtex explosives are manufactured in Czechoslovakia.  This is an area where Chairman Gorbachev could see what kind of action could be taken if he is really interested in taking action on a wide front to reduce tensions and promote peace in the world.  Let us not be in any doubt about it; the Soviet Union, its satellite countries, the countries of the Warsaw Pact, are all centrally planned economies still, and it is very clear that the wishes of the Soviet Chairman would carry a great deal of weight in relation to the conduct of their affairs.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has mentioned the fact that in his meeting with Chairman Gorbachev he thanked the Chairman for his interest in the Guildford Four and the Birmingham Six cases.  I believe that in previous reports it was reported that Chairman Gorbachev said he believed that the Northern Ireland problem was a matter for the British Government. There is some confusion about that.  One of the questions I had put down to the Taoiseach was to ask him if indeed the <Col N="1371" /> question of the Guildford Four and the Birmingham Six had been raised and if the Taoiseach himself had asked Chairman Gorbachev to take that up with the UK Prime Minister when he met her. The reason I asked the question is that we should be very careful and selective about the people for whose assistance we ask in areas like that.  There is little point in asking somebody to intervene on our behalf if he is not in particularly friendly standing with the person in question.  The UK Prime Minister has a certain reputation for handbagging &mdash; I do not know whether that is true.  I could imagine that her reaction to Chairman Gorbachev speaking to her about civil rights and freedoms in the UK would be&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I just wonder if it is really useful to raise those kinds of questions when the relationship between Chairman Gorbachev and Mrs. Thatcher is not perhaps one calculated to produce the best results.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I note that the Taoiseach and Chairman Gorbachev spoke about the possibility of barter deals.  I understand that a group of Ministers is to visit Moscow to examine all of that.  There I would just make the point, for the record, that barter deals of that kind require a fair amount of attention.  There are obvious problems in relation to fixing price equivalents. If the product one is getting in return is oil, we have seen a number of fluctuations on oil markets sometimes working to one's advantage and sometimes not.  I believe that experience in Ireland among commercial operators who have been involved in deals of that kind have indicated that it is always wise to have a position taken so that the oil can be unloaded in the Rotterdam spot market before any barter deal is done. That is an area to which the Government would need to pay some considerable attention because we would have to get <Col N="1372" /> manufacturers of food products here to accept this secondhand relationship with the payment that they would be finally getting for their product.</P>
    <P>I note that the Taoiseach has informed Chairman Gorbachev of our strong interest in disarmament.  I was tempted to pick the Taoiseach up on a word he used when he said that Ireland as a country without a nuclear or other arms connected industry could speak as a disinterested party.  I am sure the Taoiseach was using the word &ldquo;disinterested&rdquo; in a purist sense because of course, we all have a very strong interest in disarmament. I am very encouraged to find that the Taoiseach said to Chairman Gorbachev that we would urge our position in the United Nations in European political co-operation and other fora open to us.  I am very encouraged to find the Taoiseach taking that view of what we can do and of the scope of the action we can take in the context of European political co-operation, and would encourage the Taoiseach to keep going along that road because it is very largely to allow the European Community and its member states to exercise that kind of influence that the process of political co-operation is so important.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach conveyed good wishes to Chairman Gorbachev for his work on economic and political restructuring at home, for global disarmament and for the reduction of world tensions.  The Taoiseach was probably speaking for all of us when he said that.  Let us not get too carried away.  We should in every way we can, constructively encourage the process that is going on in the Soviet Union.  Let us not forget the difficulties that are there and let us not forget the point from which they are coming, so to speak.  We look at television news and read the various journals and there is a whole list of areas where we can empathise with people within the Soviet sphere of influence who are trying to change their situations.  These include Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania.  In Hungary developments are taking place.  It is difficult to see whether anything is really happening at present in Czechoslovakia. <Col N="1373" /> Unfortunately, we now see reports of unrest in Georgia and there have been similar problems in Armenia in the past. The process that Chairman Gorbachev has embarked upon is certainly a very new and a very great adventure in his terms but it is a process that is aimed at bringing the people of the countries in the Soviet sphere of influence so far to a level of human rights, civil rights and civil freedoms that will still be a long way behind the standards that we regard as acceptable.  That process must be encouraged but we should not get the view that in what is being done so far any headline is being set for the rest of the world.  We should bear that in mind in the praise and support that we give to the process because the bottom line must always be that we want to see it going a great deal further.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the making of this statement by the Taoiseach about these two meetings that he had with President Bush and Mr. Gorbachev. The statement confirms the view that most people had that these meetings were largely ceremonial ones.  They are not to be denigrated for that reason; they are still to be welcomed.  It underlines for me how regrettable it is that while the Taoiseach can meet the President of the United States and the President of the Soviet Union and have friendly discussions with them of that kind, it has not been possible for him or, indeed, his predecessor, for the past three and a half years to have a meeting with the head of government that is perhaps most relevant to our problems, other than the twice a year short meetings on the margins of the European Council.  The very fact that the Taoiseach found it necessary to convey his views to Mr. Gorbachev about certain matters in Northern Ireland and certain aspects of Anglo-Irish relations in order, hopefully, that they would be conveyed or reinforced by Mr. Gorbachev, underlines the necessity for a real, substantive meeting taking place between the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister without any further delay.  I presume the Taoiseach has made many efforts to have <Col N="1374" /> such a meeting and I presume we all know that the reason it is not taking place is that the British Prime Minister is not prepared to have it.</P>

      <P>It seems to be a great pity that the review of the Anglo-Irish Agreement should be going on in some fashion for the last number of months and that it should presumably be completed without a meeting between the heads of the two Governments involved.  We recall that in 1985 the heads of the two Governments were very much involved, particularly in the latter part of the arrangements that were then made.  It is not clear from what the Taoiseach has said whether or not the United States propose to make further contributions to the International Fund that was set up under the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  My hope obviously is that they would be prepared to do that and that it would go on for some time.</P>
      <P>The position of Irish immigrants in the United States was raised by the Taoiseach, as indeed it should have been, but it is not at all clear from the statement what the response was in terms of what can be done for the very large numbers of people who, unfortunately, are there now on what the Americans call an out of status basis, or whether their position is going to improve at all in the next number of years.  It is not clear either what number of Irish emigrants or wouldbe emigrants are going to be covered by the arrangements being made now for the Berman visa, as the latest round of visas are called.  I hope the position of the very large number of our people who are in the United States can be clarified and regularised during this present year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the discussions with Mr. Gorbachev I note that the Taoiseach discussed disarmament with him as one of the main topics and I am obviously very glad that he did.  It seems strange, however, that an Irish Taoiseach can discuss the very essential topic of disarmament with the Soviet President but appears not to be <Col N="1375" /> able to discuss it, nor were his predecessors, within the European Community or in the European political co-operation process.  Some time ago a speech was made by the former Taoiseach, Deputy FitzGerald, in which he said that matters of this kind came up at discussions at which he was present and that he felt his obligation was not to contribute but simply to listen.  That is unreal.  We should be getting away from that sort of situation and it is underlined by the fact that if we are in a position to talk to the head of the Soviet Government surely we should be in a position to talk to our own partners in the European Community about these matters.</P>
    <P>The question of the closer relationship which Mr. Gorbachev would like to see between the European Community and the countries of Eastern Europe was raised.  That is going to be a very important development insofar as the whole of Europe is concerned in the next number of years and I would like to see us play our part in that.  One aspect of it that will be particularly important is the question of Austrian membership of the European Community.  Austrian membership seemed to be unthinkable up to a few years ago and it is only in the Gorbachev era that the Austrians have made serious approaches to the European Community. Their neutrality, of course, is a genuine one in the sense that it is imposed on them by treaty which they signed with, among others, the Soviet Union.  In the last resort, whether or not they can join the Community is dependent on the attitude that will be taken by the Soviet Union.  It has considerable ramifications and our position is particularly important both from the point of view of the Soviets and the Austrians.  It can influence greatly what is likely to happen in terms of defensive arrangements within this Continent well into the next century.</P>
    <P>On the question of the arrangement whereby oil might be exchanged for food or other commodities which we would be in a position to supply, perhaps that is not as attractive as it was portrayed here, <Col N="1376" /> as if it were some sort of major breakthrough. There is no shortage of oil at the moment and nobody is really seriously looking for oil as something that is needed to trade.  It is just another commodity. We could just as easily take other goods in exchange for whatever we would supply ourselves.  Unless we can pre-sell whatever oil is given to us it is not much use to us and it is no better than any other commodity.  Nonetheless, since one cannot engage with the Soviet Union in normal trade where one is paid in hard currency for what one sells, one has to make arrangements on whatever basis they are made, whether on the basis of barter or on the basis of counter-trading. I hope we can increase trade between the two countries because it is at a relatively low level.</P>
    <P>We are not just talking about trade in goods because one of the most interesting and heartening things that happened in recent years was the arrangement made by Aer Rianta, particularly the Shannon sector of Aer Rianta, in one of the Moscow airports and in Leningrad.  The provision of services of that kind gives an opening for this country that, perhaps, could be much easier and more lucrative for us than simply the sale of goods in the traditional way in which trade is carried on.</P>
    <P>I could not help being reminded by the unfortunate event in the northern Norwegian sea within the last week when a Soviet nuclear submarine was lost with, unfortunately, the loss also of a substantial number of lives, of the threat that we are subject to all the time in the Irish Sea in relation to nuclear submarines, Soviet, US and British.  That brought home to us the necessity to try to work towards some control of the use to which the Irish Sea is put and the dangers that are very much part and parcel of it at present and from which we would be major sufferers if there was an accident of that kind.  The difficulty about the Irish Sea is that, unlike the Norwegian sea, where the submarine sank to a depth in excess of 5,000 feet, the deepest part of it is about 500 feet.  A geat deal of it is a lot shallower than that and if there is <Col N="1377" /> any contamination of the sea from those nuclear sources the dangers will be enormous.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to say that I welcome very much the fact that the two meetings took place.  Meetings with American Presidents are common enough and nothing very different or unusual happened at this one.  On the other hand, a meeting with the chief political figure of the Soviet Union is very different.  It is new and, as far as this country is concerned, it probably would not have happened up to some years ago. Like everybody in Western Europe we should rejoice at the huge changes that are taking place within the Soviet Union and the remainder of Eastern Europe. We look at them with great interest and with great sympathy.  We realise also that it has been the initiative of Mr. Gorbachev, and his various supporters within the Soviet Union, that has brought this about.  What he has done is of huge significance not alone for that country but for Europe and the world as a whole.  I congratulate him on that and hope he will succeed in the objectives he has set himself.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join with other Deputies in welcoming the statement from the Taoiseach on his two meetings, one with President Bush and the other with General Secretary and Chairman Gorbachev of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.  It is a mark not only of the change in public attitudes but of more deeper institutional relationships that we have a report from the Taoiseach's meetings with both leaders in the same statement.  It indicates a more positive concept of balance in relation to what are referred to on occasions as the two super-powers.  Having listened to the speeches welcoming and commenting on the Taoiseach's statement I am prompted to raise one critical point and it does not say anything about the language used in the statement.  My point is that the mechanism used for discussing meetings and issues as important as the ones referred to is quite unsatisfactory.  At the risk of introducing some tedium I should like to <Col N="1378" /> say that what we have listened to this morning clearly makes the case for a concept I so often proposed, that there should be a foreign affairs committee of the House.  The issues to which the Taoiseach adverted could be discussed more substantially at a meeting of such a committee. If such a committee had existed one could envisage the careful preparation of themes and the reaction to the heads and points of discussion that took place between the different leaders.  Such a committee would be of powerful assistance to the House and, in terms of public education, to the evolution of new attitudes and interests.  It could take account of the extraordinarily under-estimated public interest there is in aspects of world affairs.  I hope that the Taoiseach and the Government will have an opportunity before the Irish Presidency of the EC commences of rethinking their attitude to such a committee.  It would be a very valuable mechanism that could be used prior to such meetings and for a discussion on the consequences of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Putting myself imaginatively into an atmosphere in which such a committee might have existed I would think that what it would have before it would not just be the Taoiseach's statement but statements of the Speaker and it could have requested a copy of Mr. Gorbachev's speech.  People are not inclined to pay sufficient attention to what Mr. Gorbachev said in his speech.  One must ask what was the status of a meeting at Shannon Airport in relation to the more formal meetings, social or ceremonial, that have taken place in other contexts. Mr. Gorbachev did not drop into Shannon in the role of a penitent to explain to people of this small country that he was hoping they would grow to love him or something like that.  There was a significant passage in his speech in which he invited the Western world, with its enormously large levels of poverty, unemployment and worker insecurity, to discuss the importance of there being a <i>perestroika</i> within Western thought and a <i>perestroika</i> particularly in relation to economic democracy.  He said that in the evolution in the West people who were <Col N="1379" /> working in perilously badly managed firms should have the opportunity of removing the franchise from their owners who are inefficient and threatening not only the firm but the jobs and livelihoods of the workers.  He spoke about the possibility of extending democracy beyond the political and into the realm of the economic and the social and about the right of workers to a freedom of information and so on.</P>
    <P>We would be very wise not to put ourselves into the role of confessor and to start saying that we are going to watch with care how Mr. Gorbachev gets on.  It behoves us to read his speeches with great care.  They appreciate our support in the difficult internal reformations that are taking place politically, economically, socially and culturally within the Soviet Union.  There is some merit in taking some of his observations about the West on board.  It is in that regard that one will find people less forthcoming.</P>
    <P>In the brief time available I want to make a couple of points that arise in the statement.  I am not going to criticise the Taoiseach for not making more use, or putting more into the agenda, of what, after all, was just an hour's meeting.  At the same time I must say that the cynic in me suggests that they must have been moving very quickly across an enormous agenda to manage to discuss all the points that are listed in the Taoiseach's statement.</P>
    <P>One I am delighted to see included is the question of Ireland's role as a possible venue for a future summit.  That imposes some responsibilities on us.  I do take the point about the use of the word &ldquo;disinterested&rdquo; in the Taoiseach's statement as being disinterested only in terms of our not being involved in arms production and dissemination.  I think that was its intended use &mdash; because obviously everybody is interested in the removal of the potential destructive effect of nuclear weapons.</P>
    <P>But what was even more interesting and is surfacing more and more in Chairman Gorbachev's speeches, and indeed in the United States, is what is taking <Col N="1380" /> place in relation to development particularly among the poorest countries.  I am delighted that that topic came up because people do not realise the extent of what has happened particularly in the light of a new economic consensus that is developing, a concept of what I have often referred to as the depeopled economy. In relation to the world, that is resulting in an enormous increase in child death, in a reduction in health expenditure, in expenditure on social provision and so on.  For example, in 1979 the average flow of funds in terms of loans, aid, interest and capital subventions from the North &mdash; if you like, the less peopled world &mdash; to the South &mdash; the vastly peopled world &mdash; was of the order of $40 billion.  By 1989 this had been entirely reversed.  If one took repayments alone and did not include trade one would find the net payments from the South to the North were $20 billion.  If one included deterioration in trade in terms of the basic, often very few, primary commodities on which the least developing and less developed countries are dependent, then one would find that the flow from the poorest to the richest, in other words, from South to North, was $60 billion.</P>
    <P>I hope, in future meetings, that the question of not only reducing armaments but also of more positively engaging the concerns on the issue of the urgency of deflection from military spending to the genuine tasks of development will prevail and be enhanced.</P>
    <P>Should we be preparing for summits, it is very interesting to note that the 1988 Summit in Moscow, the joint statement issued at the end of that Summit, took account of the circumstances of which I speak and said:</P>
    <P>Both leaders reaffirm their support for the World Health Organisation/ UNICEF goal of reducing the scale of preventable childhood deaths through the most effective methods of saving children.  They urged other countries in the international community to intensify efforts to achieve this goal.</P>
    <P>I want to conclude the point I am making <Col N="1381" /> by simply saying that the issue as to whether or not armaments cannot only be contained but vital resources transferred to the urgent needs of development, affects not only the lives of children today but those of the many children who have been saved by intervening and innovative medical techniques such as oral rehydration therapy, immunisation and so on, and who are now at risk beyond the age of five.  The children of the world are the principal beneficiaries of every move we make towards peace.</P>
    <P>It is important that the point I made &mdash; that the international economic consensus, which is concentrating on indicators of economic performance which do not necessarily take into account the human populations affected by that economic thinking at macro level is responsible for the danger to children on this planet &mdash; be emphasised.  At home I believe such policies are perceiving unemployment &mdash; and I note it in the Taoiseach's statement &mdash; almost as not the major priority towards which economic measures are taken but rather as an obdurate consequence of economy which simply will not remove itself.  It is possible, as many economies in the world show us if we care to look at them, that world economies can have high export rates, low interest rates and, at the same time, cannot have any kind of labour-intensive investment opportunities, when the unemployment figures can take off quite separate from the overall better performance of the economy on other indicators that do not necessarily take account of demography or of people.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the unemployment issue was honestly raised.  I do think it is a dreadful reflection on us, in a way, a reflection of an intellectual and basic political kind in that we are, here again, dealing with the very last bulge that will take place in the Irish population.  Demographic trends suggest that we will never again have the same expansion of population we have now.  Here we are discussing the welfare of emigrants.  It is right to discuss the welfare of emigrants. Their position in the United States is something that must be kept at the top <Col N="1382" /> of the agenda in any talks that take place. However, behind it lies a great confession of failure.  It is insufficient to say that the country is incapable of keeping all its people at home.  This raises questions about the kinds of redistribution investment, the kinds of strategic investment of which I speak that are necessary to create the jobs that will provide the opportunities which in turn will render emigration simply an historical problem.</P>
    <P>I did not find precise reference to it and it would probably have been inelegant of the Taoiseach to have raised it in the atmosphere of St. Patrick's Day, but I wondered about the United States budget deficit.  If we decide to cast our contentious eye on Chairman Gorbachev, it behoves us to look at the economic policies of President Bush and what they are doing in the rest of the world.  The United States budget deficit could be crudely described as a beggar-my-neighbour approach to world economy.  In fact, it has created enormous difficulties for the rest of the world.  The nature of the structure of the external relationships of a budget deficit are ones that are beneficial to the inhabitants of the country involved.  If one combines it, as in the United States, with a low tax régime, effectively what one is doing is living off one's international neighbours.  That is how the budget deficit is operated in the United States.  It is something we should think about.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that the detail on issues of trade was taken up.  I do not share the concerns many people have in relation to barter.  I simply want to say this: there was a time, and it was not so long ago, when even for a plane to have touched down at Shannon would have created a great furore in that part of the world I was reared.  I often wonder and I hope the fact that we earn many millions of pounds from servicing planes for Aero-flot, and now also for Cubana, has not brought about this extraordinary metamorphosis in Newmarket-on-Fergus, in Limerick and Clare.  Someone said there was not a single anti-Communist banner in sight.  What a conversion.  How was it related to the possibility of trade?  Let <Col N="1383" /> us not be cynical.  People are now more sophisticated.  People have come on and seen that a great deal of the rubbish and nonsense which wasted decades of our time in this country, in abusing and insulting people who live in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, is past.  We have great opportunities for trade which can be managed within a complicated set of arrangements.</P>
    <P>For example, people spoke about oil. Just think of the manner in which this can be facilitated by the provision of services to aircraft.  There are very neat ways of making the transaction.  I will not say much more about them but I do know that they exist.  We should expand those trade opportunities.</P>
    <P>I shall conclude by saying that I welcome the Taoiseach having come into the House and making the statement on his two meetings but I find it hollow and totally insufficient.  For goodness sake, how can we speak about disarmament, about the Irish and US budget deficits, about aid, trade, GATT and so on in an hour?  It is rather like someone describing how they had a flush of global thinking to the head.  It is not this that we need.</P>
    <P>We are a Parliament and we are unique among European Parliaments in being deprived of a forum to debate all these issues in detail so that we can be of assistance to whoever is the Government of the day and reflect the widespread welcome public concern with regard to issues of peace, disarmament, development, mutual understanding, the removal of misunderstandings and so forth.</P>
    <P>In fact, the mask only slipped once during the course of the visit to Shannon. I particularly deplored the despicable comments in some of the British newspapers about Mr. Gorbachev having talks with the Taoiseach and Ministers at Shannon Airport.  They let themselves down very badly by making statements about what would Mr. Gorbachev have to say to an Irish Government and so forth.  As I said, these statements were despicable and revealed to us how, in relation to other matters, we have a very long way to go in acquiring an equality of treatment <Col N="1384" /> in relation to certain sections of the British media in particular.  I do not say that in any anti-British way: I say it with a mutual concern for the responsibility of comment.</P>
    <P>Also, it is not fair to ask, because we are a country with an independent foreign policy and we speak to Mr. Gorbachev and President Bush, when are we going to speak to Mrs. Thatcher.  Mrs. Thatcher's backward and recalcitrant views in relation to world politics are primarily a problem for her and the unfortunate and suffering British people who have to live under her.  I think the Taoiseach is correct, and I hope that this will be the case during the Irish Presidency, in pursuing as many contacts as possible and in avoiding an obsession with somebody who may not be bringing any kind of creativity, openness or, very often human understanding to great and urgent issues. In a way, a small country talking to the representatives of a very large one should be an indicator of our mutual interdependence. I request the Taoiseach to think again on the issue of a foreign affairs committee which would provide a proper forum for the discussion of these issues.</P>

      <P>I was disappointed to some extent at the negative and begrudging attitude from some speakers in relation to the Soviet Union.  If we sit back like contented tom cats believing that we have in some way created new life in the Soviet Union we will be making a serious mistake.  Very good things are happening in the Soviet Union but they are happening there because the people in the Soviet Union want them to happen. We would also be mistaken in thinking that all we have to do is sit back and wait until things happen in a way which satisfies the countries of the West.  I do not believe there is any way in which the Soviet people will accept the values of the West in the way that western people or some western Governments see them. They have very different concepts of democracy and freedom and in many ways they have a much more expanded concept of democracy and freedom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1385" /> President Gorbachev's willingness to break the political and military moulds in the search for world peace has quite rightly led to him being acknowledged as the outstanding world statesman of our time.  It has won him the affection and admiration not just of socialists and communists but of all those throughout the world who want to see a lasting and secure peace.  The remarkable enthusiasm demonstrated for President Gorbachev by the Irish people during his short visit here is an indication of how much progress has been made in defrosting the cold war.  Not too many years ago it would have been unthinkable for a Soviet leader to get such an enthusiastic reception from virtually all sections of Irish society.  Indeed, it is not too long ago that to be a communist in this country effectively placed a person outside the pale of civilisation in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Irish people have demonstrated a maturity in relation to this matter in recent times.  It is a tribute to the remarkable contributions made by President Gorbachev to the successful conclusion of the treaty between the Soviet Union and the United States for the destruction of certain nuclear weapons.  The efforts of the Soviet Union to secure solutions to the many regional conflicts throughout the world in such places as Afghanistan, Southern Africa and South-East Asia, have also clearly had their impact.  The decision announced at the United Nations last December to reduce by almost one-third the number of Soviet conventional forces in Eastern Europe was a particularly significant development. It opens up the possibility of real progress towards a demilitarised Europe if, and I emphasise the word &ldquo;if&rdquo;, there is a reciprocal response by NATO countries. I urge the Government, and I think the Taoiseach indicated in his statement that he would do this, to use all available international fora to exert pressure on the NATO countries to leave the cold war thinking behind them and to respond to the clear wishes of the people of the world for peace and a demilitarised world.  The announcement by President Gorbachev in London last week that the <Col N="1386" /> Soviet Union would cease production of enriched uranium used in the production of nuclear weapons, is a courageous initiative which merits the support of all those who want to see the end to the nuclear madness.</P>
    <P>Following President Gorbachev's short visit here there is now clearly the possibility of real and substantial developments between Ireland and the Soviet Union in the cultural, trade, economic and political areas.  The potential for trade is enormous.  Apart from our immediate neighbours in Europe, we have tended to look west to the United States for trade developments but we should also be looking east.  There is a great potential market in the Soviet Union and the successes of Aer Rianta demonstrate how well we can do there. The heaviest concentrations of population are in the western areas, not that far away from Ireland and, in fact, Moscow is far nearer to us than New York is.</P>
    <P>In the context of the present bootboy tactics by a small group of multinational oil companies in trying to deprive this country of petrol supplies, the Soviet offer of a barter deal involving oil is particularly important.  To deny the multinational oil companies the stranglehold they now enjoy over this country, we must find alternative sources of oil and, as I said yesterday in the House, establish an independent distribution system.  The Soviet Union are now offering us the prospect of an oil supply independent of the oil giants.  The Government must follow up on this offer and transform it into a firm deal which would, of course, not only break the oil companies stranglehold on this country but would also give a much valued and much needed boost to our food industry.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach's visit to the US was much longer than the visit of President Gorbachev to this country and, unfortunately, does not seem to have thrown up anything of the same potential or significance. Indeed, what is now almost an annual visit by the Taoiseach to the United States around St. Patrick's Day to present shamrock to the resident of the <Col N="1387" /> White House, unfortunately, and with all due respect to the Taoiseach, conjures up images of a 19th century tenant farmer presenting a sprig of shamrock to his lordship in the big house.  I say this because I believe that we should be careful about how we present ourselves to powerful countries, whether they be the United States or the Soviet Union.  We must not present ourselves as suppliants who are looking for scraps from anybody's table. It is important, of course, that we maintain good relations with the United States and, indeed, all other countries.  It is an important source of investment and, therefore, job creation for this country. It is also, unfortunately for Ireland, home for more and more of our people and as long as the Fianna Fáil Government persist with their current economic policies more and more people will have to look for a job and a living in other countries.  The severe difficulties faced by the Irish people illegally in the United States is highlighted again by a report this morning of a young girl who was virtually held prisoner there and has been well documented.  It is essential that the Government do all possible to ease those difficulties.</P>
    <P>On his return the Taoiseach said he had received a good response to his representations but nothing seems to have happened since then.  Our moral case for a sympathetic consideration for Irish people illegally in the US would, I believe, be far stronger if we showed a similar degree of sympathy and consideration for illegal immigrants in Ireland.  This is far from the case.  Illegal immigrants are whisked out of this country in most cases without any opportunity to take legal advice or challenge the decision in any way.</P>
    <P>In conclusion all our Taoisigh have been regular visitors to the United States and a number of US Presidents have visited this country.  I hope the short visit of the Soviet leader will be followed up by a visit to the Soviet Union by the Taoiseach and a longer visit to Ireland by the President of the Soviet Union.</P>

      <P>Such a development would mark the opening of a new phase in our State's foreign policy where we must seek equally good relations with all the major countries of the world.  Such a policy can only strengthen our neutrality, an essential principle for the peaceful development of this world and unfortunately, one which Fine Gael appears to be abandoning.</P>

      <P>Last evening I was opening my contribution and I was making reference to the success the Government have had over the past few years and that the time was not opportune to put new strategies in place to allow us to continue and to improve on that success.  I made reference to the fact that the plan was a clear, credible and coherent plan both nationally and regionally.  It involves programmes which talk about real money for real programmes.  It deals with the future prosperity of the country, job creation and better living standards for all.  I was somewhat disappointed with the Opposition response to date.  In advance of the national plan being published and submitted to Brussels we were being told by the Opposition that we were pitching the plan too low and that it would fail but, of course, it did not, then they met our success with disappointment and, of course, there has to be something deeply sad about that kind of attitude because it is the politics of trivial pursuit as far as I am concerned.  The attitude is, never mind the realities, just dream up a long list of whinges.  What we have heard to date from the Opposition in this debate is the desire to frustrate the plan and not to contribute to it.  That must be politically sad for all of us.  Because of this politically shabby response there are now no matters of substantive content raised by the Opposition which must be addressed.  Therefore, I propose to provide the House with the precise details of how the National Development Plan will affect my own area of responsibility and with some comment about the sub-region attached to the west of Ireland.</P>
      <P>Nineteen eighty-nine is the first year of a strategic road programme designed to meet the challenges and opportunities of 1992 and the opening of the channel tunnel.  Some £1.8 billion will be spent on roads in the five year period 1989 to 1993. This massive level of funding is only possible due to the very expanded and higher rates of assistance available from the EC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1390" /> We can look forward to the implementation of a comprehensive road programme which is intended to reduce transport costs, to provide an adequate inter-urban network of national roads, to eliminate traffic bottlenecks and relieve the traffic congestion of lorries and cars in our cities and towns, to improve non-national roads contributing to economic and regional development, to strengthen bridges to cater for EC weight limits, and to make our roads safer.</P>
    <P>An important aim of our programme is to ensure that Irish road users are generally not disadvantaged <i>vis-à-vis</i> road users in other member states.  As a result, transport operators should be able to compete more effectively both at home and abroad thus leading to lower prices being charged to the Irish consumer.  The programme will also result in the creation of approximately 8,700 extra man years of employment over the next five years and generate spin-off employment.</P>
    <P>Last month, we submitted a detailed operational programme for roads to the EC Commission, in support of the outline of the road elements in the National Development Plan.  This is the first time in the history of the State that a comprehensive medium- to long-term strategic plan has been prepared relating to national, regional, urban and county roads.</P>
    <P>Apart from the condition of Irish roads, a number of factors have been taken into account in analysing road needs.</P>
    <P>First, I have had regard to very high relative transport costs in Ireland.  Transport costs for Irish exporters to mainland Europe are approximately twice those incurred by Community countries trading with one another on the European mainland. The most significant reason for the high Irish transport costs is the deficient state of the national roads and of the access roads to the principal ports and airports.</P>
    <P>Secondly, I have been influenced by the fact that roads are the dominant mode of inland transport, accounting for 96 per cent of passenger travel and 90 per cent of freight travel.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1391" /> Thirdly, I have had to meet the needs arising from the very rapid increase in vehicle numbers.  The total number of licenced vehicles trebled between 1960 and 1980 and is forecast to double between then and the year 2005.  Of particular significance is that since 1960, there has been a forty-fold increase in the number of heavy goods vehicles, over eight tonnes unladen weight.</P>
    <P>Fourthly, it was necessary to meet our special needs arising from our open economy. Ireland is very dependent on external trade, which represented 133 per cent of GDP in 1986.</P>
    <P>Fifthly, I found it necessary to provide for improvements to meet the requirements arising from the fact that traffic on national routes is projected to grow at the rate of 3 per cent per annum over the next 20 years.</P>
    <P>My Department have estimated total road needs at £9 billion at 1989 prices on the basis of a 20 year evaluation period. The average of £450 million a year compares with an expenditure of £280 million in 1988 of which £150.5 million was financed by the State, including EC grants, and the balance by local authorities.</P>
    <P>The Government propose to invest almost £1 billion in road improvements over the next five years.  When account is taken of State grants for road maintenance and local authority expenditure financed from their own resources, over-all roads expenditure in this period should reach £1.8 billion.</P>
    <P>The Government provision for the improvement of national roads in this period is £755.2 million.  The average expenditure of £151 million a year represents a massive increase of 74 per cent in real terms, compared with £86.6 million last year.  These important roads represent 6 per cent of the total road mileage and carry 35 per cent of the traffic.</P>
    <P>Immediate priority will be given to the development of the following sections of strategic national routes.  Euroroute EO1, from Rosslare to the Border including the Dublin Ring Road, section of <Col N="1392" /> Euroroute E20 &mdash; Portlaoise to Dublin and Dublin to Kinnegad.</P>
    <P>The strategy for national roads will concentrate on a few broad categories of work, for example, the first is the major improvement projects on national roads, mainly town by-passes and relief roads and major route realignments and bridges.  Sixty-nine major projects are expected to commence construction in the period while a further 23 are already under construction, involving a total expenditure of £610 million in the plan period.  The strategy also concentrates on smaller improvement projects on national roads including minor widening and realignment and accident blackspot eradication with an expenditure of £90 million over the five years.  The remaining elements of the strategy are road pavement improvements and bridge strengthening on national roads primarily to cater for increased EC vehicle weight limits. The total expenditure here will be of the order of £55 million.</P>
    <P>The new programme has already got off the ground.  By way of practical examples, I might mention that 12 major schemes costing £190 million are starting this year.  These schemes include Navan Road, Newbridge, Shankill/Bray, Glenmore/New Ross and Phase 2 of Cork/Mallow.  Major schemes in progress include the public section of the western parkway and Chapelizod in Dublin, Glanmire in Cork and Athlone by-pass.</P>
    <P>I also expect to obtain private funding through toll franchises.  I recently issued an invitation to private interests to consider further toll-based investment in the Dublin Ring Road and I am looking forward to a satisfactory response.  I have also identified three other projects which may have potential for private investment remunerated by tolls.  They are the Newbridge and Kilcullen by-passes, the Lucan to Kilcock Road and the downstream crossing of the River Lee in Cork. Any realistic proposals will be fully considered. It is important to stress that any private investment obtained through tolling will be used to accelerate the road development programme and will be <Col N="1393" /> additional to the Exchequer funding spelt out in the national plan.</P>
    <P>The Government also propose to spend a total of £230 million on the improvement of non-national roads during the next five years.  During the course of discussions I had in Brussels last January, I pressed the case for EC aid for urgent investment in non-national roads.  EC aid has been sought for State investment totalling £75 million which will be concentrated on non-national roads which significantly contribute to the objective of promoting economic and regional development.  These include important access routes to ports and airports, roads providing access to industrial, agri-business, fish processing and aquaculture facilities, access roads to commercial forestry developments, tourist access routes and scenic routes as well as roads which contribute to rural and urban economic development.</P>
    <P>The planned investment in road improvements includes provision for an estimated expenditure of £135 million to strengthen or replace bridges.  This is based on surveys of some 2,500 bridges since 1986.  These surveys show that, of the 20,000 bridges in Ireland, 7,000, or 35 per cent will need to be strengthened or replaced to meet EC lorry weight requirements.</P>
    <P>While Irish road accident rates compare quite well with other EC member states, there are no grounds for complacency. An important objective of the planned investment in road improvements is to make roads safer.  In particular, there should be a significant reduction in road accident rates on national roads as a result of the improvements, based on international experience.</P>
    <P>I also propose to revise speed limits generally.  It is widely accepted at EC level that speed limits must be realistic to ensure that they can be properly enforced.</P>
    <P>In the past, there has been serious underinvestment in roads.  What I am now providing for is a medium-term strategic road programme with a financial commitment over a number of years <Col N="1394" /> designed to meet the challenges and opportunities of 1992.  Our roads are the most deficient part of our physical infrastructure.</P>
    <P>We have now embarked on the first five year strategic roads programme in partnership with the EC.  The Commission shares our view that a coherent roads programme is urgently required to reduce our transport costs and assist the Irish economy to compete more successfully in the proposed single internal market.  The programme is good news for the transport operator, the purchaser of Irish goods, and the building industry. We are determined that it will succeed in its objectives.</P>
    <P>The National Development Plan provides for expenditure of £316 million over the five year period on sanitary and other local services.  This element of the plan will be implemented through an operational programme, which will establish a framework for the effective utilisation of capital resources.</P>
    <P>Expenditure on water and sewerage schemes will be £62.5 million for each year, 1989 to 1993.  These services have benefited from ERDF aid over past years and the Government are now seeking 50 per cent Community support towards continuing expenditure on the programme. The level of Community support sought has been determined having regard to the overall objectives of the National Development Plan, the Government's assessment of priorities in the area of infrastructure development, and the best balance of Community and national resources which should be invested in the different sectoral areas in order to achieve the development objectives of the national plan.</P>
    <P>The national plan sets out a succinct analysis of the importance of these services to the economy and the environment, as well as a clear statement of objectives for the development of water and sewerage services.  It also contains a concise indication of the basis for the programme of work which will be carried out over the next five years, together with annual and regional breakdowns of the planned capital investment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1395" /> The planning exercise undertaken for sanitary services has several significant features.  For the first time, a multiannual programme has been devised within which priorities for investment are clearly defined.  A better basis has been created for close, structured co-ordination between economic and infrastructural development.  Major emphasis is placed on quality factors as well as on the availability of services and there is a stronger correlation between environmental protection requirements and development objectives.  A framework has been put in place within which the impact of changing demand factors can be effectively assessed.</P>
    <P>During the period 1989-1993 the intended investment of £62.5 million a year on sanitary services will be directed towards supporting planned expansion in defined economic sectors, including agri-food, fisheries and tourism, thus meeting national and rural development needs; upgrading water supplies so as to achieve statutory quality standards and keep pace with demand; extending sewage treatment facilities to ensure effective environmental protection; and extending and renewing water supply and sewage collection networks, increasing the availability of safe, piped services.</P>
    <P>Sanitary services provide an essential infrastructure basis for several sectors of the economy.  The investment planned will support this Government's policy of promoting rapid exploitation of natural resource based industries, including food and fisheries.  Good quality, high capacity services must be available to allow these industries to expand.  Clean, pollution-free waters are a basic requirement for the further development of aquaculture. Sanitary services have major implications for the quality of our environment and this, in turn, influences the perception of Ireland abroad, for example, as a producer of high quality food and as a tourism destination.</P>
    <P>Apart from the substantial volume of work already in progress, a total of 145 new water supply, sewerage and urban <Col N="1396" /> flood relief schemes, valued at £277 million in current costs, are scheduled to commence during the period of this plan. These schemes have been selected because of factors relating to the quality or standard of existing services, or factors generating a demand for the extension of existing services, or the provision of new services.  In devising the programme, account has been taken of national, regional and local development priorities. An important objective was to provide an incentive to the regional location of industry so as to assist in achieving balanced economic development and job opportunities.</P>
    <P>Sanitary services both utilise and protect water resources.  Last year, I gave effect in Irish law to the requirements of three important EC Directives relating to water quality, setting standards for drinking water, bathing waters and salmonid waters.  These standards are stringent and meeting them has considerable cost implications, but they must be met in full, and as quickly as possible.  Positive concerted action will therefore be taken under the sanitary services programme on a priority basis in the case of water supplies, to replace existing sources of abstraction, where necessary, provide new or upgraded treatment works and improve distribution systems, and in the case of sewerage schemes, to provide new or improved services with better collection networks and treatment or higher levels of treatment, where appropriate, in order to protect designated waters and abate pollution.</P>
    <P>In this way, the programme will contribute to the maintenance of the amenity and recreational value of water resources, while utilising those resources in a prudent, controlled way to provide necessary consumer services and a base for economic development.</P>
    <P>The level of investment projected for sanitary services, while lower than spending in the first half of the eighties, is realistic, given the general level of sanitary services development which has already taken place, the pressure on the public finances and the overall infrastructural demands which must be met in <Col N="1397" /> order to develop our economy to compete in Europe.</P>
    <P>With careful, detailed appraisal of specific projects and comprehensive assessment of investment needs, the most productive and worthwhile sanitary services schemes will proceed during the next five years.  Although a programme of 145 schemes is projected in the operational programme, I do not intend that sanitary services policy and planning will now become rigid or static.  The planning framework is changing in fundamental respects, and it is vital that we can respond to new priorities where these arise.  Accordingly, I will be reviewing and updating the programme annually to take account of any significant priority changes or urgent new demands which may arise in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>As well as recognising the importance of ensuring that existing water pollution problems are remedied, there is provision in the national plan for dealing with the high smoke levels which can occur during the winter in Dublin.  We must eliminate that problem by April 1993 at the latest to comply with an EC Directive and we are taking measures as quickly as we can &mdash; by means of special control areas in seriously affected areas, measures in the housing and planning areas, and promotion of smokeless fuels.  The implementation of an effective smoke control programme could involve considerable public expenditure and we are, therefore making the case to the European Commission for assistance towards the cost of remedial measures which will achieve a solution to our smoke problem and so help to make Dublin more attractive for its own residents and for tourism, investment and leisure purposes.</P>
    <P>Industrial waste disposal aspects are also dealt with in the plan.  If these wastes cannot be disposed of satisfactorily and economically then that creates problems for industry and for the environment. Lack of proper facilities for the management of wastes has already been identified as a constraint on industrial development and job creation in some areas.  Investment is therefore needed to support the development of services for <Col N="1398" /> the treatment, recovery and disposal of industrial wastes.  Such investment would ensure that wastes are disposed of in a manner which does not cause environmental damage.</P>
    <P>As regards the incineration of hazardous wastes, the report of the consultants who carried out a feasability study of contract incineration requirements has been made available generally. The Government have decided that there will be no involvement by the State in providing a national incineration facility, either directly or by way of a joint venture with private interests, but we intend to promote and assist, where possible, the development of such a facility by the private sector subject, of course, to stringent planning and environmental controls. I will shortly be inviting the submission of proposals on that basis.</P>
    <P>The Government are also conscious of the increasingly important role played by our towns and cities in the context of the overall development of the country.  To this end, the urban renewal scheme is actively encouraging the renewal of selected inner urban areas by making a range of financial incentives available for developers. The scheme is generally working well and is succeeding in its aim of attracting commercial and residential redevelopment to the targeted areas and so uplifting the local economy.  This year, for the first time, incentives to private developers will be complemented by a modest scheme of public works, at a cost of £2 million, aimed at further upgrading the environment in designated areas. Structural Fund assistance is being sought under the plan for this expenditure.</P>
    <P>I would like to turn now to the west of Ireland and, in particular, the west sub-region which comprises the counties of Galway, Mayo and Roscommon. Although the area has a population of over 348,000, the population density is low both in national and European terms. The sub-region is predominantly rural, and suffers high emigration levels. Unemployment is high throughout the three counties.  The region has approximately 20 per cent of the land mass of the country and 10 per cent of the population.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1399" /> While much has been achieved over the past 20 years the region is still under-developed relative to other regions within Ireland and even more so in the European context.  The regions principal assets include a very high grade environment with major areas of unspoiled landscape, an extensive scenic coastline and major inland rivers and lakes.  It is one of the most important tourist destinations in the country, with major potential for redevelopment.  In common with the other sub-regions, a working group and an advisory group representative of the main bodies concerned with development, together with the local authorities, State agencies and Government Departments, were established and have produced a substantial report on the region. Submissions and other representations received from private individuals and bodies were taken into account in the deliberations of both bodies.</P>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity to thank the individuals and organisations represented on the working group and the advisory group for their efforts in producing a stimulating and very interesting draft report.  This report has provided a most important input into <i>The National Development Plan</i> which has recently been published.  It will also be an important input into the operational programmes which will implement the national plan.</P>
    <P>
      <i>The National Development Plan,</i> at Chapter 6, sets out a summary of the socio-economic position in each of the sub-regions, together with the objectives and strategies identified for each.  A breakdown of the planned expenditure over the period of the plan in each of the sub-regions is also set out.  I do not propose, therefore, to re-travel all of this ground but rather to refer to certain specific areas.</P>
    <P>The development strategy for the next five years as set out in the report prepared by the working group focuses on key actions and operations which will directly and immediately benefit the infrastructural adjustment of the sub-region. A major component here will be the <Col N="1400" /> improvement of key aspects of the infrastructure base so as to facilitate economic growth and to support the development of the main economic sectors.</P>
    <P>In so far as my own Department are concerned, the need for the protection and improvement of the environment is stressed in the report.  This emphasis is reflected in <i>The National Development Plan</i> which fully recognises the importance of the environment.  Apart from the protection it warrants in its own right, the physical environment can make a major contribution to economic development. It is important therefore that existing pollution problems are dealt with and that there is sufficient investment in sanitary services and pollution control systems. The plan also recognises the need for facilities for the proper disposal of industrial and other wastes and for the achievement and maintenance of proper quality standards for water supplies.</P>
    <P>Priority in the provision of sanitary services will, as recommended in the report of the working group, be given to projects that meet the established needs of industrial and other forms of development, to projects which will facilitate and encourage development and to projects which are particularly necessary to remedy deficiencies in existing systems.  The Government fully accept that the provision of adequate water and sewerage services is a vital prerequisite for industrial and tourism development, for rural development and for the enhancement of the environmental quality of the west region.  Expenditure in the sub-region on sanitary services during the period of the plan will amount therefore to some £60 million.  In the case of County Galway, I have already approved a new water supply scheme at Kinvara to start this year.  Several other major schemes will be provided for under the plan &mdash; for example, sewerage schemes to serve Galway city, Oranmore and Tuam and water supplies for Tuam and the Costelloe regional area.  In Mayo, I have approved a major sewerage scheme at Achill and a water supply scheme for <Col N="1401" /> Erris; further sanitary services development is projected under the plan at , Ballyhaunis and Swinford. Investment in services in County Roscommon will enable the local authority to undertake new schemes at Elfin-Strokestown and Ballinagard, both of which I have already approved, as well as at Boyle and Fairymount.  A number of the projected water supply schemes in the western area will benefit from the terms of the western package, revised and extended last year.</P>
    <P>In the area of transport, the report recommends a major improvement of transport infrastructure.  This emphasis is fully reflected in the national plan. Ireland in general and the west sub-region in particular suffer from major cost disadvantages as compared with other EC countries due to our peripheral location and the generally poor quality of our internal transport network.  Furthermore, following the opening of the channel tunnel, Ireland will be the only member state without a land link to the Community.  Under the national plan, improvement to the roads system will be achieved by selective improvements to the national roads providing access to and within the sub-regions.  Furthermore, regional and county roads will be improved and strengthened, with particular attention being given to the more important access roads and to bridges which need to be strengthened.</P>
    <P>The National Development Plan is an essential element in our response to the increasingly open European Market.  It is realistic.  It maximises the support available for Europe and, based on that support, sets out objectives that are achievable.</P>
    <P>The huge investment outlined in the plan will help to bring our roads up to EC standards.  It will erode the competitive disadvantages faced by our exporters.  It will lead, in the short term, to more jobs in the construction industry and in the long term to better employment opportunities across the nation.  It is a plan informed by the need to control inflation and overheating.</P>
    <P>We now know where we are going. <Col N="1402" /> This plan lays down the methods by which we are going to get there, and get there we will.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The planning exercise invested in this document that we are discussing, entitled <i>The National Development Plan</i> was a complete charade. There was no real consultation.  The motions were gone through with the CII, the FUE, ICTU, the IFA, the chambers of commerce in the various advisory groups and sub-regional levels.  These also included county and city managers and chairpersons of various local authorities. All of the bodies and individuals now realise that they have been used by the Taoiseach and the Government to give the Commissioners and Brussels the impression of a regional input into the plan.  On the Taoiseach's own admission to this House yesterday, only the interim reports from the seven sub-regions were considered.  This glorified public capital programme is all about hardware and is very short on software.  It is about roads, yes, and indeed very welcome.  The Minister, Deputy Flynn, has just outlined the details but it is not about the people who will travel those roads.  It is very strong on capital spending, but there is no evidence of reform of the taxation or social welfare systems.  It is full of aspirations while ignoring the practical realities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the recent press conference to launch <i>The National Development Plan,</i> the Taoiseach said that the doubling of the Structural Funds would be sufficient to remedy the severe structural deficiencies in our economy, which restrict our ability to compete, especially as we face into 1993 and the Single Market.  I challenge the Taoiseach's views that the doubling of these funds will suffice.  As pointed out the increase in Structural Funds support for productive investment to Ireland, to overcome the difficulties which will result from the intensified competition in the free trading of goods, services and capital will amount to £500 million more in 1993 than in 1988. In other words, £800 million will be spent in 1993 compared with £300 million this year.  This increase is very welcome, but <Col N="1403" /> we must be realistic about what it can attain and not unnecessarily raise expectations throughout the country.  To put it in context: the tax amnesty of last year brought in £500 million and the benefits of that, though real, made such a small impression on our economy, that it serves to underline the enormity of the problem ahead.</P>
    <P>If our growth rate exceeded that of the Community by 1 per cent for the next 40 years, only then would our income levels, now at 58 per cent, catch up with the average in the European Communities. The increases proposed over the next five years in the Structural Fund allocations to Ireland, representing less than 2 per cent of our annual GNP, will fall far short of what will be needed to ensure that the opportunities rather than the dangers of the Single Market will predominate. They will fall far short of what is needed to guarantee that the economic and social benefits of the single market accrue to the 12 members of the European Communities rather than just to its centre. They will fall far short of ensuring that the present social and economic disparities between the centre of the Community and the peripheral regions, such as Ireland, are removed to allow us to benefit from the increased market opportunities.</P>

      <P>We need larger allocations from the Structural Funds than indicated, but we need to assure Brussels that the money will be put to productive use.  On the Opposition benches we are not in the business of giving a long list of whinges, as the former speaker suggested.  Throwing money, even in billions, at our country is not what is needed to solve our problems. We need disciplined and integrated physical planning on the one hand and the lighting of economic fires &mdash; as one economic commentator put it &mdash; on the other, so that the flames will burn years <Col N="1404" /> after the initial funds are spent.  We need to implement strict monitoring and assessment of the strategic objectives of the plan and the operational plans that will follow.  The build up to 1993 is about opportunities and our ability to make use of them.  This is no dress rehearsal, it is a once off, it is for real.  It is our last opportunity to get it right and as a nation not remain indefinitely on the periphery of the Community.  It is our last opportunity to ensure that our sons and daughters can choose to stay in our country and find gainful employent, if they so wish, or alternatively, if it be their choice, armed with an education which has opened the doors of Europe to them, by giving them fluency in one or more European languages, go to the European state of their choice to widen their horizons, and then if they so wish come home, bringing back their experience which will be of benefit to all of us.  You will be aware, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, that Fine Gael proposed a national consensus to prepare for the single market.  This document, <i>An Economic Accord for 1992</i> indicates in detail the Fine Gael proposals and I can commend it to the House.  I regret very much that the Government chose not to discuss with Fine Gael nor indeed with the entire democratic framework of this House how we could move forward together to maximise the opportunities presented by the increased drawdowns from the Structural Funds.  In this document we propose regional development authorities to implement and monitor the operation plans for the seven sub-regions, along the lines of a SFADCo type authority.  Indeed, that proposal for regional development authorities had the approval of the European Parliament when they debated the Hume report on the &ldquo;Regional Problems in Ireland&rdquo;.  We did not leave it at that but we followed up our <i>Economic Accord for 1992</i> with our Economic Development Bill which is going through the House at present during Private Members' Time.  That will give effect to the many proposals in our economic accord.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the agricultural spokesperson I wish to comment on the many issues contained <Col N="1405" /> in this plan which beg an explanation. The Structural Funds, as we know, comprise the Social Fund, the Regional Fund and the FEOGA Guidance Fund.  Have the Government, or indeed Brussels, made any provision for the doubling of the Structural Funds, over the next five years to ensure that agriculture holds its share?  Has the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Michael O'Kennedy any criteria for the allocation of moneys as between guidance, The Social Fund and the Regional Fund?</P>
    <P>FEOGA guarantee money is at best likely to stabilise, but it is far more likely to decline with the ominous reports from the GATT talks in Geneva last weekend, in relation to the new international agreement on farm subsidies.  This, together with the inability of our Minister for Agriculture and Food to face up to his former colleague, the farm Commissioner, Mr. Ray MacSharry, and to defend the special position of agricultural production in our economy, is a major cause of concern for us.  We must remind ourselves that the main plank in the argument for initial entry to the European Community in 1973 was based on the benefits to agriculture and the agri-food industry.  Again, this argument was to the front during the Single European Act debate, leading up to the referendum, that this Government never wanted.</P>
    <P>We are particularly vulnerable to changes in the Common Agricultural Policy. Again I must condemn the Minister for Agriculture and Food for what obviously are his sentiments and his contribution to the National Development Plan that we are debating this morning.  Page 61, paragraph 3.26 of the <i>National Development Plan 1989-1993</i> reads:</P>
    <P>A number of schemes have been devised to address the specific problems and requirements of the Irish farming community in the light of changes in the Common Agricultural Policy.  I take that statement to mean that he has abandoned our farmers and our agri-food business by supporting unequivocally the derailing of the Common Agricultural Policy which the <Col N="1406" /> International Monetary Fund report has recently reminded us will benefit all countries with the notable exceptions of Ireland and Denmark.  We have a lot to fear from the derailing of the Common Agricultural Policy and our Minister is supporting that move without fully understanding the implications to farmers and the agri-business sector in this country.</P>
    <P>The plan talks about structural measures to assist farmers to adjust and about rural development.  Integrated rural development is a theme that occurs many times in the plan, but at no stage is there any indication as to how extra resources will be applied to achieve this or as to what the Government have in mind. There is no reference to global grant from the Regional Fund or whether we are in a position to make the best use of draw downs from this grant.  We know the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy O'Kennedy has nothing in mind, because he has no one to advise him. What we do know is that this Government have no commitment, apart from lip service, to integrated rural development.</P>
    <P>The Minister has no one to advise him as the Rural Economic Research Centre in Teagasc has had its staff and resources decreased by 75 per cent in the past year or so.  The few who are left in the section are dealing with the national farm survey for the Communities, this is part of the farm accounts data network which is compulsory for member states.  This section is left because the Government have no option as it is part of their commitment to the Communities.</P>
    <P>The well enunciated view of the Chairman of Teagasc, Mr. Joe Rea, assuming he represents the Minister's views on the matter, is that the national farm survey is the only necessary function for the Rural Economy Research Centre &mdash; Athenry has now been designated as the centre with the rural development brief. But as all the rural development officers and those who were in a position to impart advice in this area have been driven out of Teagasc, technical agricultural advisors are only now being <Col N="1407" /> retrained in their new role as rural development officers.  This retraining is referred to in the plan.  So much for this Government's commitment to rural development, so much for this Government's commitment to the future of the family farm unit and the stabilisation of remote rural populations.  They have decimated the only centre qualified to look after a proper rural development programme and have asked another centre to start from scratch.</P>
    <P>We have, as we know, an agricultural economic institute, in a country where agriculture plays a major role in our economy, accounting for 15 per cent of the total at work and 11 per cent of our GDP. I do not think that Brussels can be aware that we have no capacity to evaluate the new policies that arrive daily from them and to put up alternatives.  We have no single body acting as an agricultural economic watchdog with the continuing reform of the Common Agricultural Policy being mooted and the new international farm agreements which reach us daily.  The section of Teagasc which was charged with this brief is effectively decimated and do we as a nation, so heavily dependent on agriculture and indeed agricultural policy emanating from Brussels, even care?  The Government do not. Surely there must be someone who will raise the alarm and shout stop before it is too late?</P>
    <P>Much has been made by the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy O'Kennedy, and indeed in the plan, of extension and reclassification under the Less Favoured Areas Directive. Headage payments under this directive are part of FEOGA guidance and hence are covered by the Structural Funds. For the purposes of the plan, Brussels has grouped our country as a single region, part of the Objective One Regional Grouping &mdash; among the most peripheral and disadvantaged in the Community.</P>
    <P>In January last I called on Minister O'Kennedy to insist &mdash; as part of the ongoing price negotiations and to extend the draw down from FEOGA guidance section of the Structural Funds over the <Col N="1408" /> next five years &mdash; that the entire country be designated as a less favoured area under Directive 75/268 and to reclassify as more severely handicapped all existing less severely handicapped areas and mountain sheep grazing areas.  This would be a major compensation in the face of changes and reforms proposed in the Common Agricultural Policy using the Structural Funds.  It would significantly boost farm incomes.  The field officer survey now being carried out &mdash; it should be noted in the face of the European elections on 15 June &mdash; would be unnecessary.  We would meet the terms of the directive that require the grading of payments to reflect the degree of natural handicap and, above all, the time-scale involved would allow the maximum number of farmers to benefit for the entire five years of the doubling of the Structural Funds which would increase their viability as economic units as we face into the opportunities and difficulties which will be posed by the Single Market.</P>
    <P>Recent economic commentators have indicated that over the next ten years 60,000 full time farms will be gone.  That is a frightening statistic as they were talking about full time commercial farms. When we see the demise of the family farm unit in rural Ireland, particularly in the more remote regions, we really have no idea what that figure could be.  I am afraid that the attention of the Minister and the Government to this major problem is totally inadequate.  Until the whole country is classified under the less favoured areas directive, as I have proposed &mdash; and indeed my views are supported by farm organisations and other independent agricultural commentators &mdash; it is clear from previous experience that no matter how many reviews are done on this directive &mdash; this will be the fourth review since 1975 &mdash; and no matter how often the boundaries are redrawn there will still be dissatisfaction with the outcome as a line drawn along townland boundaries cannot by itself distinguish or differentiate between the physical features of an area.</P>
    <P>There is another obvious major issue on reading this plan.  For the last two <Col N="1409" /> years the Minister for Agriculture and Food has postponed the commencement of the present review of the less favoured areas directive until he got a commitment from Brussels on 75 per cent recoupment on headage payments and on contemporaneous payments from Brussels. While there is no reference to the latter in the plan, it is obvious from the figures that the Government have capitulated on the 75 per cent recoupment before any official response to their request from Brussels.  Accepting the principle of additionality as a condition for increased payment from the Structural Funds, I must ask the Minister for Agriculture and Food if he has now accepted defeat on the vital issue of increased recoupment. Will he be man enough to admit it and give the House reasons?  Could it be yet again to save his former colleague, Commissioner MacSharry, embarrassment?</P>
    <P>I applaud the inclusion in the plan of emphasis to eliminate farmyard pollution and to solve the general problem of the safe disposal of agricultural waste. Indeed, primary production and the primary agricultural enterprises have been removed from pole position on the agenda of agricultural meetings in most of our European neighbouring countries to be replaced by environmental issues. Interestingly, in the plan the Minister accepted verbatim my proposals of 18 January last to extend the benefit of western package levels of anti-pollution grants to the whole country.  This has been an obvious move for some time, particularly as most of the intensive livestock units and silage making is in areas outside those designated at the moment. I am delighted that my views on this matter at least have found favour with the Minister.</P>
    <P>The plan refers to &ldquo;the intention to encourage the introduction and maintenance of environmentally friendly farm practices to protect the ecology of sensitive areas on the landscape&rdquo;.  My response to these aspirations is very warm.  However, will the Minister for Agriculture and Food be specific and assure the House that these aspirations <Col N="1410" /> will be speedily translated into the determination of environmentally sensitive areas under Directive 797/85 in the appropriate regions?  He will have my support and areas such as the Burren in Clare, the wetlands of the Shannon basin, Lady's Island Lake and the Pingos in Camross in County Wexford immediately spring to mind.</P>
    <P>Under the heading &ldquo;Diversification of Production&rdquo; in the plan, much has been made about the operations of the producer group regulation.  Will the Minister for Agriculture and Food please explain why one obvious group, pig producers, who have been experiencing catas-trophies for some time in production, have been excluded from this regulation? In the same section, in relation to encouraging alternative enterprises not controlled by production quotas, there is a reference to &ldquo;horses for sport&rdquo;.  I appeal to the Minister for Agriculture and Food to extend his generous premium announced in November last for Irish draught foals &mdash; indeed it was very welcome &mdash; to the non-thoroughbred foals eligible for registration in the Irish horse register.  There is a crisis in the number and quality of our non-thoroughbred brood mares and, without them, we will not have an industry in the future. Such an incentive would ensure a future for this flagship and it is one of the most labour intensive enterprises in the agricultural sector.</P>
    <P>I should like briefly to mention an area of great concern to many, the position in relation to animal and plant health status post-1992.  I know the various animal health and veterinary committees in Brussels are debating this at the moment but, thus far, the debate has not opened up in this country.  There is enormous concern among our farm and veterinary organisations about the implications of what is being proposed.  The threat of rabies, foot and mouth, Newcastle's disease and many others from which we have been effectively free for many years has to be answered.  What has been the response of the Government and the Minister for Agriculture and Food to the proposals?  Should we be looking at the <Col N="1411" /> possibility of declaring Ireland the foundation stock island of Europe in relation to animal and plant health status or have we nothing to fear from the proposals of removing all the technical barriers to the free movement of animals and plants and their products post-1992?  I am concerned about the ignorance and lack of debate.</P>
    <P>Ireland has an enormous contribution to make to Europe and we can have a disproportionate influence in the Community. We have many friends in Europe.  We can be its garden for the production of pure agricultural and horticultural products and we can be its playground for special interest activity holidays.  We must recognise the opportunities and the dangers posed by the Single Market commencing on 1 January 1993.  I have for a long time been amused by the fact that my own colleagues and, indeed, all Members of this House keep referring to 1992.  Nothing will happen until 1 January 1993.  Therefore, it is really 1993 we should be preaching in referring to the dateline.</P>
    <P>As I say, we must recognise the opportunities and the dangers posed by the Single Market commencing on 1 January 1993.  We must acknowledge that the doubling of the Structural Funds to encourage us to achieve social and economic parity with our Community colleagues is a once-off measure.  It is our last chance to get it right.  Indeed, by our application to the measures necessary to resolve our economic disadvantages, we must convince Brussels that we are worthy of even greater financial support over the next five years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnStafford" hpid="Acting Chairman (Mr. Stafford) Acting Chairman (Mr. Stafford)">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman (Mr. Stafford)</NameTxt>
      <P>I call on the Minister for Labour, Deputy Ahern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is nice to see you, Acting Chairman, in your new position.  We start from the position that, while we are a rich country in world terms, we are relatively poor and underdeveloped compared to our partners on mainland Europe.  Irish GNP <i>per capita</i> in 1987 was less than 60 per <Col N="1412" /> cent of the Community average.  We are experiencing a rapid growth in our population and our labour supply and we have a high dependency ratio.  We have continuously experienced relatively high levels of unemployment, under-employment and emigration.  The national debt at the end of 1988 amounted to about 133 per cent of GNP.  We have weaknesses in our infrastructure and in the industrial sector, characterised by small sized traditional indigenous industry, mostly dependent on the home and UK markets. Our investment levels are also low, with the rate of fixed investment per head in 1986 being less than two thirds of the EC equivalent.  <i>The National Development Plan</i> puts forward the strategy with which we, with the European Commission's help, propose to overcome our problems and close the gap with richer, more developed member states.</P>
      <P>I would like, first, to talk today about the plan as it relates to the Dublin sub-region. Dublin's importance nationally is highlighted by factors such as its strategic importance for access to the rest of Europe, and its concentration of population, with some 29 per cent of the total State population.  <i>The National Development Plan</i> identifies and summarises the numerous problems currently facing Dublin.  Overall, it appears that Dublin has recently fared somewhat worse than the rest of the country in investment terms, resulting in problems such as a lack of jobs, poor levels of access to education and training, serious infrastructural deficiencies and simultaneous inner city decline and outer suburban growth.  These have been worsened by the 42 per cent growth of population experienced in the sub-region in the 25 years to 1986, particularly in the earlier part of that period.  Indeed, Tallaght alone now ranks as an equal third with Limerick as an urban population centre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The plan exposes serious deficiencies in Dublin's employment structure, particularly in industry.  The relative position of the sub-region has worsened over the last decade, with Dublin rising to a position slightly above the national average unemployment rate.  The overall rate <Col N="1413" /> of 19.2 per cent masks massive local variations, with black spots of up to 56 per cent unemployment in certain outer suburbs and also high concentrations in inner city areas.  The majority of those who work do so in the service sector, which has remained static in overall numbers recently, while 29,000 jobs were lost from industry between 1981 and 1987.  A major priority for the plan for the Dublin sub-region is thus to promote industrial and services development.</P>
    <P>We propose to build on the existing strengths, encourage new business and revitalise areas particularly affected by industrial decline.  The plan proposes to concentrate on marketing and technology and to pay particular attention to the food, engineering, electronics and clothing industries.  The western suburbs, with a growing young population and already high unemployment, will be specially targeted for development.  A massive total of £763 million will be spent on industrial development, the largest single area of expenditure.</P>
    <P>Unemployment problems are closely related to the more general area of infrastructural deficiencies.  The recent return to higher economic growth will exacerbate existing problems.  These problems affect both Dublin as a sub-region and also the economy as a whole.  Dublin, for instance, is located at the hub of the country's road and rail network linking all parts of the country to the capital and, via the Irish Sea central connection, to the UK and the land bridge to mainland Europe.  Its airport handles 70 per cent of the rapidly increasing international air traffic and its port is of major importance, handling over a quarter of Ireland's seaborne trade.</P>
    <P>In all these areas the present position is seriously inadequate.  Dublin's streets are clogged with traffic, contributing to a range of problems ranging from higher transport costs to increased pollution and a poor urban environment.  The plan, accordingly, devotes major attention to infrastructural and environmental improvement.  Expenditure on the roads and on rail and bus transport totals £248 million for the sub-region.  In particular <Col N="1414" /> the Government will give priority to three developments: The Dublin Ring Road as part of the Euroroute from Rosslare to the Border; the section of the Euroroute from Portlaoise to Dublin and the road west to Kinnegad.</P>
    <P>A planned £26 million will be spent on providing new diesel commuter services on existing Dublin rail lines to the western areas of Dublin.  This will include opening eight new commuter stations and will result in a high speed and efficient commuter service to this large hinterland. Investments will be made in bus services in order to provide better links between Dublin, its outer suburbs and other regions.  The peripheral ring road, together with a port access route, will facilitate long distance traffic and greatly reduce congestion in the city streets.</P>
    <P>Because of Ireland's peripheral and island location, international access transport to the country has a particular strategic importance.  Dublin's position means that the development of its sea and air freight facilities is a major priority.  Final decisions on development possibilities such as air freight channels have not yet been taken but options are being explored urgently with the help of the European Commission.  A large extension to the terminal building at Dublin airport and a major ugrading of port facilities, including passenger terminals, are planned.  It is intended to provide intensive air and sea freight shuttle services to Britain and the Continent. Total expenditure in these areas will be £183 million in the Dublin sub-region.</P>
    <P>Another key infrastructural area central to economic development and business success is the postal and telecommunications networks.  Significant improvements have been made in the last few years in both of these. Nevertheless, the increasing emphasis both on technological developments and on speedier, more efficient processing through traditional postal and telephone systems means that we must invest significantly on updating mail handling and telecommunication systems.  The plan includes a proposed development of four modern mail centres in Dublin.  Improved <Col N="1415" /> services and reduced costs will result from the overall investment of £169 million in the sub-region on post and telecommunications.</P>
    <P>Dublin as a tourist destination is currently under-exploited.  Its location has unrivalled natural advantages in its proximity to both Dublin Bay and the mountains, its access to the Liffey and two canals, and its parks, particularly the Phoenix Park which is the largest urban park in the European Community.  These are matched by its rich cultural and historical heritage.  The plan envisages expenditure of over £60 million on measures which will improve the attractiveness of Dublin for visitor and resident alike.  Dublin's Millennium last year showed what could be done with a combination of public sector, local community and individual initiative and gave a great boost to tourist numbers.  The plan will build on and develop this further.</P>
    <P>While Dublin's agricultural employment is tiny, the north County Dublin area is one of Ireland's three premier horticultural areas.  The plan envisages development of an industry capable of competing at home and abroad on a commercially viable footing.  A sound basis already exists for this development.  The plan also envisages increased emphasis on forestry and fishing development. Total expenditure in all these areas is planned to reach £16 million for the sub-region. Dublin will, of course, have a substantial share in other national investments. National developmental measures for energy supplies and cost reductions will total £478 million, of which £134 million will be spent in the Dublin sub-region.</P>
    <P>National investment in sanitary and local services, designated both to cope with economic and population growth and to achieve adequate standards of environmental protection, will total £316 million, of which Dublin's share will reach £54 million.  In particular, measures will be designed to cope with major deficiencies in waste disposal in the <Col N="1416" /> Dublin region, in Dublin Bay and in landfill sites.</P>
    <P>Of particular interest to me as Minister for Labour is the development of our labour force.  Here, because of my responsibilities in relation to the European Social Fund and for the operations of FÁS and CERT, the Manpower agencies, I would like to broaden the debate to include both proposed investment in Dublin and relevant aspects of the national programme.</P>
    <P>In the Dublin sub-region, planned investment in education, training and employment measures, including the vocational education infrastructure, is envisaged at a total of £602 million, the second largest area of expenditure.  From the education sector's viewpoint, I understand from my colleague, Deputy Mary O'Rourke, that her major priorities include the re-equipping and upgrading of facilities at the third level institutions and the provision of a regional technical college in Tallaght, as I said, now the third largest urban centre in the country.  These and other measures will provide the necessary infrastructure to cater for today's increasingly complex demands on the education system.</P>
    <P>As a major development under the plan, I am arranging to provide for a single training outlet in Dublin where CERT activity will be centralised.  This will improve the access possibilities for trainees, allow for a 10 per cent increase in throughput and facilitate greater organisational efficiency and impact.</P>
    <P>Turning now to the overall aspects of training and employment programmes in Ireland, as the Taoiseach said yesterday, we are recognised as very successful in making efficient use of European Social Fund assistance.  Its role in the development of the vocational training infrastructure and of individual programmes has been vital.  Since Ireland joined the European Community in 1973, we have been approved for aid in excess of £1,437 million from the ESF and have, to date, actually received £1,031 million. Last week, I received official notification from Brussels that Ireland's ESF allocation for this year would be over £183 <Col N="1417" /> million.  When the new regulations for the ESF, and the higher rates of assistance, come into operation on 1 January next year, I am confident that the level of assistance from the Social Fund will further increase, in line with the contents of the national plan and of separate plans soon to be submitted to Brussels and designed to help the long-term unemployed and facilitate the integration of young persons into the labour market.</P>
    <P>There have been significant improvements in the Irish workforce since these moneys became available to us in 1973, despite major problems of structural adjustment, changing patterns of demand and production methods and the movement from a mainly agricultural structure to an industrial and service based economy.  Our highly qualified workforce contributes to domestic expansion and attracts from abroad industries which today employ somewhere in the region of 80,000 workers in good quality jobs.</P>
    <P>Despite these improvements, weaknesses and problems still remain compared to the countries with which we now seek to compete.  These weaknesses are most graphically illustrated by the high level of unemployment and our lower productivity levels compared to other EC countries.  Our unemployment rate is the second highest in the Community and 7.3 per cent above the EC average.  Our labour productivity is about three quarters of the EC average.  Our relative under-achievement, judged on these two measures, is attributable to a number of complex factors &mdash; some relating to the labour force, some not.</P>
    <P>We continue to experience a relatively high inflow of young people into our labour market.  The labour force is projected to increase under all the migration assumptions prepared by the Central Statistics Office.  For the foreseeable future, there will be somewhere in the region of 70,000 young people leaving the educational system each year.  They will require training and education in order to make the transition from school to work.</P>
    <P>Irish companies provide relatively little <Col N="1418" /> training and development for their employees.  Data available from the 1985 Labour Force Survey indicate that only 6.5 per cent of all employees in the four weeks prior to interview had received some education or training.  The corresponding figure for Britain is 10.4 per cent.  This shows a relatively low level of training by Irish firms, well below the major economies.  The Cecchini report indicated that most small companies in particular lack the necessary resources to acquire the skills and qualifications that will be needed in the Single Market. Nearly 90 per cent of Irish industrial firms employ fewer than 50 people and fewer than 0.5 per cent of firms employ more than 500 people.</P>
    <P>I do not want to present too pessimistic a picture of our workforce.  I believe, however, that it is necessary to be realistic about where we stand &mdash; our strengths, weaknesses, problems and, particularly, opportunities.  Our situation on the geographical periphery of the Community will always involve costs for ourselves above those of other Community countries.  This places a greater need on us to develop those areas and key sectors where we could have a comparative advantage and develop those resources which would contribute to this process.  Our workforce is such a resource.  This is the type of thinking behind our application for ESF assistance under Objective 1 &mdash; promoting the development of regions whose development is lagging behind the generality of Community regions.</P>
    <P>Our request for assistance under Objective 1 falls under three broad headings: training; aids to recruitment by new and expanding enterprises; and expenditure on temporary employment schemes for unemployed people.  These activities are designed to ensure that our workforce and our enterprises have the skills required for competition and growth in the wider Single Market.  At the same time, our expenditure plans have regard to the need for a social dimension in Ireland's approach to 1992, just as such a dimension is being promoted at Community level.  There is provision, for <Col N="1419" /> example, for disadvantaged groups &mdash; both in access to our mainstream training activities and in the more targeted provision of temporary employment opportunities.</P>
    <P>With regard to vocational training the programmes involved will be delivered by a range of agencies, including FÁS, the Department of Education, CERT and Teagasc.  They are designed to provide trainees with sector specific skills in some cases, and in other cases with more broadly applicable skills, in areas such as marketing, computing, finance and engineering, which are vital to the development of the economy generally.</P>
    <P>Major features of the proposals include, first, a substantial increase in the level of vocational training to be assisted in the upper levels of the education system, with average trainee numbers rising from under 40,000 this year to nearly 60,000 in 1993.  This expansion will concentrate largely on higher technological skills required for future industrial competitiveness, secondly, a special FÁS training programme for employees of small and medium enterprises facing external competition, thirdly, a significant growth in the activities of CERT in support of the tourism industry and of Teagasc in training for new farm enterprises; and, fourthly, increased training for the short-term unemployed over 25 years of age.  ESF assistance in recent years has been negligible under this heading because this category has not figured in the priority operations of the fund.</P>
    <P>Total expenditure over the five years on vocational training under Objective 1 will come to £1,360 million, with average trainee numbers rising from 54,000 in 1989 to 80,000 in 1993.  The full national expenditure on education, training and employment programmes then will be £1,905 million.</P>
    <P>An industrial restructuring programme is being established to counter the low levels of firm based training I mentioned earlier.  Our firms are going to have to undertake major programmes of product development, quality improvement, marketing and processing efficiency. <Col N="1420" /> These changes will often require new equipment and technology.  They will also require new skills in firms &mdash; with a need for training and retraining of existing employees.  The restructuring programme will provide advice and financial support for such training.  The budget for this new activity in FÁS is set, provisionally, at some £6 million per annum, and it is expected to provide short duration training for some 14,000 workers each year.</P>
    <P>FÁS's training for the unemployed will also see some expansion &mdash; most notably in the area of specific sectoral skills, where activity is set to increase by 20 per cent between now and 1993.  As in the case of support for in-company training, the thrust here will be increasingly towards skills demanded as a result of heightened competition.  We will also be able to offer more assistance to those over 25 years old who have not yet become long-term unemployed.</P>
    <P>The heading &ldquo;Aids to Recruitment in Industry&rdquo;, includes those parts of the operational programme for industry described in the development plan and the operational programme for industrial development, for which support is being sought under the Regional Fund.  These include training grants, recruitment and management grants.  The heading also includes enterprise programmes, administered by FÁS, which support the recruitment of unemployed people by expanding small firms, and the establishment of small enterprises by the unemployed themselves and their communities. These latter supports include pre-business start-up training as well as financial supports during the early period of trading.  This category of aid represents an acknowledgement of the potential of locally-based indigenous ventures to employment throughout the country. Total expenditure under this broad heading is scheduled to amount to a total of £260 million over the period.</P>
    <P>The temporary employment element included in our Objective 1 submission is basically the social employment scheme, aimed at the long-term unemployed. <Col N="1421" /> While the primary objective of the programme is the re-integration of long-term unemployed persons into the workforce, it does so through their employment on works of benefit to their community. Many of these projects are designed to enhance the environment and/or to contribute to tourism infrastructure.  I am satisfied that this type of programme has made a significant contribution both to the job prospects of the long-term unemployed and to the community.  Total expenditure on temporary employment programmes over the five years will reach £285 million.</P>
    <P>The development of tourism has been highlighted in the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> This sector is highly labour-intensive and employment in it is projected to increase by 25,000 over the plan period.  The activities of CERT, which has responsibility for the hotel and catering area, will assist the realisation of set job-targets through the provision of suitably trained personnel.  Graduates from CERT courses will increase from a total of over 7,000 in 1988 to more than 12,000 by 1993.  The range of courses to be provided will range from the short-term introductory modules to comprehensive craft and management training programmes.</P>
    <P>A high calibre workforce in the hotel, catering and tourism sector is essential. Success in gaining an image for efficient work practices, good hygiene standards and well-prepared and presented cuisine is vital to advancing the potential contribution of tourism.  CERT plan to increase their training provision with a simultaneous increase in the quality of that training, which is already very high. In that way the trainees who graduate from courses will continue to find quick access to secure employment.  Employers for their part have an obligation to ensure that the working conditions in the industry are also improved so that the attractiveness and image of working there is enhanced.</P>
    <P>This, then, is a brief outline of the proposals which we have included in the <i>National Development Plan</i> for vocational training and other labour <Col N="1422" /> market measures under Objective 1.  I am pleased to say that discussions between Commission officials and officials of my Department on these proposals have already commenced.</P>
    <P>I want to underline one issue which is of central importance in the context of our application for support for training activities.  Renewed emphasis is now being placed on the quality of training and its impact in fitting trainees for access to worthwhile occupations.  This reality must be fully understood and taken account of by all training providers in receipt of Structural Fund support.  A new concentration is necessary in the setting of realistic objectives for training programmes which are in accord with the manpower needs of the labour market.</P>
    <P>We will also be submitting soon to the Commission plans for assistance under Objective 3, dealing with the combating of long-term unemployment, and Objective 4, dealing with the vocational integration of young people.  We are at an advanced stage in the preparation of these plans.  They do not have to be with the Commission until the latter part of June, but it is my intention to submit them considerably sooner.</P>
    <P>While the human resource developments form a significant part of the over-all <i>National Development Plan</i> they are only a part.  Our training, education and employment programmes are linked to and supportive of the other development initiatives in the areas of industry, infrastructure, tourism and rural development.</P>
    <P>Returning in particular to the Dublin sub-region, I am convinced that the plan meets the genuine needs of the area. Its overall objectives are to promote the economic and social development of Dublin city and county in a balanced way. The aim is to increase economic growth and increase employment levels.  It will improve Dublin's industrial competitiveness and promote expansion of its productive capacity.  Aiming at balance, we have been fully conscious of the need to target assistance on areas of particular need of deprivation.  The plan is of course geared specifically to measures eligible <Col N="1423" /> for Structural Fund support and consequently cannot be criticised for not including measures outside this category. It represents a comprehensive statement of the measures to be taken by the Government in partnership with the private sector and the European Community. I know that the total expenditure of £2,229 million envisaged in Dublin will transform our capital city.</P>
    <P>Taken together, the measures in the plan will give a major direct and indirect impetus to investment in Ireland.  They will greatly increase potential output in the economy, not least by increasing skill levels.  And they will create jobs directly, through the investment programmes proposed, and indirectly by increasing the economy's capacity for job creation.</P>
    <P>Our aim in the short-term is to increase the annual rate of job creation from the present level of 29,000 to at least 35,000. I am confident that this can be achieved and that we can begin to build more rapidly on the foundations laid over the last year, when employment began to increase after six years of decline.  Progress along these lines is essential to our efforts to reduce both unemployment and emigration.  This plan, therefore, requires and deserves the country's support and we look forward to its implementation within the next three or four years.</P>

      <P>Go raibh maith agat, a Chathaoirligh.  I join with other speakers in congratulating you on your new post.  I am sure it is a lot easier than some of the other jobs you have.  I will not create any difficulties for you today.</P>
      <P>I propose to read into the record the wording of our amendment, which is as follows:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;expresses total dissatisfaction with the Government's National Development Plan, calls on the Government to <Col N="1424" /> submit a supplementary plan to the EC Commission, seeking adequate funding for industrial development which is so essential for job creation, housing and public transport; Dáil Éireann further deplores the failure of the Government to allow any democratic or community input into its contents and the decision not to submit regional plans to the Commission.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In referring to that amendment, I would urge the other Opposition parties and Deputies to support it.  It is an amendment which will not in any way interfere with the plan already submitted, but it does call on the Government to submit additional proposals which would make the plan far more realistic and effective in terms of our economy in preparation for 1992 and afterwards.  It is important to recognise that 1992 is neither the beginning nor the end of the world.  Life will go on after that.  Whatever is being done now will obviously have a bearing on the shape of things to come and work will continue to be needed even after 1992.</P>
    <P>The National Development Plan published by the Government is rich in words and lavish in design, but it is short on imagination and virtually devoid of vision.  This plan is potentially the most important development plan produced in recent decades.  Its success or failure will determine how this country will fare in the very different conditions we will face in the aftermath of 1992.  It will determine whether we are to grow and develop and hopefully approach the living standards found in other parts of the EC, or whether we will continue to wallow as the poor relation of the Community with some of the lowest living standards and highest unemployment in the Community. As a response to this challenge the Government's plan is a dismal failure, and is totally incapable of producing the sort of development necessary to take advantage of the 1992 process.</P>
    <P>The plan fails at almost every hurdle. The balance between funds going to infrastructure on the one hand and industrial development on the other is wrong. <Col N="1425" /> The reliance to such an extent on private investment places a major question over the feasibility of many of the proposals. The emphasis on privately funded roads rather than public transport seems designed only to put more money in the pockets of Fianna Fáil builder friends. The omission of housing is a major opportunity lost to improve the living conditions of many of our people.  The failure to provide any democratic procedures either to prepare these plans or to supervise the disbursement of the funds is ominous.  In fact this plan is so flawed that the Commission will probably be doing the Irish people a favour if they insist that the Government redraft it.</P>
    <P>The most urgent social problem facing this country is unemployment.  Many of our other problems, like poverty and emigration, flow to a greater or lesser extent from unemployment.  Given the extent of that problem and the fact that it has been so high for so long &mdash; the last time unemployment was below 200,000 was in November 1983 and shows no sign of diminishing, it is incomprehensible that more emphasis has not been put on creating lasting, sustainable jobs.  The Government hope that the plan would create an additional 20,000 new manufacturing jobs over the next four years, but this would account only for eight months emigration at our present rate.</P>
    <P>Infrastructural projects do, of course, develop the country's economic potential for investment, and provide short term employment and permanent facilities. But with 600 people a week emigrating, the number one priority is not infrastructural development but industrial development which will give permanent, sustainable, productive jobs.  Real productivity must be raised.  A shift from mainly training and infrastructural supports must be made to direct investment of Community funds in industrial and productive projects.  At least 60 per cent funds from the Community should be put into direct support for industry, with the semi-State companies receiving a substantial portion of this.</P>
    <P>As far as industrial development is concerned, there is no indication that the <Col N="1426" /> Government have learned anything, and continue to rely almost totally on private enterprise for industrial job creation.  The plan does acknowledge on page 17 that modern industrial firms in this country are foreign owned, that the traditional Irish sector is composed of firms, 90 per cent of which employ fewer than 50 workers, and that their performance has been so poor that they have lost even the domestic market.  Irish private enterprise has in recent years shown itself far more interested in investing outside the country.  How then, could anyone have confidence in a plan that relies to such an extent for job creation on the same private sector?</P>
    <P>In addition, there is no guarantee that the EC Commission will match private investment with the same level of funding it has pledged for public spending.  Thus, there is a double jeopardy in the Government's reliance on private investment. The private investment may not materialise and if it does it is likely to result in reduced EC funding.</P>
    <P>The Workers' Party are opposed to granting Community funds, or indeed Irish public funds, to build toll roads and toll bridges as such projects can only increase transportation costs for Irish exports and prove a burden on Irish travellers and tourists.  The Workers' Party of course support improvements to the Irish road system where economically necessary and environmentally and socially acceptable.  However, the emphasis in the plan on roads and private transport is misdirected.  This shortsighted attitude is illustrated by the failure to apply for funding for the badly needed extension of DART in Dublin.  This is a direct snub to those living in the suburban housing estates of the capital who so badly need such a system.  It indicates that Government support for public transport will decline and that we are going to see more and more privately owned toll roads and bridges.</P>
    <P>Dublin has special needs and is entitled to special consideration in relation to any development plan and in any application for EC funding, not because it is our capital city, but because it is the home of <Col N="1427" /> about one third of our population.  It is an indication of its low priority in the eyes of this Government that five pages out of a 123 page document are devoted to its special problems.  It is shameful that the regional plan for Dublin &mdash; and indeed the other regional plans &mdash; will not be even sent to the Commission.  The consultants' report for Dublin, produced at considerable public expense, has not even been published.  In fact my information suggests that the consultants' plan for Dublin has not been accepted by the Government and has been sent back for redrafting because it did not have sufficient emphasis on privately build roads and bridges.  The only ones to benefit from this nonsense are the consultants who now have fat fees in their bank accounts.</P>
    <P>The way in which EC funding is spent can have a crucial impact on the future direction of the city.  The Workers' Party want a revitalised Dublin, a city once again in the hands of its people, dynamic and alive, a city of equality and justice, a city which is a good place to be in, in which the inner city is buzzing with human activity and the outer suburbs fully integrated into the overall urban structure and provided with all the amenities of a modern living environment.  We want a Dublin that is back at work with education, skills and hope for all its children, a city where it's safe to work and play.</P>
    <P>The Workers' Party have produced our urban renewal plan for Dublin which would radically change the face of the city, creating a capital city in which people would come before the interests of the motor car, the land speculator and the slum landlord.  Other community and interest groups have also put forward their plans for Dublin.  In fact, Dublin is buzzing with ideas.  Dublin people love their city.  They hate what has happened in it and they want to see a change of direction.  This is reflected in the wealth of imaginative plans and programmes produced for the development of the city, but those who have put so much effort and work into producing their plans have <Col N="1428" /> been snubbed in a contemptible way by Fianna Fáil.  They have been denied a say in the National Development Plan's application to Dublin.  Given that there are such ideas and such enthusiasm, why could the Government not have established a forum where all those interested in the future of their city could have had their say and an influence on the drawing up of this plan?</P>
    <P>The regeneration of Dublin depends on re-establishing its vitality as a working and a living city with strong worldwide exporting and trading links in economic and physical planning terms.  This means restoring Dublin's essential relationship with its port.  Here I would like to say how much I welcome the proposals from the Dublin Port and Docks Board of which our esteemed Cathaoirleach is also chairman.  The opposition being mounted against that plan is misdirected.  We must have a vibrant port if we are to have a vibrant living city.  While I agree fully that there has to be proper environmental concern about our port and our bay, for us to reach a position where it is not possible for us to have industry located in our port would, in the long run, be the death knell of this city.</P>
    <P>We must create an integrated urban area out of the hotch potch of dislocated development that is now under the planning jurisdiction of Dublin Corporation, Dublin County Council and Dun Laoghaire Borough Council.  Most of all, people must be mobilised directly under a democratic planning system which would involve them in the planning process of their own local communities and of the wider area of Dublin city.</P>
    <P>There is a whole range of proposals in our own plan, which I do not propose to go into here today, including ideas for pedestrianisation, the creation of squares in the city, the restoration of the Liffey as a central part of the city by widening footpaths along the river banks, narrowing the carriageway there and restricting traffic along the Liffey.</P>
    <P>This is something which strikes me quite often when I try to walk along the Liffey.  One is virtually blown off the footpath by articulated trucks trundling <Col N="1429" /> past and one gets one's lungs full of diesel fumes whether one is trying to get from O'Connell Bridge to Heuston Station or <i>vice versa,</i> which I often have to do.  One simply cannot walk along the Liffey wall because it is a danger.  Apart from that, in all my years I have not seen a woman or a man try to walk by the wall of the Liffey with a pram.  It is absolutely impossible.  Unless we reach a position where we can enjoy the Liffey, one of our most prominent features which could be a major asset to the citizens of Dublin and the tourists who come here in large numbers &mdash; and hopefully will come in even greater numbers &mdash; and unless we re-establish the Liffey as a focal point for the city we will be neglecting a major resource.  I must say strongly that attempts to develop tangent ring roads and links through our city will be a disaster, and I would urge those who are proposing and supporting them to drop that idea and to allow a living city to develop.</P>
    <P>I would also like to draw attention to the fact that the national plan has suffered greatly from the refusal of the Government to allow any democratic or community control into the input of this plan.  It is ominous that, despite the public outcry over this, no provision has been made for any democratic structure for supervising the disbursal of the fund. Unless there is democratic accountability through an Oireachtas committee, through a national programme of development group and a series of regional development boards, then there is every prospect of a repeat of the national lottery scandal with money being used and abused as political slush funds.</P>
    <P>In a submission which The Workers' Party made to the Minister for Finance, and sent also to the Commission in Brussels, we made three specific proposals. We made the point that an Oireachtas committee comprising representatives of all political parties be set up to oversee the use of the funds and the later general EC matters relating to Ireland.  Such a body would have to have a wider function than the present committee on secondary legislation.  We also proposed that a <Col N="1430" /> national programme of development group be established comprising the national Government and representatives of various national, economic and social groups, including the Congress of Trade Unions, to plan and oversee the use of the funds on programmes at a national level.  Most importantly, we proposed that regional development boards which would comprise governmental, European Community, local authority, council and managerial representatives, trade unions, local bodies and local community groups, would make submissions and plans directly to the European Community on regional development programmes within the national guidelines laid down by the Oireachtas committee. These boards would also have an implemental power over the use of funds allocated to them.</P>
    <P>Unless that kind of approach is adopted, we are flying in the face of how the European Community wants these funds to be spent and how the plans for spending those funds are evolved.  It seems that the Government are more intent on producing plans which will, in the first place, relieve the Exchequer of having to pay out capital sums for development and at the same time assist private enterprise in a way which will not produce long term productive jobs.  That is an abdication of responsibility by this Government and will be opposed at every opportunity by The Workers' Party.</P>

      <P>
        <i>The National Development Plan</i> has been prepared in the knowledge that the years immediately ahead will be decisive for Ireland's economic future.  As the European Community moves towards the completion of the single internal market, Ireland has to remedy many disadvantages associated with our peripheral location and other structural characteristics.  At the same time, we have to strengthen the competitiveness of our economy and further develop the key sectors.</P>
      <P>Before discussing the sectors for which I have responsibility, I would like to refer to the special mechanism for consultations at sub-regional level which was established by the Government as part of the process of drawing up <i>The National Development Plan.</i> While the territorial basis of the plan is Ireland &mdash; by definition from Europe &mdash; in accordance with EC regulations, the Government carried out an extensive consultation process, at both national and sub-regional level, in preparing both the plan and the programmes to implement it.  For the purpose of this consultation the country was divided into seven sub-regions.  The consultation involved the main bodies concerned with development, the local authorities, State agencies and Government Departments operating through working and advisory groups in each sub-region.  These groups received submissions from other bodies and private individuals and took them into account in their deliberations.  I know that for a fact in my own sub-region. I would like to commend these groups for their excellent work.  That work has provided a valuable input into the formulation of the plan and programmes and will be an important factor in the detailed implementation of the programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to point out to the House <Col N="1432" /> that this is the first time &mdash; I emphasise the first time &mdash; that an Irish National Development Plan has contained such sub-regional planning.  At local level, there are long standing operational administrative arrangements whereby such sub-regional expenditures are the subject of co-ordination on an on-going basis between the various agencies involved, such as the local authorities, the Industrial Development Authority, FÁS, the regional tourism organisations, etc.  This system of co-ordination and integration at sub-regional level is efficient, cost-effective and practical and will continue to apply to the expenditure and programmes under the plan.</P>
    <P>The plan will be implemented through a series of operational programmes.  Nine programme headings have been agreed with the European Commission.  Tourism and transport, the sectors for which I have responsibility, are included among the agreed headings.  These two sectors have a crucial role to play in strengthening the productive capacity of the economy. Because of the sheer size and scale of these sectors, their pervasive nature and their importance to the national economy, tourism and transport are key sectors for the attainment of the single market objectives.</P>
    <P>The development of the Irish tourism sector, having regard to its labour-intensive and its scattered nature throughout the Community, even ins na háiteanna is iargúlta, is central to the Government's medium-term strategy in relation to employment.  The national plan recognises that a more developed tourism industry can help to strengthen the productive capacity of the economy.  For this reason, tourism has been chosen as a major axis for development in Ireland over the period of the plan.</P>
    <P>Ireland has considerable assets which can be effectively marketed to international tourists &mdash; a rich cultural heritage, a tradition for friendliness and hospitality, a relatively unspoilt environment and a folk tradition which is still reflected in a vibrant performing arts sector.  The primary objectives of tourism policy are to exploit these advantages, <Col N="1433" /> to expand the capacity of the sector, to strengthen its competitiveness and to market it more effectively abroad.  Our operational programme for tourism will contain specific measures to achieve these objectives.</P>
    <P>Statements have been made from the Opposition benches that it would have been profitable had the Members of the House had a chance of debating this plan before it was finalised.  Judging by the contributions from Deputy Dukes and Deputy O'Malley yesterday with regard to tourism, I have grave doubts about whether that is so.  In his contribution to the debate on the National Development Plan yesterday, Deputy Dukes asked when niche marketing would start so that we can benefit from it.  I have good news for him.  It started almost two years ago in earnest.  Deputy Dukes said he had not noticed it in any of the magazines he read.  I have got more news for him.  He is reading the wrong magazines.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I should explain for his benefit that the whole point of niche marketing is to match the particular product with an identified target market.  Advertising in magazines is but one of the methods used to promote holidays.  It is an extremely expensive method and the magazines in which particular niches are advertised are carefully chosen to ensure that the appropriate target market is reached, thus ensuring the optimum return on expenditure.</P>
    <P>I brought into the House some of the Bord Fáilte publications for niche markets. I am sure Bord Fáilte would help to educate Deputy Dukes if he called in to them.  The publications include, <i>Historic Houses, Castles and Gardens, Walking Around Ireland &mdash; Only The Best, Cruising in Ireland, Cycling in Ireland, Golfing in Ireland, Angling in Ireland, Equestrian Ireland,</i> publications dealing with coarse fishing and game fishing in Ireland, <i>Sailing in Ireland</i> and <i>Ireland's Heritage.</i></P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there anything about rod fishing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>There are about ten or 12 niche booklets which have been <Col N="1434" /> beautifully produced.  They are a credit to Bord Fáilte and it is a pity that Deputy Dukes, as Leader of Fine Gael, would not expand his range of reading to include them.</P>
      <P>If Deputy Dukes were to read any English angling magazine he would see Irish holidays featured regularly.  The February-March 1989 edition of <i>France Golf,</i> the most widely distributed golf magazine in Europe, contained a ten page feature on Irish golf.  Bord Fáilte, in association with Carrolls, were the only non-American delegation present at the recent convention of the Association of American Golf Writers in South Carolina. As a result of this, eight American journalists will travel to Ireland this year and will feature Irish golf holidays in their magazines.  Last Sunday's <i>The Observer</i> newspaper contained a very complimentary feature on a new Bord Fáilte brochure for garden enthusiasts.  I have just given the House the benefit of a look at its cover and I advise all good Christians to read it fully.</P>
      <P>These are just some examples of the type of newspaper and magazine publicity best suited to niche marketing.</P>
      <P>As I mentioned, this is just one of the methods used to promote niche holidays. Bord Fáilte also promote extensively through tour operators.  In addition Bord Fáilte are active on many other fronts. For example, last June they held a special interest marketplace to which they brought 110 foreign tour operators, 50 of whom had not featured Ireland previously. All were specialists in different product niches and all now incorporate Ireland in their programmes.  Bord Fáilte will be repeating this exercise on 30 June next.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley's contribution made me doubt what the benefit would be if we had had a debate about the <i>National Development Plan</i> before it was sent to Brussels.  His comments on tourism were shallow and simplistic.  He mentioned statistics, citing an ephemeral report about a footballer who came several times to Ireland and was, according to him, counted among the statistics.  I wonder <Col N="1435" /> how he would cater for the 240,000 visitors from France and Germany last year. Were they all to play for Garryowen, Ahane or some of the Limerick teams? If they were, we should promote that game to bring in more tourists.  Deputy O'Malley appeared to be labouring under some major misconceptions yesterday, again due to his shallow approach and lack of study of the plan.  He was under a misconception in particular about the role private investment would play in overall tourism investment over the period from this year to 1993.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley erroneously equates the figure of £130 million, which is the projected net contribution of the private sector to eligible projects under the plan, to total private investment in tourism plant over the next five years.  A very simple lesson in logic would have saved him that mistake.  What the Deputy said was totally incorrect.  I am sure Deputy O'Malley would neither expect nor support the idea that all private investment in tourism plant over the period should be put forward to qualify for regional development fund assistance.  We have been quite selective in what we propose to put forward, taking into account the views of the Commission and the sub-regions. The objective of the plan is clearly to increase tourist traffic and revenue to this country over the next five years.</P>
    <P>As indicated in Chapter 3, paragraph 3.1.12 of the plan, qualifying investment will be concentrated on the provision of all-weather facilities, mainly in the sporting and cultural areas, and other tourist attractions which maximise the tourism potential offered by the country's natural and cultural environment.  I have spent sufficient time trying to educate Deputies Dukes and O'Malley and I will continue with my contribution on the plan in general.</P>
    <P>The cornerstone of the tourism development strategy over the next five years will be major capital investment in the Irish tourism product, backed up by a new, specially designed marketing scheme to capitalise on the new amenities <Col N="1436" /> provided as a result of this investment. We have been heavily into the marketing area already, as the House will be aware. The House also is aware that we have provided extra money for that.  Because of the constraints which budgetary imbalances impose on the Government's ability to finance this investment, policy will be primarily directed towards supplanting Government expenditure by private sector investment in the provision of the necessary amenities.</P>
    <P>I should like to emphasise that our tourism strategy was prepared after detailed consideration of the excellent analysis and recommendations on the strength, weakness and potential of tourism in each of the seven sub-regions.  Our plan is built on these foundations.  I should like to illustrate this by reference to my own region, the North-West.  This sub-region, which comprises counties Monaghan, Cavan, Leitrim, Sligo and Donegal, is regarded by many as peripheral, not only within the EC but also within Ireland itself.  Tourism is already reasonably well established in the sub-region but the full potential is far from being reached.  Furthermore, for many areas within the sub-region tourism offers the best possibility for economic development and employment creation.  The analysis prepared by the working and advisory groups for the region identified a number of deficiencies and also its strengths.</P>
    <P>Among the main weaknesses are distance from ferry ports and inadequate internal transport links from major access points.  The north-west sub-region also has image problems because of the Northern Ireland troubles, and also suffers from pollution problems in some small inland fisheries.</P>
    <P>On the positive side, the north-west sub-region has a physical environment which is its greatest asset, boasting a variety of scenery, including mountains, hills, extensive network of lakes and rivers, extensive coastline sprinkled with a range of high quality sandy beaches and coves; woodlands and forest parks; boglands and pasture.  The sub-region also has an extensive accommodation <Col N="1437" /> base, concentrated in most instances in a number of resorts serving the domestic market for seaside holidays.  The strong links with the Gaelic and Celtic heritage, including close association with Yeats, the poet, the availability of an internationally renowned coarse angling product, and developing questrian and cruising products are very positive features.</P>
    <P>The North-West sub-region has not been without success in attracting tourists. Some 272,000 overseas visitors, visited the sub-region in 1987; by 1992 it is intended to bring this figure up to 588,000, giving rise to an estimated 2,000 additional jobs.  The principal strategy is to develop products based on the subregion's natural, cultural and heritage attractions.  The quality and range of the tourist product will require to be improved with particular reference to amenities and activities, and taking account of the need for all-weather and resort complex facilities.</P>
    <P>I should like to emphasise that our plans for tourism development in the North-West are but a part, albeit a very important one, of a fully integrated strategy for the full economic development of the region.  On foot of the work of the working and advisory groups in the North-West region, this strategy is designed to achieve the creation of viable, sustainable employment in all sectors of its economy so as to reduce unemployment, retain population and raise <i>per capita</i> income, while protecting and improving the environment.</P>
    <P>An essential prerequisite for measures to achieve this aim is the provision of an adequate infrastructure.  We will concentrate on four key strands of infrastructure: (a) access roads to the sub-region and roads within the sub-region will be improved.  This will involve the improvement of national, regional and county roads and I have no doubt that this will receive the full treatment from the Minister for the Environment; (b) water supplies and waste and sewage disposal facilities will be improved to enable the region to attract more industry <Col N="1438" /> and tourism and to ensure its environment is protected and enhanced; (c) there will be further development of regional airports to facilitate tourism growth and other economic activity and (d) advanced telecommunications services to and within the sub-region will be introduced.</P>
    <P>These are not just pious aspirations. They are backed up by hard cash of well over £1 billion comprising £428 million for agriculture and rural development, including forestry and fishery harbours; £295 million for industry; £182 million for education, training and employment; £89 million for roads; £36 million for sanitary services; £33 million for tourism; £26 million for telecommunications; and £23 million for energy.  This billion pounds boost is a clear and practical illustration of the Government's commitment to develop all regions of the country to their full potential.</P>
    <P>
      <i>The National Development Plan</i> is particularly concerned to improve cross Border co-operation.  The north-west sub-region, which shares a land frontier of some 300 kilometres with Northern Ireland, is well placed for the further development of economic and social co-operation with Northern Ireland.  In this context I would like to draw the attention of the House to a major cross-Border project &mdash; the restoration of the Ballinamore/Ballyconnell Canal linking the North's main inland waterway, the Erne system, with that of the South, the River Shannon &mdash; which is the subject of a feasibility study at present.  If those two great waterways were linked up &mdash; of course there was also the link to the Grand Canal system to be taken into account which, in turn, links into the Barrow &mdash; we would have a waterways system which touches every one of the sub-regions into which the country has been divided for the purposes of this plan, with the exception of the Cork/Kerry sub-region.</P>
    <P>The plan gives a specific commitment that, subject to the outcome of the study, this project will be included in the operational programme for tourism.  In fact, it is included in the operational programme <Col N="1439" /> for tourism.  We wait the results of the feasibility study.  I am quite confident that there will be a considerable boost to tourism in both parts of the island with the proposed linking of the Shannon and Erne water systems by the re-opening of the Ballinamore/Ballyconnell Canal.</P>
    <P>At this stage I would like to refer to the transport proposals in the plan.  It is clear that Ireland suffers from major cost disadvantages <i>vis-à-vis</i> other EC countries due to its peripheral and island location with a consequent heavier reliance on air and sea access transport services and the generally poor quality of its internal transport network.  The most significant reason for the high Irish transport costs &mdash; reckoned to be twice those of our competitors on mainland Europe &mdash; is the deficient state of the national roads and the access roads to the principal ports and airports.</P>
    <P>Government policy, as outlined in the plan for the transport sector over the next five years, is to develop an adequate internal transport structure which is fully integrated with improved access transport services.  To this end there are specific proposals for four main areas of investment in the plan.  These are: rail and bus transport, access transport, sea ports and airports.  I will refer to these areas in turn.</P>
    <P>As regards rail and bus transport, it is proposed to develop the mainline rail network through improvements in existing stations, expenditure on the network to facilitate more container traffic and renewal and completion of the rail signalling programme.  Plans have been prepared for the introduction of new diesel commuter services on existing rail lines in Dublin.  It is also proposed to invest in the introduction of improved local and provincial bus services.</P>
    <P>Turning to access transport, major investments in specially dedicated sea and air access services are essential for the future development of the Irish economy in the context of the completion of <Col N="1440" /> the internal market.  In mainland European terms, these developments are equivalent in nature to investment in cross-Border road and rail links to other member states.</P>
    <P>The plan proposes a total investment of £200 million for specially dedicated sea and air shuttle services.  The main policy priority will be to improve transit times and reduce access costs to Europe.  On the sea front, the development of fast sea freight shuttle services directly to Europe using Rosslare Harbour as its hub and/or via the British land bridge link using Dublin Port are a priority.  These must be complemented by the development of viable air channels between Ireland and continental Europe if we are to benefit from the completion of the internal market in Europe.  The development of these necessary sea and air freight facilities is an essential prerequisite for the Irish economy to maximise the export growth which must underpin sustainable economic growth and job creation.  We are currently arranging, in conjunction with the European Commission, feasibility studies to determine the optimal organisational and commercial structures for such sea and air freight services with particular reference to their commercial viability.</P>
    <P>In the case of seaports, proposals have been prepared by the Government for the development of the main Irish commercial ports.  Expenditure will be concentrated particularly on Dublin, Rosslare, Waterford and Cork ports.  The estimated total cost of the proposed investments in commercial ports will be about £72 million over the period of the plan.</P>
    <P>As regards airports, existing capacity is being strained because of a dramatic increase in travel to and from Britain and mainland Europe on foot of radical Government initiatives in relation to access air fares into Ireland.  As a result of the increase in traffic numbers there is now an urgent need for an accelerated capital investment programme at the State airports.  Total investment in State airports over the period 1989-1993 will be £115 million.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1441" /> Because of initiatives taken by this Government airport investment also has a very important regional dimension.  The large volume of traffic using these airports is a clear vindication of our bold policy initiatives in this area.  Further improvements in regional airports are now both warranted and essential if rural areas of the country are to be linked satisfactorily and efficiently with both Dublin and the rest of Europe.  The plan provides £5 million for investment in these airports over the next two years.</P>
    <P>While discussing the regional importance of airports I would like to specifically refer to the transport structure and needs of the north-west region.  Its transport structure has many of the characteristics of the national structure: there are some strong transport links but also some weak ones.  There are serious deficiencies in the road network in the north-west sub-region. There are 717 kilometres of national roads and much of this is substandard. There are 15,918 kilometres of regional and county roads and most of them have deteriorated in recent years due to lack of funds for maintenance. Rail services to the sub-region are fairly minimal with only the Dublin-Sligo link which serves a small part of the sub-region only.  The most important part in the sub-region, Sligo, has suffered siltation over recent years with a consequent decline due to limitations on ship size and cargo tonnage.</P>
    <P>However, thanks to initiatives taken by this Government, there has also been a considerable strengthening of transport links to the region.  I refer to the two regional airports in the area, one at Sligo and the other at Carrickfinn in west Donegal.  Both commenced scheduled flights in 1988 &mdash; Sligo to Dublin and Carrickfinn to Glasgow.  Both airports are being further developed with assistance from the Government and also with local contributions.</P>
    <P>The working and advisory groups in the area stressed the importance of improving both access roads to the sub-region and roads within the region.  They also recommended further development <Col N="1442" /> of regional airports to facilitate tourism growth and other economic activity.</P>
    <P>We got their message loud and clear &mdash;<i>pace</i> voices to the contrary &mdash; and have included specific provisions in the plan to answer it: £89 million have been provided for road development of which £38 million have been specifically provided for non-national roads.  From an economic point of view they are equally as important as the national primary and regional roads because the paramount industry is agriculture, within which is dairying.  It should be remembered that the county roads carry the goods to the processing plants.  I would like to inform the House that I recently received the feasibility study, commissioned by the Government, on the contribution which a regional airport at Letterkenny could make to the tourist and economic prospects of the region.  I can assure everybody concerned that the results of this study are being examined in a very positive way by my Department.  I am glad Deputy Harte is present to hear that piece of news.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">

    </Speaker>
    <P>The expenditure plans which have been identified for the north-west sub-region and for the other sub-regions of Ireland are required in order to ensure that we can compete successfully in the Single Internal Market of the European Community.  In this regard, <i>The National Development Plan</i> has been designed to prepare the Irish economy as a whole to compete successfully in the Single Internal Market.  The plan sets out the structural measures which Ireland proposes to implement over the next five years, in conjunction with the European Community Structural Funds, with a view to achieving the national and Community <Col N="1443" /> aim of greater economic and social cohesion.</P>
    <P>The total projected level of expenditure on transport measures in the plan is in excess of £1,427 million and that for tourism is over £300 million.  This represents nearly 19 per cent of the total expenditure in <i>The National Development Plan</i> of £9,110 million &mdash; a clear measure of the importance which this Government attach to the transport and tourism sectors in our drive for overall economic development and employment creation.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like to reiterate the fact that the single internal market offers opportunities but it also presents challenges.  <i>The National Development Plan</i> is designed to prepare the Irish economy as a whole to compete successfully in that market, but the success of the plan will depend not merely on the amount of Community funds that we attract, it will depend fundamentally on the extent to which the opportunities are grasped and the challenges are met head-on by all sectors of our economy.  Our national psychology seems to like challenges and I am sure it will respond to this challenge as it has responded to many challenges in the past.  <i>The National Development Plan</i> charts a course whereby we can maximise the opportunities and minimise the challenges.  It deserves to be strongly endorsed by this House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder if I am living in the real world after listening to the fairy tales of Ireland from the Minister for Labour, Deputy B. Ahern, the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Flynn, and the Minister for Tourism and Transport, <Col N="1444" /> Deputy Wilson.  I must be excused for feeling like this because having spent 27 years in this House and listened to speeches about different plans which were to be introduced I am cynical.  I was particularly amused to hear the Minister for Tourism and Transport, Deputy Wilson, talking about angling in Ireland. The party he represents, who have as a cornerstone the unity of Ireland, protest that they are the only party entitled to a monopoly on that.  They cannot find a way to unity with fishermen in the west of Ireland.  This is a total contradiction. However, I am glad the attutude of mind in that party is now concerned with cross-Border co-operation.  I welcome that attitude but it is major U-turn on the part of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
      <P>The tariff barriers, customs duties, the economic war of the thirties, the different economic policies which have been pursued by them in the years since we gained our freedom, and, the most crippling blow of all, the break with sterling, are in total conflict with the attitude they portray in <i>The National Development Plan,</i> of economic co-operation between North and South.  It is a pity Fianna Fáil did not come to terms with this economic co-operation at the foundation of the State because I believe that if they had the differences which exist at present on the island of Ireland would not exist. Economic differences multiply the political differences which generate disagreement and lead on to violence.  We can trace our present problems back to bad economic thinking on the part of Fianna Fáil so far as economic co-operation with Northern Ireland is concerned.</P>
      <P>I am a bit disappointed with <i>The National Development Plan</i> with regard to County Donegal and the north-west, but we have always been the Eskimos of this nation.  Having spent 27 years listening to various reports and having read <i>The National Development Plan,</i> I could not but think of that now infamous plan which was introduced by Fianna Fáil in 1977.  I went out of my way yesterday evening to get a copy of the 1977 <i>Fianna Fáil General Election Manifesto </i> which states on page 1:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1445" /> The vision of this manifesto is an Ireland in which a successful strategy for national re-construction offers real security for all.  It has been carefully put together and costed for implementation in Government by a new team under Jack Lynch as Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>To confront the facts of unemployment, rising prices and Coalition mismanagement there is a crash campaign to boost industrial expansion and agricultural production through a massive export effort based on appropriate investment and efficient partnership. Getting the economy moving again &mdash; and keeping it that way &mdash; will create new jobs and opportunities, develop existing employment and provide security and stability for those who have suffered most from inflation &mdash; the housewife, the elderly and those on fixed incomes.</P>
    <P>To complete the Fianna Fáil strategy there is a programme of specific policies on which the legislation and reform of the next Government will be based.  The new strategy demands structural changes which mean a reversal of Coalition decisions and attitudes. An Independent electoral commission will be set up to deal with constituency boundaries and put an end to all charges of gerrymandering.  Departmental and executive responsibilities will be re-organised to provide the most effective machinery for the operation of Government.</P>
    <P>Sample surveys of population, unemployment and other social indicators will be held to lay a more solid foundation for future economic and social planning.  Fianna Fáil believes that this manifesto gives young men and women their best chance to participate in the building of a better and stable future.  It is a blueprint for leadership which, by the firm and just administration of law, esteem for enterprise, and concern for the individual, will bring back that sense of confidence and interdependence which is essential to the growth of peace and social progress, and of our cultural <Col N="1446" /> heritage and place among the nations of the world.</P>
    <P>What piety.  We can trace the problems of the eighties back to the 1977 manifesto. The Fianna Fáil manifesto was slightly different to <i>The National Development Plan,</i> now before us.  The Fianna Fáil Party were then going to implement the manifesto by reducing taxation, abolishing rates on houses, abolishing road tax and reducing the price of fuel.  It was a giveaway manifesto and they were going to build on it, but it was only a means of getting Fianna Fáil back into Government.  It had no respect for the building of the nation, generating prosperity and distributing that prosperity among those who need it most, the poorer sections of our community.</P>
    <P>The troubles of the eighties can be traced back to three very important events in the late seventies, one of which was the 1977 <i>Fianna Fáil General Election Manifesto.</i> When Jack Lynch took over leadership of this House in 1977 he said on television that the economy of the country was buoyant and that all the promises in the 1977 manifesto could be delivered.  That is a matter of public record.  The economy was buoyant in 1977 but within two years we were unapologetically clamouring to get into the EMS.  The EMS stands for the European Monetary System, although at the time it was termed &ldquo;easy money soon&rdquo;, and I believe that was its attraction for Fianna Fáil: they wanted to get money to pay for the mistakes created by the 1977 manifesto.</P>
    <P>I argued at the time that a party who preach national unity could not follow policies which interfered with the natural trading or the natural relationship between people in different parts of this country, and in particular between people living as near neighbours in Border areas.  Fianna Fáil, in spite of the warnings, clamoured to get into the EMS and we broke with sterling.  They introduced to this country a ludicrous situation where Irish money is foreign currency in six Irish counties.  It was not the Unionists or the British who did this to us but <Col N="1447" /> ourselves.  Nationalism, or what Fianna Fáil masquerade as nationalism, influenced that type of thinking.  We have now got what must be the greatest Irish joke of all times that the four Irish banks &mdash; the Bank of Ireland, Allied Irish Banks, the Ulster Bank and the Northern Bank &mdash; who have had a licence since their foundation to print currency, which they still do, and they print it in their Belfast offices&mdash;in sterling&mdash;but that currency, a Bank of Ireland tender note, is foreign currency in the capital city of this country.  The four Irish banks which now print Irish money&mdash;the Bank of Ireland currency note, Allied Irish Bank currency note, the Northern Bank currency note and the Ulster Bank currency note &mdash; have been forced by bad foresight on the part of Fianna Fáil into a position where that money is now foreign currency in Dublin.  That is the kind of cross-Border co-operation that Fianna Fáil was guilty of.  I am glad they have changed their minds and I hope it is for real and that it is not the fairytales of Ireland we are listening to again.  I have said enough, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, about what Fianna Fáil did in the past.  I would like to put on record how I see the plan.</P>

      <P>There is one other factor which obstructed this plan and which makes me wonder whether it is for real. When the Taoiseach took over as leader when Jack Lynch retired as Taoiseach he had to captain a ship that was sinking and he spent money like a drunken sailor. That contributed to the bad economic situation we have in the eighties as well as the Fianna Fáil manifesto of 1977, the break with sterling and the squandermania of the Taoiseach in the two <Col N="1448" /> years in which he was leader before the National Coalition took over in 1981. These are the things which have caused the economic convulsions of the eighties. Now let me get on with the plan itself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>The National Development Plan</i> challenges the credulity from start to finish, beginning with the claim that the plan was compiled after an extensive consultation process at both national and regional level, which we all know to be a complete fiction.</P>
      <P>A matter as basic as reform of the taxation system in line with the requirements of 1993 has been ignored in that not one specific proposal is put forward &mdash; only a mention of widening the tax base &ldquo;in the years to come&rdquo;.  Is this supposed to be a practical proposal?  Indeed, the Government missed the opportunity to make a start in the right direction in the January budget.  Instead of reform, they went in the opposite direction by putting an additional 5p on the price of a gallon of petrol &mdash; look where that has got us.  That is evidence of cross-Border co-operation, putting petrol suppliers and filling stations out of business in Border areas.</P>
      <P>The Government claims to have created an additional 29,000 jobs last year alone.  We all know that after redundancies had been accounted for, the net increase in jobs was something of the order of 1,200.  Bandying around unrealistic claims only undermines any confidence one can have in the Government's plans for an average of 35,000 jobs annually over the coming years, particularly when the plan already anticipates many more redundancies as industry modernises to face the challenges of 1993.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this regard, I am particularly anxious about plans to automate most activities in the postal service which must be one of the largest employers in the country. Great credit is due to An Bord Post for the improvements they have made to the system.  One must question, however, whether it is wise expenditure for the <Col N="1449" /> Government to invest large sums in further automation if it is going to lead to redundancies on a very large scale.  Many largely unskilled workers will not find other employment.</P>
    <P>In this regard, I am also very disturbed at the fact that there is no section on education in this plan.  The recent census reports indicate an alarming number of children leaving school at the minimum age requirement.  In an increasingly specialised and technological labour market, the great majority of these young people would seem to be doomed to a life of unemployment or emigration, and we already know how appalling are conditions in England for unemployed, unskilled young Irish people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>You can talk about that.  I would have thought that greater commitment should be given to vocational education.  Not everyone is academically inclined and there should be greater provision, particularly in the west and north-west regions, for young people in this regard.  I do not believe that short term FÁS and other such training schemes are sufficient to enable young girls and boys prepare for the challenges of 1993 since without a good educational base they will lack the necessary flexibility to adapt to market changes.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>In the plan there is a lot of talk about the sub-regions, yet for the west and the north-west there is little that is concrete despite the Government's supposed concern for that peripheral <Col N="1450" /> region.  I have already said I feel like an Eskimo.</P>
      <P>The £86 million for airports, air freighters, support facilities and improvements is all to be spent on the three national airports, Dublin, Shannon and Cork.  All other airports around the country are to share out of the total of £5 milion between them over the next two years despite the repeated emphasis on the importance of access for the peripheral areas.  Just where does this leave Carrickfin, Sligo, Galway and Horan, which the Minister for Transport has just spoken about, and, of course, the proposed airport for Letterkenny? He failed to tell me from where the money would come for that airport.</P>
      <P>Development of Horan as a freight port &ldquo;will be considered&rdquo;&mdash; is what they say &mdash; but apparently no money has been allocated for that.  Let me say that Horan airport could be supported without additional expenditure by allowing all transatlantic flights terminating at Horan to fly directly to that airport.  That is something which the Government should look at very seriously because there is a growing awareness in the U.S. of Horan being beside the shrine of Knock.  There is a great devotion in the United States to Our Lady of Knock, far greater than I ever anticipated.  There is a tremendous willingness or desire on the part of Irish Americans to come in great numbers to the Knock Shrine.  They can do that by flying directly into Horan.</P>
      <P>A sum of £50 million is to be spent on seaports and sea freight, but it is all on the east coast and Cork.  The plan admits that the biggest harbour in the north-west, namely, Sligo, is silting up and is increasingly restricted in the size of vessels and tonnage it can handle but there is not a word about doing anything about it. Neither is there a word about Galway port, apart from improving roads to it. Donegal is totally ignored and Buncrana and Moville are not mentioned.  This plan seems to have a fixation about roads as if that was the solution to all our problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a lovely piece about the development of inland fisheries and the job that will ensure.  Since the rod licence <Col N="1451" /> dispute is in its second year, the whole tourist angling industry in the west is on its knees and many small businesses catering for the trade are in serious trouble.  Apart from that, the fishery board got £1 million less in this year's budget.  A prospecting licence has been sought, with every likelihood of it being granted, for Clew Bay, which is acknowledged to be one of the best sea angling waters in Europe.  With these kinds of proposals how can anyone take the Government's plan seriously?</P>
    <P>Tourism, we all know &mdash; apparently except the Government &mdash; is of major importance to Connacht Ulster. However, the Government plans to build on the progress made over the past two years.  May I ask what progress has been made over the past two years?  I do not see any progress in Donegal, SligoLeitrim or in Cavan-Monaghan, whatever about the City of Galway and Connemara. There has been no progress in Roscommon and Mayo over the past year.  Business has dropped alarmingly except for visits from young emigrants and they do not, as a rule, stay in hotels or eat out.  They stay with their families and, perhaps, visit the local disco.  The Government, according to this plan, lays great stress on cleaning up our rivers, lakes and general environment.  With just a token nod to industry, the whole blame for pollution has been put on the farmers. Yes, some bear heavy responsibility but they are putting their house in order, but industrial pollution, whether in the north-west, or in the south-east is being largely ignored or denied.</P>
    <P>What of the pollution caused by local authorities who have been starved of funds to clean up their act?  Local authorities, unfortunately, are serious polluters. Whether it is river pollution, rubbish dumps, sewage outflows into the sea at resorts, or merely the litter along hedges and roadsides all over the country, local authorities are not being funded to eradicate these problems. These things upset tourists as much as anything else.</P>
    <P>I refer specifically to the pollution of <Col N="1452" /> the Donagh River in Carndonagh where for the last two years, because of storm damage to a bridge which was washed away, raw sewage has been spilling into that river.  The Minister for the Environment knows exactly what is happening. Everybody is protesting about it and every member of Donegal County Council feels that this problem should be remedied as a matter of urgency.  The amount of money needed is not very large, but the Minister has told us he has no money. I am told that the ESB power station at Moneypoint is one of the worst polluters in the country.  Do the Government have no idea of the impact of this deterioration of our environment, not only on tourists but on the Irish people who live here?</P>
    <P>The planting of trees is to be doubled. That is welcome, as we all want to see an increase in this valuable natural resourse. The Government have not indicated any intention to modify plantings with a greater proportion of indigenous hardwoods which are not only valuable but beautiful.  What about the islands and their great tourist potential?  I was in Achill a few days ago and it is bereft of tourists.  The Government have made no effort by way of grants to bring the hotels, guesthouses and other amenities up to the standards expected by visitors to that beautiful part of Ireland.  The islanders do not have the money to improve amenities.</P>
    <P>I am told that the Aran Islands have been without a ferry service for months. The only boats that take passengers come into Rossaveal, quite a distance from Galway and there is no decent transport available.</P>
    <P>I am also told that Inishboffin is being ignored by Bord Fáilte because there is no &ldquo;safety approved&rdquo; ferry.  The islanders do not have the money to provide such a luxury.  Yet because they are without it, the island is not being promoted so the hotels get emptier and there are even less funds for improvement.</P>
    <P>The islanders on Tory Island have recently launched a plan for the future of the island.  Despite promises from Government Ministers who attended, their proposals have been ignored in <i>The</i><Col N="1453" /><i>National Development Plan</i>.  What islands have the Government been talking about when they spoke of island tourism? Is it one island off the coast of Kerry?</P>
    <P>The lack of public transport to serve the islands bring me back to a major area of expenditure planned in this document. The only public transport to be provided is for Dubliners, and millions are to be spent on that.  I understand why the Government spend so much money in Dublin and ignore the rest of the country. There is some improvement in bus services from Dublin to the provinces, but within the provinces the bus service is infrequent and expensive.  If one lives in Downings, Glencolmcille, or Belmullet, or in any of a dozen other towns throughout the north-west, one cannot get to work because there is no public transport. Unless one has a car or a neighbour with a minibus, one is at a distinct disadvantage. To talk of developing industry and roads without developing public transport within the regions means the roads will be used mainly by large trucks ferrying imported goods around the country, or by emigrants leaving in even greater numbers.  For £89 million to be spent on roads, the Government could have done better than earmark a mere £0.6 million for the development of bus and rail services.</P>
    <P>On cross-Border development, the re-opening of the Ballinamore-Ballyconnel canal is mentioned, but there is no commitment to do anything about re-opening it if the IFI-sponsored report so approves. There is no sign of any money being allocated for it.</P>
    <P>Again, under cross-Border co-operation, there is reference to &ldquo;operational liaison on marine search and rescue&rdquo;. There is no indication of funds being allocated for this purpose.  Is that an indication that the Government intend to rely on British Sea King helicopters to search for and rescue our fishermen, particularly since we have just learned that the Air Corps have been so run down that they do not have the capacity to base a helicopter in the west for this purpose?</P>
    <P>Surely the provision of an effective <Col N="1454" /> search and rescue operation based along the west coast was an appropriate measure to put before the EC and for which to seek funding in this plan.  The waters off our west coast are fished by many nations so there is every reason to expect the EC would be willing to assist, but we do not find any mention of this vital service in the plan.  Not a word.</P>
    <P>There is another lovely piece about the development and promotion of export services, such as insurance and data processing at appropriate locations, including Roscommon.  Will this be on the site of the promised briquette factory?  How convenient to be able to include a piece like this just before the Euro elections, with no indication of what particular company is involved or when it will be established.  Fianna Fáil election promises have caused a lot of pain already in Roscommon, and the Roscommon people deserve better than this.</P>
    <P>The overall thrust of this so-called <i>National Development Plan</i> is downright dangerous.  Billions are to be spent and bilions borrowed.  Is this to be a replay of the infamous Fianna Fáil plan of 1977? Too much of this money is to be spent on roads and national airports and east coast ports.  Given the lack of any detailed investment in agriculture, fishing, angling tourism, industry and education, these roads, ports and airports will be used to ferry goods into the country and people out.  Too much of it is a once-off type expenditure with no total investment for industry or regional development to produce on-going returns and employment opportunities for our people.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, I am so disillusioned with the introduction of so many plans that have been shelved in Government offices that I do not take this for real.  I welcome it perhaps as an attempt to identify what has to be done, but if one looks at the promises in the 1977 Fianna Fáil manifesto of 20,000 new jobs in 12 months, and looks at what they did, one becomes disillusioned.  They proposed in that manifesto house improvement grants to refurbish homes and the first thing they did when they returned to office in 1987 was to abolish that kind of <Col N="1455" /> grant.  The Coalition Government made such grants available during their term in office.  I take this <i>National Development Plan</i> with a pinch of salt.  I hope it succeeds but I will be back with every ounce of energy I have to remind the Government about the things they have identified. I hope that this well prepared, well drafted plan has the same commitment from the Government as was put into it by those who drafted it and by the printers, but I doubt it very much.</P>

      <P>I will comment, in the short time available to me, on some points made by Deputy Harte.  The Deputy's remarks are beyond comprehension. Deputy Harte said that there is no provision for education in this plan.  I would refer Deputy Harte to the provisions in Chapter 3 which provide that a sum of £879 million will be spent on education. I cannot understand how the backroom people in Fine Gael are so benefit of ideas&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There is a full chapter there, covering education.  In relation to agriculture, Deputy Harte said there was no adequate provision for agriculture. The Deputy is even wider off the mark, if that is possible, in that criticism.  A sum of £1,428 million is provided for agriculture and rural development under the plan.  If that is the extent of the Opposition criticism of the plan, based as it is on total ignorance of the facts, it demonstrates just how successful the plan is.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. F. Fahey Mr. F. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government decision in regard to the amount of money made available to Bus Éireann for 1989 requested Bus Éireann to make provision from the overall allocation of public funding to the company for the provision of the school transport system at the same level as in 1988.  The Government are confident that that can be achieved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. Birmingham Mr. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>To clarify the matter, would the Minister accept that the cash allocation is £5.8 million less than it was last year?

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. F. Fahey Mr. F. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I confirm that the amount of saving in accordance with the Government decision is £5 million.  It is a matter for Bus Éireann to come forward with proposals for the implementation of the services at the level of funding provided.  Let me say that the Government have full confidence in the ability of Bus Éireann to do this.  Bus Éireann <Col N="1458" /> have shown a remarkable achievement in the last couple of years in the service they have been able to provide and in the quality and reliability of that service.  The Government are quite confident that this can continue even with the reduced amount of money which, as I have said, can be catered for across the board in regard to the overall subsidisation of Bus Éireann.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite clearly, Bus Éireann, as indeed everybody, will complain about their inability to operate on less money.  I complain myself to the Minister in the same way.  Obviously, they must live within the constraints of the Government decision.  We accept that this places an additional burden on Bus Éireann who are confident that the level of services can be maintained.  In addition, we have made an extra special effort this year and the Minister has asked me to come up with new, more flexible proposals in regard to special transport and transport for minorities.  It is evident that through greater efficiency, greater flexibility and, indeed, a more commonsense approach to the provision of those services we can actually improve the quality of service, even with less money available.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 40 together.</P>
      <P>I have not made a submission to the Primary Education Review Body.  The report refers to a discussion paper submitted by a member of my Department to the Primary Education Review Body which was not intended for publication.</P>
      <P>The primary education system derives from the Stanley letter of 1831, the Royal Charters of 1845 and 1861, the Ministers &amp; Secretaries Act of 1924, Articles 42 and 44 of Bunreacht na h-Éireann, and the School Attendance Act 1926.</P>
      <P>The rules for national schools are not statutory rules but exist in pursuance of Articles 42 and 44 of the Constitution and have their origins in rules previously drawn up on the basis of the Stanley letter and Royal Charters by the Commissioners of National Education in Ireland.  The Minister for Education is empowered under the Ministers and Secretaries Act of 1924 to administer public services in education and to take over the functions of the Commissioners for National Education in Ireland.  In numerous court cases the rules have been afforded quasi-legal status, and the rules, along with administrative circulars and directives have been treated as legally binding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1462" /> With regard to the introduction of an Education Act, the Primary Education Review Body will be addressing issues concerning the structures in primary education in the course of their deliberations and will complete their work later this year.  I do not intend to take any action in the matter until I have had the opportunity to examine the review group's report and recommendations.</P>
    <P>The Intermediate Education (Ireland) Acts, 1878 to 1924, provide the legislative basis for the operation of the secondary school system.  The third level education system operates under the various Acts relative to that area.</P>

First, will she make the document which was presented to the Primary Education Review Body available to Members of this House?  Further, is she aware in regard to the answer she gave to my question which quotes the Stanley letter and a number of different Acts which go as far back as the Ministers and Secretaries Act of 1924 that that latter Act did not abolish the Commissioners of Education?  Let me repeat the substance of my question to her.  By what authority does she operate the educational system at primary level, given that she has now acknowledged that it has no legal basis?  On what authority can she make regulations and issue instructions within her Department?</P>

My authority comes from the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924, and the rules for national schools exist in pursuance of Articles 42 and 44 of the Constitution. There have been numerous court cases and those rules have been afforded recognition.  As I have said, my authority comes from the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924.  I want to be quite clear on that.  The Deputy also asked if I would make the document available.  The primary education review body are presently sitting and all the documents are with them as part of submissions. Some time in the autumn they will report to me and I will report to the Government, and at that time all relevant matters will become public.</P>

      <P>In view of the enormous public concern that now exists, might I once again ask the Minister a question about this matter?  It is true that the 1924 Ministers and Secretaries Act gave her the power to function as Minister for Education, but I am asking about the status of the regulations and orders made within the Department of Education. The 1924 Act neither abolished the Commisioners for Education nor gave legislative authority for primary education.  Is the Minister aware of the <Col N="1464" /> dangers that are there and the lack of legislative support for the orders she is making in her Department?  My further point is that reference to Articles 42 and 44 of the Constitution are constitutional principles which require legislative implementation.  Is the Minister bringing in an Education Act which will make legal her actions that are at present without legal authority?</P>

All matters relating to primary education come within their remit, apart from the curriculum for which there is a separate review body.  Let us be quite clear on that point.  Secondly, I want to emphasise that it is Deputy Higgins who put forward the legal argument that the rules for national schools derive their validity from the principle of continuity&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>In the autumn of 1988 each second level school was circulated with copies of the seven new syllabuses, an information brochure outlining the key issues involved in the junior certificate and a video illustrating the central developments of the new syllabuses.  The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment subsequently convened information seminars throughout the country to introduce teachers to the new syllabuses.</P>
      <P>I sought additional funding for in-service training and secured an allocation of £698,000 for 1989.  This represented an increase of 124 per cent on the previous year and it is intended that the bulk of this allocation will be devoted to in-service training in relation to the junior certificate syllabuses.  In-service courses already held in February and March this year involved 14,000 teachers in 36 centres countrywide.</P>
      <P>A radical start has now been made on in-service training.  This represents the first step in ensuring that teachers and pupils will be able to derive maximum benefit from the new junior cycle programme. This process is an ongoing one. Guidelines and other materials amended following the in-service courses, will be circulated to schools later this school-year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Introductory circular letters sent out to schools with the syllabuses stated that the syllabuses were to be implemented within <Col N="1467" /> existing resource allocations.  This approach was adopted on the basis that the syllabuses offered sufficient flexibility of approach to enable implementation within existing resources.  However, representations have been made to me by both teacher unions and school management authorities and I will be having discussions with them in the near future to acquaint myself in detail with their concern in this regard.</P>
    <P>I am aware that some confusion appears to have arisen over the question of the proposed assessment procedures which I think stems from a misinterpretation of the term &ldquo;assessment&rdquo; itself.</P>
    <P>I am proposing to advance the oral component in languages to consolidate the valuable progress the aural experience has already achieved.  This will of course include Irish.</P>
    <P>To assist with the on-going evaluation of the junior certificate programme I will have further reports on the matter.</P>

      <P>The Minister's reply is extraordinary as I would have thought that there would be grants for clubs that provided rescue services.  This club has already spent £10,000 on premises and equipment and they are looking for just £7,000, which seems a very high rate of expenditure on their part.  Does the Minister agree that this is a suitable enterprise to be funded by the lottery?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of assistance for rescue services is the responsibility of another Department, not that of the Department of Education under their sport subhead.  However, we are in a position to provide funding for equipment for training and competition purposes. There is no restriction on a particular club using that equipment for rescue services or other activities in which they are involved but, essentially, our objective is to provide for equipment in the further development of the sport at élite and sport for all levels.  In the past we have refused to grant-aid agencies such as the Irish Water Safety Association and the Irish Mountain Rescue Association because it is not our responsibility to do so.</P>

Perhaps it is the Department of the Marine but I received a letter today from the Minister for the Marine and he does not want to be involved in assisting this club because his Department do not allocate funds under the aegis of the <Col N="1473" /> national lottery.

I accept the Deputy's point that a rescue service such as that provided by the Waterford Sub-Aqua Club should perhaps be assisted but I do not see any cause for conflict.  In principle, we are prepared to provide for equipment for competition and indeed for the pursuance of sub-aqua diving and so on.  There is nothing to prevent the club from utilising that equipment in their search and rescue exercise.</P>

      <P>The Deputy's point is reasonable and I do not disagree with it. I have had experience of voluntary search and rescue organisations not being in a position to get any money from the State. It is a question that should be looked at but it is certainly not within the ambit of <Col N="1474" /> sport.  As I said, we provide finance for equipment used in the search and rescue area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>On 21 December 1988 the Council of the European Communities adopted a directive on a general system for the recognition of higher education diplomas awarded on completion of professional education and training of <Col N="1475" /> at least three years duration.  The directive must be implemented in all member states by January 1991.  The directive will apply to teachers and I am confident that it will solve the present difficulties experienced by Irish teachers in securing qualified teacher status in the UK.</P>
      <P>I have been having this whole matter pursued through the education and culture sub-group of the Anglo-Irish Inter-governmental Council.  I will be considering the outcome of a meeting of this group held on Tuesday so as to determine what further action I could take in the matter in the light of, among other things, plans for the implementation of the EC directive in the UK.</P>
      <P>Let me say also that just over one week ago I met a group of teachers, representative of the general body of Irish teachers in the UK, to hear their concerns arising out of comments made recently by the Minister with responsibility for such areas, Angela Rumbolt MP.  As I say, I am following up the matter and in early May I hope to meet with that Minister in London when I will press the case again of Irish teachers throughout England, in particular those living in many of the local authority areas in London.</P>

Because of this an early meeting between the Minister and the Secretary of State might go a long way towards resolving that problem.  I ask the Minister to seek an early meeting with Secretary of State Baker in an effort to put this matter right once and for all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education if her attention has been drawn to the fact that Ireland receives only 1 per cent of the total ERASMUS budget available, with the result that many students receive derisory grants which cover little more than their travel expenses; and in view of the difficulties faced by Irish students and the greater organisation of students at European level through the Western European Student Information Bureau, if she intends appointing a representative of the Union of Students in Ireland to the NGAA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The method by which money for student grants is allocated to member states is fixed by the terms of the ERASMUS decision adopted in 1987 and it cannot be changed during the present phase of the programme which will operate up to 30 June next year.  In accordance with the decision the budget available for student grants is divided between member states on the basis of the number of third level students modulated by the number of 18 to 25 year olds in each member state.  This system provides funding which is, in general terms, proportional to the number of third level students in each member state.</P>
      <P>The decision assumed a somewhat similar level of demand for student grants across the Community countries.  This did not, however, turn out to be the case. The difficulty is that demand for student mobility grants is very high in Ireland and grants are relatively small as a result, compared with some other countries where demand is lower and grants accordingly are higher.  I should, of course, point out that the ERASMUS grants are supplementary in nature and are not intended to cover full mobility costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position is, however, unsatisfactory and I would like to inform the Deputy that at a meeting of Community <Col N="1479" /> Education Minister last November I pressed home very strongly the difficulties being experienced here under the present arrangements and emphasised the need for an improved method of allocating money for student grants in the next phase of the programme.</P>
    <P>The Commission is fully aware of and sympathetic to our difficulties and these were highlighted in bilateral discussions which took place recently.  The Deputy will be glad to know that as a result of these discussions we succeeded in having the basis of our student numbers reviewed.  This will increase our share of the student grant money by about 10 per cent in 1989-90.  Moreover, the over-all amount of the ERASMUS budget allocated to student mobility in 1989-90 will be approximately double the 1988-89 provision and this should also help to alleviate the situation.</P>
    <P>The NGAA will kept the Union of Students in Ireland informed of any developments but since the amount of money available for student grants is fixed by the terms of the decision I see no useful purpose in nominating a student to the NGAA.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister has already addressed herself to the difficulties which arose when this scheme was first put into place.  Can the Minister tell us if it is her intention to continue to press very hard &mdash; the next review is due in June &mdash; for a larger share for Ireland form the ERASMUS fund bearing in mind how deficient Irish students are in modern European languages?  Secondly, having sought, successfully we hope, a larger share for the country, is it then the Minister's intention to recommend to the NGAA, the National Grant Awarding Authority, that perhaps a minimum grant ought to be guaranted to all students suitably qualified to participate in this scheme, bearing in mind again the distance Ireland is from mainland Europe and the travel costs involved as a result and bearing in mind also the higher living cost for Irish students?</P>

      <P>As Deputy Quill has said, the present phase will end on 30 June and we are now already in negotiations about that, so we will have to take decisions on that well before that date.  Certainly we would like to see a better method of allocating grant money to the member states and the point the Deputy has made with regard to mobility is very relevant to us because distancewise we are much farther from any of the centres than many of the other countries. This factor has been taken into account in the lingual programme and we hope to adopt the same principles for ERASMUS.

      <P>The rapporteur does not state that &ldquo;rights under the Constitution would seem to have been infringed in the area of education&rdquo;.

      <P>The extracts which the rapporteur quotes in his report from the very full Irish response refute the allegations.

He was trying to hint to the Government to put their house in order before he judged on this matter.  Is there not detailed comment in the report that raises questions about the scheduling in the curriculum of religious education and about the employment of teachers or, rather, refusing them employment on the basis of religious affiliation or religious practice?</P>

This is clearly not the case because paragraph 10 of the report states that there is no question of the special rapporteur making any judgement of these allegations, in accordance with the mandate entrusted to him. I will offer to make available to the Deputy or any Deputy who so wishes, the full text of the Irish response which was sent.

      <P>I consider that priority in the provision of remedial education must be given to schools on the basis of greatest need.  To this end, my Department allocated some 237 <i>ex quota</i> remedial posts in post-primary schools in the last ten years.  A further 55 <i>ex quota</i> posts to be used either as remedial or guidance above ordinary guidance were also allocated by my Department.  In addition, many post-primary schools employ teachers within their approval quotas who have been trained in the area of remedial education.</P>
      <P>While there are no immediate proposals to allocate further <i>ex quota</i> remedial posts in post-primary schools, this is a matter which will be kept under review in the light of prevailing circumstances.

      <P>As a former post-primary teacher, would the Minister not agree that the whole situation in relation to remedial teaching is pathetic, that we have hundreds of post-primary schools which have no remedial teachers, that we have thousands of children languishing today at the back of classes who simply cannot cope with the gymnastics of the group certificate, the intermediate certificate or the leaving certificate and who derive absolutely no benefit from the existing curriculum &mdash; they are totally demoralised &mdash; and that there is need to leave out the jargon and get down to an immediate review designed to do something positive about this sector which is totally discriminated against?</P>

      <P>Many things are desirable in education.  One does not need to have been a teacher to know that.  One could constantly improve.  We can only do our very best within the existing resourses.  I am very glad that existing posts for remedial teachers were enabled under the national plan to be left intact. However, I take the point the Deputy is making and one constantly seeks to improve within the available budget the position of the disadvantaged child or student in the educational system.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 and 51 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1487" /> The report on libraries in VEC third-level colleges prepared by the Union of Students in Ireland has recently been submitted to me.  I am not at this time in a position to make a statement on the matter as the findings of the report are currently under consideration in my Department.</P>
    <P>My Department have an ongoing programme of enhancement in respect of all third-level VEC colleges and are endeavouring to improve facilities generally, including library facilities.  Some progress has already been made and improvements will continue to be implemented as rapidly as possible within the current financial constraints.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister indicate where the improvements have been made?  Is she not concerned about the basic facility of seating?  The Library Association of London recommendation of one seat in four is more than exceeded. It is ten to one and in some of the colleges it is 17 to one.  The same is true of staff, opening hours and basic facilities.  Is the Minister not concerned that in this sector which facilitates access to third level education all the basic components of the library service are below her own Higher Education Authority recommendations, below the fire safety regulations and below the professional librarians' recommended levels of service?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy asked where there had been enhancement of library facilities.  The colleges where improvements have already taken place quite recently are Bolton Street, Kevin Street, Athlone Regional College, Dundalk Regional College and Galway Regional College.  A plan for the expenditure of £3 million per year for the period 1990-93 on a rationalisation and capacity enhancement programme for all third level VEC colleges is being submitted for aid from the EC Structural Funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for that valuable information.  In those libraries where there are fire dangers, <Col N="1488" /> inadequate seating and inadequate opening hours, would the Minister not address these matters urgently, quite separate from the programme of development for the years 1990 to 1993?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The report has only been to hand for two or three weeks and Easter was a busy time for anybody in education.  I will certainly be going through the report.  We have been enabled even in these difficult times to achieve some enhancement.  I will study the report carefully.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The staffing arrangements in the school in question have been determined in accordance with the agreement between the Government and the INTO under the <i>Programme of National Recovery</i>.  It would not be open to me to make a change in that arrangement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had a reduction in Crossmolina from seven to six teachers because one teacher sought a career break under the general policy available to teachers and as a result we have 202 students being catered for by six teachers.  Would the Minister not agree that this is typical of the horrendous consequences of circular 20/88 which has meant that 1,029 teachers have been put on the panel and a county like Mayo, which was always educationally deprived, has lost 41 teachers in a 12-month period?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the school in question at Crossmolina, the Deputy did not refer to the fact that enrolment there has dropped.  The enrolment on 30 September 1987 submitted to the Department was 214, while the enrolment on 30 September 1988 as <Col N="1489" /> submitted to the Department was 199. The Deputy quotes a figure of 202.  There has been a decrease in the enrolment between 1987 and 1988.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister makes a very interesting point.  The reduction of 15 has arisen as a result of the emigration of eight families from the area.  Is the Minister prepared to confirm to the House that she is still in active discussions with the INTO and management in relation to the consequences of circular 20/88?  When can we expect conclusions?</P>

      <P>The Deputy will note from the information supplied that there was no decrease in the over-all number of teachers in the period in question.  In fact the number increased by some 564 teaching posts.</P>
      <P>The number of teachers to be employed in the next school year will depend on the application of the pupil-teacher ratio to pupil enrolment figures. The position of full-time permanent teachers is, however, safeguarded under existing arrangements applicable in the case of these teachers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education if she will make provision for the employment of a caretaker at the vocational school, Kildare town, County Kildare, in view of the fact that the school will have to close if one is not appointed immediately.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education if she has received a request from Kildare Vocational Education Committee for permission for extra resources to employ caretakers in the various vocational schools in the county; if her attention has been drawn to the  fact that parents have to pay for the teaching of continental languages, the teaching of which has been established for some years; whether this situation is satisfactory; if not, the action, if any, she proposes to take to resolve the situation; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16, 37 and 81 together.</P>
      <P>My Department have received a request from County Kildare VEC for a new permanent caretaker at Kildare vocational school.  The previous Government in 1983 began a phasing out process of the appointment of caretakers in schools.  This phasing out is continuing. My Department are precluded under the terms of Government policy on public service staffing from sanctioning any increase in the existing personnel resources of the VEC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1493" />
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Where a caretaker is required to operate a turf burning system, and where under the regulations of the Minister's Department a certain temperature is required before teaching can take place, can the Minister tell me how the school is to operate if she will not allow the replacement of the caretaker? A certain temperature and a certain standard of cleanliness are required by the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I met with the chairperson, the CEO and some members of the Kildare VEC and discussed this matter.  They put proposals to me regarding conversion of the heating system from one method to another.  In general it is a matter for VECs to deploy the resources available to them under the scheme.</P>
      <P>I neglected to answer one of the other questions.  The Deputy will be aware that the committee made a number of appeals to my Department against its teacher allocation for the 1988-89 session.  All these appeals were considered and the allocation was subsequently increased by a total of 11 whole time teacher equivalents. That addresses the teaching element.</P>
      <P>The meeting I had with the committee resulted in ideas about a change in the scheme being put forward.  It is understood from the County Kildare VEC now that the level of heating in the school is satisfactory, but if they wish to put forward more definite proposals with regard to conversion from one heating system to another, I certainly would be glad to pursue them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Can I take it from the Minister's reply that VEC schools in general will no longer be required to use native fuels?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is extending the subject matter of the question. The question refers to a specific school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from the Minister's reply to a question about this specific school, is it now the Department's policy <Col N="1494" /> that imported oil will be used in future at a high cost of conversion from the present system and would be higher in this case than the wages of the caretaker for a year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>There are other Deputies offering and I am anxious to facilitate them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>It was Deputy Stagg who suggested to me that the present system of operation of turf burning was not suitable for the schools in County Kildare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not correct.  The Minister must have misunderstood me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that now, in mid-April, the problem of heating and the question of the caretaker have no longer the urgency they had when this question was put down?  Deputy Stagg would have been aware of this at Monday's meeting of the VEC.  Accordingly, seeing that the question has not been withdrawn I must conclude that Deputy Stagg put down this question to spark off a confrontation rather than to seek a solution to the problem.  I would like to thank the Minister for allowing us to make the decision ourselves as to whether we will have a solid fuel burner or oil.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>With reference to Question No. 81, would the Minister be prepared to elucidate further as to the number of representations she has received from the various VEC schools in County Kildare requesting the employment of a caretaker?  In relation to the teaching of German, could the Minister indicate&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is included in the question. Could the Minister indicate her own response to the situation which prevails <Col N="1495" /> in some schools in County Kildare where teachers have to pay to have their children taught German?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have a list of the representations with me.  With regard to the general question of the replacement of caretakers, I would remind the Deputy that it was his Government who took on board that policy in the conduct of their Estimates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may want to forget his past.  With regard to the teaching of German in Maynooth, that was one of the issues raised by the group who came to see me from the County Kildare VEC.  We had a useful discussion on the matter and I indicated that while, in general, the allocation of teaching hours and people goes to a committee system which allocates the resources, in the light of the programme commencing in September I will look at the case they put to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to assure both the Chair and the Minister that I certainly did not put down this question to provoke a confrontation.  Is the Minister aware of the temporary expedient operated by the Kildare VEC arising from which the VEC have been advised that they may be surcharged for their actions in this regard and that this matter is the cure that the Minister and her colleague are referring to?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I had a very constructive meeting with the Kildare VEC and feel that they are conducting their business in a very admirable fashion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the employment of caretakers, would the Minister be prepared to contact the Kildare VEC <Col N="1496" /> with a view to determining the number of schools seeking to employ caretakers and try to make some effort to resolve the difficulties that have arisen?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I will not be contacting Kildare VEC to ask how many caretakers they need.  One might as well open a Pandora's box and contact every county committee all over the country.  I do not intend to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>If they contact the Minister, will she be prepared to assist?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am precluded under a Government decision brought in by the Deputy's Government and continued by this Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Informal approval has been received from the EC Commission for the extension of the ESF to vocational training courses of up to three years duration in VEC colleges.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  A clear distinction has been drawn by the VEC.  It is beginning in September.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The certificate is not acceptable on its own and parents have to find a substantial amount of money to send those students for the third year. Would the Minister agree that an exception should be made for the small number involved?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a question in which I have an enormous interest.  I was very glad when the EC decided finally that they would include the diploma year. However a clear distinction has been made by the authorities that the proposal will start in September and will be of marvellous benefit to the young people. This will benefit only those who commence their studies in September.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>We can always make further representations but the communications we have received from them and the consultations we have had leave us in no doubt about the measure which, as I have said, is of enormous benefit to young people.  Nobody is asking me questions on this and it is a really good measure.  Deputies are asking all the other questions.  Deputy Farrelly is the only one who mentioned it and I acknowledge his interest in the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>It is for those students who begin their studies in September. There is also &mdash; and I neglected to say this because we were dwelling on the VEC colleges &mdash; a provision whereby a one year diploma in certain related disciplines, particularly in technological and business geared studies, following on the receipt of a graduateship, is also to be funded and that is at present under consultation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>

Those who have already embarked on a certificate course of two years and will complete the course either this year or next year will not be entitled to assistance in their diploma course.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education whether she accepts as an objective that every primary school should have access to the services of a remedial/resource teacher; and the steps she has taken to achieve this objective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. F. Fahey Mr. F. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of remedial teaching at primary school level <Col N="1499" /> is a matter in the first instance for pupils' class teachers.  Additional teaching staff may be appointed in particular schools to assist in remedial teaching where need is particularly acute.</P>
      <P>It cannot be agreed that every primary school should automatically be entitled to the services of a special remedial teacher, as the level of learning difficulties varies as between schools of different sizes, and as between rural and urban areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. Birmingham Mr. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that in every national school there are individual students who require the support and assistance of a remedial teacher?  Is the Minister aware that this issue was one of the concerns that dominated the discussions of the INTO conference in Bundoran and that they indicated a willingness to proceed much further along the road of shared facilities and so on in order to achieve the objectives that every child who has need of the service would have access to it?  Would the Minister at least accept that as an objective and then let us see how far we can go?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. F. Fahey Mr. F. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>We all agree with the view that there are children in every school in need of remedial teaching. However, the difficulty is that due to financial restraints it has not been possible to allocate additional remedial posts since the 1986-87 season.  I would agree with the Deputy in regard to the distribution and sharing of resources and so on.  The Minister has initiated the review of the distribution of posts as between individual schools so as to ensure that the best and most equitable use is made of the existing authorised posts that are in place.</P>

      <P>The higher education grants scheme is subject to annual ongoing review and is also subject to amendment in the light of such review.  Apart from this ongoing review a more detailed review by an interdepartmental committee of the criteria for assessment of eligibility on grounds of means under the higher education and related grant schemes has been presented to me.  When I have fully considered the findings of the interdepartmental review group I shall be presenting proposals to Government for whatever changes in the scheme that are deemed necessary.  Changes in the scheme that may arise from the review group recommendations will of course be made public.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>That is good enough but I wish to ask the Minister, in the light of what she has said, if she will be making the findings of that body available to the Dáil for discussion.  How soon can we see changes being brought about in the grants system that will eliminate the present anomaly where families who can well afford to send their children to college have been able to exploit the system to get grants for their children whereas families who are not in a position to pay have been excluded from grants and also the children of families who live in certain geographical areas of the country have been excluded from third level education because they are not clever enough to exploit the system, as has been done by others in years past?  How soon will the Minister be tackling that problem and putting it right?</P>

    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Deputy Quinn.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy) Michael O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Irish agriculture was never in a better position to avail of the new <Col N="1547" /> opportunities that arise for the agriculture and food sector under the national plan.  After four years of depression, it is now acknowledged in the official reports of the EC that farm incomes in Ireland have increased well ahead of all other countries in the last two years.  I am well pleased that Government policies promoted by my colleagues and myself at home and in the European Community have been so successful.</P>
      <P>The income increase of almost 50 per cent over the last two years has not, of course, been enjoyed equally by all sectors in agriculture.  Some producers in the dairy sector have enjoyed considerably more than the average figure while small producers and producers in the cereals sector would have experienced considerably less.  As Minister for Agriculture and Food, I am determined to ensure as far as possible that application of the benefits under the plan will take account of the disparity of incomes now existing.</P>
      <P>There is no other country in the European Community in which the farming sector represents such a crucial element in the overall economy as it does in Ireland.  The major beef and dairy sectors provide vital employment throughout the country.  Employment in the agri-food sector accounts for almost 20 per cent of the total employment.  Exports of food, drink, and live animals exceeded £3 billion in 1988 for the first time, accounting for about 25 per cent of total exports. The contribution of the agricultural and food sector to the balance of payments is proportionately much higher.  When account is taken of FEOGA payments relating to agricultural production and exports, estimated at over £1 billion in 1988, and the low level of import content and profit repatriation of the sector, the contribution of the agricultural and food industry to the balance of payments is equivalent to that made by the rest of the manufacturing industry.  I should like to point out that there is no repatriation of profits from agriculture; they are all held at home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an encouraging buoyancy in <Col N="1548" /> our main production sectors.  For the first time since the introduction of the EC milk super-levy system in 1984, the decline in the beef herd has been arrested; market prices for cattle throughout 1988 were in the order of 10 per cent up on their levels a year earlier; the December 1988 livestock enumeration revealed an increase of 114,000 in beef cow numbers and 41,000 in heifers in-calf.</P>
    <P>In the milk sector, prices have risen by 40 per cent in less than three years and prices of over £1 per gallon for milk, something that no one could imagine a few years ago, are commonplace.  After a difficult year in 1988 prospects for the pigmeat sector are now particularly encouraging.  Prices have been steadily increasing since the beginning of the year and this trend should strengthen as the year progresses.</P>
    <P>As regards cereals there is an increasing export demand for quality malting barley, and our cereal producers are now very much aware of the need to meet the necessary quality standards which will ensure further expansion of this lucrative market.  Current world grain shortages have reflected a reasonable return to grain growers and this situation should continue beyond the 1989 harvest.  The agricultural and rural development measures in the plan are designed to ensure that the agricultural sector and our rural community will contribute to, and share in the fruits of, our overall national economic and social development.</P>
    <P>These measures will involve the combined efforts of farmers, food processors and others in the private sector, the State and the European Community.  Those measures which fall within the ambit of the Community's agricultural fund will cost £1,428 million over the years 1989 to 1993 &mdash; I wish some person would convey that information to the backroom boys who prepared Deputy Harte's speech; they did not seem to be aware of that simple fact &mdash; of which £344 million will come from the private sector and £416 million from the State, with the balance, £668 million, being contributed by the European Community.  In addition, the <Col N="1549" /> agricultural sector and the rural community will benefit both directly and indirectly from substantial expenditures within the scope of the Regional and Social Funds, which will, of course, be applied widely and effectively throughout rural Ireland.  By any yardstick expenditure of the magnitude proposed in the plan represents a strong vote of confidence in the future of Irish agriculture and in the future of the people of rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>The measures which the Government are proposing, and the resources necessary to fund them, will, of course, have to be the subject of negotiation with the Commission, but we are confident that what we are proposing will be favourably received in Brussels.</P>
    <P>The FEOGA guidance section has already played a pivotal role in the reshaping of Irish agriculture since our accession to the Community.  It helps finance the common policy of improving agricultural structures and in the period from 1973 to 1988 total payments from it to this country amounted to £520 million. That figure is an indication of the significance of what will be done in the next five years.  It amounts to almost three times the amount paid since we joined the European Community.  A wide variety of schemes operate under FEOGA Guidance Section but I will confine my remarks to four main areas where Community intervention has been of particular assistance to Ireland.</P>
    <P>Headage payments encourage the continuation of farming in those areas of the country which have been designated as disadvantaged.  The total FEOGA Guidance Section funding of these payments to date is over £208 million.  These have proved to be a major contribution to the maintenance of the population and the continued conservation of the countryside.</P>
    <P>The food processing sector has benefited from EC investment of £74 million in the form of grant-aid for marketing and processing facilities.  Apart from providing an outlet for the primary producer, the food industry is responsible for the enormous export trade which has been <Col N="1550" /> established, a trade which has exceeded £3 billion for the first time in 1988.  That is an increase of 8 per cent over the figure for 1987.  FEOGA Guidance Section investment has made an important contribution to the expansion and modernisation of the food industry, particularly in recent years and, consequently, to the rapid growth of exports.</P>
    <P>Under the farm modernisation scheme and the farm improvement programme, the Guidance Section have been effective in promoting on-farm investment for controlling pollution, increasing efficiency and improving quality of products.  The Guidance Section's contribution to this investment exceeds £46 million to date.</P>
    <P>More important still has been the operation of specific regional measures to meet the problems of farming in the west. Under the western drainage scheme, which is now terminating, and the western package the Guidance Section has contributed £102 million to on-farm investment.  The revised western package has now been extended to all the less-favoured areas of the country.  The agricultural elements have been redesigned to place emphasis on the solution of the most important problems of pollution, basic winter-housing for stock, fodder and storage.</P>
    <P>The decline in the market support mechanisms under the FEOGA Guarantee Section will increase the emphasis on guidance measures in addressing structural and income problems and in enabling Irish farmers to adjust to the realities of agriculture in the future.</P>
    <P>The structural problems which beset Irish agriculture are too well known to be repeated.  We are all well aware also of the consequences of these problems, particularly the low average incomes and serious under-employment on many farms, especially in the west.  These problems, allied to the shortage of non-farm employment, are the main contributors to the continuing migration from rural areas and their consequent decline.  The current market restrictions, arising from the changed orientation of the Common <Col N="1551" /> Agricultural Policy, tend only to exacerbate the situation and highlight the need for urgent action to find solutions.</P>
    <P>However, perhaps this is an appropriate juncture for me to make the point that the European Community is not simply about operating a common market.  It is about creating a community and all that this implies.  In that context it is understandable that the present emphasis in EC policy, as far as the rural population is concerned, is on seeking ways that will enable people to find prosperity, satisfaction and fulfilment in their areas rather than pulling up their roots and moving to the large towns and cities.</P>
    <P>It is against this background that those measures in the plan which relate to agriculture and the development of the rural community have been formulated.  I would now like to outline the measures involved.</P>
    <P>We did, of course, take a big step forward last year when I negotiated the extension of the western package to all the less-favoured areas of Ireland which, incidentally, now represents 62 per cent of the country.  This enabled the people in almost two-thirds of the country to benefit from a measure which was tailored to meet our specific needs.  As a result of the revised package we are now in a position to pay grants of 55 per cent for the control of pollution on farms in the areas covered by the package, thereby enabling farmers to make the necessary investment to solve what has become one of the greatest problems for them.  I may say, in passing, that the 55 per cent rate of grant is the highest which it is possible to pay under the EC regulations.</P>
    <P>Of course, pollution does not stop at regional or administrative boundaries. We are well aware that it is as much a problem for the farmer in the east as in the west.  That is why, as part of our plan, we are proposing to extend the western package-type of pollution control measure to all the other areas of the country. Subject to the agreement of the Commission to this proposal and provided the 70 per cent rate of FEOGA recoupment available in the western package is also <Col N="1552" /> forthcoming, a scheme will be introduced to provide and enable higher rates of grant for pollution control to be paid in non-disadvantaged areas without the necessity, on the part of the farmer, to draw up a farm improvement plan.  This measure is a matter of top priority for me.  It is my intention to press for an early decision from the Commission on it. Nevertheless, there are two points on which it is necessary for me to lay particular emphasis.  First of all, the requirement relating to prior approval by the FDS of any envisaged works will remain. Secondly, the fact that the plan proposes that the scheme will be introduced at a future date cannot be used as an excuse by anyone for not carrying out work to control farmyard pollution now which he is now legally required to carry out.</P>
    <P>While the control of farmyard pollution will have to be a top priority for many farmers in the years immediately ahead &mdash; it is, as it were, &ldquo;an gad is goire don scórnach&rdquo;&mdash; but it will not, of course, be the only item which will call for investment.  Later this year, the Community's horizontal regulations governing on-farm investment will be reviewed. The outcome of that review that I will be seeking to achieve will be to ensure that Irish farmers will be put in a position to obtain adequate assistance for measures which will increase efficiency, reduce costs and improve the quality of production. These measures are necessary if farm incomes are to be protected and improved and if primary production is to be geared fully to the needs of a flourishing food-processing sector.</P>
    <P>The control of pollution arising from farming operations is only one side of the coin.  The other side is the need not only to preserve and protect the environment but to take positive action to improve it where possible.  I scarcely need remind Deputies that the protection of the environment and natural resources is a matter of much concern all over Europe at present.  Happily, we here have not encountered problems on the same scale as has been experienced in several other countries and long may it remain so.  But nevertheless we have to be on our guard <Col N="1553" /> lest the situation should deteriorate and we must facilitate the rural community in enhancing their surroundings so that not only they themselves but visitors, both Irish and foreign, will find in our countryside a source of pleasure and peace.  To this end, it is one of the proposals in our plan to identify areas which are particularly sensitive from an environmental point of view and to offer incentives to farmers in those areas to conduct their operations in such a way as to retain the character of the countryside, its flora and its fauna, and to protect and guard the rural heritage in all its manifestations.</P>
    <P>Diversification of production plays a large part in our strategy for the future of Irish agriculture.  The term itself may sound a bit grandiose but plainly and simply what is being said is that the market can no longer absorb all the traditional products and that there is a need to orientate farm businesses towards products for which there is an outlet on European or world markets.  Let me emphasise that this is not purely and Irish problem; it is a problem for all farmers in Europe and, indeed, for farmers in most countries of the world.  Government policy &mdash; and this is stated very clearly in the plan &mdash; is to promote the viability of the maximum number of farms in Ireland.  To bring that about, however, we must not alone promote increased efficiency, improve quality and reduce costs, but also encourage and assist the farmer to produce only what can be readily sold.  This is not as easy as it sounds, because almost all the traditional products are now in surplus.  However, there are sectors which are relatively under-developed in Ireland and which have great potential &mdash; I mention horticulture, sport horses and on-farm food processing merely as examples.  The plan envisages the introduction of the necessary measures to enable activities of that kind to be developed to the full.</P>
    <P>A sector which in my view has great potential and for which we in Ireland are particularly suited is rural tourism. Admittedly, this sort of activity may not be new to many Irish farm families.  But it seems to me that by and large such <Col N="1554" /> developments as have taken place have been the result of individual decisions to invest in tourist facilities which, in turn, were almost totally dependent on passing trade for their utilisation.  There is nothing at all wrong which that approach &mdash; indeed, many farm families have been very successful in the business &mdash; but I do not see it as being adequate for the future.  The Irish countryside and Irish rural life have many attractions for visitors but we need to promote and market what we have to offer in a co-ordinated, efficient and planned way.  We must consciously plan and create organised tourist facilities of a kind that will offer visitors the inducement to prolong their stays in local areas.  That is the proper way to develop the full potential of rural tourism. The way forward, as the plan outlines it, is to place the emphasis on collective effort to provide more and better tourist amenities and to market the group rural tourism product in a coherent and integrated way.  Just now, the final touches are being put in my Department to a draft scheme to promote rural tourism under the western package.  This scheme will reflect the kind of thinking I have outlined.  I expect to announce its details as soon as possible.  This new scheme will also serve as a pilot scheme for a wider measure embracing the entire country which can be introduced under the framework of the national plan.</P>
    <P>We here think of the on-farm diversification primarily as a measure of supplementing the earning capacity of the farm.  Elsewhere in Europe it has a somewhat different constitution.  It would be seen as one of a whole set of Community measures aimed at reducing surplus production. As Deputies will be aware, a set-aside scheme to encourage the withdrawal of land from farming for a period of five years is already in operation.  This will be followed in due course by schemes to encourage extensification of production &mdash; which in practice will mean encouraging farmers to adopt less intensive production methods and, by a further scheme, to encourage the conversion of production from surplus products to alternative lines of production.  The <Col N="1555" /> extensification measure will be introduced in the beef sector this year on an experimental basis before being applied to all surplus production next year.  The introduction of the scheme to encourage conversion must await the finalisation of the relevant EC regulation which is at present being discussed by the Council of Ministers.</P>
    <P>I did, of course, during last year obtain the agreement of my colleagues in the Council of Ministers to the extension to Ireland of the Community regulation relating to aids for producer groups. Initially it is to apply in the cereals, beef, sheep and potato sectors.  If there should turn out to be a demand to apply it in other areas I will have no hesitation in going back and asking that it should cover other sectors where it is likely to be utilised effectively.  Properly availed of, this regulation can be of great assistance to groups of producers who want to organise themselves so as to have more control over the marketing of their products in order to secure greater advantage for themselves.  I would also envisage possibilities for contractual arrangements, for example, between producer groups and meat processors to the advantage of both sides and to help tackle the particular problem of seasonality of supply.</P>
    <P>The plan fully recognises that, no matter what investment aids are provided, farmers in less-favoured areas will still have to cope with natural disadvantages which, though calling for a greater effort on the part of the farmer, nevertheless result in a lesser return for his labour <i>vis-á-vis</i> his counterpart in the better-off areas.  The plan, therefore, envisages that additional support will be available for such farmers' incomes through the greater use of headage payments.</P>
    <P>Under our disadvantaged areas schemes it would be the intention to increase the rates of headage payments gradually over the period of the plan, if possible, to the maximum at present permitted under EC rules.  The extent to which this objective can be achieved will be dependent on the rate of FEOGA <Col N="1556" /> recoupment that will eventually be sanctioned by the Council of Ministers. We believe that there is every justification in accordance with the philosophy that underlines the strengthening of the Structural Funds for securing a recoupment of 70 per cent.  If that happens, it will be possible to raise payment rates from their present levels of £32 to about £84 in the case of cattle, other than beef cows, and from £9.50 to about £12,000 in the case of sheep.</P>
    <P>These substantial increases in payment rates clearly have the very positive effect of stabilising the farming population in our disadvantaged areas by pumping increased funds into those areas that can be used as both income supplements and extra support to the development of farms in these underdeveloped and handicapped regions.  In the long term, this can make the difference between viable and prosperous rural economies and a continuing decline of the areas as a result of depopulation.  For this reason, it is of vital importance that the necessary EC funds be secured to implement these planned increases in payment rates.</P>
    <P>I expect that the EC Commission will shortly be presenting proposals to the Council of Ministers on this issue.  At any Council, my main objective will be to secure the highest possible level of recoupment.  I see this as a vital issue for our disadvantaged areas.  Increased funding from the EC Commission is also a key element in relation to the extension of these areas and any reclassification of existing areas.  As the nationwide survey of areas which I got under way earlier this year is not yet completed, I am not in a position, at this stage, to speculate as to how large the extension or reclassification of our disadvantaged area will be.  I do want to make it clear, however, that where the survey results indicate there is a case for extension or reclassification of any particular area, I shall put that case to the Government and EC Commission and pursue it vigorously and persistently.</P>
    <P>Since taking office, the Government's <Col N="1557" /> policy has been clearly focused at restoring confidence and investment in our agriculture and food industries.  The food sector has not been slow to react to the favourable policies which we have initiated.  Our food and drink exports have increased from £2.2 billion in 1986 to £3.1 billion in 1988, a growth of almost 41 per cent over the period.  This compares with a 31 per cent increase in total exports.  It is clear that there is a growing confidence and new sense of purpose in the food industry.  This is due, in no small measure, to the stimulus which the revitalisation of Government policy has provided. An essential ingredient in that policy is the emphasis on the importance of the market led approach and the critical need for firms to have a clear strategy for developing their markets.  As a result, the State agencies are now targeting their grant assistance towards those enterprising and ambitious firms which are commited to providing quality Irish products for our export markets.</P>
    <P>The five year strategy for the food and drink industry published in December 1987 is well underway and accelerated development programmes involving investment of £0.6 billion have been agreed across the various sectors of the food industry.  This investment will lead to the establishment of internationally competitive food firms in Ireland having a range of products comparable, and indeed superior, in quality to the best worldwide.  Strategic overseas acquisitions by Irish food companies are being encouraged.  This will leave the industry well placed to take advantage of the opportunities in the single market of 320 million consumers.</P>
    <P>The FEOGA grants scheme to the agri-food sector has made a major contribution to the development of the industry. All sectors of the industry have benefitted from the £140 million EC grants approved to date, but it is worth highlighting the pigmeat and beef sectors as industries that have undergone great change as a result.  A major rationalisation programme has been introduced in the pigmeat sector which involves an investment of over £150 million and <Col N="1558" /> which will result in a modern efficient industry capable of competing on the international scene for the nineties.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the increased investment in the beef industry, particularly in the area of added value consumer products. Indeed, I was particularly pleased to announce recently the launch for the first time of a branded Irish beef product, which will be targeted at the UK and continental markets.  This is a major breakthrough for the Irish beef industry and reflects a fundamental change in the marketing attitude of our major meat processors.  There is no doubt that we have the expertise and ability to produce quality food products comparable to the best anywhere in the world.</P>
    <P>As I have said, these sectors have benefited particularly from EC aid under Regulation 355/77.  The total investment in the agri-food industry over the next five years is estimated at £750 million. This represents an enourmous investment in the sector and is indicative of the confidence in the sector of the Government's economic policies.  In this year alone, 81 projects, involving a total investment of £150 million, are already in the pipeline and I am confident that the doubling of the Structural Funds will facilitate the financing of this new investment.</P>
    <P>Up to this I have been talking mainly of agricultural developments and I would now like to turn to the wider question of rural development.  Farming will, of course, continue to play a major role in rural Ireland but I think we all recognise that, increasingly, recourse must be had to the non-agricultural sector to provide the jobs and income required to maintain a stable rural community.  I want to stress that farming will be the core of the continued development of the rural community and the other developments will be complementary and supplementary to that.</P>
    <P>All the measures to which I have referred up to this will have a developmental impact on rural areas.  For example, the industrialisation programme, supported by the Regional <Col N="1559" /> Fund, will contribute to rural employment, particularly through the provision of assistance for small and craft industries. The roads programme also supported by the Regional Fund will mitigate the major constraint on rural development represented by our inadequate road network.</P>
    <P>As the House knows, the Government have already launched a pilot programme for integrated rural development in a number of specially selected areas.  This is the first such programme undertaken on this scale by any member state and its progress is being watched with great interest by the EC Commission and other States who are making a contribution towards the cost of its implementation. At the end of the two year experimental period, an analysis will be made of the results and this will enable us to decide on the overall design of the nationwide programme which will be launched in due course.  The results will, needless to mention, be of considerable assistance to the Commission in finalising their own policy on the development and preservation of the rural population.  Before leaving this subject perhaps I should say that the promotion of forestry and fisheries will play a large part in this overall intergrated rural development programme but I am sure that my ministerial colleagues who have direct responsibility for these areas will cover them fully.</P>
    <P>The overall programme I have outlined is a very broad one extending not only to the agriculture and food sectors but to forestry, fisheries, industry and services. It is a <i>sine qua non</i> that its implementation will require new skills, improved standards and better product quality.  To meet these requirements we need to develop the necessary human resources and make the maximum possible use of all forms of modern technology.  This means training &mdash; or retraining, as necessary &mdash; advisory staff, educating farmers, both those already on the land and new entrants, so that they may be able to adapt to the new circumstances of farming, providing advice to local communities where it is needed and carrying <Col N="1560" /> out all necessary research.  To do all this we must not alone maintain our existing training facilities but in addition provide the extra training to meet the special needs of, say, diversification, afforestation and integrated rural development. Support for this will be sought from the Social Fund.</P>
    <P>To conclude, I would like to say that I see this plan as a challenge to us all, to the rural community as a whole, to the Government and to everyone involved in any way in its implementation, but it is a challenge well worth meeting.  It has been claimed by many commentators that, in the early years of Ec membership, we as a nation did not take full advantage of the opportunities available to us.  We are now getting a second chance and we must ensure that we do not miss any opportunities on this occasion.  The additional resources which will become available to us from the Structural Funds will be of considerable assistance to us in exploiting the completed internal market.  But, essentially, the key to success lies with ourselves.  We can choose to take less than full advantage of the internal market and the additional resources from the Structural Funds or we can grasp the opportunities that are opening up to us with enthusiasm and determination.  I am confident that the Irish people will respond appropriately to the historic challenge now confronting them.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I am sorry the Minister has left.  I do not want to criticise anything in the Minister's speech but there is one glaring omission <Col N="1561" /> in it, and I was going to volunteer ten minutes of my time to let him rectify it. Nowhere in his speech did the Minister refer to the recent agreement at the GATT talks in Geneva which I believe will have a more profound impact on the future of Irish agriculture in the course of this plan, and especially in the years 1991, 1992 and 1993, than anything the Minister has announced.  Since he has gone I cannot develop the point but I presume I will get an opportunity to return to it again.</P>
      <P>This document is a rather modest proposal. In effect, it is a public capital programme projected over five years but it is not even a full public capital programme. It is a public capital programme for infrastructure and would fall into the tables in the first part of that programme which describes the provision of infrastructure. So far as it goes many of the projects are worthy but it certainly is not an economic plan.  It does outline, though, for the next five years the projects in which the Government intend to invest Irish taxpayers' money and the money which will come from Europe.</P>
      <P>I do not make light of the difficulties in putting an economic plan together. The planning process is quite difficult. There must be at least 40 variables in the Irish economy which must be analysed and worked through to an integrated conclusion. Whoever worked on this one did not have the patience to bring all the threads together and continue them through the process.  It certainly is not a plan, it is a series of projects which the Government intend to fund over the next five years and it is as such that it should be evaluated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also, I believe, more of a public servant document than a political document. I do not say that in any way as criticising the public service in this country.  To a large extent it is the combined wisdom of the county engineers together with the engineers working for the semi-State bodies.  So far as that goes it tends to build the programme on policies already in place because that is all a public servant can do.  The kind of new <Col N="1562" /> policy decisions which would turn a project-centred programme into an integrated development plan are not there. As a public service document I accept its accuracy and its competence but it is not an integrated plan and it could not be because the people who put it together did not get the policy decisions to centre it on programmes rather than projects. What we have here is a list of infrastructural projects which the Government hope the publication of this plan will enable them to convince Brussels to fund together with a 25 per cent injection of funds from the Irish economy and some private investment.</P>
    <P>I would like to state my position.  I believe that any economic plan would have to start from one particular premise. There is only one question to be answered in putting an economic plan together. How can we organise the country so that we can produce more and sell it more effectively and more competitively?  That is the question.  All planning is an attempt to answer that question.  You might ask me: &ldquo;What do you mean by producing more?&rdquo;, I mean to produce sufficient to occupy all the citizens of this country who want to work.  That is the level of production we require.  We must use the land and the spare capacity in our factories together with the massive amounts of either under-used or unused labour we have in this country.</P>
    <P>We must look at the factors which inhibit production in Ireland, and at what are the factors which inhibit us selling our production overseas.  Many of the answers come very quickly indeed.  Until recently the burden of the economic debt was an enormous constraint on our productivity. All of us in this House have agreed with that, even the parties on the Left.  Parties such as Fine Gael and the Progressive Democrats have actively supported the Government in stabilising the national debt.  There is no doubt that progress has been made and we are certainly glad to be associated with that progress. A target of the budget, just three months ago, was that we would have an EBR in 1989 of 5.3 per cent of GNP.  It now appears from the returns for the first <Col N="1563" /> quarter that the end of year result will be better than that.  It will certainly be 4½ per cent but it may be as low as 4 per cent.  The target in the plan for five years down the line is 3 per cent.  How is it reasonable to have a target over the next five years where we will only improve the position by a single percentage point and at most by 1½ per cent when, in fact, the position has been improved by, say, 9 per cent over the last two years?  I do not believe that is a reasonable target.  It is a target which will keep the Government out of trouble while everything is going right, both internationally and domestically, but it is not a target that allows for any margin of safety against a background of uncertain exchange rates and uncertain interest rates worldwide and at home.  I would like the Government to have a more firm approach to the problem of the debt even though I realise it is a political issue which is moving to the back burner but it could come to the front burner very quickly again with changing circumstances abroad.  We still have a situation where the debt is rising and where it continues to rise.  The only reduction in the debt is not in its magnitude but as a proportion of GNP.</P>
    <P>I have advocated here that we should have as a target the total elimination of the current budget deficit, and go back to traditional budgeting where we separate the capital programme from the current programme.  I can see the difficulties that were faced by those who drew up the plan.  Once they decided to include sufficient funds in the plan to match resources coming from Brussels that meant, in effect, that there could be no further cuts in capital expenditure.  For the first time the capital budget becomes sacrosanct though major gains and reductions in the debt were made by cutting capital expenditure over the last three or four years.  If we are to make further progress on debt control, cuts have to come on the current side.  It is implicit in the plan that the Government intend to make no further cuts in the supply services and that they are relying on whatever buoyancy comes through to make the 1 per cent gain and the <Col N="1564" /> improved EBR-GNP ratio over the life of the plan.  That target is so modest as to be ridiculous.  If it were presented to the economic commentators in any other background but the background where the tax amnesty meant that last year's end of year figures were dramatically better than expectations and where now there is consumer spending which would indicate a buoyancy of revenue to make this year's end of year figures better than those for which we have budgeted, there would be an outcry in the markets with the paltriness and the lack of foresight in that particular target.</P>
    <P>I would like to look at some of the main projects in the plan.  There is no doubt that our peripherality as a nation is one of our major difficulties if not the major economic difficulty we face.  If we are to produce more and employ our people productively we cannot sell it on the home market, because it is too small.  It is a logical conclusion that we must transport what we produce to the marketplace &mdash; the marketplace is the UK or the European mainland but that costs money.  Shortly, when the channel tunnel is built we will be the only member state without surface access to Europe.  Obviously, we must develop our road network in a manner which reduces transport costs so that what we produce can be transmitted to the marketplace and sold competitively without huge added costs arising from transport costs.</P>
    <P>I will refer now to my primary criticism of the plan.  The Government are investing an enormous amount of money in improving the road structure.  I agree with that completely but it is a series of projects.  To make a plan out of it they would need to look at the other factors which are driving transport costs through the roof and seek to eliminate those at the same time.  There is no mystery about those either.  The excise take by the Revenue Commissioners &mdash; the Government in other words &mdash; on, say, articulated vehicles and even on motor cars is colossally out of line with the rest of Europe and that factor is making the cost of lorry transport in Ireland excessive.  Also the <Col N="1565" /> excise take on petrol and diesel is out of line with the rest of Europe.</P>
    <P>This document proposes the investment of an enormous amount in road structure.  This would improve our road structure network but the Irish lorries travelling over those roads will still be filling up at diesel pumps where the excise take is enormously out of line with the rest of Europe.  The owners of the fleets will be buying articulated lorries where there is a 30 per cent disadvantage between them and owners buying elsewhere. In an integrated Europe the roads run both ways.  Any advantage to the Irish distributor will be also shared by the UK distributor when they come across on the ferries into Ireland.  The difference is that the fleet run by the French company, the German company or the UK company will be acquired at a much cheaper rate than that acquired by the Irish company and the petrol which fuels the tanks will be acquired at a much lower rates as well.</P>
    <P>In talking about the improvement of the roads structure, the major emphasis is on a series of projects brought forward by county managers and county engineers, projects which were on their shelves for years and for which they could not find funding.  Those projects were included in this document.  If this was a plan the Government would have decided contemporaneously that in the process of harmonising VAT and excise duties they would systematically reduce fuel costs and the excise on the purchase of articulated vehicles so that the economic disadvantage in this country in so far as it arises from excessive transport costs could have been eliminated.  That is as good an example as I can give of my major criticism that this is project based on infrastructural projects rather than a programme to deal with the real problems of the economy.</P>
    <P>Two years ago we had an announcement that we would have a national roads authority but the Minister for the Environment has not yet come into this House to legislate to give that body any authority, and the implementation of this plan is still the fuction of innumer able local <Col N="1566" /> authorities throughout the country.  The plan cannot be integrated if there are 40 local authorities implementing it.  It will only be implemented if a national roads authority is put in place.</P>
    <P>The local authorities cannot provide toll roads.  The tolling of roads is a function for the elected members who have consistenly refused to do this.  It was intended to put a toll on the Nass by-pass but Kildare County Council refused to toll it.  It will not be possible to fulfil the projects here which depend on the tolling of roads unless a national roads authority is given the power to toll over the heads of the country councils.  We have project centre development, the implementation of which has gone to a multiplicity of local authorities.  There is neither the horizontal nor the vertical integration necessary to do the job properly.</P>
    <P>I am saying a lot about roads because billions of pounds have been dedicated to roads in this document.  The existing roads structure has been allowed to remain the same.  Here I will diverge to the plans for the mid-west.  We were told that the Shannon Estuary will play a major role, yet the two roads serving both sides of the estuary in Counties Clare and Limerick are not national primary roads but national secondary roads.  The road from Limerick city to Foynes, which will be the main port on the estuary, is a national secondary road and yet the bulk of the investment is in the national primary roads.</P>
    <P>To make any sense out of this and to integrate the plan nationally and regionally one must look at the status of the roads and upgrade those roads which are fundamental to the development of the ports which is outlined on the other side of the plan.  Again, it is project, not programme based.  We have great emphasis on the Shannon Estuary as a key area for development.  According to the national plan and the local plan we must put investment into it, but the roads which will take the lorries to the ports have not been upgraded in status.  They are still secondary roads.  That is the thrust of my criticism right through this plan.  The variables have not been analysed and <Col N="1567" /> worked through to an integrated conclusion. This is a series of projects for which the Government hope to provide funding, but it is not an economic plan.</P>
    <P>If one looks at the other cost factors which inhibit growth and prevent us from producing the maximum and thus employing more people, the same thing applies.  In relation to energy for example, how do we stand on nuclear energy?  Where is the reference in the plan?  Are we against it or for it?  Do we have an Irish solution to an Irish problem? According to the plan we are going to have integration with the European electricity network.  Are we only going to accept that generated by oil or coal and not accept what comes from France and the UK which is generated by nuclear energy?  Why is the plan silent on that when one of the objects of the plan is to reduce energy costs?  I am not saying that I am a supporter of nuclear energy, but if we are projecting our energy position for the next five years we cannot dodge one of the crucial issues of the day worldwide. What is to be the situation in relation to the electricity generated by peat in the midlands?  Where is the reference to that in the plan?  Are we to conclude that the Government will proceed to get the lowest possible engergy costs, that there is a threat hanging over the peat production stations?</P>
    <P>A certain amount of attention has been given to energy over the last few days, with the petrol prices and the announcement by Marathon Gas of another find in the Celtic Sea.  Will the Minister for Energy clarify if that was a new find? There is widespread speculation now that it was a drilling into the old field because everbody knows that this Government have made an arrangement with the company involved, which allows a higher level of royalty for new finds than for an old find.  Could we have clarification on that?  It is being widely discussed in the city at the moment and Deputies have a right to know whether the Minister for Energy has categoric evidence that the announced find in the Celtic Sea is a find and the establishment of a new gas field <Col N="1568" /> and not simply the boring into the existing gas field from a location five and a half miles away from the epicentre of the old one.  These question are not addressed in the plan and neither has the cost of energy in relation to industry been addressed.</P>
    <P>There is very little in the plan concerning telecommunications costs.  There is a statement of the present position, that our costs are grossly out of line with the rest of Europe.  Telecommunications costs here are still 25 per cent or 30 per cent higher than in the UK, our nearest neighbour.  If all the objectives of the plan concerning high-teach industries, information industries and the telecommunications industry are to be achieved, how can we process data here and transmit it electronically to mainland Europe if our costs are 30 per cent higher than those pertaining elsewhere?  How can we compete with Bristol to attract, for instance, an American company here to process credit cards if all the work has to be done on telephone lines that are 30 per cent dearer?  These are a series of admirable objectives, but the whole thing does not tie up.  Much of what is in the plan is contradictory and it certainly needs more than the half hour at my disposal to deal with it.</P>
    <P>The cost competitiveness of wage costs is probably one of the factors that most inhibit the provision of jobs.  If we get everything else right, if we keep the debt down and interest rates stay down, if our transport costs are down to the European average or lower, if our energy costs are down and our telecommunication costs are down, of course we will attract industry. We are already beginning to attract it, but will be industry which is asset based and capital intensive rather than industry which employs people.  We will get enormous industries costing billions of pounds to put in place, producing billions of pounds in exports and they will employ very few people because anybody investing in this country wants to make a profit.  The American multi-nationals do not come here because they like the greenness of the fields, the blueness of our eyes or the beauty of our women.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1569" /> They are looking at the bottom line, which is profit.  It is possible to make a profit with machinery and very few people and it is possible to make a profit with people and little enough machinery.</P>
    <P>Everything that we are doing in terms of industrial policy is making it impossible to employ people and easy to instal machines.  This problem has not been addressed at all in the plan.  The industrial policy set out in the plan is a restatement of industrial policy as it has existed over the last ten years.  The plan does not address the single issue which is inhibiting employment, which is the cost of labour. To give somebody an extra £1 at the moment on the average industrial wage would cost an employer £3.30.</P>
    <P>Workers are like any other commodity when it comes to the factory floor.  There is a man upstairs running the numbers and seeing how much they cost.  If it costs £3.30 to pay somebody an extra £1, if the choice is between 20 people and a machine that will do the work automatically, the machine will be put in. The machines have been put in and will continue to be put in and our highly educated young people will be in Boston, New York, Manchester, Birmingham and London &mdash; scattered around Europe. They will not be working in this country. There is nothing in this document which suggests that the Government are aware of the situation.  Even if the targets in the plan are achieved, we will still have an economy which is more conducive to capital investment and high production by automatic processes than one in which people can be employed productively to ensure that profit can be made.  We need to reform taxation, to reduce the burden of PRSI if we are to make Irish workers competitive with those right across Europe.</P>
    <P>I move very rapidly to the area of tourism. Tourism could provide a huge boost to this country in the next five years.  There is one aspect of the tourism industry which I admire more than anything else. Not only does it provide investment and jobs, but it distributes income right down to the most out of the way places.  The tourist will travel to see the scenery and, <Col N="1570" /> either by accident or design, the best scenery is in the most out of the way places, as the Minister, Deputy Geoghegan Quinn, knows quite well, having come from an out of the way place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The Minister did very well.  The Minister might go even further.  There is nothing is this plan which suggests that anybody knows what needs to be done with the tourism industry.  There seems to be a notion that because it rains a good deal here what we need is to get the tourist under a roof.  The main thrust of the plan is that we will put roofs on to various things.  It often rained when I was abroad but that did not have me scurrying down to the local swimming pool or squash court, simply to get in out of the rain. There is plenty to do in this country and any other country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall throw out a couple of ideas. First, I do not think that we know what is happening.  I do not think that the Minister or Bord Fáilte know.  There is no attempt to collect proper statistics about the tourism industry.  Everybody who arrives in this country is supposed to be a tourist.  Our sons and daughters coming back from London seven or eight times a year go into the statistics each time as tourists.  The Minister states that we had a 15 or 20 per cent increase in tourists visiting the country last year. Would it not be simple for the very attractive air hostesses of Aer Lingus, Ryanair and British airways to hand out a little form so that the status of visitors could be established?  The questions could be: Where have you come from? What nationality are you?  Are you here on business or on pleasure?  Where will you be staying while you are here?  Will you be with relatives?  Will you be at home?  Will you be in an hotel?  Will you be in a guesthouse?  It would take only 15 to 30 seconds to tick the boxes and give the computed form back to the hostess to be put on computer cards so that the information can be evaluated.  That is the <Col N="1571" /> first thing that should be done.  It would cost little or nothing but would give the information, which is not available at present, on which policy should be based.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the last Central Bank report shows clearly that tourists going out of the country spend more abroad than tourists coming in spend here.  For the first time since the foundation of the State, the balance of tourist trade has been negative.  The projection for 1989 is that it will be negative by a figure of £80 million.  Why is that?  I do not see the Spanish Government having tourist offices here or the Portuguese Government, or the German Government or the United States Government.  There is no Bord Fáilte in these countries with offices in Dublin.  Yet our people are going to those locations.  This is because the local travel agents are selling the holidays as one would sell any other commodity. Sometimes you are not sure where you want to go and you look at brochures in the travel agent's office and somebody behind the counter tells you that there is very good value in the Algrave this year.</P>
    <P>With a budget of about £25 million or £36 million, I would strongly advocate that the Minister for Tourism should consider acquiring major shareholdings in tourist promotion companies abroad.  I would like to see the Irish Government with a stake in a major travel agency in the north-east of the United States.  I would like to see our Government with a stake in a major agency down around Georgia, in Atlanta from where Delta fly when they are coming to Ireland.  I would like to see our Government with a majority stake-holding in a travel agent company with many outlets in the United Kingdom.  The kind of money that we are spending on general promotion is only a drop in the ocean.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the marketing by an international beer company or a tobacco company or any of the biggies.  These are spending literally billions of pounds on promotion.  The Irish Tourist Board have a budget of £24 million or £25 million, most of which is going on wages and <Col N="1572" /> salaries.  Bord Fáilte are not even known in the United States or in the United Kingdom.  It would be much better to use that money to buy directly into the travel agent business in our travel target markets, and for this country to be sold at the counter rather than have this thinly spread marketing which is going on at the moment.  Bord Fáilte are not delivering because they are not being put in a position by the Government where they can deliver.  If we use the budget as I suggest, of course there would be redundancies in Bord Fáilte but if we have a stake in a foreign travel agency we need people in there to show that our stake is properly looked after.  I have no objection to Bord Fáilte staff operating overseas in this kind of situation.</P>
    <P>We must think differently about the tourist industry.  We may go around saying that if this or that Government were in office the position would be grand, that it would be vastly different. There has been a massive expansion of the tourist industry worldwide in the last ten years.  It has expanded certainly by more than 100 per cent.  The Irish tourist industry has expanded by 2 or 3 per cent. It has been a real failure.  If we had a plan rather than a series of projects this might have happened.  You have to decide on the commodity and how to sell it abroad. I am saying to sell it abroad directly by buying into the travel agencies.  The other aspect is, what will they do when they come here?  Many people holidaying like a few drinks.  If you try to wine and dine around Ireland for a fortnight you could be around the world and back for what it would cost.  The price of drink is outrageous, especially for those coming from countries where it is cheap.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> As well as looking at infrastructural products for tourism in the context of harmonising excise duties and VAT, which we must do anyway as we approach 1992 and 1993, <Col N="1573" /> we should look again at those things that inhibit the tourist industry.  We should start bringing down the price of wine, for example, and the price of beer and of liquor generally, in the same way as we must bring down the price of petrol. People will not come here to indulge themselves in the typical summer and pay much more dearly for everything.  Why is it that one can get good value for lunch here, and after 6 p.m. get the menu written in a French <i>patois</i> with exactly the same items costing four times as much? That does not happen in France.  Lunch can be expensive enough there.  It is probably better value at home.  You will probably be paying £7 or £8 for it rather than £4 or £5 here, but if you go to the restaurant in the evening, the price will be the same.  Lunch is great value here, both in the restaurants and in the licensed premises involved in the lunch trade.  You can still get a good lunch in the city for approximately £3.50 or £4.  However, if you were to go to the same place at night it would cost you £20.  Why?  If you order a bottle of wine, which can be bought in Quinnsworth for £3.99&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The only information available to me is a press release by Commissioner MacSharry reported in the newspapers.  It seems that things will be reasonably all right for two years, but this is a five year plan.  Before we discuss the plan further, I think that information should be supplied to the House.  What the Minister for Agriculture and Food has just said &mdash; and I know he does not realise it &mdash; is not that relevant in the context of these decisions, because time is passing.  I do not know whether the Minister was in Geneva, but somebody should have been there to look after the Irish interests.  The last time the talks were held in Toronto it was the Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce, Deputy McCarthy, who attended and not a Cabinet Minister.  These talks are vital to European agriculture and to the future of this country.  In the plan it is recognised how vital agriculture is to this country, but nobody bothers when there is an agreement between the European Commission and the United States Government that the aids to agriculture in Europe will be dismantled.</P>

      <P>We on the Government side particularly welcome this debate on our National Development Plan which contains the largest budget ever mobilised to modernise our economy, accelerate economic growth, provide increased job opportunities and contribute to narrowing the gap between our living standards and those in the more prosperous regions of the European Community.  As such, this plan is of fundamental importance and its success will have a critical bearing on all our people in their everyday lives in enabling us to prepare for the single market in 1992 and to reap our fair share of the significant economic benefits which will accrue from this at Community level.</P>
      <P>In parallel with the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>, the Government have also been very active and effective in protecting and advancing this country's interests in the European Community. The success of our efforts compared to the previous Government is a testament to our strong political determination, coherent overall strategy and well co-ordinated negotiating stances which we have adopted and successfully pursued.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Our record of solid achievements on the EC front, which has an ever increasing impact on our economy and on our living standards, is one of which we can be justifiably proud.  In particular, the agreed doubling and the new régime for the Structural <Col N="1576" /> Funds, achieved after arduous negotiations, was an important breakthrough in tackling the problems of regional disparities in the Community which is central to the Government's approach to the Community and its further development.</P>
      <P>The relaunching of the European Community and the strengthening of its impetus towards European integration under the provisions of the Single European Act has given the Community renewed momentum and confidence in its future.  The major priority task now facing the Community is to build on this progress and carry through the full implementation of the range of policies provided for in the Single European Act in areas such as the internal market, not neglecting its social dimension, economic and social cohesion including the reform of the EC's Structural Funds, research and technological development and the environment.  This will represent a further step in the strengthening and development of the Community and in enhancing its role in the world, while at the same time providing substantial rewards in terms of greater prosperity and increased employment opportunities. Particular attention and vigilance will, of course, be necessary to ensure that these benefits are shared equitably among all the member states and throughout the regions of the Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the House will be aware, the Government established special co-ordinating arrangements to plan and supervise the preparation of our economy for the increased opportunities and inevitable structural changes arising from the completion of the internal market and to oversee the preparation of our National Development Plan.  These arrangements represent a significant new departure and a strengthening of relations between the Government and the Commission, which is unique in the Community.  A framework of co-operation and consultations has been established between the Government's EC Committee of Ministers and Secretaries over which the Taoiseach presides, on the one hand, and a task force of relevant Commissioners and <Col N="1577" /> Directors-General on the Commission side, headed by President Delors on the other.  The overall objective is to ensure that the Government's policies and Community policies are more effectively co-ordinated under the plan so as to maximise their effectiveness in the development of our economy and thereby help us in our efforts to attain the level of living standards enjoyed by our Community partners.</P>
    <P>These arrangements, coupled with our development plan, offer us major potential benefits in accelerating the pace of economic and social development in this country.  With a view to ensuring that this process is well co-ordinated and that the necessary momentum is maintained, President Delors and the Taoiseach will meet regularly to set strategic objectives and review developments.  These novel arrangements were very successfully employed in the preparation of our plan and complementary operational programmes and we will continue to avail of these innovative co-ordination and co-operation procedures to ensure the successful implementation of the plan and the programmes.</P>
    <P>The Government's commitment to closer integration and to the further development of the European Community reflects our belief that this offers the best prospects of ensuring that this country's overall interests are protected and accommodated in the increasingly competitive and rapidly changing world in which we now live.  However, we cannot expect that the Community will provide us with the solution to all our economic and social problems without further and sustained efforts on our part. What Community policies and assistance under the Structural Funds offer us now, through the &ldquo;partnership&rdquo; arrangements between the Commission and the beneficiary member states established under the new regulations, is the unique opportunity to obtain major Community support for our own national efforts in realising more quickly our development objectives.</P>
    <P>The internal market, if it is to succeed and create the necessary solidarity among <Col N="1578" /> the member states and support from the public and the social partners, must be accompanied at the same time by a social dimension directed at ensuring that all Community citizens benefit and that there is a progressive improvement in social standards and working conditions throughout the Community.  An important element of the social dimension is that of consultations with the social partners which the Government fully support, and it is a concept which is entirely in line with the approach which we initiated with the social partners in preparing and implementing our <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>, in the preparation of the national plan which we are currently debating and which we have also carried forward in our EUROPEN campaign to promote awareness and the necessary preparations for the 1992 Internal Market deadline.</P>
    <P>The outcome of the negotiations on the reform of the Community's Structural Funds, which were of vital importance and significance for this country and other less developed regions of the Community in the context of the completion of the internal market, represents a major achievement by the Government in ensuring a meaningful follow-up on the cohesion provisions of the Single European Act and provide us with major opportunities resulting from the doubling in the level of the Structural Funds resources for the less-developed regions, the commitment to a special effort for the least properous of these regions which, at our insistence, will also include this country, and the provision that for these regions the rate of assistance from the funds can be up to 75 per cent.</P>
    <P>In addition, we were also successful in obtaining agreement that certain infrastructural projects with private sector funding will be eligible for assistance &mdash; a provision which will be particularly helpful to us, given our budgetary constraints, in ensuring that we will be in a position to maximise our take-up from the funds and, through partnership arrangements with the private sector, ensure that certain projects can proceed <Col N="1579" /> much more rapidly than would otherwise be the case.</P>
    <P>In this context, Deputies will note that a special feature of the plan is provision for funding from the private sector where such private funding can be regarded as similar to public expenditure and thus, under the regulations qualify for Structural Funds assistance.  This is particularly so in the case of roads where we have already identified a number of projects such as the Dublin Ring Road, the Newbridge-Kilcullen by-passes, the LucanKilcock Road and the downstream crossing of the River Lee.</P>
    <P>Another area is that of tourism facilities and amenities where substantial investment by the private sector, with assistance from the ERDF, is envisaged in the plan in line with the high priority we have given to tourism development since our assuming office.</P>
    <P>Because of the still precarious state of our public finances and the massive overhang of Exchequer indebtedness, I need hardly emphasise the constraints which we face in regard to expenditure by the Government here.  Against this background and the need for a continuing reduction in the Exchequer borrowing requirement, which was again underlined in the recent Community's Annual Report on the Economic Situation, the increase in the Structural Funds and their deployment in enhancing our economy's potential output as we are proposing in the development plan assume critical importance in providing a firmer basis for our economy to return to a sustainable growth path.</P>
    <P>We do, of course, welcome any constructive comments and suggestions for improvement to the plan.  While there is no real scope for significant changes in the fundamental provisions, however, and as the Taoiseach emphasised in opening this debate, the Government will be flexible as regards the more detailed aspects of the particular sectors and in the timing and implementation of particular projects. Thus the procedures which we are following are as open as possible in the circumstances to receiving submissions <Col N="1580" /> and proposals from any quarter or particular interest groups.</P>
    <P>The work involved in formulating the national plan and complementary operational programmes has had an important regional input from the working groups in the seven sub-national areas designated by the Government.  These working groups represented the relevant Government Departments, State bodies and local authority management and had the assistance of advisory groups which included elected representatives of the local authorities such as the chairpersons of each county council and corporation within the area and of the larger urban district councils as well as representatives of a wide range of vocational groups with an interest and involvement in the local development such as the CII, CIF, Chambers of Commerce, FUE, ICTU, ICMSA, ICOS, IFA and Macra na Feirme.  Criticisms that the views of local elected representatives were ignored are, therefore, totally without foundation. Indeed, specific arrangements were made to ensure that the views and suggestions of the advisory groups were taken into account by the working groups.</P>
    <P>The Government adopted these arrangements against the background of their strong commitment to regional development and their desire to have a regional contribution in planning the best use of the increased resources from the Structural Funds.  We believe that these arrangements struck an appropriate balance between, on the one hand, representation of central Government which will have to provide the great bulk of the matching national finance and which has to assess the expenditures involved in the total national budgetary context and, on the other hand, representatives from the areas themselves who brought to the task their knowledge of the needs, assets, weaknesses and resources of their areas together with a spirit of local enthusiasm and enterprise.  This is the first time that regional participation of this kind has been instituted in this country.  We did this on our own initiative, because we firmly believe in the stength and vigour of our regions and local communities and <Col N="1581" /> their indispensable role and contribution to overall development efforts at national level.</P>
    <P>The criticisms from the Opposition of our arrangements in this regard are, therefore, devoid of any substantive content and are a bit hard to take, especially from those who participated in the previous Government which consistently refused to introduce any regional or sub-national dimension into the operation of the Structural Funds in this country.  As Ireland remains a single region for Structural Fund purposes, we could have adhered to the position established up to now that the national Government was the single regional authority to be involved in the process.  Instead, and in line with the stance on consultation and involvement which we have adopted at national level on domestic economic and social matters, we introduced these new arrangements to ensure that regional and local knowledge and experience were drawn on and utilised to the full.</P>
    <P>I should now like to take up several points, including some that contradict each other, which have been made by Deputies opposite, including Deputies Dukes and Des O'Malley.  It has been suggested that the Government introduced the regional dimension as an afterthought and only under pressure from the Commission.  This is nonsense.  Let me remind the Deputies concerned that I announced the Government's intention to introduce this regional dimension as early as October 1987 when the negotiations on the Commission's proposal were only in the early stages.  There was no pressure from the Commission &mdash; and could not have been &mdash; since we had already spontaneously announced our intentions to proceed according to the spirit of the approach we had advocated in successive elections.  Those Deputies who think there would have been a basis for pressure from the Commission are also misinformed.  I refer them to the new regulations on the funds adopted in June and December 1988.  They will search these in vain for any provision that would provide the Commission with a legal basis <Col N="1582" /> for pressing us to adopt a regional dimension within Ireland.</P>
    <P>The reference in the regulations are typified by Article 4.1 of the framework Regulation Number 2052 of 24 June 1988.  This states:</P>
    <P>Community operations shall be such as complement or contribute to corresponding national operations.  They shall be established through close consultation between the Commission, the member states and the competent authority designated by the latter at national, regional, local or other level.</P>
    <P>There is more but I simply want to underline that it was left to each member state concerned to designate the competent authority and it was completely optional whether these included regional or local bodies.  Moreover, in Irish terms, since we are one region for Community purposes, the reference to a regional authority referred in our case to the national Government.  The language of the regulations has to cover varying situations in all the member states concerned and the reference to regional authorities is primarily relevant to countries like France or Spain which are divided into regions, most of which have larger populations than that of the entire State here.  For example, in France the average population of the 22 regions is 2.4 million and the most populous of its regions has 10.2 million people.  In Italy the populations of regions are also in general quite large by reference to the population of Ireland, ranging in fact to 8.9 million.</P>
    <P>In Opposition contributions here it was claimed, on the one hand, that the programme documents drawn up by the working parties were subject to a rigid pattern imposed from Dublin.  On the other hand, there were complaints, as summarised in the national plan, that they varied and showed differences in approach and style.  The Deputies opposite cannot have it both ways.  While there were general guidelines from the centre no rigid pattern was imposed and the approaches and priorities of the different working and advisory groups did show differences, as is only to be <Col N="1583" /> expected in view of the varying nature and needs of the subregions.</P>
    <P>It was also suggested that the regional breakdowns in the plan had as their point of departure figures which were pre-determined at national level without refof departure figures which level without reference to the inputs from the regions. This is also wide of the mark.  Precisely because we had the central Government Departments as well as the local authorities represented on the working groups, we had a constant feedback from these groups to the process of preparing the national plan.  Due to the time constraints the two exercises had to proceed in parallel, but they did not proceed in sealed compartments.  As a result of a process of interaction, the regional breakdown set out in the national plan matches quite well with the results emerging from the working and advisory groups, all of which incidentally have essentially completed their reports.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable, of course, that the valuable work of the two groups in the south-west region, covering Cork and south Kerry, has been so badly misrepresented by the Lord Mayor of Cork, Fine Gael Deputy Bernard Allen.  The facts of the matter are that Deputy Allen was rarely present at meetings of the advisory group to put forward the interests of the people of Cork.  In fact, of the seven meetings held by the advisory group he only attended one meeting.  He failed also to attend the important joint meeting in Killarney between the working group and the advisory group.  Instead of making a constructive contribution as his other colleagues on the advisory group did, as indeed was the case with practically all other advisory group members throughout the country, Deputy Allen chose to ignore the serious problems, particularly unemployment, facing the south-west and preferred to issue a constant stream of mischievous and ill-informed statements to the media on every possible occasion.  So much for responsible Opposition, which we have heard so much about from the benches opposite.</P>
    <P>I should like to avail of this opportunity <Col N="1584" /> to publicly thank all the representatives on both the working and advisory groups for their commendable efforts which facilitated the significant regional input to and dimension of the national plan and the operational programmes.  The results of their work were taken into account and incorporated, as appropriate, by the Government in the National Development Plan which, for the first time ever, contains planned total expenditure, including the amounts which we are putting forward for EC support from the Structural Funds in each of the seven regions in response to the assessments of needs and objectives made by the groups.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will have noted, chapter 6 of the National Development Plan contains a summary of the objectives and strategies which were identified for each region together with financial tables outlining a detailed sectoral and functional breakdown of the planned expenditure over the period 1989-1993 in each region.  It is clear from these tables that each region will benefit substantially in the developments planned.  Given the substantial role of the Exchequer in funding the expenditures involved, the decisions on the allocation of resources as between the different regions had to be taken by the Government, but let me emphasise that these decisions took fully into account the needs and priorities as identified by the groups.  It also needs to be clearly understood that within the constraint of the limit on the resources available, increases in the share of any region could only be at the expense of other regions.</P>
    <P>I would now like to turn to the regional component of the national plan, using as an illustration the west region covering the counties of Galway, Mayo and Roscommon with which I am, of course, particularly familiar.  This region is especially disadvantaged in terms of its peripheral location, is one of the least industrialised in the country, with income per capita at only 80 per cent of the national average, while difficulties in its agricultural sector are further exacerbated with the small size of farm holdings <Col N="1585" /> and extensive areas of marginal agricultural land.</P>
    <P>On the basis of the development strategy and priority development needs which were identified by the working and advisory groups, the Government envisage over £1 billion expenditure on development projects in the region over the next five years, in respect of which nearly £450 million is being sought in assistance from the Structural Funds.  The greatest component of that £1 billion expenditure, nearly £370 million, will be in respect of agricultural and rural developments in the region such as the strengthening of marketing and processing facilities and the development of alternative enterprises, including agritourism, by farmers themselves as well as by rural communities in the regions. Included in this figure also is provision for forestry development as well as the further development of the region's assets and significant potential in the fishing and aquaculture sectors.</P>
    <P>On tourism, the region is one of the most important destinations in the country and expenditure of over £40 million is planned in developing the region's facilities and amenities for tourists.  On the industry and services front, nearly £270 million in expenditure is planned in further development the region's strengths, expanding the region's capacity in the high-technology areas, centred in Galway and University College Galway, the facilities of Horan and Galway Airports, as well as other developments such as improved linkages and technology transfers.  On the services front, the region's attractions have been further highlighted with this week's announcement by the US firm Cigna Corporation to locate a project in Loughrea which will provide ideal job opportunities for our school leavers.  In the human resources area, over £200 million in expenditure is planned in the further development of education and training programmes to respond to increasing technological needs and the upgrading and the provision of technological infrastructure and facilities at all levels, which in turn will be particularly important in overcoming the <Col N="1586" /> region's isolation and in attracting firms demanding high technology qualifications.</P>
    <P>The other major block of expenditure is that of infrastructure with over £40 million planned in the improvement of national roads and £36 million for regional and county roads.  These will mark an important contribution to the development of the region's assets and in mitigating the present level of transport costs arising from its peripheral location. On sanitary and other local services, nearly £60 million is being provided to cater both for existing as well as future needs.</P>
    <P>Apart from their input into the preparation of the <i>National Development Plan,</i> the work undertaken by the groups has also provided a valuable input into the formulation of the operational programmes which will set out in greater detail the development measures which are set out in outline form in the national plan.  A number of these programmes, the coverage of which is set out in chapter 5 of the national plan, have already been submitted to the Commission and the remaining ones will be forwarded very soon.</P>
    <P>These programmes will be examined by the Commission in parallel with its examination of the national plan and we expect that they will be approved at the same time or, possibly, in some cases in advance of the six month maximum period set in the regulations.  Indeed, by acting quickly in this area we are ahead of nearly all our Community partners and are, therefore, well positioned to ensure that projects can go ahead and that the assistance from the Structural Funds can flow as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>For the information of the House, I should mention that a provision in the Co-ordinating regulation, dealing with the transition from the old to the new régime for the Structural Funds, permits approval of programmes once the plan has been submitted, but before the Community support framework for the five year period is agreed with the Commission &mdash; a provision which we wish to see availed of to the fullest extent possible <Col N="1587" /> to ensure that there is no interruption or undue delay in our take-up of assistance from the funds this year.</P>
    <P>Responding to recent criticisms on the future role envisaged for the working and advisory groups, I should mention that the co-ordinating regulation provides that, within the framework of the new partnership, the member states and the Commission are to ensure effective monitoring in the implementation of programmes which are assisted from the funds.  Such monitoring is to be carried out by way of jointly agreed reporting procedures, sample checks and the establishment of monitoring committees set up in agreement between the member states and the Commission.</P>
    <P>The manner in which these provisions will be applied in our case has yet to be discussed in any substance with the Commission and it is, therefore, too early at this stage to comment on this particular aspect.  However, as we pointed out in the national plan, our present system of ongoing co-ordination and integration between the various State agencies and local authorities is efficient, cost effective and practical and this will continue to ensure that particular developments planned for each area are implemented in an integrated way which will ensure coherence and complementarity between the individual measures and programmes. An additional consideration to bear in mind also is that the work of the groups at sub-national level will be an important, and to a large extent, the guiding factor which will influence and will be taken into account in the detailed implementation at regional and local levels of our operating programmes.</P>
    <P>In this debate, the relevant Ministers directly concerned are outlining in detail the approach which we have adopted in the <i>National Development Plan</i> in respect of the various economic sectors such as industry, tourism and agriculture as well as infrastructure support services such as transport, energy and training.  I do not, therefore, propose to repeat this or respond to the unfounded criticisms or opportunistic comments made by the <Col N="1588" /> Opposition in this debate and which will be, or indeed have already been, effectively disposed of by other Ministers.</P>
    <P>Renewed and strengthened action through the doubling in the size of the Structural Funds will not in itself be sufficient to effect a significant breakthrough in reducing regional disparities at Community level but must also be complemented by additional measures and Community policies to complement the efforts of the individual member states concerned.</P>
    <P>Foremost among these is the need for meaningful follow-up action on the provision in Article 130 (B) of the Treaty, an article inserted by the Single European Act (SEA) that the implementation of all Community policies should from now on take into account the cohesion objectives of reducing regional disparities as set out in the SEA and shall contribute to their achievement.</P>
    <P>The Government, of course, attach the highest importance to vigorous follow-up on this to ensure that this Treaty commitment is acted on for the benefit of the Community's less prosperous regions, not only in respect of existing Community policies such as the CAP and the Common Fisheries Policy, for example, but also in the case of new policy areas provided for in the SEA, such as research and technological development and the environment.  This, I should emphasise, of course, is not uniquely an Irish concern but is also in the overall interests of the Community, whose potential will not be fully exploited and whose capacity to take decisions would be seriously impaired unless all regions of the Community share equitably in the benefits of further integration.</P>
    <P>As we have highlighted in chapter 2 of the national plan, the role of the Community in terms of the pursuit of a common macro-economic strategy at Community level designed to ensure that the Community economy expands at a rate in line with its potential and that the potential benefits of the internal market are fully realised, and the implementation of the internal market programme <Col N="1589" /> and the development of Community policies in accordance with the spirit of the cohesion provisions of the Single European Act are of crucial importance in ensuring that the objectives which we have set in the plan are realised.</P>
    <P>The co-ordination of economic policies within the Community has now been given added significance and impetus with the requirement in the Single European Act that member states shall conduct their economic policies and shall co-ordinate them in such a way as, in addition, to attain the cohesion objectives of the Single Act.  By way of follow-up on this the new co-ordinating regulation and related entries in the minutes of the Council provide that the assessment of programmes assisted by the funds shall take account, <i>inter alia,</i> of macro-economic effects and performance and the extent to which programmes complement national policies.</P>
    <P>This provides a strengthened basis for the pursuit of the Community's Co-operative growth strategy whose importance was again underlined in the market results described in last year's Cecchini report on the Internal Market and which would provide major benefits in tackling more effectively the still unacceptably high level of unemployment in the Community and in maximising the gains from the internal market.  The House will recall from the debate which we had here at the time of its publication that the Cecchini report identified that coupled with an appropriately growth-oriented economic policy, the benefits at Community level of the internal market could be as high as an increase in GNP of up to 7 per cent &mdash; additional to the economic growth which would otherwise occur &mdash; while the increase in net new jobs would be five million.</P>
    <P>In short, given the limited size of our domestic market and with the Community market accounting for threequarters of our exports, the realisation of our economic potential is critically dependent on growth conditions in the markets of our Community partners.  In this context and viewed in historical perspective, it is notable and striking that <Col N="1590" /> between 1960 and the first oil crisis in 1973 when the Community economy was at its most dynamic, economic convergence improved fairly steadily with cross-country deviations of GNP <i>per capita</i> narrowing substantially.</P>
    <P>Indeed, during that period the four poorest countries now in the Community &mdash; Ireland, Greece, Portugal and Spain &mdash; managed on average to reduce the gap separating them from the four highest member states by about one third. However, since 1973 the convergence process has not only halted but has even gone into reverse and the gap between the four poorest and the four highest member states has widened by 5.5 percentage points.</P>
    <P>One of the central objectives of the plan is, through addressing the economy's structural weaknesses and deficiencies and increasing productive investment, to accelerate economic growth here on a sound and sustainable basis.  On the basis of the development measures put forward and the assistance from the Structural Funds, Deputies will have noted that the plan provides for a higher growth rate of the period to the mid-nineties than the average for the Community as a whole.</P>
    <P>Achievement of the targets in the plan which we believe are realistic and attainable is of particular significance, therefore, in helping us to narrow the gap between living standards here and those in the more prosperous areas of the Community. To the extent that the Community succeeds in fully exploiting all the opportunities which the internal market will create, our prospects and opportunities would of course be all the greater. In conclusion, the plan and supporting programmes which we have formulated provide this country with an unprecedented opportunity, in partnership with the European Commission, to consolidate the solid progress which the Government have already achieved in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>, and thereby opens up a new horizon of higher growth, increased employment and higher living standards for all our people.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1591" /> In the process, the Community will have demonstrated in a very practical way its commitment to the achievement of the cohesion objectives in the Single European Act of greater convergence in living standards and, in turn, this country will be better positioned to contribute to and participate more fully and effectively in the prospects which are opening up towards further steps in the Community's development and strengthening to which we are fully committed and which we know is also shared by the vast majority of our people.</P>

      <P>I welcome the <i>National Development Plan</i> but it can be described as very appealing but very misleading indeed.  This plan could be rejected by the European Commission if it does not comply with strict EC rules. The plan seeks £3.35 billion from the Structural Funds with matching Exchequer funds of £3.6 billion &mdash; wherever that is to be found I do not know &mdash; plus £2.15 billion from the private sector. I ask the Taoiseach if he intends to borrow this £3.6 billion over the next five years or is it to be raised by taxation on the few remaining people left in the country?  I would like the Taoiseach and his Ministers to answer these questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is no good producing the glossy <i>National Development Plan</i> that is being debated here yesterday, today and tomorrow without knowing where this money is to be found.  The EC placed an increased emphasis on value for money from the programme funded.  There will be a move away from short term income support towards investment which will stress the infrastructural development of the poorer regions of the country so that they can create their own jobs and raise their living standards on a par with the rest of the Community.  I am afraid this plan lacks the initiative to tackle that problem we have for the poorer regions of the State.  As a Member of Dáil Éireann elected for Cork South-West let me say it is evident that there is a great deal of poverty in that constituency. <Col N="1592" /> There is inactivity and a lack of Government interest in the area.</P>
    <P>In the plan the Government have reversed planned reductions in public capital expenditure on infrastructural developments.  They are now planning for Exchequer spending on airports, roads, education, industry and training.  I will deal with some of those commitments later in my speech.</P>
    <P>It is clearly stated that some of the State agencies, including Coillte Teoranta and Telecom Éireann, have put forward planned Government budgets in their submission for EC funding.  That is to replace planned Exchequer funding with EC funding, contrary to the additionality rule.  Under the rigorous rules relating to additionality any agreed expenditure commitments for the years 1989 to 1993 must be spent on further structural measures.</P>
    <P>The content of the plan, which has been shrouded in secrecy for the past few months, has at long last been unveiled in this document.  The Taoiseach was ill advised not to consult the leader of our party and the leaders of all the other Opposition parties in the Dáil to ensure that we would reach a national consensus before he submitted this document to Brussels.  Why the great secrecy surrounding this plan?  If we were truly patriotic surely we would have consulted the elected public representatives.  I was amazed the other day to see a Government Deputy shedding crocodile tears at a meeting of Cork County Council because he was not getting unanimous approval of the plan.  Where was the co-operation from the Taoiseach and his Ministers who formulated this plan? Where was the co-operation with this House?  Neither the leaders of the Opposition parties nor the elected representatives were consulted before the plan was submitted to Brussels.</P>
    <P>There was a fanfare of trumpets at the recent press conference introducing the plan but the press reporters who attended were unanimous that they were completely at sea as far as understanding what was going on.  It was a well orchestrated launch of the plan but no matter what <Col N="1593" /> whitewashing is done behind closed doors it will not camouflage the problems and the poverty which exist in rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>Ireland is the third poorest of the 12 EC countries and has the second highest unemployment rate in the EC.  At 19 per cent of the population it is second only to Spain's 21 per cent.  Ireland therefore has a strong case for a high level of grant assistance from the EC but there is no guarantee that more will be granted in the expanded Structural Funds than has been given to date.  The objectives of the expanded funds are to assist development in five areas.  Ireland is classified under objective one as a less developed region. The objectives are to help regions suffering from industrial decline, long-term unemployment, those in need of aid for young people and in need of rural development.  Of the three funds, the Regional Fund will be most important for objective one regions, with up to 80 per cent of allocations available.</P>
    <P>The net benefit to Ireland to date has been from the agricultural price support fund, CAP, and the European Social Fund.  The news emanating from Europe now is that the CAP is to be wound down and over the next five years the net transfer to this country will be addressed to regional and social problems.</P>
    <P>Ireland suffers from major cost disadvantages due to its peripheral island location and consequent heavy reliance on sea and air transport.  The small size of the Irish market, less than 1 per cent of the EC total, compounds this problem and makes Ireland relatively more dependent on exports.  Transport costs for Irish exporters to Europe are approximately twice those incurred by countries trading with one another on the European mainland.</P>
    <P>Agriculture plays a major role in our economy.  It accounts for 11 per cent of the GDP and employs 15 per cent of the total working population.  In addition, 20 per cent of the manufacturing sector is engaged in the food processing industry. The importance of agriculture to the economy as a whole leaves Ireland particularly vulnerable to change in the <Col N="1594" /> Common Agricultural Policy.  Direct employment in agriculture has been declining steadily.  Our farming population has decreased alarmingly during the past few years.  Unless serious steps are taken by the Government to arrest this decline we will eventually see the demise of all the small farmers along the western seaboard from Malin Head to Mizen Head.</P>

      <P>Tourism is another major industry which must be nurtured and aided under the plan.  It accounts for 67,000 full-time jobs, equivalent to 6 per cent of the total labour force, while export earnings from this sector makes it Ireland's third largest source of foreign earnings.  Ireland has a considerable natural advantage in terms of tourism with a rich cultural heritage, a tradition of friendliness and hospitality and a relatively unspoilt environment with an abundance of clear air and fresh water.</P>
      <P>It is most important that immediate steps be taken by the Taoiseach and the Government to restore the ferry link between Cork and Swansea and thereby give the necessary up-lift to the tourist industry in this job-starved area, the south-western region.  How serious are the Taoiseach and his Ministers about the development of tourism?  They have failed hopelessly to maintain a ferry service from Cork to Swansea.  How are we to develop tourism in the south-western region when the major link with Great Britain and the Continent is left to die a lingering death?  If the Taoiseach and his Ministers were genuine in their approach to tourism why did they allow this service to be strangled by lack of financial commitment? It is clearly evident that there will be no development of tourism in the south-west region while there is no ferry service from Cork to Swansea.</P>

      <P>How can tourism flourish in the south-west?  The Minister of State is conversant with the tourist industry and knows how dependent the south-west was on the Cork-Swansea ferry service. How can the industry flourish with the type of treatment it is getting from a native Government.  At the same time the same Government granted B &amp; I over £30 million of State money to keep it going last year and to create a fares war between the Cork-Swansea ferry and the B &amp; I ferry.  The eastern part of the country is favoured with special attention from the Government, receiving £33 million in State aid for their ferry service while the south-west was denied the relatively small sum of money that they were looking for.  If the Government are so committed to tourism, why did they not stipulate that the B &amp; I should maintain a service from Cork to Swansea as well as from Dublin to Holyhead?</P>

At least Deputy Walsh has the guts to try to promote the region.

      <P>Fishing is another industry which must get prominence under the <i>National Development Plan.</i> For years it has been treated as a hind tit industry. There is a lack of infrastructure at fishing harbours and structural weaknesses in the fleet and in the processing and marketing sectors are significant obstacles to the future growth of what could be a great industry if it got the funding it should have got over the years.  Improvement of roads leading to fishing ports such as Castletownbere is most important if the industry is to survive.  Why have the Government this year reduced the road fund grant for the improvement of the Glengarriff-Castletownbere road by 50 per cent?  Is that Fianna Fáil's commitment to the development of infrastructure and roads leading to major fishery ports?</P>

If that road were on the eastern seaboard the road fund grant would not be reduced by 50 per cent; the road would be made into an autobahn to cater for the &ldquo;special&rdquo; people who exist in the eastern half of this country.</P>

What steps is he going to take to vehemently oppose such moves in the interests of the Irish fishermen? Is this one of the agreements that the Taoiseach reached with President Mikhail Gorbachev when he entertained him in Shannon airport?  I would like to ask the Minister of State, Deputy Walsh, if this is part of the new inter-trade agreement that has been reached between Ireland and the Soviet Union.</P>

      <P>I would also urge the Minister to take recognition of the Castletownbere Fishermens Organisation and the co-ops who today are vehemently protesting against EC moves to allow Soviet fishing vessels to operate in Irish waters and to catch those two species of fish that are not under quota to our Irish fishermen.  Those are the only two species of fish available to Irish fishermen that are not subject to quota. There are now moves a foot to let the Russians have a lucrative harvest on our fishing waters while at the same time the quotas are dwindling in the Irish fishing industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there is to be a future in the National Development Plan for the fishing industry the Taoiseach and his Cabinet should adopt a more comprehensive policy towards this very important industry.  It is clearly evident that no serious consideration has been given by the present administration to the development of this industry which could and would create an enormous number of jobs under the five year plan.  Unless some efforts are made to renegotiate the quota system, every trawler that is owned by the Irish fishing fleet will die in debt because there is no way the fishermen can survive.  We are an island and we will be the only member state in Europe separated from the mainland when Great Britain have access through their newly constructed tunnel. Ireland has access to 24 per cent of the <Col N="1599" /> fishing waters of the EC but only less than 5 per cent of the catch.  It is high time that the Taoiseach and his Cabinet Ministers, if they are sincere in their efforts to develop fishing, take immediate steps to wipe out the anomalies that exist in the fishing industry and make sure that proper attention is given to it.</P>
    <P>I will return to agriculture, an industry that is very important to this country. During my term as a public representative in the past 20 years, I have had the distinction of serving on the old county committees of agriculture from 1972 onwards and on ACOT committees throughout the country.  I had the distinction of being in ACOT when Teagasc took over.  I would ask the Minister who is now listening to me &mdash; he knows what agriculture means to this country &mdash; if the farmers were better off under the old committees of agriculture system than they are now under the newly formed body called Teagasc.  Under the old committees of agriculture system representatives were elected by the people and they could demand a vote whenever the occasion arose.  In ACOT that was reduced by 50 per cent and in Teagasc it is a completely closed shop.  The elected representatives of Ireland are completely denied the right to speak on behalf of the people who elect them.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food if he is aware that no assistance or direction is given now by the agricultural instructors because they have neither the time nor the money to do so.  They are not allowed to visit the farmer unless he pays £30 or £40 per visit.  Is this the answer to the development of the major industry in this country?  I would ask the Minister of State to implore the Taoiseach to at least give the farmers some recognition, to give them an opportunity of developing an industry that is capable of progressing.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, it seems that commitments are given in the plan to improving the structural condition of major road <Col N="1600" /> networks throughout the country but it is sad to think that the five major recommendations for priority in this National Development Plan, this famous plan which, according to Deputy Máire Geoghegan-Quinn, is supposed to be the cure for all ills, are Dublin to the Border, Dublin to Kinnegad, Dublin to Portlaoise, Dublin to Rosslare and a new national road now in progress around Dublin city.  No emphasis has been placed by the Minister for the Environment in the plan on the creation of a national primary road structure from Cork city to Schull, onto Bantry and Castletownbere. Neither is there any provision for the upgrading to national secondary status of the county road leading from Bantry to Bandon.  This is an area greater than many counties in Ireland and yet it has not been recognised for one mile of a national primary route.  I sincerely hope that the Taoiseach and the Minister will review the position when the funding becomes available from the National Development Plan and give due consideration to this area which plays a unique role in agriculture, fishery and tourism development.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. J. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The <i>National Development Plan</i> envisages total expenditure of £9.1 billion over <Col N="1602" /> the five year period to 1993.  That will amount to an expenditure of approximately £2,000 million per annum and for that reason I cannot understand the complaining and whinging about it.  After all, the plan envisages the most substantial expenditure on any plan since the foundation of the State.  The plan, for the first time in the history of planning here, has a substantive sub-regional content.  That includes, for each of the seven sub-regions, an analysis of the socio-economic situation, the establishment of development objectives and the identification of development measures, as well as the planned expenditure in the structural area for the five years to 1993.</P>
      <P>I shall discuss the plan in relation to the food industry and in the course of my contribution I shall refer to its proposals for the south-west sub-region.  My ministerial colleagues have dealt in detail with the other aspects of the plan.  It is because of my specific ministerial responsibilities that I shall refer to the role of the food industry in the overall strategy of the plan.  Since the commencement of their period in office, the Government have given the highest priority to the food industry and the reasons for that should be obvious.  We have first class raw materials produced in one of the cleanest environments in the world.  We have a tradition of food production and we have the research infrastructure which is central to the success of that industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is because of the Government's determination to realise the full potential of the food industry that a five year strategy for its development was prepared and published in 1988.  That strategy provides for a change in emphasis in State support for food processing projects away from grants for fixed assets to support for the total business.  In the case of medium and large enterprises this support will be dependent on the achievement of specific targets, for example, job creation and marketing.  In the case of new and small <Col N="1603" /> enterprises support will be dependent on the development of niche products.  This strategy is not altered by the <i>National Development Plan.</i> Indeed, the only changes is that additional assistance, made possible by the enlargement of the Structural Funds, is envisaged.</P>
    <P>The total investment requirement of the food industry over the period of the plan is estimated at £750 million.  In the last two years £250 million has been invested in the food industry which means that in the next five years £1,000 million will be invested in that industry.  That amounts to a substantial investment by any standards.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no evidence of that in the Minister of State's constituency, south-west Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that the Deputy reads tomorrow's edition of the <i>Cork Examiner</i> for information about a major announcement for that area.  Of the figure I have announced, it is considered that £300 million, and possibly as much as £500 million, will qualify for FEOGA assistance.  It is clear that, as the plan states, a continuing and stronger role for FEOGA is essential for the development of the food industry.  I should like to tell Deputy Sheehan that we had a most pleasant time in the constituency of south-west Cork, in Kinsale, last weekend.  Visitors from all over the globe converged on Kinsale to sample the food and to talk to those involved in the food industry and those in the culinary business in Kinsale.  Their unanimous verdict was that we have superb food and that it was served up in a wonderful area. I had hoped to meet Deputy Sheehan there because we had some nice samples of food and local beverages.  It would have been nice to join him sampling some of the local brew.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is little point in having food and beverages if we do not <Col N="1604" /> have the people to eat and drink them. It is a pity the Minister did not announce the restoration of the Cork-Swansea ferry service which would have been more beneficial to the people of that part of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Cork were beating Kerry in the park at the time these functions were taking place but we managed to attract a massive crowd to Kinsale, I am glad to say.  In my view we will reap benefits from that weekend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>One swallow never made a summer.  The Minister should move further west to see the desolation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the Government's aim to do everything possible to ensure that food companies are strategically positioned to avail of the enhanced market opportunities of the Single European Market.  I am delighted that so many food companies are gearing themselves to avail of a market that will increase from £3.5 million people to 320 million people.  Only an aggressive international marketing strategy will maximise our food exports and create extra jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>How does the Minister intend to bring them in?  Will it be by not air balloons?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>This market oriented approach is an essential prerequisite for the future expansion and development of the food industry.  The plan envisages increased funding for marketing and, indeed, as a first step in this direction £3 million was provided in the 1989 budget to strengthen marketing support service for firms, including those in the food and beverage industry.  There are good grounds for optimism and I am confident that the Government's current economic strategy, coupled with a practical and businesslike response from those involved in the industry, will prove the right recipe for our future success.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>This amounts to a very feeble approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to marketing I should like to say I am glad another Cork firm, Agra Ltd., based at Watergrasshill, announced a major development programme costing £151 million. Of that figure £50 million is earmarked for marketing and promotion.  That is the type of confidence that epitomises the new breed of entrepreneurs here.  They are getting the maximum Government support for their enterprises.  I should like to tell the House that one of the major retail outlets in the Federal Republic of Germany, a co-op group who have more than 2,000 outlets, launched a programme to boost the retail sale of Irish goods.  The first consignment amounted to £70 million.  The reason that group embarked on that programme was because of the quality of Irish food exported from one of the best locations in Europe.  I am determined that our environment will be protected because it has proved to be such a valuable asset.</P>
      <P>I should now like to deal with the problems of the south-west sub-region.  I am familiar with them.  The principle assets of the sub-region include a magnificant environment for the production of wholesome food products, large areas of beautiful landscape with extensive mountains and coastline, and a plentiful labour force, many of whom are young and well educated.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Other assets include a relatively well developed physical infrastructure in the Cork area and its associated business and specialist services sector.  We have the Ringaskiddy Industrial Estate and the deep water resource of Bantry Bay.  There is also the potential of third level institutions.  I am pleased that in the plan the third level institutions, University College Cork, the regional <Col N="1606" /> technical college at Bishopstown, the micro electronics centre and the research station in Moorepark, are included in the plan for the sub-region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>And there is not anything in it for our constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Those institutions have been included in the plan because they have a tremendous contribution to make in the education of people from the Munster region.  The micro electronics centre and the research station at Moorepark have a supportive role to play in the development of technology for industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the roads?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Major drawbacks derive from the subregion's peripheral location and its distance from major markets.  This could become even more marked after the completion of the single internal market.  Parts of the subregion, notably west Cork, those areas in the western part of south-west Cork and indeed south Kerry are particularly disadvantaged and isolated.  In addition to low productivity and limited adaptability of many local enterprises, technology, marketing and financial resources are depleted in that subregion.  It does suffer from serious infrastructural problems which not only restrict access to national primary routes but also cause difficulties from the point of view of inter-town travel within the subregion.  I am always delighted to facilitate and introduce people not alone from Dublin but from Europe to Cork south-west in order to highlight for them the disadvantages we suffer on account of location and our poor run-down roads network.  I will continue to make the strongest possible representations to have these structures improved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The subregional plan identifies a strategy for future development based on the restoration of growth momentum to an internationally competitive manufacturing sector.  For example, I am <Col N="1607" /> delighted to be able to say that in Bantry we have the Bantry Bay Mussels Company which is internationally competitive&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>Even though the Minister asked me a while ago what we had done with the money.  That is one major industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge that.  It is great to see the initiative and innovation of that company, selling oysters in France, in Paris in particular, giving very good employment in Bantry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Had we the remainder we would have a great time altogether. Again I reiterate that the subregional plan identifies a strategy for future development based on the development of internationally traded services, particularly the area's great tourism potential, and the augmentation of those main elements by efforts to stabilise the rural population through an integrated rural development programme for both the mainland and island communities.</P>

      <P>I am absolutely certain about it.  Indeed I should like to pay tribute to the Federal Republic of Germany authorities who gave tremendous technical assistance in relation to that project. It is not alone of tremendous benefit to Oilean Cléire but also of tremendous educational benefit in the generation of electricity from that source.</P>

    <P>The other gem to which I want to refer <Col N="1610" /> is the star gazing planetarium we have out in Schull.  There is no doubt but that it constitutes a tremendous resource there.  I know there had been an amount of star gazing going on at all times in that region.</P>

      <P>We need technology and marketing support matched to the requirements of local business.  It is encouraging that in a number of rural towns in coastal areas there is sufficient technology to provide jobs for people located in those towns and employed by <Col N="1613" /> firms in New York or some other part of the world.  This gives me great confidence that rural and coastal areas will improve their positions substantially over the next few years.  They will no longer be disadvantaged by isolation when they can make telecommunications contact simultaneously&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Last year, for the first time in many years, there was an increase of 6,000 in the number of additional jobs created and I have no doubt that in line with the improvement in the economy other additional jobs will be created, and it is the jobs in the coastal and rural areas I am particularly concerned about.  We have a skilled, adaptable and highly educated work force and it is no joy for me or for anybody else to see and hear about not alone one member but sometimes all the members of a family who have had to leave this country.  It is bad enough that they have to leave the country but it is worse when they end up as illegal aliens in other countries sometimes working in menial jobs but many times working in occupational which do no justice to their educational qualifications and will not enhance their particular profile, status or CV so that they can do better when they come back home or go elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A set of coherent and integrated actions are necessary to achieve the over-all objectives under the various headings in the plan, such as agriculture and rural development.  I have already mentioned the pilot programme which is in position. Deputy Sheehan referred to fisheries development and there is no doubt that in coastal regions fisheries is the single most important matter in relation to the development of the area and the creation <Col N="1614" /> of jobs for people.  There is a major fisheries port in Castletownbere in the south-west sub-region and the co-op and companies such as Ríocht Fish Ltd., which has recently been taken over, and Fast Fish Ltd. are giving tremendous employment in that area.  The developments which have taken place there in the past few years give great grounds for optimism.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to go into all the individual actions under the various headings in this plan.  However, at this stage I should like to refer specifically to what I consider to be two of the most important agricultural proposals in the <i>National Development Plan</i> which will have particular significance for the south-west sub-region, the first of which is the extension to the rest of the country of the anti-pollution measures in the western package.  This will enable farmers in areas outside of the western package area to receive grant aid in order to provide anti-pollution facilities and effluent disposal facilities in their farmyards.  The Department of the Environment and the Department of Agriculture and Food have very stringent regulations in relation to the environment and effluent treatment, and rightly so, but it is fair to give some encouragement and incentive to the farming community to help them provide the very costly buildings and effluent disposal treatment plants which they have to put in at farm level.</P>
    <P>The second proposal relates to the aid to enable farmers in areas considered to be environmentally sensitive to carry out their operations in a way which will not only prevent damage to the environment but which will positively improve it.  The significance of these proposals to the south-west sub-region is considerable because of the central role of tourism in that sub-region, a role which I might mention will be further enhanced by the specific proposals in the plan to develop rural tourism, which I hope will be announced in the next couple of weeks.</P>
    <P>Total expenditure in the structural area <Col N="1615" /> in the south-west sub-region over the five year period 1989-93 is estimated at £1,254 million.  It is proposed to put forward £842 million of that amount for assistance from the Structural Funds which it is envisaged will amount to £487 million. When all is said and done the aim of the plan for this country must be to create an environment in which people can work and live in prosperity and contentment. That is what the Government's plan sets out to do by creating more jobs and thus enabling our young people to remain at home and make their contribution to their communities.  I believe immense benefits will accrue to the people of the south-west region and the people of Ireland as a whole if we grasp the opportunity now presented to us by the enlargement of the EC Structural Funds and the Government's carefully thought-out strategy to avail of the funds, to improve our economic and social conditions and bring about a better life for the generations of Irish Europeans who will succeed us.</P>

      <P>Having listened to the detailed debate and the cut and thrust between the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food, Deputy Joe Walsh, and Deputy Sheehan, I began to wonder could we be here discussing the same document; was this debate actually centred around a national development plan or was it in fact, as I think it is, very much an opportunity for many people to say a lot of diverse things in the context of a document which concentrates the minds of nobody on the real issues which confront us.</P>
      <P>The circumstances in which this National Development Plan, as it terms itself but which I believe it is not, was launched spoke volumes about the plan itself.  There was an element of absurd melodrama about the Taoiseach presenting this document with the strains of Mise Éire, which seems to have become his personal anthem, playing in the background to a captive audience of the captains of industry and the political and economic hyperbole, known as hype, all lent a sense of surrealist fantasy to what was in fact a rather sad and I believe pathetic occasion in terms of democracy and economic maturity.  When the dust settled and the contrived euphoria which the publicity people had created had lifted and the adrenalin coursing through the Government's veins drained away, the process of cool, rational and dispassionate examination of this so-called National Development Plan was bound to begin, and it has.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Between its purple covers lie a set of predictions, propositions and assumptions which do not together constitute a plan, not even a programme, but I believe a rather flaccid expression of vague aspirations which are totally inadequate. Worse still, the paper deliberately exaggerated, distorted and falsified the facts <Col N="1617" />&mdash; as many of us know them to be &mdash; in order to lend spurious weight of its contents.  Most importantly the paper completely failed to deal with the extent of our unemployment problem and the impediments to overcoming it as central issues requiring examination, analysis and reform.</P>
    <P>This document is devoid of original or creative planning but it is rich in spurious detail and spurious projections.  This is contrived to give the reader a sense of exactitude and accuracy which is wholly unwarranted.  The paper purports to concern itself with structural measures and to constitute a plan for the deployment of European Structural Funds in the Irish economy over the next five years, but the first, and most obvious whopper, is the suggestion that the paper is a £9.2 billion plan.  The additional projected injection of European Structural Funds over existing levels is roughly £1.5 billion spread over five years, or £300 million per annum.  That figure of £300 million sounds great and it sounds large until we remind ourselves that it represents only an annual capital investment of between £90 and £100 for every man, woman and child in this country and that it is not likely to make a real difference to their well being, assuming a real return of about 10 per cent or about £10 a year for every person in this country.  That is the measure of this so called £9.2 billion plan.</P>
    <P>Seen in this light the £300 million total annual increase in Structural Funds for Ireland is very small indeed, especially when compared with the scale of the problems which 1992 will bring in its wake, including a revenue loss to the Exchequer of between £300 and £500 million, estimated by the Government, not to mention the destructive effects on our present economic arrangements of increased external penetration of our markets.  I am not against 1992, I favour it absolutely, but I think it will present huge problems for a peripheral economy like ours.  I am saying that the additional investment of £300 million per annum to <Col N="1618" /> the Irish economy over each of the next five years is not an adequate response to the problems which an integrated market creates and that this plan, in particular, for reasons which I will set out later, is an inadequate way to plan and to project how that money could be spent.</P>
    <P>The £9.2 billion figure which the Taoiseach used to conjure up a sense of awe and anticipation in the minds of the ordinary people of this country is an economic mirage, a phoney conflation of what is inevitable anyway &mdash; spending that will happen whether there is a plan or not &mdash; with what is irrelevant, and that is spending which has nothing to do with the European Structural Funds.</P>
    <P>The largest part of the £9.2 billion is £3.6 billion which is supposed to come from this State in the form of the public capital programme.  Let us be fair and honest about that; that amount is the present rate of public capital expenditure frozen at present levels effectively and projected over five years.  That is not new; that is something which is reduced in terms of volume over the level it held, say, two years ago.  There is no additionality implicit in the Irish State contribution to this so called £9.2 billion fund.  On the contrary, compared with two years ago, the level of the State's capital expenditure will be lower on an annual basis.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the third component of this £9.2 billion fantasy figure of the Taoiseach, that the private sector is supposed to be making a contribution of £2.1 billion towards the implementation of the plan.  That suggestion fools nobody, and especially it will cut no ice with the Commission of the European Community. The £2.1 billion aggregate figure is arrived at by conflating the anticipated level of private investment in IDA backed projects and the like with a tiny and economically insignificant private sector investment in what I would call structural investments, such as toll roads. Of the 2.1 billion anticipated to be expended by the private sector in support <Col N="1619" /> of this so-called plan over five years, a very tiny fraction &mdash; less than 1 in 10 &mdash; is represented by anything to do with improving our infrastructural base. Again, we are describing things which are either inevitable or irrelevant as a portion of this plan.</P>
    <P>Shorn of its pretentions, stripped of its baubles and its exaggerations, this paper is no more and no less than a hamfisted, transparent and amateurish description of how the Government, while reining in their own capital investment, intend to cajole the European Community to part with the modest structural investment in the order of £90 for each member of our population for each of the next five years. That is not by any standard a new economic Jerusalem.</P>
    <P>The absurdity of the process of regional consultation has been referred to by other speakers in this debate and, doubtless, will be referred to again.  I am not going to repeat them or anticipate them.  Suffice it to say that it would have been better if this paper had emerged from a real national debate at regional and national level, rather than being published and then subjected to what is, in effect, a mock debate.  That is what is going on in this House because there is no real chance of changing the plan.  It is very vaguely presented.  We have heard speeches supporting it and underpinning it, which consist of waffle and hyperbole for the main part.</P>
    <P>If there had been a real national debate identifying specific items and targets on which people could have exercised their critical faculties and talked about the choices which were to be made, at a time when choices could be altered and influenced, then I believe we would never have seen a document of this kind presented to this House in its present vacuous and tendentious form.</P>
    <P>There is by now a well established system of writing economic programmes. Its chief element involves this: you cast about for facts and figures from all the <Col N="1620" /> State agencies, who appear to be only too happy to oblige the Government of the day by submitting an up-beat description of what their activities are and what they plan to do over the next few years.  These corporate and semi-State aspirations are then aggregated and used to flesh out the skeleton of the paper's chapter structure. The immediate political purpose is to gorge the reader with details, and particularly the press who read them and give response within 12 hours as to whether it is detailed or not and looks convincing, and by that means create the impression that the document somehow is the master plan by which all the disparate and autonomous events, which are in no way related to it, are governed and regulated by it and carried on in accordance with it.</P>
    <P>You read about the corporate plans of Telecom &mdash; they are there whether or not that document is produced.  You read about the national roads plan &mdash; we have heard about that for the last two years. You read what the ESB are planning to do, what An Post are planning to do in setting up new offices in Dublin.  All these things were planned and did not come into being because the word went out that this document, with its purple cover, was to be published.  But they are all brought into the document to pad it out with detail and to so gorge the reader with a sense of detail and minutiae that it appears to the gullible that the plan is designed to bring these events about.  Of course it is not.  It seems to work as far as some of the more gullible or lazy members of the Fourth Estate are concerned.</P>

      <P>A particular example of just how dishonest this document is can be found on page 37.  I would refer the Government to this page and ask them to explain to the Irish electorate how they can seriously stand over this <Col N="1621" /> document as an honest statement of intent as opposed to mere propaganda.</P>
      <P>Paragraph 2.3.5 reads:</P>
      <P>Specifically the objective will be to create 20,000 extra manufacturing jobs per year on average over 1989-1993, and to continue to contribute strongly to further employment creation in the services sector through the multiplier effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The phrase I want to bear in on most is &ldquo;to create 20,000 extra manufacturing jobs&rdquo;.  The word &ldquo;extra&rdquo; means something to me, and one does not have to be a politician, a lawyer or a third level education graduate to give a simple meaning to &ldquo;extra&rdquo;.  It means-over and above that which would otherwise be.  It means a net addition.  There is no point in talking about extra, when one means new and replacement jobs for jobs which are going out of existence.  Yet this document has the brass neck and the effrontery to suggest that it is planned to create 20,000 extra jobs per year over a five-year period.  That would mean 100,000 extra manufacturing jobs, and when one takes the multiplier effect in the service industry into account, would provide every person who is now emigrating with a job, if one assumes that 25,000 or 30,000 extra jobs will be created by this plan.  The word &ldquo;extra&rdquo; is used there utterly dishonestly, because it does not mean extra at all.  What this is talking about is gross job renewal in the context of high redundancy.  It appears that where extra is used here it means the diametric opposite.  It means substitute jobs.  When one examines this paper rather than plan, it means that as far as the Irish economy is concerned 25,000 or 30,000 people will continue to emigrate each year.  As far as we are concerned it can be confidently said that this paper is based on the premises that by year five the economy will have failed an extra 400,000 people, more than half of whom will still be on the dole and the rest will have emigrated or will be in job training schemes.  About 400,000 people stand to be failed by the Irish <Col N="1622" /> economy on the projections implicit in this document.  The suggestion on page 37 of this document that it is concerned with bringing about 20,000 extra jobs and downstream jobs in the services sector is simply false propaganda which deserves to be exposed as such.</P>
    <P>Instead of facing that reality the paper's authors chose to phrase it as to suggest somehow that the expenditure of the European Structural and Regional Funds would create an extra 20,000 jobs in each of the next five years.  That was shamefully dishonest, but the great danger in a paper of this kind is that some people may actually be persuaded that there is now in place a plan or programme which by itself amounts to some adequate response to the very real fiscal difficulties and economic disadvantages under which the Irish economy labours.  It may persuade the naive that the Government have set out a programme of reform which will turn this economy round, but they have not done so.</P>
    <P>Employment, which is the central issue in Irish politics and economics and in terms of achieving social justice and tackling poverty, is not substantially addressed in this paper.  If it was, the Government would have had to spell out the actual steps the Government propose to take over five years to reduce the employment tax wedge &mdash; that is the difference between gross payroll costs and take-home pay which in Ireland is the highest by far of the European Community countries and which unremedied completely undermines any efforts to sustain employment or enterprise in Ireland especially in the context of a single market where there is mobile capital, labour and enterprise.  I will never tire of restating in this House or elsewhere the glaring truth that seems to be understood by everyone except the occupants, political and public service, of Merrion Street, that is, that with freedom of movement of capital, labour and enterprise the basic laws of economic gravity will tend to pull employment away from <Col N="1623" /> the periphery of the Community to the centre and that this process will be compounded and accelerated if our peripheral economy insists on loading its entire tax burden on to employment.</P>
    <P>There seems to be an error implicit in some of the responses we have heard and in some of the language employed in this document.  Tax reform is not a residual option contingent on an economic upturn.  It is an essential and integral part of the process of economic recovery.  No amount of transfer payments from the European Community will redress or reverse our unemployment unless and until our Government accept that there must be a stated sustained and achieveable strategy set out in a five-year programme for radical reform of our tax system on employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I tender my extreme thanks to Deputy McDowell for affording me the opportunity to speak here tonight since I will unavoidably not be here tomorrow.  I was surprised to find that the line that Deputy McDowell is taking differs only slightly from mine in regard to this plan.  Had I more time I would elaborate, but I will try now to deal with the bones of what is flawed in so far as this document is concerned. There was a lot of hype about the regional and deep study and the input by vocational and other interests throughout the country.  That is all a lot of poppycock. I happened to be on a committee which was given four days, starting on Friday, to consider this document and have it in with the central authority. <Col N="1625" /> South-west Ireland do not have theirs in yet despite the fact that the overall plan has already gone to Brussels.  I also learned from those who participated in the central consideration of all that was put together and eventually sifted out, that in fact it was presided over by somebody or other from the Department of Finance, no doubt with a pre-determined arrangement as to what was to go through.  Instead of discussion and elaboration within the committee as one might expect, the committee were told what they were to do.  The result was a concoction that was costed before it went to the Community as an application for funds.</P>
      <P>We should underline that the £9 billion, is the costed amount of the proposals sent to the Community.  That we will get that sum is beyond anybody's conception, unless he is a fool.  We will be lucky if we get two thirds, or one third. Good and helpful though the Structural Funds may be, they are only transitory, only passing assistance, to try to take us out of the potholes.  They will not permanently surface the road that we have to travel.  We can be sure that that assistance will disappear at some stage and then where will we be?  The projections and costings in this plan are, as Deputy McDowell said, in most cases merely an adding together of the plans already established and achievable but which will be achieved more quickly with money from Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most of the proposals contained in the plan will leave no lasting benefit.  They will create an economic upsurge.  We may even take back workers from abroad for a five year period but it will taper off and then we shall find ourselves in a worse position than when we started.  What if our roads, our harbours, our air services and our airports are better if activity within the country on a real competitive basis is not possible?  And it is not possible in this peripheral area.  To be able to shift our goods more quickly and more conveniently will not make those goods <Col N="1626" /> competitive within the overall Community market, where the multinationals reign supreme, as they do now, with the raw materials at their doorstep, their markets immediately surrounding them and a manufacturing scale to which we can never aspire.  We cannot compete and 1992 is far removed from a golden age.  It is the greatest hype of all time. Rather can it be the year of disaster and further decline in this country.</P>
    <P>Any development by way of having more educated young people available will not be to the benefit of this country or adding to its wealth.  Rather will they continue to be exported, as now, to add to the wealth of the multinationals in the heart of the Community.  I would trade the suggested £900,000 million and the Regional and Social Funds for a renegotiated policy on agriculture that would wipe out the quotas which are suppressing us and driving our small farmers off the map and for a renegotiation of our fishery policy which is restricted to the point where we cannot move one foot further.  That resulted from a stupid, unimaginative deal in 1972 made by people who obviously may have heard about the sea and even have seen it but knew little about what was in it.  Its riches are there in abundance off the west coast.</P>
    <P>There is talk about 20,000 jobs &mdash; whether these are real or imaginery as Deputy McDowell has said &mdash; and another 25,000 in tourism.  There are 20,000 to 30,000 additional jobs capable of being created on our west coast where they are needed most, if we are allowed to catch the fish off our own coasts rather than have the foreigner scooping them up and taking them away, all because we did not see where we were going in 1972 and paid no regard to the potential value of expansion of fisheries.  It is the single largest element for progress in the future and has not been accorded a place on the list of the main items in this document. It gets a few lines further on, as does forestry.  Agriculture is at the foot of the list, deliberately I have no doubt.  Due to <Col N="1627" /> the quota system we will not be allowed to improve our position as we could improve it from a very undeveloped state.</P>
    <P>Fisheries and agriculture are the only two elements where we are assured of the raw materials with which we can compete with any conglomerate throughout the world.  Ninety per cent of the raw materials used in every manufacturing industry must be brought in at high freight costs.  Practically 100 per cent of our exportable goods manufactured here must find a market abroad, on which we pay high freight charges.  We can work as diligently as we like, have all the airports and sea ports that we like and better roads, but that will not overcome the disadvantages of our peripherality which is geographical, immovable, unchanging.</P>
    <P>Let us be realistic and look for something long term to put us in a competitive position for all time.  Let us forget about the £900,000 million big apple that will not be thrown to us.  Those proposals have yet to be examined in Europe and undoubtedly the plans will not be funded to the full.  1992 was hyped up a year ago but the approach is more muted now. Reality is beginning to set in.  We should withdraw those proposals and start again, because we are merely providing for more international dole which will balance the overall price that we are paying by being members of the Community. We are members and will remain so.  We have paid the price and will continue to pay it everyday that even one of our young people goes out of the country.  If computed over the last five years, the cost would wipe out the quoted figures of increased output and increased exports. We would be getting less today rather than getting more.  The plan will not result in our being able to provide jobs at home for our young people.  Had we that amount along with what I have mentioned, we would be going somewhere.</P>
    <P>Peripherality is what our difficulties are all about.  This is why we went to the <Col N="1628" /> Common Market in the first place and listened to the talk about the wellbeing of those in the least favoured areas being equated with that of those in the best favoured areas.  With the best will in the world, no matter how you juggle the figures, relatively we are much worse off today than we were in 1973 <i>vis-á-vis</i>, for example, Germany and that will continue.</P>

      <P>I am very pleased to have the opportunity this evening to participate in this debate, as I was pleased also this morning, to speak on the National Development Plan.  I have listened to much of the debate which has ensued during the day.  As the House will know, I share with my colleague, Deputy Bertie Ahern, Minister for Labour, responsibility for training and education in connection with the European funds.  We are very pleased at the extremely high profile which that area has achieved in the plan's objectives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make it clear that I object very strongly to a statement made by Deputy Harte from the Fine Gael benches.  He stated that there was no money for education included in the National Development Plan.  My colleague, the Minister for Agriculture and Food, who was replying rebutted that claim and pointed out the exact figure which was under that heading in the plan.  However, I wish to state that our priorities are very clearly reflected in the section devoted to education and training.  The Minister for Labour and myself share a common portfolio in this area.  I am very pleased that <Col N="1629" /> such emphasis has been placed on the technological skills of our young people and on the need to advance those skills so that we can improve our preparedness, competitiveness and our readiness to compete on the European scene, which is the objective of the plan.</P>
    <P>The plan is developmental.  I am sure the House will share my viewpoint that had we not got our house in order over the past two years, the plan we submit would stand very little chance of success. Europe took cognisance of how we handled affairs on the domestic front in righting our finances and they saw fit to support us.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is with a great deal of anger and not a little regret that I raise this matter at this time because, if my information is correct, Paul Kane is on his <Col N="1630" /> way at this moment towards the cursed Border and has been for the past half hour.  That Border is the curse of our people and country.</P>
      <P>In order that his way be smoothed &mdash; something like the projections in the plan &mdash; we have 200 Garda backed up by the Army and all south bound roads blocked off, with an Irish Army helicopter in conjunction with two RUC or British Army helicopters in surveillance.  Paul Anthony Kane is for the high jump if he has not already crossed the line.</P>
      <P>I want to say seriously to the Minister, to the Government and every Member of this House that we should be ashamed to call ourselves an Irish Parliament.  I say that with all due respect to the fact that we have all been elected from the Twenty-Six Counties.  It makes me feel ridiculous, particularly when I am abroad, to meet people who ask the unanswerable question as to how our parliamentarians and Government or leading Opposition spokesmen are now on the bandwagon condemning the lack of justice in British courts campaigning for the release of the Birmingham Six and the Guildford Four and looking for a full pardon for the Maguires on the basis that all these people did not get a fair trial under the British jurisdiction when at the same time that Government are sending more of our citizens to be tried by those courts.  It is hypocrisy of the highest order.</P>
      <P>However, I would go further.  I will try not to bring in what I know of the Minister and the people who went before him. but it comes to mind that I am talking to a Minister who should know so much better, who rather than do what he has done now would cease to be a Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In sending this man across the Border we are dealing with extraordinary circumstances. When people talk about civilised countries or indeed so called noncivilised or under-developed countries &mdash; I never quite know whether they are talking about the unknown world or this God damned one we are living in.  Be what it <Col N="1631" /> may, Paul Kane was sent to Longkesh with ten or 12 more of his colleagues on the evidence of a supergrass.  During his internment, he found it possible to escape.  Subsequent to his escape the said evidence of the supergrass was found to be so flawed that even those extreme people who sent him behind bars decided that the evidence could not satisfy their biased outlook and they released those who were still imprisoned &mdash; in other words, they should never have been there.  In any man's language, without parsing and analysing it in a legalistic sense, the man was never in legal custody but was held unlawfully.  He escaped from it, but he is now being sent back, because of this and the 15 other trumped up charges &mdash; which we know they are so adept at when they are trying to get somebody.  However, the basic fact is that he was jailed in Longkesh on spurious evidence, escaped from it before his pals were released and now he is being sent back on the basic charge that he escaped from lawful custody, when we know that it was unlawful and the very release of the people who were imprisoned with him at the same time is evidence that he or they should never have been there.  He is now going to face a series of charges, some related to his escape from custody which was never lawful.</P>
    <P>He is one of our citizens, but we tend to forget that in this House.  We are so partition-minded that we tend to ask whether he is from the South or the North.  He is from Ireland, an Irish citizen, and our Constitution lays down &mdash; and rightly so &mdash; that all the children of the nation should be treated equally.  He is of this nation and we are sending him to a place where he cannot expect to get a fair trial due to facts we already know about the Birmingham Six, the Guilford Four and all the other cases, the six shootings in Armagh, the butchery in Gibraltar and Bloody Sunday.  They are the same people, regardless of the Anglo-Irish Agreement and the inter-Governmental <Col N="1632" /> conference.  They are no different from what they were then, and they prove this every day, but for the fact of the massive propaganda machine which they are more adept at using than any other people in the world because they are at it longer and have had more reason to cover up their tracks.  We do not see the wood for the trees, do not see what they are doing.  Instead of looking for subversives under our respective beds, we should be looking in the beds to see who is in them with us and to see what influence MI5 and the CIA wield in the various political parties, in this Parliament, the present Government, or in the country.</P>
    <P>We are being led by the nose by these people and their propaganda and their obsession about security.  The only security they are concerned about is to continue the occupation of this country.  This case is the most outrageous of all because we are sending this man back to be charged with escaping from lawful custody. It was unlawful and illegal custody. Then they added 15 other charges so that at least one would stick.</P>
    <P>Do you think Kane will get a fair hearing when he gets back?  Do you think there is not a real danger of him losing his life?  Does the House not realise that it is not protecting its citizens and that we are contravening the spirit of our Constitution? We are spitting on the people who gave their lives that we might be in this little Parliament today in some sort of freedom which we are now throwing away by pandering to our occupiers.  The propaganda is so massive &mdash; it is brainwashing &mdash; that the public should be clawing this place apart, but they are quiescent, afraid and intimidated.  It is happening day in and day out and it is much more subtle than in a physical sense.</P>
    <P>If the pictures of people not as prominent as the Members of this House were recorded at a protest rally against extradition or an anti-hunger strike, members of their families would not get a job in a State or semi-State organisation or <Col N="1633" /> associated bodies and of course the security forces are taboo as far as any of the family is concerned.  Even if they are on a peaceful protest, they will not be considered for such jobs.  Then we talk about equality and treating the children of the nation equally.  We will go down in history as the most craven generation that ever purported to represent their country in any age anywhere.</P>
    <P>We are collaborators of the first order with people who should be tried for war crimes.  We cannot lean backwards far enough &mdash; our vertebrae does not allow it &mdash; but if we could we would tie ourselves in knots to kowtow to Mrs. Thatcher who represents the establishment in Great Britain.  In the greater horizons of the European Community we are seen as law abiding, peace keeping, peace loving and security conscious whereas we are craven, inferiority ridden rats.  That is what we are, what we are displaying ourselves to be and what history will record about us.  My God, I do not know what has happened and I cannot credit that the Members of this House, no matter which side they are on or what party politics they adhere to, can sit quietly while this goes on.  I am not talking about the few Deputies who are here, I am talking about all those who are not here.  They did not protest when a young man such as Kane, a citizen of this country, was sent over to be reincarcerated where he never should have been in the first instance.</P>
    <P>We are spitting on the escapes of the past.  If we had had the same outlook in those days as we are now displaying what would we have done with de Valera when he escaped?  Lawful custody, how are you?  How would we have treated the patriots down the years who made their escape?  Judging by the tone, attitude and climate pervading the country, and this House in particular, we would be sending them back to wherever they came from to finish their sentences or to have their sentences terminated by having their heads cut off, hanging or shooting them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1634" /> I implore the House, the Minister and the Government to rethink the entire situation in which they have found themselves by devices of propaganda to look at the past and try to forecast the future. They must realise that we are not representative of the people who went before us or doing a fair deal for the people who come after us.  We are selling out like we never sold out before.  We have had traitors in the past, people who individually sold us out.  They are recorded in song and story which, in our brainwashed days, we do not allow to be played on the airwaves of our national station because they might contaminate the present generation by knowing what happened in the past.  Maybe it is because we are afraid that comparisons would be made with those traitorous acts of individuals in the past.</P>
    <P>As a Government, as a parliament, there is no parallel in history in this or any other country for the way we are behaving at present in our abject grovelling to our occupier.  We are prepared to pay any price by exporting those who are sought by the Crown although we know they will not get a fair trial and that they are where they are because they did not get a fair deal down the years.  They are where they are because they are trying to change it and we are doing our damnedest to stop even the sympathy of our people being accorded to them.  It is monstrous, appalling and mind-boggling in an Irish context and in an Irish Parliament that we perpetrate these sorts of deeds in the name of security, peace-keeping and peace in the future.  However, we know full well that there is no possibility of peace even beginning to break out unless and until the occupier to whom we are now pandering decides she is going.  If only we could have sent her out she would have been gone long ago.</P>
    <P>The reality is we are not capable of doing it but at least let us try to bring to her mind that the Executive, the Sunningdale Agreement, the Anglo-Irish Agreement and the Irish Conference are <Col N="1635" /> only fiddling while the North burns.  After all these things have been tried and failed, the only answer is to point out to our occupier that if she has any interest in peace in this land of ours &mdash; which many times I doubt &mdash; the way to do it is to declare her intention of leaving, to make it clear she means she is going and that she does not give us very long from the declaration until the date of departure.  I have no doubt that if that were done, instead of a bloodbath there would be meaningful talks between the divided communities in the North and between North and South, which you will never see while we persist in allowing and helping the occupier to stay where she is.  God help Kane and others like him whom we may, through our belief of justice, send back now and in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to inform the House that Mr. Paul Anthony Kane was returned to the North at Carrickcarnan just before 6 p.m. this evening in accordance with orders made by the District Court on 5 July 1988.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Which were confirmed by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Those orders were the subject of an appeal to the High Court brought by Mr. Kane.  That appeal was heard by a divisional court of the High Court which unanimously rejected the appeal in judgments delivered on 16 March.  The High Court order, perfected on 22 March 1989, placed a stay on the execution of the District Court orders for 21 days from the date of perfection and, in the event of notice of appeal to the Supreme Court being served within that period, until the final determination of that appeal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mr. Kane chose not to appeal the decision of the High Court to the Supreme Court and the District Court orders therefore fell to be executed in accordance with the High Court order as <Col N="1636" /> and from midnight last night.  Arrangements were then put in place to give effect to the District Court orders and, as I have already indicated, those orders were executed at about 6 p.m. this evening.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the powers vested in me by section 50 of the Extradition Act, 1965.  The position in that regard is that on 30 March 1989 an application from Mr. Kane was lodged with me requesting me to consider his release under section 50 (bbb) of the Extradition Act, 1987.  It was clear from the terms of the letter that reference to section 50 (bbb) of the 1987 Act was intended to be a reference to section 50 (2) (bbb) of the Extradition Act, 1965, as amended by the Extradition (Amendment) Act, 1987.</P>
    <P>That provision allows the High Court to direct the release of a person if it is of opinion that by reason of the lapse of time since the commission of the offence specified in the warrant or the conviction of the person named or described therein of that offence, and other exceptional circumstances, it would, having regard to all the circumstances, be unjust, oppressive or invidious to deliver the person up under section 47 of the Act.  Under the Act, the power to order the release of a person under section 50 (2) (bbb) is reserved to the High Court.  The Act does not empower the Minister for Justice to intervene on the grounds set out in that paragraph.</P>
    <P>The effect of subsection (4) of section 50 is that a direction under that section may be given by me in my capacity as Minister only on one of the grounds set out in paragraph (a) or (b) of subsection (2) of that section.  It was not, therefore, open to me to accede to Mr. Kane's application given the express provisions of the Act.  I replied accordingly in writing to Mr. Kane's application on 11 April.

      <P>As I have mentioned, the only grounds on which I may intervene to direct the release of a person are those contained in paragraphs (a) and (b) of subsection (2) of section 50.  Those provide for the Minister for Justice to issue a direction if of opinion that the offence to which the warrant relates is a political offence or an offence connected with a political offence, an offence under military law which is not an offence under ordinary criminal law, a revenue offence or where there are substantial reasons for believing that the person named or described in the warrant will, if removed from the State, be prosecuted or detained for an offence of that nature.  Mr. Kane did not rely on any of those provisions in his application.  The facts and material advanced in his application all related <Col N="1639" /> only to paragraph (bbb) of section 50, subsection (2).</P>
      <P>Furthermore, it was also, of course, open to Mr. Kane to apply to the High Court following the making of the District Court orders to direct his release in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of section 50, subsection (2).  Mr. Kane initially instituted such proceedings but he chose not to pursue them.  He subsequently withdrew those proceedings.  Clearly in the circumstances it would not, therefore, have been appropriate for me to have intervened in accordance with the limited statutory discretion available to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House will appreciate that for me <Col N="1640" /> to intervene under section 50 of the Extradition Act, 1965, would, in effect, be to set aside an order of the court. There has never yet been a case in which a Minister for Justice has considered it appropriate to make such an intervention which, of course, could only be based on clear evidence that the grounds on which the Minister is entitled to intervene under the Act exist.  In conclusion, I might add that it has been the view of successive Ministers for Justice that decisions on matters of that kind are normally best left to be made on the basis of sworn evidence provided in open court.</P>

I am advised by Bus Eireann, which operate the school transport service, that school buses are subject to stringent maintenance checks as specified and controlled by their chief mechanical engineer.  Where occassionally failures occur &mdash; and the Deputy will I am sure accept that failures cannot be eliminated completely &mdash; replacement services are provided through the use of existing vehicles to operate additional trips or through calling on stand-by vehicles.</P>

      <P>I have at all times since taking up office made clear to schools managements, teachers, parents and business interests my views on the importance of modern continental languages for our young people.  I am happy to see that there has already been a significant increase in the number of schools offering German, for example, and I am continuing to encourage and promote modern language teaching generally.</P>
      <P>In particular I have had a survey carried out of the extent to which teachers qualified in modern languages are under-utilised at present.  I have followed this up by arranging special financial provision to enable schools to employ additional part-time teachers in order to expand their language teaching, either by freeing up existing teachers or by using the extra teachers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following discussion of possible measures to improve language teaching with <Col N="1511" /> the interested parties, including the Confederation of Irish Industry, I am finalising proposals whereby pupils will be facilitated in taking up a modern language <i>ab initio</i> after the completion of the junior cycle.  I have also arranged for foreign language modules to be offered in VPT courses.</P>
    <P>Finally, I have been a keen exponent of the EC's lingua programme which is to be put before the Education Council next month and which provides for in-service training abroad for language teachers, exchanges of pupils and study periods abroad for undergraduate trainee teachers of languages.</P>

      <P>The numbers of remedial posts approved in primary schools for each of the five years in question are as follows: 1984, 767; 1985, 790; 1986, 827; 1987, 827; 1988, 857.  A small number of vacancies arise from time to time and these are normally filled without too much delay.</P>
      <P>A special ex-quota of remedial teachers for post-primary schools was made in the 1979-80 school year.  This was repeated in the 1980-81 and the 1985-86 school years.  As a result of these special provisions a total of 237 ex-quota remedial teachers are employed in the post-primary sector as follows: secondary schools, 86; community and comprehensive, 36; vocational schools, 115. A further 55 ex-quota posts were allocated under the terms of my Department's Circular Letter No. 23/86 and designated as remedial/guidance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The posts were allocated as follows: secondary schools, 21; community and comprehensive, 9; vocational schools, 25.  The utilisation of the 55 posts within <Col N="1512" /> the areas of remedial education or guidance counselling was left to the discretion of the school authorities.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in my addresses to the ASTI and TUI Conferences on 28 and 29 March last, the dominant issue for the next decade in the administration of the education system will be the rationalisation of school provision. The drop in student numbers evident at primary level will transfer to second level over the next six years with an anticipated loss of some 36,000 pupils.  This significant change in the demographic pattern requires careful planning to ensure the optimium and most equitable use of resource allocations.</P>
      <P>It appears to me an opportune time for extensive discussions to take place between representatives of all the organisations &mdash; managerial, parental and teaching &mdash; directly involved with this issue.  I intend, therefore, to convence such a forum in my Department if this meets with the agreement of the organisations concerned.  This forum should allow for extensive discussion of problems and expressed fears in relation to the future pattern of post-primary school provision and facilitate their resolution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 43, 82, 83 and 84 together.</P>
      <P>At present continental languages do not form part of the approved curriculum for national schools.  The primary curriculum is an integrated curriculum involving the development and use of the two official languages, Irish and English, with a view to facilitating the introduction of further languages at an early stage of post-primary education.  I would be hesitant at this stage to take any formal measures to introduce a third language to primary schools before I have had an opportunity to examine the recommendations and report of the Review Body on the Primary Curriculum.  The review body is due to report later this year.</P>
      <P>So far as the teaching of modern continental languages at post-primary level is concerned, I cannot accept the Deputy's suggestion that the system is deficient, or that we have somehow been remiss in preparing for the fresh demands upon our modern languages provisions in the post-primary curriculum which will result from the completion of the internal European market in 1992.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as approach, content and teaching methods are concerned, the modern language courses now being pursued in our post-primary schools differ radically from traditional courses.  Exposure to and use of the target language in real or simulated conditions are now the central activities of the language class, and pupils are given the opportunity to hear on tape the authentic target language as spoken naturally by native speakers in real-life situations.  They are given practice in speaking the language as a vehicle of <Col N="1519" /> effective communication.  They read and write the everyday language that is encountered in the natural environment of the language and in the media.</P>
    <P>It is not clear what the Deputy means by &ldquo;deficiency in the Irish public education system&rdquo; and by &ldquo;radical advance in the teaching&rdquo;.  The major problem that effects the situation in Ireland is the uneven uptake of the foreign languages. I am addressing this problem at present and am taking steps to bring about an increase in the number of schools offering German, Spanish and Italian, and in the numbers of pupils taking those languages.</P>

The main points of the plan concern the establishment of a planning and monitoring unit to oversee the implementation of the plan, the review of courses, the standards of Irish for those entering the teaching profession, inservice training, and the fostering of oral competence and a spirit of billingualism in schools.</P>
      <P>In addition to these measures, in the case of national schools my Department provides a grant towards the running costs of all-Irish schools equal to 150 per cent of the normal capitation grant.  The appointment of an extra teacher over and above the number allowable on the basis of the pupil/teacher ratio is also approved in certain all-Irish schools.  The purchase of extra Irish reading material in schools, and the provision of filmstrips and tapes to accompany the course in conversational Irish in primary schools is also funded.  My Department also operates a scheme of grants towards the cost of students' attendances at courses in the summer colleges in the Gaeltacht.  Some 18,500 students avail of these courses each year.</P>
      <P>I should mention also that there is specific reference to Irish in the terms of reference of the Primary Curriculum Review Body, the report of which I expect to receive later this year.  I am satisfied in general that Irish is being taught with great care and enthusiasm in our post-primary schools at present.  For this the teachers deserve great praise.</P>
      <P>However, it has been a matter of concern for some time that the prescribed post-primary syllabuses in Irish needed to be reviewed.  It was felt that they concentrated too much on the study of literature and that they paid insufficient attention to the development of oral and aural language skills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am happy to say that a major review of the Irish syllabuses is now under way. A new junior certificate syllabus in Irish has been prepared by the NCCA junior cycle course committee for Irish.  This <Col N="1522" /> will be introduced to the schools in September 1989, and will be examined for the first time in June 1992.</P>
    <P>This new syllabus in Irish puts much emphasis on the teaching of language skills, but without neglecting the study of literature of a style and level of language difficulty that is suited to the capabilities of the pupils.  The new syllabus will also be more interesting for pupils, and more relevant to their needs.  It will do much to enhance the teaching of Irish in the junior cycle.</P>

      <P>My Department have notified all the offices under my control and responsibility of the wishes of the Minister for the Environment regarding the use of unleaded petrol.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Three offices under my control have petrol driven vehicles, and the position in relation to these is as follows.  I am <Col N="1528" /> informed by the Revenue Commissioners that there are 74 petrol driven vehicles in their fleet and that the annual mileage is of the order of 1,500,000 miles.  Forty-six of these vehicles can use unleaded petrol without modification and it is the commissioners' policy, when purchasing new petrol driven vehicles, to ensure that they are capable of using unleaded petrol. However, there are constraints on the use of unleaded petrol.  In the Border area, where most of the fleet is based, there are few garages which supply unleaded petrol and even in urban areas there are difficulties in locating garages which are agreeable to supply petrol on an accounts system.  The availability of unleaded petrol is under continuous review and a further survey is being conducted at present.</P>
    <P>The Valuational and Ordnance Survey Office have five petrol driven vehicles and their approximate annual mileage is 75,000 miles.  All five vehicles are capable of using unleaded petrol and all drivers have been instructed to avail of unleaded petrol where possible.  A list of outlets which supply unleaded petrol has been distributed to the staff.  The arrangement is being implemented since 1 January 1989.</P>
    <P>The Commissioners of Public Works have 31 petrol driven vehicles in service, out of a total fleet of 313.  None of them is capable of using unleaded petrol.  It is the commissioners' policy, according as petrol driven vehicles are being replaced, to replace them by diesel driven engines which are more suited to the needs of the office.  It is not possible to extract readily from overall mileage records the data relating to petrol driven vehicles.</P>

      <P>St. Laurence's Gate, Drogheda, is owned by the Corporation of Drogheda and was placed in the Guardainship of the Commissioners of Public Works in 1965.  I am satisfied that the commissioners have discharged their responsibilities as Guardians of the National Monument over the last 24 years and I do not accept that they have neglected it.  The commissioners have in that period undertaken substantial repair works to the monument and they carry out regular maintenance of it.  The commissioners see no need to undertake any major works at the site arising from their guardianship responsibilities and accordingly no funds have been allocated for such a purpose.</P>
      <P>I am not aware of any commitment by the last Government to carry out works at the monument.  I understand that the Corporation of Drogheda have made the refurbishment and opening of the gate to the public an objective of their development plan and I would be happy if they were to do this subject to the consent of the commissioners under the National Monuments Acts to the scheme of works. The commissioners have given advice to the corporation regarding the minimum works which would be required to give safe public access to the wall tops of both towers of the monument and, indeed, have offered to undertake these works on a repayment basis.  As the arch of the monument bridges one of the main streets of Drogheda, the corporation would, I expect, also have to consider new traffic regulations in order to implement their plan.</P>

      <P>There are a number of glasshouses in the Botanic Gardens, the condition of which is causing concern and which will require repair before too long.  These are the Curvilinear Range, the Camelia House, the Palm House and the Cactus and Water House.</P>
      <P>Planning for the restoration of the Curvilinear Range is in hands as I indicated in reply to a similar question on 31 January.  The estimated cost of this scheme is put tentatively at approximately £4 million.  In view of the scale of the expenditure involved the Government have requested the Minister for Agriculture and Food to prepare a detailed report on the matter for their consideration.  I understand this report is in course of preparation.  I am not in a position to say at this stage when the repair of the range will commence.  EC assistance towards the cost of restoration of the Curvilinear Range has been sought.  The balance of the cost would have to be met by the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>The need for repair to the other houses which I have listed is not quite so pressing.  The financial resources available to the Commissioners of Public Works are not adequate to allow these repairs to proceed immediately.  The necessary repairs will be carried out as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Apart from those houses in need of repair, there are four propagating houses in need of replacement.  They will be replaced on a phased basis as funds become available.  There are no plans to replace them immediately.</P>

This will be done by the purchase of suitable peatlands as resources permit and as they become available.  At present 741 hectares of midland raised bog and over 10,000 hectares of blanket bog are conserved.  A survey of the remaining raised bogs has been completed and will be published shortly.

      <P>A conflict of interest between the objectives of Bord na Móna and those of the Wildlife Service may arise from time to time in relation to particular properties.

      <P>Ireland is a full member of the European Space Agency (ESA) and has full voting rights and complete access to all ESA programmes.  However, Ireland's involvement tends to be concentrated on the programmes which offer the best potential benefits to this country in terms of industrial application and spin-off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>ESA's role is confined to the development and qualification of space products, for exclusively peaceful purposes, and the demonstration of their ability to carry out their mission.  The peaceful purposes <Col N="1534" /> aspect of ESA is enshrined in the Convention of the Agency.  ESA is not itself involved in the launching of satelites or payloads, with the exception of eight launches which were undertaken as part of the qualification and promotion phases of the Ariane Launcher Development Programme during the period December 1979 to March 1984.</P>
    <P>ESA satellites and payloads are launched under contract, either by NASA or wherever possible by Ariane-space &mdash; which is a private commercial company set up expressly to commercialise and market the Ariane launcher. A list of all the satellites-payloads launched under the auspices of ESA is attached, together with a description of their purposes.  These satellites fall into three categories: (1) Scientific satellites, (2) Applications satellites launched on a commercial basis on behalf of a customer &mdash; normally with a view to selling services or data obtained and (3) experimental or test satellites.</P>
    <P>Ireland has free access to any data obtained from scientific satelites. Regarding the applications satellites, Ireland has free access to the data obtained by the meteorological satellites, while the telecommunications satellites are service satellites, and therefore are not involved in data collection.  Finally, the data obtained from the technological or test satellites is initially restricted to the participants in the programme concerned. If Ireland has decided not to participate in the programme, then we would not have a right to the data obtained from the experiment.</P>

      <P>The charge for repeating the leaving certificate examination as a school candidate is £200 &mdash; £100 course fee and £100 examination fee.  The decision to charge this fee was taken in the context of the very difficult financial circumstances facing the country at present.  In view of the financial pressures at various levels of the educational system, it was considered not unreasonable that those who had already benefited by the normal course of post-primary schooling, and who wished to take an extra year, should be asked to make a contribution towards the cost of providing the necessary resources.  Pupils whose parents or guardians are medical card holders are exempted from payment of the £100 course fee and are required to pay only the standard examination fee of £35.</P>
