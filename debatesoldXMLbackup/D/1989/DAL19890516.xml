    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach the art forms and activities which are financially supported by the Arts Council; and if there are any plans to introduce amending legislation to widen the range of activities supported.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The art forms and activities which are financially supported by the Arts Council are defined in the Arts Acts 1951 and 1973.  Under these Acts, the expression &ldquo;the arts&rdquo; means painting, sculpture, architecture, music, <Col N="2" /> drama, the cinema, literature, design in industry and the fine arts and applied arts generally.  This definition is comprehensive and there does not appear to be any need to widen its scope.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Taoiseach for his reply.  I tabled the question because I am somewhat apprehensive that while the Arts Council, and the Acts which govern these activities, cater for what we might call &ldquo;arty crafty&rdquo; activities, some highly valuable trades which have a tremendous cultural value do not have anybody looking after them. The Taoiseach will recall that last week <Col N="3" /> I put a question to him about thatching and the necessity for retaining thatched houses and I did so because I find that the trade of thatching is almost extinct, particularly in my area.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I find that the very valuable trade of wickerwork is also dying out.  I would like to think that the Arts Council, or somebody in the State, would see to it that those trades are retained.  Will the Taoiseach investigate this matter to see if what I am saying is correct because if it is it is rather alarming?  In the past I found that State bodies, such as the IDA, were not very concerned about the retention of such crafts, or the creation of jobs from them.  Will the Taoiseach make inquiries about this matter and inform me if there is a Government body responsible for the retention of these trades?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy about the importance of some of these old and traditional crafts and trades. However, the Crafts Council of Ireland have specific responsibility to look after crafts and that whole area.  They are very active and very good.  In fact, one of the best events of the year is the fair held in the RDS in Ballsbridge and organised by the Crafts Council of Ireland.  There one can see on display some magnificent artistic products in the crafts area from all over Ireland.  This matter is not entirely neglected.  The Arts Council border on that area in a number of ways.  However, as the Deputy suggests, I will have a look at this to make sure that these matters are attended to.  I know exactly what he has in mind, such as the art of making lace and so on.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my experience that such arts are being neglected and are dying out.  I should like to ask the Taoiseach to take the matter up with the Arts Council.</P>

      <P>(<i>Limerick West</i>): I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 29 together.</P>
      <P>The committee who were set up in June 1988 have been established on a permanent basis and have been augmented by the addition of two former members of the Permanent Defence Force who have been appointed for an initial period of not longer than three years.  Deputy Vincent Brady, Minister of State at the Departments of the Taoiseach and Defence, is the chairman of the committee who also comprise representatives of the Departments of the Taoiseach, Finance, Defence and Labour.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Limerick West</i>): I want to repeat my reply for the Deputy: I do not accept the implication in the Deputy's question.  The charge is only £1.68 per day for three full meals and extra rations where necessary.  I also want to advise the Deputy that single persons who live in barracks are issued with rations on a daily basis and are charged for such rations at the appropriate rate of deduction as outlined.  Single personnel living outside barracks are not normally issued with rations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Limerick West</i>): However, if rations are issued the appropriate deduction from pay is made.  Single personnel issued with rations do not incur the deduction in certain circumstances if they are on a course abroad or on overseas service.  Married, non-commissioned <Col N="10" /> personnel normally live with their families in married quarters or outside barracks and are not normally issued with rations.  Where rations are issued the married man is charged for them subject, however, to the following: where married personnel are separated from their families while undertaking military duties, including security duties or attending a course at a location away from their permanent station, for example, on patrol duty or on board ship, they are issued with rations free of charge.  Married personnel engaged on Border duties who are precluded from returning home for meals are also issued with rations free of charge. At present the rate of deduction from pay in respect of the supply of rations, three full meals plus extra rations where necessary, is £1.68 per day.  This charge was fixed in January 1987.</P>

      <P>If the charge of £1.68 per day is as small as the Minister says it is, why does he not do the big thing and give a signal of appreciation to the Army by cutting this charge out altogether? It will not upset the Exchequer one way or the other.  That £1.68 may seem small to the Minister but it is a very big sum to a soldier who has 11 years' service and who brings home only £150 per week.  The Minister should do the big thing by cutting this charge out altogether.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Defence if he favours the establishment of credit union facilities for members of the Defence Forces; if his attention has been drawn to the fact that many soldiers and their families are being forced to deal with moneylenders; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Limerick West</i>): The setting up of a credit union for the Defence Forces was considered by the military authorities on a number of occasions. Following detailed examination and consultation with various authorities, including the Irish League of Credit Unions, it was concluded that a credit union for the Defence Forces was unnecessary and <Col N="12" /> would not solve the problem of soldiers dealing with moneylenders.  Since the mid-seventies there is a Defence Forces savings scheme arranged with the Trustee Savings Bank and personnel who have established a credit rating can borrow through this scheme.</P>

I have heard that families all round the country are finding it very difficult to live and that occasions which should be joyous for all families, for example, First Communion and Confirmation, are nightmares for these families. They cannot make ends meet and the illegal moneylenders are the only people they can turn to.  Does the Minister accept that this practice is going on?</P>

I might draw the attention of the Chair and the House to the question which merely asks in general terms the number of Army personnel normally deployed for cash escort duties for the major banks.  I must insist on the Minister giving that information in view of the cost to the taxpayer and of the depletion of numbers within the Defence Forces in recent years.

      <P>(<i>Limerick West</i>): I propose to take Questions Nos. 10, 18 and 20 together.</P>
      <P>The whole question of search and rescue services is at present the subject matter of a detailed study by the Review Group on Air-Sea Rescue Service under the Chairmanship of the former Garda Commissioner, Mr. Eamonn Doherty. The location of search and rescue helicopters is one of a number of questions which the group will examine and I will consider what action needs to be taken in the light of the recommendations of the group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Irrespective of where the Air Corps' search and rescue helicopters are based, the amount of cover which they can provide would remain unaltered.  The time to reach a particular location would, of course, depend on its distance from base. I am pleased to say that the Air Corps now has sufficient pilots with sufficient <Col N="21" /> experience to undertake night search and rescue operations in the Dauphin helicopter and further pilots are in training. A total of 143 missions, including night missions, have been flown by the Dauphins, as a result of which 102 persons have been rescued.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Recruitment to the Permanent Defence Force is being kept under review in the light of current strengths and commitments. My Department advertised in February last for a total of 110 apprentices for the Apprentice Schools at Naas and Baldonnel.  My Department will also be advertising in the near future for cadetships in the Defence Forces, comprising 20 Army cadetships &mdash; 16 male and four female &mdash; 20 Air Corps cadetships and four Naval cadetships.  A total of 100 personnel have been enlisted in the Naval Service to crew the vessels which were acquired in 1988 and were <Col N="26" /> commissioned in January last.  General recruitment has been suspended since 1981 but there have been special intakes of recruits as required to meet essential needs.</P>
    <P>It is not possible at this stage to indicate when the next intake of recruits will take place but it is my intention that females will be included.  Any such intake must have regard to general financial constraints and the overall budgetary situation.</P>
    <P>Of the 100 Naval personnel mentioned, 58 had been found suitable for service following interviews in September 1988 and the balance were found suitable from 407 applicants who were called for interviews which were completed in January 1989.  The current strength of the Naval Service is 960, of which 270 are in training.  The unexpected acquisition of the Peacock class vessels has resulted in a large-scale training programme being undertaken.  I am advised that the current manning levels are adequate for the Naval Service.</P>
    <P>It is not envisaged that females will be recruited to the Air Corps and Naval Service as their non-combatant status precludes them from serving on aircraft or Naval vessels.</P>

The Deputy said the FCA have used it for summer camps.  They did indeed in 1988 when they had 303.  In 1987 they had 539 and in 1986 they had 959, so the number has been decreasing.  Fort Dunree has limited value as a training centre and its closure will result in more efficient use of available resources, mainly due to savings in maintenance costs and transport costs and more effective use of manpower.  Following the proposed closure of Dunree, increased use will be made of Finner Camp for FCA summer camps and a small number of military personnel at present located in Fort Dunree will be transferred to other locations in due course.</P>

      <P>(<i>Limerick West</i>): The Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces has responsibility for the formulation of military proposals affecting the conditions of service of members of the Defence Forces.  In dealing with these matters he has the assistance of specialist military staff and the benefit of a wide section of opinion within the Defence Forces.  In the normal administrative process of my Department conditions of service are reviewed constantly and sympathetically <Col N="38" /> with a view to giving effect to improvements where warranted.  Furthermore, the Committee on Pay and Conditions have been established by the Government on a permanent basis and now include two former members of the Permanent Defence Force.  The military authorities may make submissions to the committee on matters referred to them for consideration.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister have the courage to put on the record of this House his position with regard to the National Association of Army Spouses and say clearly that he is not prepared to meet them?  Would he explain why he is refusing to meet with a nationally constituted democratically elected executive established throughout the country with upwards of 20 branches?  They have legitimate interests because the conditions of spouses and of children of members of the Defence Forces are directly related to pay and conditions within the Defence Forces?  Would the Minister confirm that the Taoiseach has also refused to meet this body?  Is the Minister aware of this? Would he indicate whether it was he who was responsible for withdrawing tickets of admission to this year's Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis in respect of the delegation from the National Association of Army Spouses who went there?</P>

      <P>(<i>Limerick West</i>): As at 31 December 1988 a total shortfall of about £15.1 million in reimbursable entitlements from the United Nations has accumulated in respect of participation by personnel of the Defence Forces in peace keeping operations in Lebanon and Cyprus.  Of this amount £14.5 million relates to involvement in the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon <Col N="45" /> (UNIFIL) since May 1978.  The remaining shortfall of £0.6 million arises out of participation in the United Nations Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP), which commenced in April 1964.</P>
      <P>The question of securing repayment of the amounts outstanding has been pursued vigorously and continuously with the United Nations through the Department of Foreign Affairs, using all appropriate means at their disposal.  In regard to UNIFIL, concern has been expressed by Irish delegations at successive sessions of the UN General Assembly regarding the withholding of contributions to the UNIFIL account by certain UN member states, which gives rise to the shortfall in the first place.  As regards UNFICYP, the position is that the force is financed by voluntary contributions from member states and these fall considerably short of the costs incurred.</P>

      <P>Would the Taoiseach provide the House with some information with regard to the Child Care Bill?  He has given me an assurance on a number of occasions in this House that it will be dealt with during this session.  I understand from various newspaper reports, and indeed from rumours around the House, that it is proposed that a committee be established to deal with the Bill.  If that is so, can he tell the House when the committee will be established and if there are difficulties establishing it, would he not agree to bring the Bill before the House in full Committee?</P>

It will, of course, also give them the opportunity to vote for our candidate, Senator Gerry Reynolds, a young, able articulate and experienced public representative, who, in very sharp contrast to the Government's candidate, has the full backing of his party.

    <P>
      <Col N="129" /> This by-election will give the people of Sligo-Leitrim an opportunity, in supporting my party's candidate, to support policies that will enable the continuation of the vital work of financial restoration without which the futures of our children and of our own unemployed would continue to be mortgaged.  We will seek the agreement of the people of that constituency to have our health services restructured so that we provide health care for people in need rather than having the chaotic and wasteful over administration which obliges thousands of people in Sligo-Leitrim and elsewhere to wait for treatment.  We will support the demand of those people for the reform of our social welfare system so that it becomes a weapon against poverty rather than the poverty trap and obstacle to employment which so many of our people find it is today.  We will seek their approval to initiate reforms in our tax system which this Government so far has obdurately refused even to contemplate. We will seek their agreement and it will be very appropriate in the case of Sligo-Leitrim to promote agricultural policies, by which the European Communities and our own Government can truly foster the development of our family farms, the expansion of our food industries and the maintenance and protection of our countryside.  We will ask the people of Sligo-Leitrim, in common with everybody in this country, to express their wish that they, the people themselves and their representatives are given their rightful and proper place in the economic and social planning of their own regions.</P>
    <P>We know they will support our demand for properly directed and practical policies to clean up our environment, with benefit to our society generally and in <Col N="130" /> particular to agriculture, industry and tourism.  It is a pity that the Taoiseach has not taken this opportunity today to resolve the uncertainty that he himself has so irresponsibly created over the past couple of weeks by his half veiled mutterings and electoral threats.  This would be an appropriate opportunity for the Taoiseach to make his thoughts clear, if indeed he is clear in his mind on that issue.</P>

    <P Just="Right">&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>There is a fair amount of business to be dispatched before the time limit is reached so I will not spend too much time on this amendment.  In the course of his Second Stage speech on the Finance Bill, the Minister for Finance referred to the &ldquo;phased programme of tax reform now underway at the behest of this Government.&rdquo; It struck me that he must have meant something by &ldquo;a phased programme of tax reform&rdquo;, that there must be some elements in this reform which even in a very indefinite way have crystalised in the Minister's mind.  The Minister on a number of occasions, and also the Taoiseach, have referred to the need to bring down taxes.  I do not believe that a downward direction amounts to a &ldquo;phased programme of reform.&rdquo;  I thought it proper therefore to put down an amendment on Report Stage dealing with the question of tax rates, in order to give the Minister an opportunity to expand further on his own phased programme of tax reform and to see whether such a phased programme of tax reform does exist or whether phased means &ldquo;fazed&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;phased&rdquo;, which I believe may be the case in this instance.</P>
    <P>If the Minister has programme of tax reform, I believe he is under a duty to spell out to the Irish people not only the direction but the ultimate aims he has in the proximate and foreseeable future.  I believe the Minister owes a duty to the taxpayer and to the unemployed to indicate in general form the overall aims and shape of the tax system he wants to build, and to give some indication of the changes he wants to make &mdash; the widening or narrowing of the tax base that he has in mind as part of this phased programme of reform.  I think he owes it to the people of this country, both employed and unemployed, to tell them where the Government plan to bring our system of taxation and the marginal rates over a period of years and what they see as the appropriate top rate of income tax, how many bands they consider appropriate &mdash; at present we have three &mdash; and how they see the tax system interacting with the PRSI system.  The Minister should say whether he is happy with the interaction of those two systems at present and whether it is just that PRSI is charged on all income, no matter how low, whereas taxation is not.  For instance, in the English system lower incomes are exempted from the payment of social insurance and the levels of income at which workers become liable to pay such amounts are graduated.  Does the Minister think that is appropriate to our case? In view of the fact that the Minister has again lifted the upper ceiling of PRSI in the Social Welfare Bill, which is part of the budgetary strategy, would he indicate whether the employer's contribution is whether the employer's contribution is to become unlimited?  If the Minister seriously contends that the words used in the Second Stage debate, that the Government had a phased programme of tax reform, mean anything real and were meant to be other than a smoke screen or a bit of palaver to keep people happy or to give the whiff of tax reform without any substance, it is time for him to spell out in a general form what process of tax reform he has in mind for the next couple of years.</P>
    <P>The amendment in my name seeks to <Col N="133" /> elicit such information by way of suggesting that there should be a 1 per cent further reduction in each of the marginal rates of tax in the next year, both for married and single people.  The purpose of so suggesting is not that I believe that this is the appropriate way to set about reforming the tax system, because I do not.  I have spoken in this House on numerous occasions &mdash; probably too often &mdash; on the need for other more dramatic and radical reforms, including the introduction of tax credits in place of tax allowances.  The amendment seeks to elicit from the Minister why he is going this far this year, where he intends bringing tax rates next year and his priorities for tax reductions, if that is his overall aim.</P>
    <P>Before the words trip off the Minister's well prepared tongue, as doubtless they will, that my proposal would cost the Exchequer £70 million or £80 million or X hundred million pounds &mdash; I am sure the little machine which spits out these goodies has been working overtime in Merrion Street &mdash; and therefore to make a proposal in these circumstances is irresponsible, I can hear it all now, it has been word processed before and doubtless it will be said again, I want to say for the record of this House that someone in my position dealing with proposals to reform the tax system in the context of a Finance Bill is hemmed in, as you know well, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, by the rules of this House.  One of the most extraordinary rules of this House is that I can never suggest any bad news.  I am confined to suggesting good news by ways of amendments.</P>
    <P>The galling thing about this is that when one does suggest some good news one is accused of statutory irresponsibility by the Minister in the script supplied to him by his advisers.  The sad fact is that one cannot win.  One cannot propose any change in the tax system which would cost anything or any widening of the tax base or anything which would adversely affect any person in the community at large.  Before I get the predictable reply I ask the Minister to avail of this opportunity to inform the House <Col N="134" /> what he meant when he used the phrase &ldquo;a phased programme of tax reform&rdquo; in his Second Stage speech and to indicate to the House and the public, both working and non-working, what plans he has in the future to further reduce tax rates in the direction specified in the table which forms part of the amendment in my name.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Limerick East</i>): I think my views on the subject of tax reform are well known at this stage.  They have been put on the record on several occasions and I do not intend to outline once again what they are.  There is one point I would like to make and it is this: in the final analysis, what people are interested in is disposable income.  Obviously, the amount deducted in PRSI and income tax has a major effect on disposable income but since the deductions are made from whatever wage or salary somebody is getting in the first instance the question of wages and salaries is also very important. In the absence of another way of dealing with this matter I would like the Minister to clarify what the scope and cost of the agreement on special pay awards which is now being entered into is. This is relevant in the context of Deputy McDowell's amendment&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Limerick East</i>): I would like the Minister to respond because it seems that there are items which need to be clarified.  If there is a heavy additional cost on public sector pay next year the Minister will be left with far less scope to reduce income tax rates or to increase allowances.  The question of the reform of the tax system is certainly related in one way or another to the availability of resources.  The same pound cannot be spent twice.  If it is spent on pay it cannot be spent in paying for tax reductions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Limerick East</i>): We cannot realistically discuss the question of tax reform and tax reductions &mdash; Deputy McDowell has raised this issue in his amendment &mdash; without having some idea of what resources will be available to the Minister in 1990, if talking about the 1990 budget.  Deputy McDowell asked a specific question.  He asked what are the Minister's intentions given that he stated he is committed to ongoing tax reform.  I wish to ask a secondary question.  In the light of the pay agreement which is now being entered into, what resources does the Minister think he will have at his disposal&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am sure <Col N="136" /> Deputy Noonan appreciates that even though Deputy McDowell asked a question this does not necessarily mean that it was in order.  That may not be a good basis for Deputy Noonan to present another question to the Minister.  In short I think Deputy Noonan knows that on Report Stage there are certain limitations. I might remind Deputies that they will be entitled to make one contribution only, save Deputy McDowell who will have the right to reply.  I ask Deputy Noonan, in view of the great harmony which has existed to date, not to push the good fortune he has had much further.</P>

      <P>(<i>Limerick East</i>): With all due respect, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, it seems that it would be impossible to discuss the question of tax reform or tax reductions without also discussing the resources which will be available to bring these about.  The Minister would be the first to remind us of that fact.  I would like the Minister to take this opportunity or on Fifth Stage, which I do not think we will reach, to deal with this issue because it is one that is fundamental to the finances of the State.  I am not trying to raise controversy.  What I am looking for is more detailed information than what has been made available in the material published following the press announcement last night.  This is very relevant.  The scope of the agreement, if all the special pay awards are included, is also relevant.</P>

In relation to revenue, the trends were excellent in the first quarter of this year.  I hope they will continue in the same way for the rest of the year.  In relation to the question as to what impact the draft formula which will go before Congress tomorrow will have on the 1989 budget, this is within the parameters of the figure of £30 million as laid down in this year's budget.</P>

      <P>I do not know how the Deputy does his figures.  I will not disappoint Deputy McDowell.  I will give him the figures.  I have said on a number of occasions in this House and I will say it again now that to most of the people I meet tax reform means reductions in their personal tax, not in anybody else's. Rather than just talk about it, as other parties have done, we have done something about it.  We started the process this year.  We have given a clear signal of the direction in which the Government and I propose to go in relation to reductions in personal rates of taxation.  I had better give the figures to the Deputy now in case I forget to do so.  Acceptance of the Deputy's amendment would result in a cost to the Exchequer of £41.1 million in 1989 and £68.8 million in a full year, and would benefit 790,000 taxpayers. I totally reject the amendment and I could not accept it in any circumstances. It would obviously upset the parameters of the budget and I have no intention of changing them at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McDowell asked where the Government stand in relation to restructuring and reform of the taxation system. Considerable restructuring and reform took place last year, despite the difficult budgetary situation, and very significant progress was made in the reduction of the personal burden of taxation.  The measures in this year's Finance Bill covering the income tax rates structure <Col N="138" /> and dealing with exemption from tax represent a continuation and strengthening of that process.  The Government have pressed ahead this year and have provided substantial reliefs in the area of personal tax, costing over £200 million in a full year.  In this context and bearing in mind the continuing need to control public expenditure, I could not accommodate the size of the measures proposed by Deputy McDowell.</P>
    <P>I should also like to answer the question regarding where different parties stand in relation to personal taxation.  I will give figures in case Deputies are under a misapprehension.  In the 1989 budgetary context, the Fine Gael proposals would cost £530 million, the proposals of the Progressive Democrats would cost £236 million and the Labour Party's proposals, one including mortgage interest relief at 35 per cent, would cost £284 million and &mdash; looking at the alternative &mdash; the abolition of mortgage interest rate relief would cost £155 million.</P>
    <P>The Government's position in relation to commitment in the whole taxation system was clearly set out and explicitly stated in section III of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> which has been agreed with the social partners.  That section sets out the Government's objectives in relation to income tax, corporation tax, capital taxation, the problems of tax evasion, tax collection and enforcement.  In a budgetary situation which requires that tight control of expenditure is maintained, the Government have not deviated from their objectives in the area of tax reform and the measures in the Bill which include a further reduction in the burden of personal taxation represent concrete evidence of a continuation of their commitment.  This commitment is being implemented in three areas, viz: (i) reducing the burden of personal taxation, (ii) improving the administration of the tax system and (iii) simplifying the tax code.</P>
    <P>We committed ourselves to a total of £225 million under the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> in relief in personal <Col N="139" /> taxation and, half way through the programme, it adds up to reliefs worth £700 million, not alone meeting our commitments under the programme but nearly multiplying them three times over. Notwithstanding this achievement, we have pressed ahead this year and will continue to do so in stating exactly where we stand in relation to the reform of taxation.  As Deputy McDowell remarked, the last time we came very close to having two thirds of the taxpayers on the standard rate &mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>They are now going in the other direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>This year, the personal tax rate is down from 35 per cent to 32 per cent for the first time in 20 years.  We have reduced the top rate from 58 per cent to 56 per cent and widened all the bands in between, which indeed was a very comprehensive package in relation to personal taxation.  In 1988, there was a revamping of the corporation tax code with a restructuring of the capital allowances provisions to companies by a reduction in the rate of corporation tax. This is a major reform of the corporation tax code.  Indeed, it runs parallel with developments in other countries and it is designed to move investment away from tax efficient investments in fixed assets to investment in jobs.  No further changes in corporation tax are envisaged at present but the Government will review the position in the context of the 1990 budget.</P>
      <P>Problems which have been built up over a long number of years cannot be solved overnight.  However, the changes proposed in the Bill in relation to personal taxation are undeniably a further significant step in the area of the tax reform which is demanded from all sides and to which the Government are committed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would remind the House that it is because of the action taken by this Government that inroads have been made into tackling both of these problems. The improvement in the public <Col N="140" /> finances over the past few years has been dramatic.  The trends so far this year suggest that, yet again, the budget targets may well be bettered.  However, the exceptional overlay of debt still constrains our economic progress and eats up large resources that could be put to much better use.</P>
    <P>When we consider that the national debt represents £7,000 for every man, woman and child, it gives some idea of the size of the imposition.  When you consider that it takes £40 per week out of the pay packet of everybody working to service that debt, it gives a clear picture of the importance of reducing that debt, not just stabilising it as we have done so far.  It is against that background we have to consider what practical steps can be taken to further reduce the level of personal taxation.</P>
    <P>Talk of tax reform could only be talk as long as the public finances were in such disarray.  The actions taken by the Government over the past two years have created the opportunity to make a significant start on the process of reform.  In availing of this opportunity the Government have pursued a steady course of tax reform without compromising the overall reduction in Exchequer borrowing which has been so crucial to our economic recovery.  The introduction of self-assessment, the changes in the corporate tax code and our significant moves in relation to personal taxation speak louder than all the words from different sides about tax reform, which to the ordinary taxpayer means, as I said at the start, a tax reduction in his or her personal income.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>My predictions were reasonably accurate, although I sincerely thank the Minister for tempering the acerbic answers which were doubtless prepared for him and for being polite.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It emerges from what the Minister said that the phased programme of tax reform does not exist, it is whatever it turns out to have been at any given stage.  You find out what the programme is when it has happened.  It is such a programme that it cannot be mentioned in prospect, nobody can say what it will contain next year in <Col N="141" /> any respect.  All you find out about its existence is that whatever happens is always claimed by the Minister to form part of his programme.  That is fine, but the whole idea of the word &ldquo;programme&rdquo; is to plan ahead and if all the programmes which we were recently told about are now history, they are hardly up to much.</P>
    <P>The history of tax reform under this Government has been very strange indeed.  I have commended the Minister for abandoning the rather illusory and pointless aim of getting two-thirds of taxpayers on to the standard rate.  As the Minister pointed out, that could have been achieved very easily in this budget but it would have accomplished absolutely nothing.  I am half sorry that it was not achieved so that the people would have realised how foolish a commitment it was and how, although it sounded grand, it meant very little.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about the extent of the tax reliefs given by the Government since they came to office.  The simple fact is that income tax is going up and up and up in terms of yields and the Minister realises that as he described the buoyancy of the revenue and the happy situation in which he finds himself.  I take his point that there is no use talking about tax reform if you do not intend to implement it.  I also take his point that it is an absolutely redundant activity to speak about tax reform if the circumstances are not there to allow it to occur.</P>
    <P>I am sure Deputy Noonan would agree that the implication of what the Minister is saying is that until there is further recovery there can be no further tax reform.  I take the diametrically opposite view, that the process of economic recovery involves tax reform.  It is not a fruit of economic recovery, it is part of the process.  It will be a cause rather than a result of economic recovery.</P>
    <P>If the Government or their successors, however that Government is composed, spell out a five year programme of tax reform to the people, say what they intend to do and how they intend to get there, there will be a public consensus in favour of tax reform.  I do not agree, <Col N="142" /> although I can see the practical and political aspect of what the Minister has said, that tax reform means tax reduction for the average man, and that to speak in terms of tax reform in any other context is by implication, the Minister suggests, idle.  In terms of how one pays one's tax, as opposed to the amount of tax one pays, tax reform can be of huge significance.  I instance in that regard the progressivity of the present tax system.  If everybody paid exactly the same amount of tax but if at least the average £1 of overtime pay for a single person on slightly above the average industrial wage did not carry with it employer payroll costs of £3.30, then there would be some prospect for the improvement which the Minister spoke about.</P>
    <P>In my view the absence of internal reform inside the tax system is a very significant factor.  The Minister is being glib &mdash; I do not mean that offensively &mdash; when he says that tax reform means tax reduction.  That may work bumping into people on the street or having a pint in a pub and leaning up against the bar with people.  It has a superficial plausibility about it but as a statement of fact it is not correct.  The way in which we structure our tax system, the size of our tax base, the way in which a tax is focused on work rather than capital or work rather than property are real issues which have a determining factor in the economic life of the country.</P>
    <P>The glib statement that tax reform must equal tax reduction does not take into account what many serious economic commentators are saying to the Government, that they must look to the supply side, that they must look to the things which are inhibiting growth on the supply side, one of which is the employment tax wedge.  A reduction in the overall tax burden is not the only way to tackle the serious problems on the supply side which the present structure of our tax system means.  Therefore, the Minister should abandon his Main Street, Longford, view of tax reform, that it is tax reduction only.  He should adopt a slightly more sophisticated approach and say that <Col N="143" /> where the money comes from, the circumstances in which it is collected, the rate at which it is collected on overtime as opposed to ordinary pay, the size of allowances, the steepness with which bands progress, poverty traps and issues like that are serious issues in the economy.</P>
    <P>There is more to tax reform than waiting until the budgetary system permits tax reduction.  That is something we cannot afford to wait for.  The Government have a duty to state a programme of tax reform as part of economic recovery so as to be a cause rather than a fruit of economic growth.</P>

There is an anomaly in that a woman with children who is a taxpayer, who is separated and cohabiting with a man who is unemployed, for tax purposes is treated as a single person and will not be given the single person's allowance under the tax code.  On the other hand, the unemployed man with whom she is cohabiting will be treated as a married man and because she is a wage earner, his social welfare will be reduced.

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 12, to delete lines 21 to 26, and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;relevant expenditure&rsquo;, in relation to an individual, means the amount of the expenditure incurred, during the qualifying period, by the individual in respect of any work of repair or restoration, or maintenance in the nature of repair or restoration, which is consistent with the original character or fabric of the building and is carried out on a qualifying owner-occupied dwelling of the individual.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment results from an undertaking I gave in the course of the Committee Stage debate on what is now section 4 of the Bill.  I promised to have another look at the measure in the light of concerns expressed by Deputies Bruton and McDowell that the section as originally drafted might have allowed relief for inappropriate expenditure.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bruton was anxious to ensure that the expenditure which is to be relieved under section 4 should be confined to expenditure on work which is consistent with the original character of the building.  Deputy McDowell considered that the word &ldquo;maintenance&rdquo;, as it appears in the definition of &ldquo;relevant expenditure&rdquo;, might be open to abuse. For example, he argued that the cost of hiring someone to clean the house could be claimed to be a &ldquo;maintenance&rdquo; cost under the measure as drafted.  This, of course, was never the intention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The redrafting of the definition of &ldquo;relevant expenditure&rdquo; will, in my view, confine relief to expenditure which it was <Col N="147" /> intended should be relieved while also meeting the points made by the Deputies on the other side of the House by focusing the relief more closely on the restoration and conservation objective of the scheme.</P>
    <P>Other aspects raised, such as the area of application of the relief, may be open to argument, but here too the scheme must be seen in its proper context as an attempt to focus relief so as to encourage not only the retention of the architectural heritage but also to improve the social fabric of the inner city.  It is worth mentioning, too, that this is in the nature of a pilot or experimental project.  The scheme as initiated is of a very temporary nature with an expiry date of May 1991. At that stage the question of its continuation will have to be reviewed and there will be an opportunity, if it is to be continued, to extend or restrict its provisions as experience dictates.</P>

    <P>the individual may, by notice in writing given to the Revenue Commissioners within 30 days after the end of the relevant period, appeal to the Appeal Commissioners on the grounds that&mdash;</P>
    <P>(A)  the work or works is or are generally recognised as having cultural or artistic merit, or</P>
    <P>(B)  the particular work has cultural or artistic merit,</P>
    <P>as the case may be.</P>
    <P>(b)  In this subsection &ldquo;relevant period&rdquo; means, as respects a claim in relation to a work or works or a particular work, the period of 6 months commencing with&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  the date which is 6 months before the date of the passing of the <i>Finance Act, 1989</i>, or</P>
    <P>(ii)  if later, the date on which a claim is first made in respect of that work or those works or the particular work, as the case may be.</P>
    <P>(5B)  The Appeal Commissioners shall hear and determine an appeal made to them under subsection (5A) <Col N="149" /> as if it were an appeal against an assessment to income tax and, subject to subsection (5C), all the provisions of the Income Tax Act, 1967, relating to the rehearing of an appeal and the statement of a case for the opinion of the High Court on a point of law shall apply accordingly with any necessary modifications.</P>

    <P>(b)  The provisions of this subsection shall, subject to any necessary modifications, apply to the rehearing of an appeal by a judge of the Circuit Court <Col N="150" /> and, to the extent necessary, to the determination by the High Court of any question or questions of law arising on the statement of a case for the opinion of the High Court.</P>
    <P>(5D)  For the purposes of the hearing or rehearing of an appeal made under subsection (5A), the Revenue Commissioners may nominate any of their officers to act on their behalf.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The amendment relates to section 2 of the Finance Act, 1969, which provides for the exemption from tax of certain earnings of writers, composers and artists. During the Committee Stage debate I promised to look again at the operation of section 2 as Deputies had expressed concern about the difficulties relating to rights of appeal being experienced by certain claimants who had not succeeded in qualifying for the exemption.  Indeed, Deputy Noonan has brought forward a Report Stage amendment which attempts to deal with these difficulties.</P>
    <P>Up to now, the Revenue Commissioners, when a claim for exemption was made, consulted with authoritative bodies in the field of culture and the arts for advice on the cultural or artistic merit of the work or works which were the subject of a claim.  If the advice they received was that the work or works had cultural or artistic merit, the Revenue Commissioners made a determination in favour of the claimant and exemption was granted.  Where the advisory bodies were unable to recommend in favour of a claimant, the Commissioners advised him or her that they were unable to make a determination.  There was no appeal mechanism whereby a disappointed claimant could pursue his or her claim as to the artistic or cultural merit of his or her work.  The present amendment is intended to introduce such an appeal provision into the 1969 legislation.</P>
    <P>The amendment provides that, where a person has made a properly supported claim and the Revenue Commissioners have failed within a specified time to make a determination in his favour, the claimant may appeal to the Appeal Commissioners on the grounds that he or she <Col N="151" /> has produced a work or works of cultural or artistic merit.  It will then be a matter for the Appeal Commissioners to hear and decide the appeal by determining whether the claimant's work has cultural or artistic merit.  It will also be open to the claimant to pursue the appeal to the Circuit Court and to the High Court on a point of law.</P>
    <P>I recommend the amendment to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Limerick East</i>): I understand. The purpose of the Minister's amendment, which has the same purpose as the amendment I put down, is to provide a right of appeal against the Revenue Commissioners' refusal to grant a determination that a claimant's work meets the requirement of the section, that is, that it is original and creative as well as having cultural or artistic merit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 2 of the Finance Act, 1969, operates along the following lines.  A claim for the exemption from income tax on the profits of an artist's qualifying work can be made only where the individual is determined by the Revenue Commissioners to have produced original and creative work of cultural or artistic merit. A preliminary claim has first to be made for such a determination.  On receipt of this preliminary claim the Revenue Commissioners consider the evidence provided by the claimant and can consult with such person or body of persons as <Col N="152" /> in their opinion may be of assistance to them.  I understand they consult with the Arts Council or appropriate members of the Arts Council.  The Revenue Commissioners then either grant the determination or refuse it.</P>
    <P>I understand from the Minister that a determination is granted if it is the opinion of the Arts Council, and the Revenue Commissioners on their advice, the work complies with the section and a determination is not given in circumstances where it is the opinion of the Revenue Commissioners, on the advice of the Arts Council, that the work is not of creative or artistic merit.  The difficulty arises if the Revenue Commissioners were to refuse a tax relief in accordance with the section, there will be a right of appeal, but if no determination is given there is no right of appeal.  The Minister has now moved to allow, in certain circumstances, a right of appeal in situations where a determination is not given.  I welcome that provision and I thank the Minister for introducing it.</P>
    <P>As I understand it, the mechanism will provide that the right of appeal will arise six months after the request for a determination has been presented to the Revenue Commissioners or, in circumstances where a request is already in the hands of the Revenue Commissioners, the right will arise six months before the date of the passing of the Finance Bill, 1989.  If I understand the section correctly, the appeal from the Appeals Commissioners to the Circuit Court will still be in place in exactly the same circumstances as already provided for in the Act in situations where a request for tax relief was turned down and the appeal to the High Court on a point of law is still in place as it was in the other circumstances.  This provision will be very helpful.</P>
    <P>Some artists are temperamental and believe that their work is creative and worthy of merit.  When they submit their work to the Revenue Commissioners for assessment, and while they are prepared to accept a decision which says that it is of artistic or creative merit and that it will benefit from tax relief, or that it is not and will not benefit but will give them the <Col N="153" /> right of appeal, they are frustrated when they are put in a limbo where, because a determination has not been given, there is no right of appeal.  The Minister has removed this problem by putting down this amendment.  I will withdraw amendment No. 9 and I agree with the Minister's amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Limerick East</i>): I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 15, line 15, after &ldquo;per cent.'.&rdquo; where it secondly occurs to insert &ldquo;This section will not apply to loans where the annual interest rate exceeds 10 per cent.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In section 6 the Minister seeks to continue a process initiated in the Finance Act 1987 which applies to relief on mortgage interest.</P>
      <P>I can envisage circumstances arising in which, when mortgage interest rates go down and the monthly amount payable by any individual mortgagee is reduced in a fairly substantial way &mdash; interest rates have gone down by four percentage points in the last couple of years, for instance &mdash; there is an argument to be made that the tax relief applicable to mortgage interest should be reduced also. In a pattern of declining interest rates, if the tax philosophy is that tax relief such as this should be removed, it is better to do so when interest rates are going downwards rather than upwards.  Of course, once removed, it is unlikely they would be put in place again even if interest rates rose.</P>
      <P>The intent of this amendment is to tie in the level of mortgage interest relief available to mortgagees to the rate of interest obtaining.  While one could make the case, as the Minister has, that the level of relief could justify it being reduced from 90 per cent to 80 per cent when interest rates are falling, I would argue that if interest rates rise again it should move upwards from 80 per cent back to 90 per cent and possibly 100 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="154" /> My amendment proposes that if mortgage interest rates exceed 10 per cent the relief should rise from 80 per cent to 90 per cent.  It is a reasonable amendment. The Minister may not be pleased with its manner of drafting but it should not be beyond the skill of the Ministers' Department and that of the Revenue Commissioners to take its intent on board, to draft it in a manner which will eliminate any wrinkles it may contain.  Its intent is clear.  Mortgage interest is one of the major household expenses, especially in the case of young couples.  Many people are now committing themselves to very heavy mortgages indeed.  They are doing their sums on the basis of current interest rates and existing mortgage relief.  Therefore, any change either in mortgage interest relief or in interest rates will place them in a very bad position.  For example, if the experience of those people who bought land in the late seventies was paralleled by that of the people now buying very expensive domestic property, undoubtedly within very few years many could find themselves in serious difficulty.  There needs to be some kind of fail-safe mechanism which protects people.  While it is most welcome that interest rates have come down I contend that if those rates should rise again there should be some trigger mechanism which would give the relief almost automatically at a certain level of interest rate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The construction of this amendment is ambiguous.  First, it is not clear from the wording whether the expression &ldquo;this section&rdquo; relates to section 6 of the Bill, the purpose of which is to reduce the existing percentage limitation on mortgage interest from 90 per cent to 80 per cent or whether it refers to section 6 of the Finance Act 1987 which provided for the 90 per cent restriction in the first place.  It is assumed that the expression relates to the 1987 Act.  Thus, the purpose of the amendment appears to be the complete removal of the percentage restrictions on relief for mortgage interest where the rate of interest is more than 10 per cent per annum.  Second, it is not <Col N="155" /> evident from the proposed amendment whether it is necessary for the 10 per cent rate to be in force for a full year or, what is more likely, for a part of the year to trigger the exemption from the proposed restriction.  However, it is taken that the amendment envisages the latter interpretation.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the additional restriction incorporated in the Bill is to withdraw a small amount of a very generous tax relief which, without the limitation, would cost the Exchequer £165 million in 1988-89.  The additional restriction, which will yield £18.3 million in a full year and which was designed to have the heaviest impact on those who derive the greatest benefit from the relief, that is taxpayers in the 56 per cent bracket &mdash; incidentally the maximum cost to a 56 per cent rate taxpayer of implementation of this restriction will be £224 per annum or approximately £4.31 per week &mdash; must be seen in the context of the overall income tax package, which as I have said already, will cost over £200 million, as announced in the budget and now being given the effect under the provisions of this Bill.  The proposals in the Finance Bill for changes in the rate band structure will result in 32,000 taxpayers, who would otherwise have been taxed at the 48 per cent rate, paying tax at 32 per cent, while a further 23,000 will move down from 58 per cent to 48 per cent and 144,000 will move down from 58 per cent to 56 per cent.  The standard rate of income tax, which has remained unchanged at 35 per cent for more than 20 years, is being brought down to 32 per cent.  As a consequence of these changes the marginal rate faced by over 600,000 taxpayers is being reduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the past year or so proponents of tax reform on the Opposition benches, elsewhere and outside commentators have hinted at or actively canvassed for an expansion of the tax base with the objective of securing a reduction in tax rates.  Yet when rates are reduced, as I have just outlined, and a modest restriction is applied to a very generous relief in order to make some contribution to <Col N="156" /> the cost of that process, the immediate response is seen in the terms of this amendment.  The amendment would not only eliminate the small restriction imposed this year but also the restriction imposed in 1987 should interest rates rise above 10 per cent.  Should interest rates rise above that figure the combined cost to the Exchequer could be at least £36.6 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>Acceptance of the amendment could have severe operational consequences if individuals moved in and out of the restriction because of fluctuations in interest rates.  Like Deputy Noonan, I would counsel those people now entering into very large borrowing commitments, because of the prevailing low level of interest rates, to be satisfied that they will be able to meet those commitments in future years if there are fluctuations in interest rates.  This was precisely what happened to the farming community in the seventies when they got themselves into very deep trouble and found that, when interest rates moved upwards because of international movements, they were in serious difficulty.</P>
    <P>In all the circumstances I must oppose this amendment.</P>

      <P>(<i>Limerick East</i>): It is far more appropriate for people on this side <Col N="157" /> of the House to criticise the drafting ability of the professionals than for the professionals to seek to criticise the drafting ability of the amateurs.  I always believed it was sufficient to state in clear prose the intent of an amendment.  There has always been a tradition in this House that if an amendment finds favour with a Minister the Opposition do not press it, but rather withdraw it on the full understanding that the Minister, his officials and the draftsmen will bring in a form of words which is far more appropriate, effective and in accordance with the law to carry the intent of the amendment.</P>
      <P>We have another option.  We could camp in the Bills Office for days and nights until everything was absolutely in place.  We could put that pressure on some of the staff of the House, as is our right, but we do not choose to do that.  It seems to me that the intent is quite clear. It does not apply to the 1987 legislation. It applies to the section and is clearly an attempt to introduce a mechanism in circumstances where interest rates go over 10 per cent that the relief will go back up from 80 per cent to 90 per cent. That is what is in question here and I think that is clear.  It is also clear that we are talking in terms of annual interest rates.</P>
      <P>The mortgage interest relief, as I understand it, is given in the current year on the basis of mortgage interest paid in the previous year; it is a year in retrospect. It is not beyond the wit of the banking institutions and the building societies to certify that the average interest on a particular loan exceeded 10 per cent in the course of the years and that this can be produced as a certification to the Revenue Commissioners when they are applying the relief in the current year to the mortgage interest paid in the previous year.  Again, I do not see any particular problem with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate that the relief <i>in toto</i> is now costing the Exchequer, in terms of tax foregone, £165 million a year.  I also think that because of our system of allowances there is inequality in it, as in all allowances.  The inequality in it is that if <Col N="158" /> you are a taxpayer on a low marginal rate you are getting relief at the new lower rate of 32 per cent but if you are getting it at the higher rate it will be 56 per cent &mdash; that is an anomaly in the scheme. There must be some kind of mechanism which protects the taxpayer and the mortgage holder &mdash; that is the intent of the amendment.</P>
    <P>I do not intend pressing the amendment. It was put up for the purpose of discussion.  The Minister has replied and he has given me the figures involved at least but it is a topic I will be returning to again if interest rates go up in the autumn.</P>
    <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 15, line 15, after &ldquo;per cent.'.&rdquo; where it secondly occurs to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Provided that this section shall not have application in relation to taxpayers who in relation to their principal private residence have contracted with a local authority to make mortgage or other purchase payments calculated on a fixed interest basis, where such contracts were made prior to 1st January, 1987.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is designed to deal with the circumstances of people who have entered into long term mortgages with local authorities and where the interest rates on their mortgage are fixed.  A colleague of mine, Deputy P. O'Malley, brought to my attention the fact that those people are paying very heavy interest, at an almost penal rate, on their loans because the rates were fixed at a time long before the low interest rates which prevail at present.  In that context I am not talking about the super-rich, because to obtain one of these loans a person must be of limited and modest means.  I am talking about people who are paying interest at a rate well above the ordinary commercial rate despite the <Col N="159" /> fact that they were supposed to be given preferential treatment and assistance in buying a house.  I am talking about people who by any standard are the least able to finance their housing at an exorbitant rate and are most vulnerable to the amendment now tendered by the Minister to the regime, which is to reduce the amount of relief from 90 per cent to 80 per cent of the qualifying interest.</P>
    <P>It seems to me the Minister likes to have his cake and eat it in this House. He comes in here and he criticises Opposition politicians, as he puts it, who in various documents propose widening the tax base and reducing mortgage interest relief, as I have done to a significant extent in the document which I prepared and which the Minister has, doubtless, scrutinised.  He would be right in saying that the reductions proposed by me go much further than the reductions proposed in his amendment.  I accept that but they are &mdash; and I have to ask him to bear this in mind &mdash; in the context of a proposal to reduce the standard rate of income tax to 25 per cent.</P>
    <P>In the first amendment the Minister has refused yet again to spell out any global intent as to where he is bringing income tax or to say how this measure of reducing mortgage interest relief fits into an overall philosophy of taxation or a widening or contraction of the tax base. We are left entirely in the dark as to what his intentions are.  By reducing this particular relief by another 10 per cent, the Minister is widening the tax base &mdash; I have to concede that &mdash; but he is doing so in circumstances where I do not know whether he is adding to the fairness of the tax base as he proposes.</P>
    <P>I suggested, and I still believe it is the case, that there should be a tax credit rather than a tax allowance for mortgage interest.  The Minister seems to imply he agrees with that at least as far as the remarks he has just made in relation to hitting people at the top rate of tax more severely than people at the lower rate of tax is concerned.  If you ever reduce an allowance in the present state of affairs you cause more prejudice fiscally to those <Col N="160" /> who are at the top rate of tax rather than those who are at a lower rate in terms of the value to them of the concession taken away.  On the other hand, people on the lower rate need money a lot more than people at the top rate and, therefore, in terms of social justice it is not always something to be proud of.  A person who is paying tax at the rate of 35 per cent &mdash; if he or she is single &mdash; is not a wealthy person by any manner or means. Although the actual amount of the relief may be less to them, the deprivation occasioned by curtailing the allowance may be all the more critical in their powerless financial circumstances than it would be to somebody for whom the mortgage interest relief is just a blessed relief from high marginal tax rates but who, on the other hand, has plenty of money in any event to take up the slack.</P>
    <P>The Minister in a sense is the victim of his own rhetoric on this matter.  Instead of saying: &ldquo;I think now is the time to widen the tax base, to take more money from those who are availing of mortgage interest relief and I justify it because it is part of a programme of tax reform and because it is an allowance which benefits the rich more than the poor&rdquo;, he came in on the night of the budget, or perhaps on Second Stage or perhaps on both occasions, and announced that declining interest rates were one of the things he had chiefly in mind when he decided to reduce the qualifying interest allowance from 90 per cent to 80 per cent.</P>
    <P>There are some people for whom that is a relevant consideration and there are some people for whom declining interest rates cushion the effect of the Minister's curtailment of the allowance.  However, there are other people &mdash; those on fixed rates of interest &mdash; for whom it is entirely irrevelant and who have been paying over the odds for the finances they have obtained from local authorities for the last number of years, who have been paying far in excess of what the richer and more well-to-do people have been paying for their money in recent times and who find themselves now in the situation that they are paying over the odds in terms of interest and are getting <Col N="161" /> less in terms of relief.  I know it will be hard to justify what I am proposing in the context of a generalised tax reform document, but in the context of the present circumstance and the reasons given by the Minister for his changing the tax rate it seems that as a group they have been singled out for the worst treatment.</P>
    <P>I am talking about people who have limited resources and because of the limitation on their resources obtained assistance for the purchase of their house from a local authority.  I am talking about people who, because of the decline in interest rates, have found themselves marooned by fixed interest contracts above the commercial rate, people who by definition cannot afford these sums of money.  I am talking about people for whom every last half ha'penny taken back by the Minister in the form of curtailment of this relief means something.  I am talking about small income families, perhaps large in number.  I am talking about people who find themselves now being lectured by the Minister through the forum of this House that he is giving them tax relief but find that on little things, such as this, what was apparently tax relief has been clawed back in different ways.  In social justice there is a case to be made for making a special arrangement for people whose interest rates are above the commercial rate and whose means are inadequate and for giving them preferential treatment in regard to mortgage interest relief.  They are a group whom the State, through the local authorities, have already sought to assist, so, by definition, they are reasonably worthy causes.</P>
    <P>As far as the practicality of my suggestion is concerned, there should be no problem.  All one would have to do is state that anybody who is on a fixed interest mortgage entered into before 1 January 1987 and who by definition is paying over the odds at the moment would get 90 per cent rather than 80 per cent remission.  That should not be beyond the capacity of the Revenue Commissioners to calculate.  It would be a fair qualification of the general movement which, I concede, is part of what <Col N="162" /> anybody would rationally suggest to be a fair movement in tax reform, that is, to widen the tax base.  This is fair temporary exception to make in the interests of social justice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall resist the temptation of saying anything about the drafting of this amendment because I would expect the gentleman concerned to have a little more expertise.</P>
      <P>Deputy McDowell misses some of the factors in taking into account the question of people who are on fixed rate mortgages. I shall try to put the whole situation in context for the Deputy.  First, I do not accept the principle in the case made here that special treatment in respect of tax relief for mortgage interest rates paid should be provided for persons who pay interest on their home loans at a fixed rate.  The general position at present is that loan interest qualifies for tax relief if the loan has been used for the purchase, repair, development or improvement of the borrower's principal private residence.  The relief in recent years allowed a deduction from taxable income of 90 per cent, reduced by the present section to 80 per cent from 6 April 1989, of qualifying interest payments within ceilings of £2,000 for a single person, £2,900 for a widowed person and £4,000 for a married couple. Since the relief is granted by reference to the interest paid in each tax year, the person servicing a qualifying fixed rate loan already enjoys a greater measure of tax relief, subject to the overall ceilings and eligible interest, than the one who has borrowed a similar capital sum but has lower interest payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many fixed rate loans were negotiated at lower interest rates than those payable on various rate loans at the time. However, there was no special tax treatment for variable rate borrowers.  It must also be remembered that a borrower who negotiates a mortgage with a bank or a building society can pay off the sum outstanding on his fixed rate loan and many local authority fixed rate borrowers have done that.  I might also mention that up to the time that mortgage subsidy was <Col N="163" /> available it was another contribution by the State to this area.  If one looks back over 15 years or more, the vast bulk of the fixed rate loans was provided by local authorities under the SDA scheme as it operated up to 1 December 1987.  Participants in the local authority tenant purchase schemes pay at fixed rates in line with SDA rates, but these schemes were heavily subsidised by the State, even before the revamped scheme was introduced last year.  For example, the old scheme offered a £2,000 reduction on a purchase valuation set at as little as 70 per cent of the market value and gave an exemption from stamp duty.  The newer scheme is set as low as 40 per cent, so there were many benefits flowing to the fixed rate borrowers, the vast bulk of whom have fixed rate mortgage loans. Many other subsidies and reliefs passed on to these people who would have to be taken into account in trying to make comparisions.</P>
    <P>Bearing these points in mind and given that the tax forgone under the existing scheme of relief would cost the Exchequer some £146.4 million in the 1989-90 tax year, I could not agree to alter the mortgage interest relief scheme for the special benefit of taxpayers on fixed rate loans for the very good reasons I have given.  I do not think anybody should complain very bitterly about the £11 million contribution in 1989 made from this area into a total taxation package of over £200 million.  As I said, this does not apply to Deputy McDowell as much as it applies to the Fine Gael Members.  When you go to enlarge the tax base, as the Fine Gael Party keep on preaching, the very minute you do something like this in comes an amendment, such as the previous amendment, trying to change it.</P>
    <P>For the reasons I have just given, and taking into consideration all the various other subsidies from Government in relation to fixed rate borrowers and the question of the discount rate at which they could buy their houses, always having the option of going into a bank or building society and taking those houses <Col N="164" /> off fixed rate interest, on balance I cannot accept this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Briefly in reply, whereas I appreciate that those who purchased local authority dwellings did receive a number of hidden subsidies, there are others who got local authority assistance but did not receive such subsidies and used their loan to buy property on the open market, so to speak.  I accept that my amendment may be too widely cast, but it was towards these people that I was addressing my concern, which is that they find themselves now paying over the odds.  The cost of refinancing through a building society for many of these is prohibitive.  Their employment circumstances are such that building societies will not offer them finance and their continuity of income and their resources are not sufficient to justify such a move. They are prisoners of their present loans. I accept that they took on a risk when they took on those loans, but the vast majority of them were never given any intimation at that time that it was Government policy to reduce qualifying mortgage interest relief and they assumed this would not happen.  They are now in a position that they are paying well above the odds, over the commercial rate, they are the people in the worst position to be paying over the odds to start with, and they will find themselves further prejudiced by the withdrawal of another 10 per cent of the allowance given to them.  They, again, are people who in the main would not be paying tax at the rate of 58 per cent because normally they are married couples whose incomes would not be anything like sufficient to bring them into that area.  In these circumstances there is merit in my amendment and I regret that the Minister will not accept it.  I regret that in the circumstances this group of people will suffer unduly and without any of the mitigating compensation of reduced interest rates which the Minister relied on firmly as one of his chief reasons for reducing the rate from 90 to 80 per cent.  This was irrelevant to that group of people and <Col N="165" /> they now find themselves doubly penalised. It is regrettable that the Minister will not accept my amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Limerick East</i>): I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 16, line 10, to delete &ldquo;£2,500,000&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;£5,000,000&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This, again, is an amendment which I put down on Committee Stage and which I withdrew to allow the Minister time to consider the situation.  I am in general agreement with the restriction on the business expansion scheme introduced by the Minister in section 8.  However, the limit of £2.5 million of capitalisation in any relevant company is too low.  There are investments which are very appropriate to the business expansion scheme but which would involve an investment of greater than £2.5 million.  This is particularly so in circumstances in which an initial investment is made and, two or three years after, the venture has been successful and the company wish to expand.  There should be the possibility of going back to the business expansion scheme for phase 2 or phase 3 of a particular development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recall that the Minister gave up figures, that the average business expansion scheme involves an investment of about £0.5 million.  He also pointed out that not all the investment required need necessarily come from the business expansion scheme.  The BES scheme was intended to be only an element of the capitalisation. I still think that on its merits the level of £2.5 million is too low and £5 <Col N="166" /> million or something in that area might be more appropriate.</P>
    <P>The Minister, for example, in section 8 (a) has introduced a restriction specifying the circumstances in which BES money could be used for the purchase of a ship. It was the intent that the BES could be used for shipping.  The Minister's amendment provides it would be used &ldquo;by the company for the purpose of purchasing a ship for use by it in the course of a qualifying shipping trade carried on by it.&rdquo; Then there are certain circumstances where effectively it must be an &ldquo;addition to the shipping fleet registered in the State under Part II of the Merchantile Marine Act, 1955&rdquo;.  For the purchasing of ships £2.5 million would not go far if we are talking in terms of additional vessels to the fleet.</P>
    <P>Another area where the Minister is, rightly, restricting the nature of the scheme is the operation of tourist accommodation facilities such as hotels and so on.  He is talking about self-catering accommodation and he eliminates the county boroughs and all of County Dublin.  Let us take the kind of scheme that has been in operation.  It usually involves the construction of, say, ten holiday homes.  They are usually of high quality, probably about £50,000 each by the time the site is included, the structure is put up, the central heating installed and so on.  At £0.5 million we are talking about a scheme of ten holiday homes in the west.  A company who would be involved in providing self-catering accommodation in a number of locations on the west coast would be limited here to approximately 50, five groups of ten. Perhaps that is the limit.  Perhaps that is the intention, but when you break it down and try to match the level of investment against the limit being put on the fund, this is quite moderate.  If we extend it to, say, hotel accommodation &mdash; which would be within the terms of the BES scheme in all parts of the country because the county borough restriction applies to self-catering accommodation &mdash; there are people who have tentative plans for purchasing provincial hotels and refurbishing them or constucting hotels in different <Col N="167" /> parts of the country and, again, it seems a limit of £2.5 million is very low to put on a scheme such as this.  I believe some of the Minister's colleagues would be of similar view.</P>
    <P>Trading houses are a new concept introduced by this Government in the 1987 Finance Act.  The operation of the trading house was deemed to be, in accordance with the Act, a manufacturing activity and subject to the 10 per cent tax regime.  I do not know what level of activity was engendered.  The Minister issued a number of licences to allow people to establish trading houses and the tax benefit would apply.  When it comes to the funding of trading houses, in the nature of the business where effectively trading houses are wholesaling Irish goods and are the private marketing agencies to improve the export drive to sell Irish quality goods or Irish goods of all kinds abroad, a ceiling of £2.5 million seems quite low.  I am not saying that £5 million is the appropriate ceiling, but I ask the Minister to raise the ceiling, or even make it a two part thing and provide that in the first issue a ceiling of £2.5 million will apply but allow for the possibility of a second tranche of BES money perhaps at £1.5 million or £2 million subsequently for the expansion of the same business.</P>
    <P>I respect and appreciate what the Minister is doing here.  There were BES schemes which were announced between 1 January and the end of the tax year which were outside the original intent of the scheme, to put it at its mildest.  I agree with the scope and nature of the restriction the Minister has introduced, but this capital sum is a ceiling put on the total investment from BES funds which will be eligible to any company.  I think it is too low.  In the absence at least of indexation it is going to go out of date very quickly and four or five years down the line we will be going back to section 8 of the Finance Act, 1989 and saying the limit there has made the BES scheme an irrelevancy.  I appeal to the Minister to take on board the points I am making and to raise the ceiling somewhat.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated on Committee Stage, the original purpose of the BES was to assist smaller developing companies in raising equity capital, thus reducing their dependence on loan financing.  The £2.5 million limit on BES investment should now help to redirect investment funds towards such companies and away from large asset-rich projects where it was heading.  In practice, this limit should be &mdash; and based on experience to date is &mdash; ample for the vast bulk of BES companies.  An analysis of the scheme up to 30 October 1988 showed that only 12 out of the total of 300 companies raised amounts of over £0.5 million under the scheme.  The £2.5 million limit does not, of course, prevent companies raising non-BES capital above that limit.  In addition, there is nothing to stop a company coming together in partnership, or in a joint venture, with other companies with a view to undertaking projects which would require larger funding.  In that case, the limit on BES investment will be £2.5 million per participating company.  I hope that makes it abundantly clear to the House that we are not talking really about a limit of £2.5 million in the business arena.  For every participating company it is £2.5 million, so for four participating companies, for instance, the limit can be £10 million.</P>
      <P>Questions were raised by Deputy Noonan in relation to trading houses.  The information available to me as at 5 April 1989 on the relief for investment in the different trades shows two trading houses with an average investment under BES of £490,000.  It is quite clear that what we are talking about in relation to trading houses so far is quite ample for them and I have no representations to the contrary in relation to trading houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have received certain complaints &mdash; and Deputy Noonan has raised them here today &mdash; about the likely impact on shipping companies of the £2.5 million overall limit on BES investment.  It has been argued that shipping is very capital intensive, that ship prices are rising, that the restriction of BES eligibility to ships eligible for a grant which must be not more <Col N="169" /> than seven years old, means Irish companies must purchase at the higher end of the market, that individual ships of suitable tonnage can cost up to £6 million and that imposition of the limit will result in a multiplicity of small companies, whereas shipping companies must operate on the basis of owning a fleet of ships rather than one or two.  Most of the representations made to me requested abolition of the limit as far as shipping companies are concerned though some suggested that for shipping companies the £2.5 million limit should be an annual one.</P>
    <P>There are, however, valid reasons for adhering to an overall £2.5 million limit for shipping companies.  Shipping is asset-rich and represents a very secure investment by comparison with BES investments generally; if the company fails the ship can be sold.  In addition, employment content is very low relative to the capital employed and much of the capital raised under the BES would be likely to be exported to buy ships in the first place.</P>
    <P>Shipping enjoys the 10 per cent corporation tax rate and, between this and capital allowances, shipping companies are unlikely to pay much tax on their profits.  Allowing shipping companies raise funds above the £2.5 million limit could lead to them &ldquo;scooping the pool&rdquo; of BES funds and, thus, divert funds from riskier and more labour-intensive sectors. The size of some proposals in the shipping area demonstrates the wide scope for tax loss and the necessity of, and strong justification for, the overall £2.5 million limit per company.</P>
    <P>It has to be borne in mind that the BES should only be part of the financing of any business.  The original purpose of the scheme was to assist high risk projects getting off the ground where traditional lending would not be available to them. In recent times we have seen asset-rich companies coming in, aided and abetted by financial institutions.  Traditional lending should have been the order of the day but was being replaced by BES finance which, in turn, put a burden of funding on the taxpayers.  That was never the intention of the BES scheme and the <Col N="170" /> House will agree that we should get back to the original objective.  There is not a limitless amount of money around to be taken under the BES scheme.  It puts taxation on the back of the ordinary taxpayer.</P>
    <P>People should remember that the scheme was established in the first place to help raise equity capital for companies in high risk sectors which otherwise would have found fundraising very difficult. It was never intended as a limitless resource of equity capital either for successful companies whose difficulties should be over or for lame duck companies. Companies are not prevented from getting funds elsewhere.  There is justification for this limit on Exchequer funding in this regard.  I am quite prepared to look at it again in the context of the 1990 budget in the light of experience throughout the year.  I am satisfied that in all the circumstances, the limit is justifiable in that participating companies can have £2.5 million each.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan raised a question about self-catering holiday accommodation. Any BES application can have 25 per cent of its income from non-qualifying activities; it does not all have to be specific.  In heavy urban areas such as Dublin, Limerick and Cork, any application can be included in the BES scheme if it has 25 per cent of the activitity in that area.  I am rejecting the amendment on the basis of the reasons put forward.</P>

I understand the Minister is saying that the BES could apply to the non-self-catering element of a scheme which would involve a development where less than 25 per cent would be self-catering.  Is the Minister saying that the BES scheme could apply to the other 75 per cent?</P>

      <P>The BES scheme already allows a company to obtain up to 25 per cent of its income from non-qualifying activities.  In other words, a resort company may obtain up to 25 per <Col N="171" /> cent of its income from non-qualifying activities, including self-catering accommodation in urban areas, provided the other conditions of the BES are met. Investment by individuals can qualify for relief under the scheme.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 10:</P>
      <P>In page 36, to delete lines 32 to 35, and substitute &ldquo;State.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment was designed to draw the Minister out further on the point that Deputy Noonan and I were asking about in relation to the IDA's role in designating companies which go down from 43 per cent to 10 per cent corporation profits tax.  I have said everything I wanted to say about that already and I will not exhaust myself or the House by repeating it.  Post-conference laryngitis is striking.  Why has the Minister not put down any amendments to this effect?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>As promised to Deputy Noonan on Committee Stage of the Bill, I have considered the points made by both himself and Deputy McDowell, and which give rise to this amendment, regarding the confining of the 10 per cent scheme of corporation tax to computer services which have received an employment grant from the IDA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the outset I would like to emphasise that apart from a limited extension to <Col N="172" /> cover consultancy and technical computer services, the provisions in this year's Bill are merely a restatement of the provisions, including the IDA requirement, which have been the law since 1984.  The intention in 1984 was to confine the extension of the 10 per cent scheme to internationally-oriented computer services.</P>
    <P>In the drafting of the provision, difficulties arose in describing exactly the scope of the relief in terms of targeted business.  It was not possible, for example, to refer in the legislation to &ldquo;exported&rdquo; services or there would have been EC objections to export aids such as led to the ending of export sales relief. Having considered the matter very carefully the then Government decided that the only reasonable course was to tie entitlement to the 10 per cent scheme to the receipt of an IDA employment grant under that body's international services programme.  Criteria for eligibility under that programme included the requirement that the service had to be export-oriented or a substitute for imported services.  This got over the difficulty of possible EC objections and it also ensured that unintended recipients such as banks and insurance companies could not manipulate entitlement to the relief.</P>
    <P>Having considered the matter further, I have come to the conclusion that, bearing in mind the intent of the provision, there is no acceptable alternative to that adopted by the previous Government.</P>
    <P>Acceptance of the amendment would remove the mechanism whereby the relief, in accordance with the policy of this Government as well as the previous Administration, is targeted to export-oriented services only.  It would throw it wide open, possibly at a very considerable cost to the a Exchequer, to all computer services including, as mentioned by Deputy Noonan on Committee Stage, such services operated by banks and insurance companies.  For these reasons I cannot accept the amendment. I hope I have clarified the purpose of the original drafting.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that the Minister would have a drafting difficulty in particularising the relief to export business. I would say by way of rejoinder to the Minister that if somebody feels aggrieved by the failure to extend this rate of corporation tax to his or her business, it would be open to him or her to commence an action based on the fact that this is really an export relief and there could be an attempt in some way to get the provision struck down as invalid at a European level or whatever. Whereas I can see the Minister's practical difficulty, it is most unsatisfactory that we delegate to a body such as the IDA the function of determining who gets tax relief and who does not.  I reiterate all my objections and stand by them.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 11:</P>
      <P>11.  In page 48, between lines 19 and 20, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3)  The increase in duty of excise provided for in subsection (1) of this section shall cease to have effect as and from 1st June, 1989.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We are now coming to the mobility section of the Finance Bill.  I noticed that on the last occasion the Minister kept saying that he agreed with my formulation that he was not a clairvoyant, had no crystal ball and could not work out what was to happen in relation to petrol prices and therefore expected the House to sympathise with him and agreed that what had happened was an unforeseen circumstance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was wondering why he kept emphasising that until I looked at the section of the Bill he was defending at the time which was to put in statutory form something which had effect from budget night. He was making the point that at that stage, from 26 January onwards, the extra excise duty was imposed by this somewhat doubtful procedure, by a resolution of this House and that it had to be confirmed by statute subsequently if it <Col N="174" /> was to have effect.  It would still continue to have effect even if we rejected the amendment here; I do not think we would actually lose money.  What I proposed therefore, to get around the difficulty of the Minister's absence of foresight on the occasion by asking him to apply a bit of retrospection and now, with the benefit of experience, to take a look at the situation and realise that perhaps it was an error and that even if it was an innocent error, and even if Deputy Noonan's suggestion that the Minister should have known that there was an increase coming is correct, was to allow the Minister gracefully off the hook by saying that, in the interests of lowering petrol prices, he could surrender this benefit to the Exchequer as and from 1 June, 1989 having had the benefit from 26 January until then.</P>
    <P>I thought that this would allow the Minister a dignified exit from the position he found himself in due to lack of foresight. I thought that in the circumstances the Minister would have explained to the House, if it did lapse on 1 June, how much money he would stand to lose, bearing in mind that he had had the benefit of it from 26 January to 31 May, and bearing in mind that petrol prices will be going up for other reasons.  How much money would actually be lost to the Exchequer if he were to start from June by giving away that which he so fortunately and unnecessarily took on 1 January?</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment has the same effect as an amendment put down on Committee Stage opposing the increase in petrol duly provided for in section 39 and would, if accepted, cost the Exchequer £5 million in 1989, £10.5 million in the full year.  At the time of imposition, the duty increase announced in the budget was designed to leave prices unaltered, taking up the slack resulting from a price fall.  While the price of petrol has risen in the meantime to 12p a gallon approximately, the retail price of a gallon of petrol is £2.84, still lower than during the period 1984 to 1986 when the price ranged from £2.88 to £2.99.  As I said <Col N="175" /> then and on two previous occasions here, all the indications from the oil industry internationally are that in the second half of this year we will see oil prices coming back down again.</P>
      <P>Petrol consumption has been declining in recent years mainly due to a switch to diesel cars.  While petrol consumption fell by 0.12 million hectolitres between 1985 and 1988, auto diesel consumption increased by 1.2 hectolitres.  Because of more fuel efficient cars the cost per mile of motoring has been decreasing notwithstanding duty increases.  While the duty increase may be said to provide a greater incentive to smuggle petrol from Northern Ireland, an interest very strongly represented by Deputy McGahon on Committee Stage, the fact remains that the price difference between the gallon of petrol in the State and that in Northern Ireland has gone down since last year from 58p to 51p due to exchange rate movements.  Also a number of measures have been adopted to deal with hydro-carbon oil smuggling.  These include the licensing of petrol retailers' and distributors' premises in this Bill, giving more control to the Customs over such premises.  Also, by regulations to be introduced very shortly a new marker dye will be prescribed for marked gas oil for use in the State making it easier for customs to detect smuggled supplies of such oil from Northern Ireland which will then be identifiable by colour or by simple test.  In the meantime, the Customs are aware of the need for vigilance in the area of hydro-carbon oil smuggling.  I will remain silent for the moment on new ideas in relation to tackling the petrol problem as well.  I do not want to give the smugglers any advance notice of what I might have in mind to try to attack the petrol smuggling problem.</P>

      <P>I am glad that the Minister admits that perhaps he might not have made the decision he did if he had known what was going to happen to petrol prices.  At least that is something.  We are, however, in the position where an extra £5 million will be imposed on petrol costs between now and the end of the year as a result of this decision.  This is now certainly seen as a step in the wrong direction whatever people thought on the night of the budget.  When one looks at the state of the tourist industry, at the Irish cost of car hire, the things that foreign tourists face when they come to Ireland, one of the chief discouraging factors must certainly be the cost of transport here, and that is only in relation to tourism. There are so many costs for Irish industry arising out of the petrol price increase that I also believe there is good reason to say that this increase goes in the wrong direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should have surrendered in as dignified a manner as possible the unfortunate increase which he imposed on petrol.  In the context of what he has recently announced to the House on a different section as the strong flow of revenues and strong budgetary position almost half way through the year, he <Col N="177" /> would have been wise to surrender this matter.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 12:</P>
      <P>In page 48, between lines 19 and 20, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>40.&mdash;The duty on bets imposed by section 24 of the Finance Act, 1926, shall (subject and without prejudice to the provisions of section 20 of the Finance Act, 1931) be charged, levied and paid on bets entered into on or after the first day of January, 1990, at the rate of 7.5 per cent.  of the amount of the bet in lieu of the rate of 10 per cent. mentioned in section 31 of the Finance Act, 1985.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to reconsider his <Col N="178" /> Committee Stage response to this amendment. What Deputy Noonan and I are proposing is a reduction in off-course betting tax from 10 per cent to 7½ per cent. That is what the amendment deals with. As we explained on the previous occasion, I have resisted the temptation to put down a second amendment proposing a 1 per cent levy to be charged on off-course bookmakers because it would have been ruled out of order by the Ceann Comhairle and if that happened I would not be able to speak on it or explain what I have in mind.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 12 is but the first stage in a three-step process that would be necessary to ensure ultimately that a 1 per cent levy was charged on off-course bookmakers, to be directed to the Irish Racing Board through a subhead in the Agriculture Estimate.  I find it hard to believe that the Minister and indeed some of his Cabinet colleagues, particularly the leader of the Government, the Taoiseach, Deputy Charles Haughey, would not support this amendment today.  Some serious questions will have to be asked if we cannot get agreement on this.  I am prepared to have the wording in the amendment corrected if the Minister feels there is a better way of phrasing it.  Effectively what we want to do this afternoon is to ensure that a minimum of about £2 million per annum goes to the Irish Racing Board.  Having guaranteed that there will be no Exchequer loss, I am quite happy to accept that the first £22 million of Exchequer receipts from off-course betting would still go directly to the Exchequer and we could cream off the money over and above that to go directly to the racing board.</P>
    <P>What I am proposing is that we ensure a future for not only our racing industry but also the bloodstock industry.  The Irish racing industry is a developing industry which needs finance to develop to its full potential.  It needs action from us, the legislators, to preserve valuable employment and it needs investment to secure the long-term future of the Irish bloodstock industry, an industry which has the potential to contribute significantly to our economy in the years <Col N="179" /> to come.  I do not need to remind the Minister that in the agricultural arena generally, most areas of primary production are now controlled by production quotas.  This is an area of alternative enterprise for farmers as well as farmer breeders throughout the country.  I would urge the Minister to ensure that support is given to the racing industry and to ensure a healthy future for our bloodstock industry.</P>
    <P>Many arguments have been made in relation to what I am saying, one of which is that it would be too complicated a collection method or that it would be very difficult to collect a 1 per cent levy plus a 7½ per cent off-course betting tax.  It could be collected as 8½ per cent if that would rationalise proceedings.  If the Minister has the will, there is a way for doing what we are proposing.</P>
    <P>I would also point out to the Minister &mdash; he may not be aware of it &mdash; that a report which has been drawn up by the Irish Racing Board on acceptable minimum standards for our Irish race courses has gone to the printers.  I do not know what is in that report as it has not yet been circulated but it deals with all aspects of the racing industry and race courses &mdash; safety, food and drink facilities and, I am sure, attention is given to the stakes.  The 1 per cent levy on off-course bookmakers, which I am proposing should go straight to the Irish Racing Board, would be used for investment in the facilities in Irish race courses throughout the country and indeed for increased stakes, particularly the stakes for national hunt racing but we will not get down to the business of spending money which we have not yet agreed to raise.</P>

In 1985 Deputy Alan Dukes, as Minister for Finance, took the first step.  I presume the Minister remembers all I said on the last occasion because apparently he does not have to listen to me at all today. We were talking about clairvoyance and retrospection so he probably has it all in his mind anyway.</P>

      <P>As I was saying, in 1985 Deputy Alan Dukes as Minister for Finance reduced off-course betting tax from 20 per cent to 10 per cent.  At the risk of raising the hair again on the heads of the civil servants in the Department of Finance, I repeat that has proved to be a self-financing tax cut. It took a few years but the take for the Exchequer in off-course betting tax is now back to £22 million.  I will debate it with the Minister any time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>And I will debate it with the Deputy any time.  The figures speak for themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the whole idea of self-financing tax cuts does not go down too easily and it sticks in the craw.  All of us from time to time use that phrase too lightly but I am not using it too lightly <Col N="181" /> today.  In 1985 when the rate was reduced from 20 per cent to 10 per cent, legitimate &mdash; and I stress the word &ldquo;legitimate&rdquo;&mdash; betting turnover more than doubled in the space of four years.  A further reduction from 10 per cent to 7½ per cent, with the imposition of a 1 per cent levy &mdash; a net reduction to 8½ per cent &mdash; would again reduce the evasion in off-course betting tax and again in a year or two we would be back to the Exchequer take we now have.  With an 8½ per cent rate, or 7½ per cent depending on how it would be collected, our rate of off-course betting tax would be some points below the English rate and we would attract a considerable amount of off-course betting revenue from English punters visiting this country.</P>
      <P>I reminded the Minister last week on Committee Stage that there would be enormous possibilities for the Financial Services Centre in relation to this matter if we get our rates right and attract overseas punters and their money.  In addition, even if a punter decided to continue to devote the same amount to betting, turnover would increase because the punter would have more money left after each betting round to reinvest in later rounds of betting.  Economic calculations show that, if one assumes an 85 per cent pay-out ratio, then with a reduction in the rate of tax from 10 per cent to 7½ per cent, a reduction of 25 per cent, tax revenue would fall by 16.75 per cent, while total betting turnover would rise by 11 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister probably realises that the betting market in Ireland is experiencing a strong growth turnover at present &mdash; and this is expected to continue &mdash; which would give rise to further increases in betting tax receipts.  The average rate of increase of betting turnover in Ireland in the past five years has been approximately 19.6 per cent per annum.  This was influenced, as the Minister knows, by the positive effect of the change in the betting tax rates from 20 per cent to 10 per cent by Deputy Alan Dukes in the budget of February 1985.  Normal increases in 1987 and 1988 ran at about 6.4 per cent for <Col N="182" /> 1987 and 12.9 per cent for 1988.  This reflects the more available cash and better economic situation that exists now. I would ask the Minister to seriously consider what I am saying.  I do not have to give detailed figures in relation to the importance of employment.  The Minister should know them and he should know the value to our economy of the bloodstock and racing industries and the importance of an alternative agricultural enterprise for our farmer breeders who are controlled in relation to primary agricultural production by production controls in Brussels.  The Minister and some of his colleagues who are familiar with the racing scene must appreciate what I am saying as being the only way forward to ensure the future of the racing industry and of the bloodstock industry.  I urge the Minister, after reflection over the weekend, to accept this amendment.  It will be a lost opportunity if he fails to do so.  The amendment which is supported by Fine Gael will have the support also of some of the Deputies on the Government side.</P>

      <P>In supporting Deputy Doyle's amendment I note that her particular interest is possibly from a bloodstock angle.  I want to give a bird's eye view from street level, the level of the unfortunate and hapless punter.  I know that the Minister is sympathetic.  I know that he has a deep and abiding interest in the turf.  He usually graces the many racetracks with his presence, and, hopefully, in the near future will grace the winners' enslosure, along with myself and Deputy McCreevy.</P>

      <P>What a crime.  I know the Minister is sympathetic, a man who understands the racing scene and although he may not say so tonight I am sure he accepts all the arguments put <Col N="183" /> forward last week and now by Deputy Doyle.</P>
      <P>The Minister will recognise that the racing industry is a very viable and worthwhile industry.  It is an industry in which we are among the leaders in the world and that cannot be said for many industries associated with this country.</P>
      <P>The Irish horse is known and appreciated all over the world.  There is no doubt that in recent years the Irish racing industry has hit on very lean times.  For proof of this, one has only to look at the dearth of success, the dearth of winners at Royal Ascot and more particularly at Cheltenham in recent years.  In previous years Irish trainers were to the fore at the premier meetings, at Ascot, Epsom and Cheltenham. Sadly that has dropped almost completely away and the last classic success we had was with El Grand Senor in 1984.  Part of the problem with the racing industry is that the prize money is derisory and that when a successful or promising young horse comes here he is immediately sold to England or France for a very large sum.  That is understandable given the dearth of prize money available here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That state of affairs leads on to another undesirable situation relating to whether Irish racing is clean.  Indeed a very big question mark can be placed over our racing industry.  I said last week that the form is so confused with horses choked for maybe a year or two, that the Holy Ghost would have difficulty in deciding what horse would win.  The unfortunate punter in the bookmaker's office has resigned himself to the unpredictability of Irish racing and, consequently, does not bet on Irish racing.  That is a matter of some concern.  We have to concern ourselves with the viability of Irish racing and with the question of maintaining its level.  While the man in the street has more confidence in English racing because it is cleaner, than he has in Irish racing, in some ways he resents making a contribution to it.  We must look at racing as a worthwhile industry which has to be encouraged and preserved.  That is why, although I prefer English racing, I <Col N="184" /> have no difficulty in supporting the Fine Gael amendment.  Deputy Doyle has a particular knowledge of the bloodstock and racing industry as she is a prominent breeder.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister for his initiative, announced today, in dealing with a problem that has been causing great concern among Irish bookmakers, that is the growing presence of English bookmaking giants who have been quietly coming in here over the last few years buying out small independent Irish bookmaking firms.  They have been using a very subtle ploy to squeeze the Irish bookmaker out of existence.  That is not good.  It is not good to have an English presence here, because they can manipulate the market and will have no compunction about doing so.  While they have been within the law, they amount to unfair competition and the smaller Irish bookmaker has been unable to compete. I congratulate the Minister for recognising that and taking steps to deal with it.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to look at the 1931 betting law which is crying out for amendment, to upgrade it and initiate some type of charter for punters.  That could be worked out with a national bookmakers' association.  At the moment there is absolute chaos in betting, with one bookie paying &ldquo;first past the post&rdquo; while another across the street pays on the official result and another, 20 paces away, pays on both.  It is crazy.  There must be some regularity among book-makers. Also, varying limits are offered by bookmakers and there have been many cases of bookmakers refusing to pay out and when confronted with the occasional win imposing their own limitations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I know Deputy McGahon would like to think that the bloodstock that he owns would become fliers.  I am not sure whether they are in that category yet as I heard they were learning how to swim, and I did not know that race horses need swimming pools in order to train.  I thought the Deputy was training them for racing rather than training them to swim.  The Deputy referred to a charter for punters.  Having published a charter for taxpayers in recent times, we can now start looking at a charter for punters.  However I am not sure that I would agree with all the things the Deputy has said about the bookies paying out in different situations &mdash; first past the post etc.  We are in the 1992 framework, and competition is what it is all about.  I would not like to remove any element of competition from the bookmakers and the punter is far better off when there is an element of competition between bookmakers rather than their having a cartel arrangement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I undertake to look at the 1931 Betting Act, but our objectives may be different from those of the Deputy. Because I know a little about the racing <Col N="186" /> and bloodstock industry, I do not consider that the acceptance of this amendment is the answer to all their problems. Throwing money at the Irish Racing Board will not bring more punters to race meetings and this is a problem that they will have to address.  The problem with prize money is certainly part and parcel of what we are talking about.  Other aspects of the problem were referred to by Deputies today and during recent debates by Deputy McCreevy.  They are not problems that I can solve or that can be solved by throwing money at them. The Irish Racing Board have problems to sort out.</P>
    <P>Deputy Avril Doyle made a very eloquent presentation on behalf of the bloodstock industry, but at no stage did she mention the show jumpers and the big contribution they make to the industry. They are part and parcel of the bloodstock industry and they have their own problems.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, books are not kept on show jumping.  In the context of this amendment to the Finance Bill, I thought I would be ruled out of order for extending my contribution on the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>When we talk in general terms about the horse and what the horse industry means to Ireland, I fully appreciate that 24,000 people are employed in the industry and I recognise that it is not the Irish Racing Board that should only be looked after but that the whole industry should be looked after and for that reason I am not prepared to accept this amendment at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to put a few facts on the table relating to the amendment.  First, I fully supported Deputy Dukes's reduction of tax from 20 per cent to 10 per cent when he was Minister for Finance.  However, let us look at what happened as a result of this, and it is not exactly as was presented here today.  The turnover did not double as Deputy Doyle seems to assert.  The turnover in 1985 was £150 million and in 1988 it was £224 million, an increase of approximately 50 per cent.  To say that <Col N="187" /> the Exchequer lost no money as a result of this reduction is not accurate or correct because the excise receipts return in 1985, the year of the change, was £16 million approximately, while in the previous year it was £20.5 million.  The Exchequer was £4 million down in the third year, £2 million down in the second year, £1 million down in the third year, making a total shortfall of £7 million.  In 1988 the figure was £2 million up on what it was in 1984, so if we subtract the gain of £2 million from the loss of £7 million, the net loss to the Exchequer was £5 million.  Therefore to assert that the reduction was self-financing is not true and we still have a bit of ground to make up to get back our own money.</P>
    <P>Deputy Doyle suggested that of the expected £24 million return, £2 million should go to the Irish Racing Board.  I do not know whether she has taken into account that if we were to adopt her amendment, we would have to reduce the tax from 10 per cent to 8.5 per cent or 7.5 per cent, whichever way you look at it.  Is the Deputy seriously suggesting that we would take in £24 million after reducing tax in view of the experience over the past number of years?  However, I still believe that the problems of the racing industry will not be solved by throwing money at it.  I have given very careful thought to what Deputy Doyle and the many other Deputies who have contributed here have said about the allocation of a portion of the proceeds of off-course betting to the racing industry.  The House will be aware that this Government made available £0.5 million to the Irish Racing Board this year in addition to making £0.5 million available in 1988 as well&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>It went to Fairyhouse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;for the improvement of facilities.  Did the whole lot of money go to Fairyhouse?  I know the money went to the Irish Racing Board and I presume they decided where to allocate it. However I repeat they got £0.5 million this year and £0.5 million in 1988 for <Col N="188" /> improvement of facilities at race courses and for improving facilities for the general public and tourists.  I accept that the facilities are very poor in quite a number of racecourses.</P>
      <P>In addition to this direct assistance, the House will be aware of the favourable tax treatment of the bloodstock industry over the years, and I do not begrudge them that.  For example the income from stallion fees is exempt from income tax and corporation tax.  Bloodstock are excluded from capital gains tax.  Exemption from VAT applies to the supply and importation of horses and also to stud fees.  Racehorse trainers are liable to VAT only in relation to the training element of their fees, which is taken to be 10 per cent of the total fee.  Admissions to race courses are not liable to VAT.  It is not in anybody's interest to suggest that the industry is not getting favourable treatment.  I think these measures are abundant evidence of the Government's commitment to the bloodstock and racing industries.  I know that difficulties are being encountered but I believe it is most unlikely that the measure advocated in the amendment will deal comprehensively with these difficulties.  It strikes me that there is a degree of complexity which is not amenable to any easy or instant solution and as I have said previously, throwing money will not solve the industry's problems but may conceal the need for other remedial action by the racing industry.  Today, Deputy McGahon, and indeed Deputy McCreevy on a previous occasion, have suggested courses of action.  For these reasons I must reject Deputy Doyle's amendment but I can say quite clearly that the industry's problems will be looked at in the round in advance of next year's budget.  I recognise the problems that exist.  In addition to the £0.5 million that the racing board will get this year I am aware that they will get additional moneys this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Between now and next year's budget I will give Deputy Doyle and the other Deputies a commitment that I will take a comprehensive look at the industry &mdash; in the round and not in isolation.  It is not <Col N="189" /> a good practice to accept an amendment that labels or identifies where a specific amount of money will go in advance of the budget.  I do not think that is a good practice for me or for any other Minister for Finance to adopt.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last occasion I contributed to a somewhat lengthier version of this debate; I am still worried, but have had confirmed to me since then, that the amount of evasion of betting duty is still very substantial indeed.  While the Minister has spoken about a loss to the Revenue Commissioners from adjusting the rate of duty payable from 10 per cent downwards, I am advised &mdash; I am not a puritan, it is not that I disapprove of betting but I do not bet often &mdash; that no serious punter, a category from which I am excluded, pays betting duty.  If you are the kind of man who is into serious betting it is understood that you are outside the duty area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to reiterate that unless and until the Customs and Excise Investigation Branch are given adequate facilities and the ministerial direction to expose that kind of tax evasion, there is no prospect of getting in the betting tax.  This is really a tax on the poor and on the amateur, whereas the big money punters do not pay at all.  If there were a reduction in betting duty from 10 per cent to 5 per cent &mdash; that being the carrot &mdash; in addition to a few massive prosecutions for tax-free betting on the phone or whatever or a conspiracy to take tax-free bets on the phone &mdash; that being the stick &mdash; you would greatly increase the amount of duty.  If we were to frighten some of the larger scale betting organisations we might make a lot more money.  I suppose this applies in relation to a lot of taxation, but if it could be proved that someone earning over £30,000 never paid a halfpenny in income tax there would be an outcry.  The same applies to betting. Anyone who is serious about betting simply does not pay a halfpenny to the State.  Until the Customs and Excise or the special branch or the investigation branch do something about this we are wasting our time.  I believe that the £160 <Col N="190" /> million the Minister talks about is only a small fraction of the real amount and that the serious money is outside the tax system.  Until the Customs and Excise do the kind of things which are being done in England to catch people we are wasting our time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick West) Mr. Noonan (Limerick West)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Limerick East</i>): I would just like to say a few words on the amendment in the names of Deputy Doyle and myself.  I thank the Minister for giving a commitment to look at this matter in the round, as he put it, and to consider it in the context of next year's financial affairs. I had the pleasure recently of visiting Coolmore Stud.  It is a most impressive place but what strikes one immediately is how much in harmony that industry is with the environment and the landscape. Frequently we give a high profile to multinational companies setting up industry here.  In announcements this administration, and previous administrations, always nominate the number of jobs to be created &mdash; be it 300, 400 or 500.  There is a downside to the influx of foreign capital or foreign personnel in that it does not always tune in with the environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are 500 people employed by that development in County Tipperary, mostly male employees.  This level of employment would have a huge impact on the economy of any part of rural Ireland.  It seems that this industry is much in tune with our tradition, background and the preservation and improvement of the environment and landscape.  It is an industry we should seek to develop.  The bloodstock industry is in a favourable tax position already but in the final analysis it will not thrive and develop until its showcase, Irish racing, is also made attractive.  The industry has only one purpose and that is to produce winners of high stakes on racecourses. What Deputy Doyle is advocating is a method whereby one end of the racing industry would finance another with the purpose of bringing Irish racing up to the best international standards, providing the best of facilities for those who participate and those who go to the races for <Col N="191" /> the day to enjoy themselves.  That is the showcase for the bloodstock industry.</P>
    <P>Rather than thinking of it in terms of racing and punting, bookies and levies, we should think of it in terms of the amount of investment in the bloodstock industry and its value in terms of trade, foreign currency and employment.  If we put it in that context we will see what Deputy Doyle is advocating, the provision of major incentives and doing so in a manner which does not cost the taxpayer. I take the Minister's point that quite frequently self-financing tax reductions do not pan out completely. Certainly in the inter-budgetary periods they do not but if we track them over 18 months to two years we will find that the return does come in and a reduction frequently leads to a better overall return because of increased activity in the white market rather than in the black market. The Minister should look at it in that context.</P>
    <P>This is not a special lobby on behalf of those who own and train horses, who go to race meetings, who punt or who, indeed, are in the bookmaking business. What we are seeking is the putting in place of incentives to enable the racing industry to be the international showcase of the bloodstock industry.  That is the economic justification for what we seek to do.  I am glad the Minister has given a commitment to look at this matter.  He has taken on board in a fair and open way many of the things we have suggested. Let me impose on his generosity once again.  If he approaches this matter in the way he successfully approached the question of extending the scheme of tax rebates to disabled drivers and if, when the Finance Bill is behind him and he is less busy, he talks to the appropriate people in the different parties with a view to putting something in place early, which could be introduced in the Estimates for 1990 in the late autumn with the amount that is appropriate for expenditure to be indicated in the Finance Bill, this would be quite helpful.</P>
    <P>I want to stress that our intention in advocating this approach is to provide a <Col N="192" /> showcase for an industry we are proud of, which is a great industry for this country, which suits this country very well.  There is a lot of expertise in the industry.  If it could be developed more, this would be of enormous extra benefit and do more for rural areas than the attraction of highly publicised and high profiled assembly line projects which are of benefit but which may not be of as longlasting benefit as the type of activity we now see at Coolmore Stud and in other parts of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me come back to a few of the points the Minister made.  I laud his commitment to look at the problems in the round, as he said, in referring to the racing and bloodstock industry generally. That would be fine if he was being entirely consistent.  The next amendment we will deal with relates to off-course bookmakers. The Bookmakers Act is so obsolete and so ante-diluvian that not one bookmaker is within the law at present. The Minister is fiddling around with one aspect which does need attention and quotes that he cannot take on board what I am saying as it deals with only one aspect of the problem.  Where is the consistency? If the Minister is prepared to look at this matter in the round he should also be prepared to take a look at the Bookmakers Act in the round and try to solve the whole thing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>It worries me.  I would have confidence in the Irish Racing Board to manage racing.  I really think they have identified the problems in Irish racing and why Irish racecourses are not showcases for the bloodstock industry at the moment.  I worry about the future of Thurles, Clonmel and Wexford if we do not take this opportunity to funnel money, through the Racing Board, to small provincial racecourses.  If not, we will have none of them within a matter of months &mdash; not years &mdash; because their future hangs on a proper system of funding the racing board, to upgrade facilities and to improve the stakes.  The Minister knows that and I think he accepts it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>No, they will get some hatchet man to do it.  Perhaps the Minister misunderstood a statement I made earlier, maybe I did not make myself clear.  He suggested I said that the first £2 million of the £22 million collected would go to the racing board.  In fact, it was the other way around, I said that we were prepared to guarantee the first £22 million to the Exchequer and that over and above that we would get into funding of the racing board on a regular basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to a projection of £24 million from off-course betting this year, that is on the presumption that we <Col N="194" /> are talking about a 10 per cent betting tax.  On my calculations that would be a turnover of £240 million.  If the off-course betting take was 8.5 per cent &mdash; which is what we propose &mdash; and we attract even 10 per cent of English and overseas punters there is no knowing what the turnover might be this year.  In the context of what I was proposing and requesting the Minister to take on board, his figures would need some adjustment.  I know as well as the Minister, that the bloodstock industry is not just racing.  The Minister asked about show jumping but he is a bit disingenuous in including this aspect of Irish bloodstock&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Not really.  The debate is about off-course betting tax and its reduction to 7.5 per cent with the imposition of a 1 per cent levy.  I am not aware of many off-course bookies who do a thriving business in taking bets on show jumping.  Perhaps they do, I am not a punter and my perspective is the bloodstock perspective.  My colleague, Deputy McGahon, has given a punter's perspective. Perhaps people take heavy bets on show jumping but I am not aware of it.  I know it has been tried and was unsuccessful on the few occasions of which I am aware.  The Minister may know more about it than I do.  Show jumping does not come into the argument today because we are talking about off-course betting tax and bookmakers.</P>

      <P>And the tin can in which the Minister might be more interested. That is what I am afraid of.  I welcome what was said here about looking at this whole area before the next budget.  The moving of the amendment in my name and in that of Deputy Noonan might have prompted the Government into some action in this most important area.  The Minister will have ample support if he comes back in the near future to the House with proposals and suggestions to solve the problems we have underlined here today.  It is a pity the Minister could not take my amendment on board as what I proposed would not commence until 1 January 1990.  Will the Minister give a commitment that the necessary subhead through which the money can be channelled will be in the Estimate for the Department of Agriculture and Food and that he &mdash; or Deputy Noonan &mdash; will give a commitment to the House that they will put the necessary apparatus in place to ensure that money, equivalent to what we have been discussing here today, will be channelled to racing and bloodstock? I would prefer it to be channelled through the racing board, perhaps the Minister will suggest the abolition of the racing board as the abolition of boards has been in the air for some time.  Perhaps the Minister has another vehicle in mind through which he can update the facilities, have our showcases and increase the stakes for Irish bred horses in this country?</P>
      <P>The racing industry needs our support now, not <i>manana.</i>  The Irish racing and bloodstock industries have my support and that of Fine Gael.  It does not seem to have the support of the Minister or Fianna Fáil.</P>

      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <P>Bill recommitted in respect of amendment No. 13.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 13:</P>
      <P>In page 48, between lines 34 and 35, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;41.&mdash;(1)  Without prejudice to the provisions of section 24 of the Finance Act, 1926, every bookmaker who makes, lays or otherwise enters into any bet, on or after the date of the passing of this Act, shall, at the time at which he receives payment of the amount of such bet from any person, require from such person an additional payment of an amount equal to the amount of the excise duty duly payable on the amount of that bet under subsection (1) (as amended by the Finance Act, 1985) of the said section 24.</P>
      <P>(2)  A bookmaker shall not accept payment of the amount of any bet unless he receives with that amount the additional payment referred to in subsection (1).</P>
      <P>(3)  A bookmaker making, laying or otherwise entering into a bet to which subsection (1) relates who&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a)  fails or neglects to require, or purports (expressly or otherwise) not <Col N="197" /> to require, the payment of the additional payment concerned, or</P>
    <P>(b)  accepts, or purports (expressly or otherwise) to accept, payment of the amount of any bet in contravention of this section,</P>
    <P>shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to an excise penalty of £1,000.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment is to deal with the practice of so called tax-free betting by a number of bookmakers.  A practice has developed whereby some bookies in respect of certain types of bet or bets placed at certain times or all bets placed over a limited period do not charge the punters a 10 per cent off-course betting duty but cover their tax liability from their own resources.</P>
    <P>Let me make clear to the House that in so far as can be established bookmakers who engage in so called tax-free betting are meeting in full their liability for the betting duty.  The tax due is being paid to the Revenue Commissioners. However, this situation is most unsatisfactory in that the advertising of tax-free betting by certain bookmakers could lead to an impression that the tax laws were being flouted.  Also it is not appropriate that a mechanism designed solely to raise revenue for the Exchequer should be used as a marketing device.  The amendment now before the House requires bookmakers to ensure that punters pay over to them, with their bets, amounts equal to the excise duty payable by bookmakers.  The liability to pay the duty remains, however, on the bookmaker. This is, in effect, to create a level playing pitch between our bookmaking industry and those who acquired large slices of the bookmaking industry from abroad.  I commend the amendment to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick West) Mr. Noonan (Limerick West)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Limerick East</i>): It is an interesting procedure to recommit the Finance Bill at any stage but to recommit it on an issue of this kind is unprecedented. I appreciate the Minister's <Col N="198" /> intent but I am sceptical about whether it will operate as the onus will still be on the bookie.  I cannot see what system of records could apply in a bookie's office to ensure that the levy is paid simultaneously with the placing of the bet. If there are arrangements whereby a bookie in certain circumstances would waive the appropriate excise, I cannot see how &mdash; no pun intended &mdash; the bookie can be brought to book.  I cannot see how it will operate in practice.</P>
      <P>I do not have any objection to the spirit of the amendment but, unless there is something I am missing in the procedure, it seems to be strong on intent and short on practicality.  I cannot see how it will improve the position very much.  The threat will be there but the onus will not be on the punter.  There will be no obligation on the punter who, in certain circumstances, may pressure the bookie and will not be inclined to pay the excise, to put it at its mildest.  The onus then will be on the bookie.  If the bookie is found in breach and guilty of an offence, the liability on summary conviction is an excise penalty of £1,000.  I presume that is an absolute amount rather than a maximum fine, like a penalty in regard to red diesel.  Will the Minister comment on how he envisages this procedure working in practice?  I would hate to see it joining the list of well intended reforms which litter our Statute Book but have no practical application.</P>

      <P>Since this is a Committee Stage debate I suggest it would be desirable to include an amendment to subsection (3) along the following lines:</P>
      <P>or (c) causes or permits any advertisement to be published or displayed.</P>
      <P>I was interrupted when I was preparing that amendment but the words &ldquo;purports to accept&rdquo; can only apply to an actual transaction whereas if one were to cause an advertisement to be published one would be doing all the damage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>It is.  One is not allowed to display or entice a person to bet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that enticements are out and, therefore, one must keep one's premises looking grotty, as the old thought about that goes.  In my view there is something to be said for putting a prohibition on causing or permitting any advertisement to be published or displayed.  I should like to ask the Minister to consider this because he could before we conclude the debate tonight put forward an amendment that would make the provision slightly more effective.</P>
      <P>The Minister, with a sombre face, has told the House that a practice has grown up of people putting on tax free bets but, as I said before, the practice for serious punters is never to have paid any duty to the State.  I agree it is an unfair competition on the part of the English bookmakers who came over here to suggest that they would absorb the cost of the duty themselves.  The Minister said that investigations tended to show that they were absorbing the cost of the duty out of their margin and that is fine but I go back to the point that serious betting in Ireland is not taxed at all.  Those bookies would not absorb the tax if that were not the case.  If the people who are putting on the hundreds and thousands of pounds were happy to pay tax, one could take it as an absolute certainty that no bookmaker would keep absorbing a 10 per cent betting duty levy out of his margin because the punter would not accept odds which were designed to give the bookmaker that kind of margin in the first place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to reiterate that although the Minister is right in this case to try to level the playing pitch, to prevent misleading advertising and obstruct the impression created in public that some-bookmakers on a large scale were effectively giving tax free betting when they were paying it themselves, it seems to me <Col N="200" /> that the big problem is that no serious punter pays duty on bets.  Deputy McGahon on one occasion admitted this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The other issue is just as serious because we are talking of a loss of duty of between £20 million and £30 million per annum.  I would like the Minister to explain to the House if he is bringing forward a measure to prevent the impression being created in public that there is tax free betting going on, what he intends to do about the tax free betting that is going on in private, was going on before the English bookies came here and will continue to go on unless he does something about it.  I would like to hear some proposals from Customs and Excise as to what they intend doing to stamp out tax free betting.</P>

      <P>Deputy McDowell has identified a problem that I cannot deny exists but how can we eliminate it?  For example, a grateful client may pay a member of the legal profession in notes rather than by cheque but how can we eliminate that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Or in kind rather than by cash.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>In some circumstances that will certainly happen but if the insurance companies paid cash and this was known one can be sure the Government would step in and do something about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>Nevertheless, the problem that the Deputy has identified exists in his profession and is rampant throughout it.  I am sure the Deputy will acknowledge that it is difficult to stamp it out, much as he would want to do so. <Col N="201" /> That is a problem that the Minister has in this difficult area which I would describe as murky waters.  I commend the Minister for trying to address this problem which was highlighted last week but I have doubts about how it will be implemented given the small number of investigators the Revenue Commissioners have and the hazards of their job.  Perhaps in 1992 the Minister will be able to use some of the officers who will be made redundant to upgrade that service.</P>
      <P>In my view the law of diminishing returns exists in the bookmaking business. There is no doubt that the decision to reduce the tax from the crazy figure of 20 per cent to 10 per cent proved successful and if it was reduced to 5 per cent it would be more successful.  Earlier the Minister said that money will not cure the ills of the Irish racing industry and I agree with that statement, although Deputy Doyle may not.  One way of making Irish racing more attractive is to make it straighter.  More people will pay at the turnstiles to go racing if they know the horses will be racing to their ability. If they think, as many do &mdash; and I share this belief &mdash; that half of the horses are being strangled, choked or out for a &ldquo;schooling gallop&rdquo; they will stay away from race meetings.  That is the real problem with Irish racing and money will not solve that problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Noonan put great emphasis on the value of the Irish bloodstock industry. That industry should be given all the State help it needs because we are the prime horse breeders in the world.  Our climate is uniquely suited to the rearing of horses and indeed the Ceann Comhairle's county, County Tipperary, is world renowned for its association with horse racing and horse breeding.  Irish horses have been a tremendous export earner and this can only be improved on and exploited further.  Indeed one has only to look at stud farms which have been bought by various sheikhs, the Al Maktoum family and various offshoots of that immensely rich family to realise the great benefit they can be to the Irish bloodstock industry and the contribution <Col N="202" /> they can make to employment and our export drive.</P>
    <P>While I applaud the Minister for introducing this section, I believe it will be very difficult to implement.  I should like to refer back to what the Minister said about money not curing the ills of Irish racing.  Irish racing needs a thorough overhaul and it needs to be made straighter. If racing is made straighter the ordinary Joe soap will bring his family to meetings, in particular to Sunday meetings which have been hugely successful.</P>
    <P>Last week Deputy Doyle adverted to the tremendous benefit which would accrue to the industry if the betting tax was reduced.  This would attract plane loads of English people to Sunday racing in this country.  At present they come in large numbers to meetings here, in particular to the Pacemaker Champion Stakes which is held in the Phoenix Park in October.  Plane loads of English punters, high rollers, come to that meeting but we want more of them to come. Those high rollers also go to Sunday racing in France because of the obvious attractions there in the punting area. While I would not know much about that now, because I am redundant in that field, I still have the interests of the punter at heart.  I should like the Irish racing industry to be preserved and upgraded.  The opportunities in the bloodstock industry are tremendous and for the sake of the man in the street, the small punter, I would like to see Irish racing made into a healthier and straighter sport.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate what the Minister is trying to achieve with this amendment but I suggest that 7½ per cent would be far easier to collect than 10 per cent when he has to go after it.  I should like to underline what both my colleagues have said.  The Minister is trying to close a loophole in theory in relation to this amendment but how it will work out in practice and whether it will be enforceable is very questionable.  I said a few moments ago in relation to the previous amendment that the Irish Betting Act is so out of date that not one of our <Col N="203" /> bookmakers is operating within the law virtually in relation to any aspect of it, and certainly not in relation to the main thrust of it.  The Minister committed himself to looking at the problems in the racing and bloodstock industry in the round but I suggest that he should extend that principle to what we are talking about now and the whole legislation concerning bookmakers and betting in this country.</P>
      <P>The Minister also reflected the view, and so did my colleague, Deputy McGahon, that I had stated money would cure all the ills of the racing and bloodstock industry.  I do not think anybody would be foolish enough to make that statement or to even imply it.  However, I stand over very strongly the belief that money will go a long way towards resolving many of the ills in that industry both in terms of a lack of facilities and stakes, which to a large extent create an awful lot of the problems in the industry. Because the stakes are so low this creates another ill which my colleague referred to &mdash; the dishonesty in terms of horses not running true to form.  Many owners, and to a lesser extent trainers, who are associated with particular horses now have to resort to the practice of stopping their horses and pulling horses in different races to increase the odds on the horse when it is off so as to get some financial return for their investment.  If the stakes were increased, as I suggested in my previous amendment, that dishonesty could be decreased, as the reduction in off course betting tax would decrease the dishonesty in the evasion of off course betting tax.  Money would be a large contributor towards resolving the ills and problems in the racing and bloodstock industry.  It would not resolve the problems 100 per cent but to dismiss the suggestion of the last Fine Gael amendment as if it was irrelevant to the problems of racing and the bloodstock industry is totally unfair and the Minister is burying his head in the sand to some extent in relation to the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This evening's papers &mdash; I am thinking in particular of the <i>Evening Herald</i>&mdash;<Col N="204" /> carries the headline &ldquo;Bet law to hit punter&rdquo;.  What we are talking about here will certainly suit the independent Irish bookmakers and will make the playing field level as far as they are concerned with the English multiple who has expressly or otherwise been accepting bets, both large and small, without tax from the punter.  They have been absorbing that tax in their margins which must have affected the odds they offered the punter, as Deputy McDowell suggested. I hope that what we are doing here today will in the long run effectively be in the punters' interests in terms of a better return on the odds they will now get, as well as being in the interests of the Irish independent bookmakers.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister can explain to us how he intends enforcing the amendment we are talking to now.  All the other points in relation to legislation in this area have proved unenforceable and I get the impression that because it is over 50 years since the legislation was updated little effort has been made to enforce it. Perhaps that is just as well because if we were to literally take to the present Bill and pursue it we would cause mayhem in the bookmaking industry generally, which gives much pleasure to many people.  It causes many a headache and heartache as well but we are not here to stand on moral judgment in relation to punting generally; we are here to deal with the problem as it is before us.  This industry is a great employer and there is not a small village in our country today which does not have one or two booking offices, or indeed many more.</P>
    <P>I look forward to hearing the Minister's response.  He is attempting to address a problem which has arisen since the advent of the English multiple.  They appear to have been able to offer certain advantages which the independent Irish bookmaker could not or did not.  Provided that what the Minister is suggesting will not be just more legislation which will prove unenforceable I think in the long run what we are doing today will be in the interests of the punter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Leyden)</NameTxt>
      <P>Due to time constraints, I was unable to complete my address to the House on the last occasion the Bill was debated.  For the benefit of the House let me briefly run through the main points I made on Wednesday last.</P>
      <P>I expressed my reservations about the practicalities of legislating in this area, a point reinforced most eloquently by Deputy Bell during his excellent contribution to the debate.  In relation to my own Department I also mentioned that, because of the numbers of individuals who use health agency facilities, it would be impossible to guarantee privacy without serious disruption and delays in the level of service being provided in these offices.</P>
      <P>In addition, I pointed out the improvements which have been made in Hawkins House in relation to the provision of privacy for the public.  With regard to the health agencies, I mentioned that straightforward business is dealt with at public hatches while facilities are available to deal with matters of a sensitive or confidential nature in private.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I go any further, I feel I must rebut in the strongest possible terms, the assertion made by Deputy Bernard Durkan last Wednesday that Government speakers denigrated the motives behind the introduction of this Bill and that they regarded it as being mischievous. This is simply not the case.  If the Deputy examines the record of the House he will see that each Government speaker in turn applauded the principle of the Bill and advised the House that they fully subscribed to the motives which <Col N="207" /> inspired Deputy Jim Mitchell's Bill.  That is a matter of record.</P>
    <P>Deputy Durkan also seemed to suggest that a dual system incorporating both a public counter and private facilities would not be acceptable to him.  Instead he said that, and I quote, &ldquo;a system whereby each person receives equal treatment and the private audience&rdquo; was necessary.  This proposal goes far beyond the provisions of Deputy Mitchell's Bill. Needless to say the cost of providing such facilities in every single public office throughout the country would be prohibitive. His suggestion that areas be screened off would simply not be practical in every instance.</P>
    <P>I would also like to take issue again with Deputy Barnes about her contention that the public should be dealt with by senior officials.  Given the large volume of callers to employment exchanges, tax offices, health boards, FAS offices and many other public offices, it would not be possible to achieve this without serious and unacceptable implications for the Exchequer pay bill.</P>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity to assure the House that the Government are committed to a progressive improvement in facilities in public offices where there are blatant deficiencies.  Indeed nothing would please Government Ministers more than to be in the strong financial position to effect the necessary improvements in the public offices under their control overnight.  Unfortunately, this is not yet the case.  Any improvements must have regard to the overriding spending priorities determined by the Dáil during the Estimates and budgetary process.</P>
    <P>It is the Government's firm belief that legislation is not the appropriate means to effect these improvements in facilities. Once the budgets for the various Departments and State agencies have been determined by the Dáil, it should be up to the local management in each area to devise and implement strategies, within budgetary constraints, which provide basic services as well as improvements in <Col N="208" /> areas such as accommodation and privacy. It is not appropriate that minimum standards of privacy should be enforced on local managements by central Government, through the Minister for Finance, as envisaged in Deputy Mitchell's Bill.  Local managements are best placed to make the necessary decisions.</P>
    <P>The present debate is serving a useful purpose in focusing the attention of both the public and officials on the question of privacy and confidentiality in public offices.  Indeed the debate has thrown up some useful pointers for Departments as to where they might best concentrate their efforts to bring about improvements. As far as the health area is concerned, I will be asking my Department to convey the views expressed by all sides of the House to the various health agencies with a request that present arrangements be critically reviewed.  I am sure that other Ministers will adopt a similar positive approach.</P>
    <P>I am anxious to ensure that members of the public who are in personal contact with my Department have the facility to conduct business in private if this is required.  As an example of the arrangements currently in place, I draw the attention of the House to the General Registrar's office located at Joyce House in Lombard Street, Dublin.  Some 25,000 members of the public call annually to this office for birth, marriage or death certificates.  While some of the details required for this purpose can be regarded as of a private or confidential nature, it is not something which might be overheard by the general public, consisting as it does of form filling.  Members of the public are given every assistance by the staff in Lombard House in completing the request forms for certificates.</P>
    <P>Of the 25,000 callers I have mentioned, approximately 1,100 per annum would be transacting business of a confidential or sensitive nature.  Facilities are available for this business to be dealt with away from the public counter.  In my view, this represents a reasonable approach to a difficult problem.</P>
    <P>That office is in a position to cater, with the minimum amount of delay, with <Col N="209" /> a large volume of callers on straightforward business while, at the same time, providing suitable facilities for business of a personal or confidential nature. Indeed, I should like to avail of this opportunity to compliment my departmental staff in Joyce House who deal so effectively and efficiently with so many members of the public constantly seeking information and assistance.  I have never received any complaint whatsoever about the workings of the General Registrar's office.</P>
    <P>I am fully satisfied with the service being provided to the public in Joyce House.  I believe that the facilities being provided for the public to conduct any necessary personal and confidential business in private are adequate.  If full private facilities were to be made available to every caller to this office it is obvious there would be a serious deterioration in the level of service provided to the public, resulting in unacceptable delays in dealing with cases.</P>
    <P>My Department are fully committed to the policy of providing facilities to members of the public to conduct business in private if the circumstances of the case so warrant.  As I said in the House on Wednesday last, my Department are satisfied that the existing arrangements for dealing with such confidential matters are adequate.  However, where there is scope for improvement of these facilities, my Department will be requesting local managements to review the position and effect improvements within their budgetary constraints.</P>
    <P>It is my firm belief that legislation is not an effective means of effecting improvements in the area of privacy in public offices.  One cannot enforce strict statutory controls in this area, such as are envisaged in this Bill, without providing the necessary additional resources in terms of staffing, accommodation and finance.  That is not possible in our present difficult financial circumstances.</P>
    <P>It is also my belief that Members' contributions to this debate, ranging over four evenings of Private Members' time, will alert staff nationwide, working in the public or semi-public sector, to be aware <Col N="210" /> of public needs as far as the transaction of their business in private is concerned Indeed, where hatches are used, business should be transacted without having to close the hatch on the person being dealt with &mdash; as it happens, this was brought to my attention at my constituency office &mdash; because it does cause offence to members of the public.  It should not be necessary to close such hatches in public offices when dealing with queries on behalf of members of the public.</P>
    <P>I am of the opinion that Deputy Jim Mitchell was faced with an impossible task when he attempted to draft this Bill. It is simply not possible to reconcile the laying down of enforceable standards of privacy in all public offices &mdash; which cost money &mdash; with the budgetary imperatives of the day which may dictate that there are other priorities in the spending of that money.  I sympathise with Deputy Mitchell in a sense because it is difficult in Private Members' time to have the back up to provide a Bill that would be fully scrutinised by the drafting office. The objective is good but the details are not thoroughly worked out.  Thus, the obligations in the Bill are qualified by the words &ldquo;wherever practicable&rdquo;.  Thereby, it becomes unenforceable and, indeed, meaningless.</P>
    <P>Despite these major reservations about the necessity for legislation on this subject and the form of any such legislation, I believe that Deputy Mitchell should be applauded for his initiative in bringing this matter before the House.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a testimony of his deeply felt concern to ensure that members of the public can discuss private business with dignity and in total confidence.  We must also recognise, and I am sure Deputy Mitchell in his summing up of this debate will recognise, the major improvements which have taken place in public offices over the last number of years under successive Governments. There has been a major investment in the improvement of facilities for the public in State offices and rightly so.  It is unacceptable that the highest standards would not be available at all times to allow the public carry out their business in a proper <Col N="211" /> manner in public offices.  I believe that the facilities will continue to be improved.</P>
    <P>When I was Minister of State with responsibility for An Post we carried out major improvements and renovations to post offices throughout the country.  In so doing we provided excellent facilities for the public but it had to be at a counter or hatch.  The nature of transactions which take place in a post office, generally speaking, in relation to the sale of stamps could not be regarded as of a confidential nature but in relation to pensions and lodgments that could certainly be considered as private.  I believe the facilities have been dramatically improved both in general post offices and in local post offices over the past number of years. Indeed I would like to compliment An Post for the continuation of the improvements in the offices throughout the country which were initiated under a previous Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
    <P>The Government are convinced that this procedure is the most effective way of achieving improvements.  The enactment of legislation in this area would be unworkable and would not serve the interests of the public.  While totally supporting the underlying principles of the Bill towards setting standards of privacy in public offices the Government must reluctantly oppose this Bill for the reasons which I and other speakers have outlined.  This should not be a Bill which would give rise to a vote in this House. The Government have clearly indicated that they are in favour of the principles but not of the actual details of the legislation which has not been worked out to a great degree.</P>
    <P>The debate has certainly elicited views from all sides of this House on an interesting topic which many people have brought to my attention in relation to services.  I was never in favour of hatches in the council offices.  When transacting business either as a councillor or as a member of the public I always felt it appropriate to be given the facilities to speak with the other person across the table.  Generally speaking those facilities <Col N="212" /> are available to the public in most local authority offices.</P>
    <P>I am sure that when Deputy Jim Mitchell reflects on the debate he will accept the Government's goodwill in striving to continue to provide and improve facilities for the conduct in private of sensitive personal business in public offices.  I would also hope that he would accept the arguments put forward by Deputy Bell and by speakers from this side of the House that legislation does not provide a workable solution.  Legislation that cannot be enforced is bad legislation and should not be on the Statute Book.</P>
    <P>It is clearly evident from this Bill and from the advice from the Departments of the Environment, Finance and other Departments who have carefully scrutinised it that it would be unworkable, unenforceable, and, in the circumstances, flawed legislation and of no benefit whatsoever.  It would create more difficulties for the public in having complaints lodged if there were no methods or structures to enforce the legislation which would be passed by the Oireachtas. When legislation is not enforced it reflects very badly on the Oireachtas in the sense of having brought forward the Bill in the first instance.  In the circumstances, I strongly recommend that the Bill be withdrawn but that the views of this House be conveyed to all public offices in regard to the improving of facilities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>Contrary to what the Minister of State has said, this is a very reasonable Bill and one that is long overdue. It is probably more relevant now than ever before because of the longer dole queues.  Quite frankly I have always believed that our methods of dealing with the public are quite callous and leave much to be desired.  It is humiliating enough for the not so well off and the poor to have to apply for medical cards in order to obtain medical aid for their dear ones or, indeed, to have to queue up and tell their sad tale of poverty and deprivation in front of a number of their neighbours.  That is the ultimate embarrassment. I submit that if proper facilities <Col N="213" /> were in place, for example, for unemployment assistance and medical card applicants, we would probably have a 10 per cent or 15 per cent increase in people receiving these benefits and perhaps that is why we do not have them.  I certainly know of people who would not face this type of humiliation and would much prefer to do without.  Instead, they come to people like myself to see if we can overcome this embarrassing episode for them but, unfortunately there is very little we can do, we have to tell them that they must go back to the office.</P>
      <P>We have thousands of unemployed queuing up each week, out on the streets in the cold and rain, for what is due to them.  I have seen them myself, in full view of the citizenry, awaiting their turn to be paid and to discuss their business. Surely simple waiting rooms in our towns and villages to allow these people to wait in comfort is not too much to ask.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Minister of State that all this does not have to happen together. If there was a consensus in this House of the need for these facilities, they could be provided.  I would not accept what the Minister said about it being impossible, nothing is impossible.  There is enough humanity on all sides of this House for us to appreciate the problem.  Every weekend we are dealing with it in our clinics.  I feel very strongly that if money needs to be spent, this is one area where it should be spent.</P>
      <P>Also in our employment offices we should have citizen advice centres, a branch of the FÁS office, facilities for interviews for jobs by various local authorities and indeed by employers generally. We hear about the drive to get after people who are abusing the social welfare system but we hear very little about the embarrassment and difficulties of the social welfare applicants in trying in public to have their rights established. This is the reason so many people will not even submit themselves to that type of public interview.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Far too much of the social welfare budget goes on administration.  We talk about scarce national resources but the system should be simplified.  This applies, <Col N="214" /> too, to health and to other areas.  As I said previously in this House, medical ethics ought to be such that when qualified medical people deem a person ill or unfit for work, that should suffice.  Think of all the money that would save.  For instance, all the appeals and reviews which are at present part of the bureaucratic set up could in these cases be dispensed with completely.</P>
    <P>The Government's present treatment of the matter is holding back payment of unemployment assistance.  Here again, vast sums of money could be saved.  I know of a family living at present on £17 a week, who are now entering their third appeal, trying to obtain a few extra pounds from the Southern Health Board. These are deserving people.  This surely must be without precedent.  I know of families who, for the third and fourth time, have gone before appeal boards, having been told that they are fit for work despite the fact that medical experts have told them that they are not fit for work. Who is right in all this?  That is surely a waste of money and makes for much office work.</P>
    <P>This Fine Gael motion is reasonable, worth while and civilised.  When I started out in life, one would go to the bank with a little financial problem.  One queued at the counter and the fellow down the road could hear the story.  If it suited the bank manager, he shouted loudly enough to make sure that the fellow did hear, to embarrass the applicant a little further. All that has long since changed, because I was talking about the middle fifties. Nowadays there is full privacy with regard to the bank and the ACC.  This facility should be offered to everybody. Surely, if private institutions can do that, it should not be beyond the powers of Government to give exactly the same facility.</P>
    <P>The banks realised the need for privacy and we can all see the results.  It is time for the State to follow suit, especially when dealing with people who, through no fault of their own, are deprived and very often in poor shape physically and mentally.  We must treat these people <Col N="215" /> with a little Christian charity and sensitivity. That is not asking too much, from a Government that promised, before the last election, to look after the poor, the sick and the handicapped.  I am afraid that they have not done much about it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>Extra facilities could be coupled with a better strategy of payment. If it is established that somebody is unemployed, a simplified system could be worked out to pay that person by cheque so that he or she would not need to queue up at all.  When the person is fortunate enough to obtain employment he or she can inform the office.  This is the system in other countries and if they can do it, we can.  The massive queues would be drastically reduced.  At the minimum, we should offer that to that section of our society that need our special attention, people who do not have powerful lobbies, unions and other organisations to fight their cause and defend them.</P>
      <P>Large amounts of scarce national resources are spent on appeals and counter-appeals with regard to social welfare, unemployment assistance and old age pensions.  With suitable offices strategically located, it should be possible to deal with most of these problems on the spot.  This is not such a big country.  Much money would be saved if we could organise in our towns and villages that there and then decisions could be made on a whole range of issues, with immense saving to the Exchequer.  Then social welfare would become what it should be, a weapon against poverty and not a battle of wits as it is at the moment.</P>
      <P>Most of our towns have pretty elaborate town halls, with plenty of scope, having reception areas and much else.  In many areas with which I am familiar there would be no need for extensive building. There are these massive buildings divided into reception areas, with a special room for councillors to meet in.  Those complete buildings could be utilised by the Departments of Social Welfare and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="216" /> Health, to deal with these delicate problems. Properly organised, this legislation should not cost that much extra money. On the contrary, with more efficiency a great deal of money will be saved.</P>
    <P>The people mentioned in the Schedule to the Bill must conduct their business in public in matters that are to them very confidential and private.  The result is that very often these people do without, rather than face the embarrassment of conducting their business in public. Deputy Jim Mitchell said in his introduction that it was a double embarrassment listening to other people's personal affairs and knowing that one's business would be overheard when one's turn came.  For that reason, we should all support this Bill.  It allows adequate time to carry out the necessary restructuring and the changes needed for implementation. Since we introduced this legislation only a week ago, the public are loud in their praise.  Already there is an awareness that something is being done to correct what they consider to be a very serious flaw in our society.  They are happy about it.  There are rumours about this matter going to committees.  The Minister should take the bull by the horns and start working on this aspect.  He should support the Bill and get to work, not with a massive outlay on buildings, but on a stage by stage basis, to tackle the pretty bad areas, which are probably in the cities and work his way around.  It may take a long time, but people are prepared to wait.</P>
    <P>In certain areas there are some improvements and these are welcome. To achieve what this Bill sets out to do, major reform is needed.  If what is needed cannot be achieved in the time limit set out in the Bill, the legislation can be amended to allow for additional time. Even if we decide to move in the direction of the thrust of the Bill, that will be an achievement.</P>
    <P>We must never say that because of the number who use health and other facilities it is impossible to guarantee privacy.  We should never use the word &ldquo;impossible&rdquo; in this respect.  It should be our aim, as Deputy Mitchell pointed out, <Col N="217" /> to move in that direction.  This Bill is to be commended, and Deputy Mitchell is to be commended for his initiative in bringing it before the House.  Anybody in public life cannot deny that there is a major problem in this area.  Solutions, with good will, will be found.  I would not agree at all that Deputy Mitchell was in any way hampered by lack of facilities, or that the Bill has shortcomings.  I have been in this House for a few years and find that the better legislation is simple and uncomplicated.  Tying legislation up with too much legalistic jargon and too many little clauses takes from its major thrust.</P>
    <P>Basically, the Bill sets out to achieve a simple, straightforward task, of offering privacy to members of the public in the areas of health, social welfare and revenue &mdash; even in agriculture.  Our agricultural offices are no better than the rest.  Right around the country, this is the sort of thing for which the public are looking.  The idea is right.  Of course, one can find reasons for not doing anything. So many people can find a problem to every solution but here we must find solutions to a very real problem.  I do not want to detain the House, but I came here to appeal to the Minister and the Government.  They certainly will have my support if they adhere to the main provisions of this legislation.  They should not pick holes and raise difficulties, but rather should look at the good points and have the legislation implemented.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with great interest to the last speaker and, in particular, to the very moderate terms in which he concluded his contribution.  It is a pity that we must at times come into the House and pit ourselves on opposite sides on issues on which clearly we all agree.  I do not believe that the proposals in this Bill are unreasonable.  I am on the record elsewhere as saying that this is one of the types of reform that must be introduced.  I am not certain that the appropriate way of introducing an incremental change in public administration, which is a very worth while change, is via legislation.  I do not want <Col N="218" /> to nitpick.  The Minister of State at the Department of Finance last week pointed out that the Government readily accepted the general principle of ensuring privacy for individuals being interviewed on matters of a personal nature in public Departments and offices.  That is the aim, I take it, the mover of the Bill wishes to achieve.  It is not so much a wish to score a political point as to move an issue here to be debated and highlighted.  That is welcome.</P>
      <P>Ireland's public administration suffers from many ills.  A lack of privacy in public offices is just one of them.  We have an over-centralised public administration. Deputy Hegarty made specific reference to the appeals system.  I can never for the life of me understand why, in the days of modern information technology, it is necessary for every little bit of paper in the Department of Social Welfare to go from the various offices around all the various parts of this country and up to Dublin as if there was some great <i>alter ego</i> up there, some great presence who would lay hands on these things and wisdom would flow forth.  Our public administration is excessively, extraordinarily and repressively centralised, and we should debate that issue.</P>
      <P>One reason I welcome the Bill is that it gives us the opportunity to look at these issues.  As every public representative and every Deputy in this House knows, these are the real things that bear down on the life and livelihood of ordinary citizens.  There is a feeling in Ireland that somehow or other the administration has been removed from the people, that it is repressive, not by intention and certainly not because of the specific intention of the people who are in public administration, but because of the way it has emerged and evolved over the years, and the fault is ours as politicians.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secretiveness is another aspect of Irish public administration.  A predecessor of mine in University College said Ireland's public administration guards its most lowly file as if it contained the last extant copy of the formula for eternal youth.  It is extraordinary.  You look for even basic information as a citizen, information you <Col N="219" /> should be entitled to and you are told you are not getting it.  That creates an &ldquo;us and them&rdquo; syndrome; it creates a veil behind which public administration operates and which obscures the value of public administration. Not only are the citizens paying the cost of this excessive secrecy, the public administration pay the price too, because there is a sense of division between the citizen and the administration. Anonymity, the concept of the faceless, mindless, removed bureaucrat, flows from secrecy.  I worked for many years in many different Departments of State and I can say that all civil servants have in common basic humanity and a wish to serve.  A few years back the then Department of the Public Service commissioned a major study of attitudes and for some reason it was never published. It was the Davis and Fine-Davis report. One thing that came across in that was a very interesting observation by the people surveyed that if somehow or other they could break through the secrecy, anonymity and institutionalisation of the State machine and make contact with individual civil servants, they would get justice, be listened to and receive consideration. However, the feeling in that report was always that the people were removed from the State, the State and the people were somehow or other at loggerheads.</P>
    <P>As has been mentioned time and time again in this debate, there is an excess of bureaucracy in this State.  We need a very serious reform of the whole system of public administration &mdash; not just in the matter of privacy which is just one small aspect, one dot on the great tapestry of what needs to be done.  Within our public administration we have an excess of forms, regulation and institutionalised procedures which belong more to the Victorian era than to the latter kick of the 20th century.  The report of the Public Service Organisation Review Group of 1969 &mdash; 20 years ago &mdash; attempted to address these issues and failed for a number of reasons.  The most commonly argued reason is that it failed because politicians did not wish it to succeed.  The <Col N="220" /> argument that has been put forward time and again was that politicians did not wish it to succeed because they were interested in perpetrating a gombeen man type of politics on which politicians fed.  That is a grotesque, crass untruth.  The Public Service Organisation Review Group got support from only one sector in the community, and that was a variety of Ministers and politicians that crossed across the scene through this House.  First of all, there was no great demand for it.  The Irish people never demanded that public administration be put on the agenda. Something Deputy Hegarty said touched the truth in this issue.  The people most affected by the secrecy, anonymity, excessive bureaucracy and centralisation are what has become known as the underclass, the people who depend on the State.  The problem is they have no great pressure group, no great interest group to argue their case.  Because their case is not articulated it is not put on the political agenda for reform and pressure in this House.  The Bill is welcome in that respect.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly our media must take some responsibility in this.  I remember years ago writing for a newspaper a series of articles on public administration.  The first, second and third were published and reasonably well received.  They were not necessarily the best journalism that ever flowed across the pages of that newspaper, but the fourth and fifth articles did not appear.  I asked the editor why and he said that the fourth article could not appear because they were doing a special on Richard Clayderman.  Maybe my journalism was not up to the standard of that of the person who wrote the piece on Richard Clayderman, but public administration reform is an issue that should seize the public attention and demands to be debated not just here but elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Throughout the period since the publication of the Devlin report this country went through a variety of changes with the situation in Northern Ireland, the economic depression, economic and political instability and changes of Government, all of which meant that it could not demand a place on the political agenda. <Col N="221" /> One other issue that prevented public administration being reformed during the last 20 years, was internal opposition within the administration.</P>
    <P>Over the years there has never been a dearth of expression of political willingness to achieve reform.  In 1969 when the Devlin report was published the then Minister for Finance &mdash; it happened to be a Fianna Fáil administration &mdash; was very strong in support of the reforms.  In 1973 when the administration changed the then Deputy Ryan, who moved into Finance and became shortly afterwards Minister for the Public Service, put into operation legislation which Fianna Fáil had left behind for them.  Again there was an expression of political will.  In 1977 the Government changed again and one interesting thing runs through the first day's debate as recorded in the Official Report.  That was the commitment that came from the highest political level to achieving public administration reform. That was reiterated.  I must be generous now and say that commitment to reform did not exist just in Fianna Fáil administrations. It got expression in Deputy John Boland's White Paper, yet none of the major proposals made by any of those Ministers or Ministers of State who served in the Department of the Public Service ever saw the light of day in any significant way.  Our public administration remains now as encumbered as it was with all the problems it had in 1969. Why?  The answer is simple.  The whole basis of our public administration is a Victorian concept which really has no place in a modern State.  It is the notion, the nonsense of ministerial responsibility, the view that somehow the Minister must and can be aware of everything that happens within his or her Department and therefore must be responsible for that Department.  That is a nonsense. It stretches credulity that even in a small Department in a bygone era this could have been the case.  In a Department like Social Welfare, Finance, Energy or Transport &mdash; any of the major Departments of State &mdash; this nonsense could not be put into practical effect.  The biggest problem in our administration is that we <Col N="222" /> do not recognise the nature of the problem. I wish this debate could be broadened to incorporate the full range of problems in public administration.  I say not in a critical way but as an observation that the very weakness of this legislation is that it focuses on minutiae, not small to the public who are affected but too small in the vast array of things that need to be done in public administration.</P>
    <P>We need not chastise ourselves unduly because the grand reform strategies which failed in the Devlin report here failed elsewhere as well.  The UK had its Fulton Report which came and went and did not change a great deal.  One American academic noted that implementation is and remains the Achilles heel of all public service reform programmes.  It remains the Achilles heel of public service reform programmes; it dies simply because of neglect, a lack of interest.  In politics and public life people must pay attention to the screaming babies and the crises which arise from time to time. Changing public administration deserves and requires a wholly different approach. One of the things we could and should perhaps do is have a standing committee of the Dáil or an Oireachtas joint committee which would consider on an on-going basis the whole issue of public service reform, not just the issue of privacy, secrecy or how we handle information in public administration but how we could continually review, update and generate a public debate on public administration.</P>
    <P>One thing which can be said for the public relations aspect of our work is that the 166 Members of Dáil Éireann, a good few Members of Seanad Éireann and many councillors around the country have an innate grasp of precisely where the crises lie in public administration. Every day in their clinics and correspondence they are put in touch with the problems that public administration unconsciously gives rise to.  We should really use the expertise not just in the on-going activity of constituency representation but somehow as a feedback into a reform process that would produce a public administration which would <Col N="223" /> obviate the need for public representatives spending so much of their time on the constituency caseload.</P>
    <P>I did a survey of Members of this House in 1981 when I was not involved in politics and had just left the Civil Service.  It produced some very interesting results. Approximately 104 contacts per week were made on average between Members of this House and citizens.  We did a comparative study in another country and we found that Irish public representatives were more in contact with their constituents than any other public representatives. It is a great pity that we cannot use to good effect that contact and the information which each of us receives in the hundreds and thousands of cases we handle every year, use and cannot generate an on-going debate. There is no mechanism or committee of this House which is dedicated to that task.</P>
    <P>The proposal in this Bill is not at all unreasonable.  I would have grave difficulty voting against this Bill because it is a desirable thing, but it is not enough in itself.  That is the criticism I would have.  There is a weakness in this Bill, but I do not say this in a critical sense since I have already congratulated the mover of the Bill.  The weakness of our approach to public service reform is well illustrated by what has been done in other countries. In 1981-82 I undertook a study for the OECD.  We looked at 12 OECD states and considered what had happened in those states which had public administration reform programmes.  In most of those states the major reform programmes had collapsed, but this had brought forward a political debate on the nature of public administration and on the relationship between public administration and the ordinary citizen.  This is a critical issue.  If public administration unconsciously grinds down the individual citizen then it does a great wrong.  The modern state machine has in its hand life and death decisions each day about ordinary citizens.  When decisions are made in the Department of Social Welfare they are not made simply against file <Col N="224" /> X or file Y.  Those decisions percolate out from that Department and hit at the life and well-being of the individual.  They can have a very profound effect.  We spend all our time in public life ameliorating that effect, going around with band aids trying to overcome the negative effect.</P>
    <P>What has been done elsewhere? Broadly speaking we could take initiatives under five different headings.  I apologise if the language is a little jargonistic. There were a great deal of measures aimed at ameliorating the general relationship between the citizen and the state.  In many ways these were costless measures and they have had tremendously beneficial effects on citizens in other developed states.  It would be appropriate to introduce measures like this here.  The second type of measures we found were information measures, which again were largely costless.  The third type were consultation measures, then measures of institutional improvements and finally de-institutionalisation measures.  Let us look at the first set of measures because they are relevant to what is proposed in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Under amelioration measures we found that OECD countries were becoming very concerned at what the French called the <i>guichet</i>, the point at which the citizen interrelates with the State machine.  The following measures were introduced in many OECD states and could be copied with effect here.  There were, first, reception measures which include privacy measures but go far further. The first aim in reception measures was to improve physical access for both the able-bodied and the non-able-bodied citizen.  There were measures aimed at improving the environment within public offices, including the creation of areas where privacy could be ensured.  Sign posting was improved.  A survey in France showed that one of the most important and popular measures introduced by the Government was improved sign posting in public offices.  Staggered and improved opening hours were another factor.  There was also common location of field offices and reciprocal <Col N="225" /> case handling arrangements.  If, for example, an old age pensioner goes into a health board and has a problem relating to social welfare as well, the official in the health board will take the social welfare aspect of the case to the Department of Social Welfare.  If this measure goes through we could expand this proposal by looking at these other measures and seeing what has been done elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Another area of intense activity in OECD states has been the sensitivity training of staff.  Sometimes staff are unnecessarily brusque and sharp with citizens. All public servants must recognise that however trying the citizen is, at the end of the day, the citizen is the person who employs that public servant.  This concept of sensitivity training, communications skills training, training on how to use telephone techniques, is widespread on the Continent of Europe and yet it has been dismissed here.  Good work was done in this area a few years ago in the Civil Service Training Centre. There was a very amusing little film called <i>Darby O'Gill and the little problems.</i> Unfortunately the good measures did not continue.</P>
    <P>Another major improvement under this broad heading of amelioration&mdash;and it does not cost the State a lot &mdash; is language improvement measures.  This is the most important of all areas because public communications, the correspondence that flows from State Departments and State agencies to the citizen, very frequently defy interpretation. Very frequently they are couched in language which is obscure and which hides the real meaning.  So one of the areas that clearly we could and should be debating is how to handle language. Staff training in language, the production of manuals as to how to deal with the public in the written word, is a very important innovation in a number of countries.  Interestingly enough the first country to actually produce such a manual was this country.  We produced, back in 1973, a little booklet called <i>Write it Better.</i>  It was the very first document produced by the Department <Col N="226" /> of the Public Service.  It was widely circulated at that time.  It showed people how to move away from the official format of letters and how to get into a more humane, a more day to day, discursive type correspondence.  Unfortunately the booklet is no longer circulated.</P>
    <P>The official application form is the most commonly used source of communication between the citizen and the State and, as we all know in this place, it is the form of communication that causes most difficulty.  The French have come up with a very novel and worth-while innovation. They have introduced an agency called CERFA which is attached to the Prime Minister's office and which audits every single form which is in circulation in public administration.  A form is looked at to ensure that its language is not obscure, to ensure that the questions on the form are not hurtful or excessively prying, to ensure that the information which is required is pertinent and that the form comes up to a certain drafting standard.  If the form does not comply with those standards it is declared illegal and its use would be considered a technical breach of the administrative code. The French are not the only country operating this.  In Austria I came across an extraordinary experiment which could again with effect and without any cost, be tried here in this country.  I refer to a system of readers/committees, people on whom they test market forms.  These committees are made up of people right across the board, from academics with linguistic skills to the people who actually have to fill in these forms.  The people say what they think about the forms and so there is a feedback within the public administration.  We could, with effect, and for very little cost, if we put our mind to it, introduce rafts of amendments, rafts of changes in the way we handle the public.</P>
    <P>The most elaborate forms of amelioration that one finds in OECD states is where they move into law, and that is one of the dangers of the position before us, where one moves to try to create a law which says how one actually administers. <Col N="227" /> Public administration is the most human of all arts and one cannot legislate, in effect, for good public administration because one is trying to legislate for common sense.  Good public administration is not a science; it is an art.  It is something that grows up, it is common sense expressed.  Some countries of course do not take that view and they have gone the route we are proposing to go here and produce long lists of codes of administrative practice.  The French, for example, have a <i>code admistratif</i> which would fill a fairly large library. Public administration Acts are common place enough.</P>
    <P>A second area of reform which does not cost a lot of money but simply requires the use of one's head occurs under the broad heading of information measures.  Citizens are very frequently starved of real information and we need to address that.  It is interesting that, in a number of the contributions here today, people made reference to that.  There is a need for improvement in the way we present printed information.  We need to establish or consider institutions to improve information.  Let me give some examples.  Again I refer to the French experiment.  The French have attached to a number of the major telecommunications centres agencies called CIRA.  These are centres for orienting people.</P>
    <P>In the case of CIRA one rings the telephone exchange with, say, a problem with a social welfare or customs and excise form or whatever.  There is an appropriate expert in the exchange, officials of the various departments, to handle those cases.  They do not resolve the cases there and then.  What they do is listen to the problems and tell the people who in the state agencies can deal with the problems.  They then send the information to the agency and the agency then contacts the people.  So the citizen's relationship with the state is improved and assisted.  The French have gone very much into technology in this area.  In public libraries one finds the use of computer technology to bring information to <Col N="228" /> the citizen.  We do not necessarily need to go down that route but certainly what is being done could, with effect, and with very little cost, be replicated here.  There is no reason we should not have a system for decentralising, for example, decisions and information in the Department of Social Welfare, by putting computer terminals in each office which can query the central record so that the office where the people come in can make a decision. That is something that should happen. Not just this Minister but Ministers in a variety of administrations have been anxious that we move along that road.</P>
    <P>There are other major propositions and other major changes that have been made in innovations and information handling, and the creation of specialist centres is something we should look at. There is a youth and services information services centre here in Dublin, but that is the only place one will find such a service in this country.  Youth in every other part of this country have specialist information requirements.  Why do we not have information centres dotted around the country?  In the communications information centres we have a citizen based information service but it is starved of funds not just this year but over the last ten years.</P>
    <P>We need to look at how we can use the explosion of information technology to improve the relationship between the citizen and the State.  We have not done that here.  We have not even begun to consider how modern information systems and modern communications systems can improve the relationship between citizen and administration.  We are light years behind some of our continental neighbours, particularly the French.</P>
    <P>There are other areas of changes in information which we should look at.  For example, the Austrians have tried to change the way law is expressed so that law becomes comprehensible to the ordinary citizen without the need to go to senior counsel to get contradictory views. The Austrians have tried to express law in readable language.  It does not seem <Col N="229" /> like a revolutionary concept, but when one looks at some of the stuff we produce, it certainly is a revolutionary concept because what ordinary citizen can sit down and read their way through the Finance Act and fully understand it? What official in the Department of Finance can read their way from the beginning to the end of the Finance Act and understand it?</P>
    <P>There are vast areas out there that we need to consider.  This legislation proposes just one specific aspect.  Under the heading of consultational and institutional measures a great deal has been achieved.  We have taken some institutional measures here.  The creation of an ombudsman was a very welcome institutional measure; the creation of an institution to handle data protection is a worthwhile measure; the creation of a Garda complaints mechanism is a worth-while measure, because all of these institutions help to redress the aftermath of citizen administration relationships.</P>
    <P>In this context I would like particularly to welcome what the Minister for Social Welfare has been saying about his intentions to look at and to bring forward proposals to Government about taking the appeals system out and institutionalising it.</P>
    <P>I wish to conclude by saying that I do not consider the proposal before us at all unreasonable.  It is a worthwhile proposal. If nothing else it has given a number of people in this House the opportunity to come in here and ventilate views as to how they see the relationship between the citizen and the State.  I wonder whether trying to put a privacy requirement such as this into law is the most workable way of achieving it.  I do not know what the answer to that is but I think there is a query there.</P>
    <P>The legislation before us deals with a small pinpoint on a whole tapestry of issues that need address. The debate we are having is a very worth-while one and I compliment the Deputy for introducing the measure.  We should be considering where we will go from here.  A committee that would audit the way the citizen is <Col N="230" /> dealt with by the State machine is at least as important as the committee that deals with public accounts or with State bodies or any of the other committees we set up from time to time.  As I have said, I do not think the proposal is unreasonable. The Government have already indicated that they accept the general principle behind this proposal but I would just put a small question mark about the feasibility of putting this type of proposal into law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say a few words on the Public Offices (Privacy of Interviews) Bill, 1988.  I have listened to a learned treatise from Deputy Roche who seems to be very well informed on public service reform.  He obviously put his time in the public service to good use and he certainly brought some of the newer ideas with him into this House.  He covered an extraordinarily wide area, contrary to what Deputy Mitchell had in mind when he introduced this Bill.  It seems the main purpose of the Bill was to deal with some of the problems that arise for the least well off people who attend the Departments mentioned in the first section, such as the Department of Social Welfare, the Department of Health, the health boards, the local authorities, the Department of Labour and so on.  What most people do not seem to realise is that there are quite a number of people who need assistance and who are illiterate.  I have been very surprised to find that in my town there is a substantial number of people who are not able to read or write. Most of these people are now unemployed and need assistance and they have to discuss very private matters openly in public offices.  I commend Deputy Mitchell for bringing in this Bill which proposes to reform, in a minute way, an area that has caused great degradation and great depression.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not saying that the officers administering these Departments have not made sacrifices.  Deputy Leyden, the Minister of State, who denied there was any problem in the Department of Health, should communicate with the health boards.  I can give an instance in <Col N="231" /> my constituency where the community welfare officer, out of the goodness of her heart, interviews applicants for medical cards and other aids to which people are entitled, in her motor car and this has taken place for a number of years.  That is the most private place she could find. That community welfare officer has been very generous in helping the community and this has been acknowledged. However, she has been transferred and the people in this parish now have to travel seven or eight miles further for their interviews for medical cards and other basic requirements.  The introduction of this legislation will have the effect of forcing health boards into a reexamination of the facilities they are making available to the public for private interviews such as I have outlined.</P>
    <P>Local authorities and county councils do not have enough private facilities either.  Many people are interviewed in their homes, some of which are not in the best of condition and leave a lot to be desired.  In the compilation of medical reports, health board officers interview people in their houses but a lot of the private information that is required should be teased out in the county council or the local authority offices.  I am sure one office in each county council area could be set aside in order to comply with the requirements of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food is aware that many public interviews take place with regard to agriculture.  There has been an outbreak of bovine disease in some of the western counties, particularly in my own constituency and many problems in this regard are discussed at an open counter where everyone can hear everyone else's business.  This leads to irate farmers visiting public representatives. Some of them have come to me, and I am sure to my colleagues, complaining about public office facilities. The office in Ennis which deals with this matter is a modern building and there would not be much structural change needed in order to provide the necessary privacy.  Perhaps the Office of Public <Col N="232" /> Works should be consulted about these buildings, many of which are prefab buildings to which the necessary changes could be made without much difficulty.</P>
    <P>Small farmers in particular make application for farmers' dole and social welfare officers are reluctant to interview these farmers and their families in their own kitchens.  A neighbour may be visiting the house when an officer arrives and the interview has to be conducted at the kitchen fire in his presence.  Many problems arise such as misinformation being given with the result that the officer disallows the application.  Many people suffer unnecessarily due to the lack of private facilities.  The Department of Social Welfare should reconsider the position regarding interviewing people for social assistance.  There is a central point in key locations in my constituency for dealing with these matters and perhaps the officers might reconsider the position.  Many people have complained about the lack of privacy in this area and wonder if something can be done about it.</P>
    <P>Some of the application forms sent out by the Departments can be very difficult to understand.  Many interviews with parents of school-going children take place in the home and there is a great reluctance on the part of a parent to admit that he or she is illiterate.  This causes enormous embarrassment.  In order to relieve the tension that arises, this small reform is necessary.  On the other hand in the banks they had big cages on their counters and when one wanted to do business one had to stretch in one's neck and conduct business in that way across the counter.  A lot of problems arose and it was very uncomfortable.  The banks came to terms with that by opening up their counters.  When one visits their premises nowadays one finds them refreshing open places.  They have not inherited the kind of Elizabethan style from earlier times.  The allocation of more space to accommodate customers is what makes the bank's system so successful in the transition.  Of course it would cost more money, perhaps too much, to provide extensive areas in <Col N="233" /> public offices to accommodate citizens. However, small improvements such as the provision of one room in county council offices for interviews should be considered. At the moment interview take place at an open counter behind which a lot of people are queueing, especially in the housing offices.  The county councils should have one adaptable room to meet interview requirements.</P>
    <P>I commend Deputy Mitchell for introducing this Bill.  I do not have anything like the reticence of Deputy Leyden, Minister of State at the Department of Health, in relation to it.  The Minister should look at the Department of Health and the health boards and ask them for their views on this Bill and whether they can do something to help the unfortunates who are suffering at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is strange to be discussing this Bill while Deputies in the House have great difficulty in conducting private or personal business in any kind of privacy.  It has been very obvious to me since my election to the House in February 1987 that there is no place where a Deputy can meet a constituent in privacy.  When constituents come to meet me I have to bring them either to the bar or to my office which I share with a colleague and two secretaries so those places are not private.  I know that prior to the renovations in the Seanad, interview rooms were available in the House. I hope they will be restored to Deputies and Senators.  It is ironic that we are discussing something like this while we public representatives have very limited access to private rooms in which to meet constituents.  Perhaps it is that lack which is reflected throughout the public service. The least we can expect, particularly now that more space is becoming available is that there should be a complete set of rooms where Deputies can discuss business with their constituents in a private and confidential manner.  It is slightly hypocritical to pass Bills and impose strictures on public servants in relation to how they conduct their business while the situation remains as it is in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the principle of the Bill <Col N="234" /> and would be surprised if anybody in the House could not subscribe to its general principle.  Every citizen who wants to conduct business privately with State Departments should have the right to privacy and to confidentiality.  I realise that certain aspects of business between citizens and State Departments are not necessarily private and confidential and that people would not insist on having private interview rooms for those aspects, but no matter what the business is some semblance of privacy should be extended to all our citizens.</P>
    <P>The areas most often mentioned during the course of this debate relate to the Revenue Commissioners and Social Welfare which are very sensitive areas.  I wholeheartedly subscribe to the view that everything should be done as quickly as possible to ensure complete privacy and confidentiality between the State and the citizen in their dealings with these areas. No one here would conduct business with a bank manager, an insurance broker or a doctor in public although in many cases the type of business being conducted is quite similar to the type of business being conducted by a citizen with the Department of Social Welfare or the Revenue Commissioners.  I do not know why the attitude of the public service or of State Departments should be so different from the attitude in the private sector.  The attitude seems to be that anything will do for the general public when dealing with the State sector.  In earlier years one got the impression that the State did not want to be bothered with people asking about social welfare entitlements, tax affairs and so on.</P>
    <P>Earlier in the debate the lack of privacy was defined in two ways in that either one could be actually overheard or could be observed doing business.  In many State Departments, especially Social Welfare and Revenue, but also in local authorities it would be unusual for a person not to be overheard or seen conducting his business.  I know how the system operates in Meath County Council.  I am not being critical in any way of the staff of the county council or the staff of the other public bodies because they have to work <Col N="235" /> within the constraints that exist.  They have a very fine staff in Meath County Council, who are understanding and sympathetic to the clients, but sections where the most sensitive of business has to be transacted such as rates, revenue or rent are housed in offices that are completely and totally inadequate.  It would take a great deal of money to refurbish them on the lines suggested in the Bill; nevertheless, I think that this should be done.</P>
    <P>The local authorities, in particular, would find this very difficult and my reservations about the Bill are that this will cost a great deal of money and that the public offices have to carry out the refurbishment within a limited time span. Deputy Mitchell suggested that public bodies would get one year in which to bring their office accommodation up to the required standard, but I do not think that would be adequate.  While I agree with the principle, I think that that is something that we could argue about and change on Committee Stage, if the Bill gets that far.</P>
    <P>All Members of the House would recognise that progress has been made in improving the accommodation at employment exchanges.  Much work has been completed over the past number of years but I know as a rural Deputy that a great deal more progress needs to be made.  I mentioned earlier that people can be observed.  I think it is totally unacceptable that people who have to queue for unemployment assistance or benefit may be seen not only when conducting their business at the exchange but can be observed standing outside the employment exchange in many of our towns. Again I know this arises in my own county and in many other counties around the country.  People have to queue outside the employment exchange, come rain hail or shine, until they get in to sign on. I think it is bad enough for a person to be unemployed and having to sign on but it is an added insult that they have to stand out in the rain where everybody who is passing can see them.  If the Bill did nothing else but brought a halt to that practice, I think it would be well justified.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="236" /> All Deputies have referred to the tax offices and they best exemplify the lack of privacy, the danger of being overheard and the visual observation.  I do not think I need to describe the system again as it has been described already by many Deputies.  Everybody knows how the hatch system operates and how you have to go to a particular hatch number.  I am very pleased that the Revenue Commissioners have at last published a charter of rights and I am even more pleased that they have given two key commitments, first, people will get courtesy and consideration; second, they will be entitled to privacy and confidentiality.</P>
    <P>I am a member of the Committee of Public Accounts and we have had several meetings with the Revenue Commissioners and, in particular, with the chairman of the Revenue Commissioners, and I had advocated changes in the system that they operate.  I am pleased that the charter of rights has been initiated and published but I wonder how they will put it into effect in those two key areas, courtesy and consideration.  If there are 30 people standing in line with you and 30 more people behind you, how can the person at the hatch deal with you in privacy?</P>
    <P>I do not think that that is consideration, and as for privacy and confidentiality, there is no way you can say you have either in those circumstances.  I hope that this charter of rights will be more than a written document advertised in newspapers and so on and that it will become a real experience.  I suggest that, rather than passing legislation, this might be the way forward and that, instead of producing rules and laws &mdash; and I will deal with this point later &mdash; we change the attitude prevalent in many Government Departments.  That might be more advantageous to the general public who have to use State facilities.</P>
    <P>When we discuss confidentiality in public offices, most people cite positive examples in the private sector, but I wonder exactly how confidential is the business we transact with our banks.  I understand that in the computerised systems it is possible for any staff member <Col N="237" /> to get information on any person, no matter at which branch they hold their account.  If that is true, I do not think we should make great play of the fact that we have confidentiality when transacting private business.  If the allegation that any member of the bank staff can read my bank account is sustainable &mdash; and they would not have a whole lot to read &mdash; so much for confidentiality.  We should bear this in mind when discussing privacy at Government offices.</P>
    <P>There are some situations, for example, social welfare, where you have to go in person to sign on but in other offices such as the tax office, there is no reason why people have to go there. Confusion arises because people do not understand the system as it operates nor the forms they have to fill in or do not know exactly what they have to do to obtain their rights.  Deputy Roche said earlier that this is an area where reforms could be undertaken in the public service. If things were made more simple for the ordinary citizen and public departments responded more quickly and sympathetically at the initial stage, I think there would be much less need for people to call in person to offices and fewer problems in the area of privacy and confidentiality.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned that I am worried about the timespan and the cost that would arise.  I am also worried, and this was referred to already, about the power that would be given to the Minister to extend the legislation to cover the private area.  In this context, reference was made to the banks, and in the course of his presentation Deputy Mitchell referred to the credit unions.  I question the wisdom of including this provision.  It would be an unwarranted intrusion.  In the case of a credit union, if it did not provide a reasonable degree of privacy and confidentiality, its clients would go elsewhere.</P>

      <P>In responding to what Deputies have said, I ask the Minister to explain how he plans to enforce the amendment before the House.  We are all agreed with what he is trying to achieve to the benefit of the Irish independent bookmaker.  The rules of the game should be the same for the English multiples and the Irish independent bookmaker.  In the long run the punter should gain, even though there is no doubt that in the short term they will be less than impressed with what we are trying to achieve here today. If the bookmaker no longer has to absorb the tax out of his own margin he should be in a position to give better odds to the punter with the result that the punter would gain in the long run.</P>
      <P>In responding I ask the Minister to make particular reference to telephone bets.  It is now a very common practice for many people to bet by phone with their local friendly bookmaker.  It is hard enough to enforce the present provisions where a person walks off the street into the bookmaker's office, puts the money on the counter and has the option of either paying the tax on the bet or on the winnings, but I am not sure what the Minister has in mind in relation to the keeping of books on telephone bets. Before we broke for Private Members' time facetiously we suggested that if the Minister had a word with his colleague, Deputy Seán Doherty, as to how this might be regularised he might be in a position to advise him, but I am sure the Minister has something specific in mind.</P>

      <P>Indeed I have &mdash; the very same system that exists at present &mdash; test betting.  We can test bet on the phone in the same way we can test bet in the office.  I can assure the House that Customs and Excise have been extremely successful in recent times in bringing prosecutions in relation to off course betting.  Those who follow the racing calendar would know about the <Col N="240" /> big swoop at the major meeting in Tralee last September.  There is an ongoing process of test betting.</P>
      <P>Having said that, I would like to deal with the practice which has evolved in recent times of a bookmaker offering to bear the cost himself.  It is now more widespread than ever.  This is generally known as tax free betting.  It is offered particularly by the larger chains of bookmakers as an inducement to punters to move their business to bookmakers offering these terms.  However, many bookmakers see this practice as an unfair ploy which puts them at a significant competitive disadvantage.  This practice is facilitated by the absence from betting duty legislation of an obligation on bookmakers to require punters to pay over to bookmakers at the same time as making payment for the relevant bet an amount equal to the excise duty on the bet.  This is now being remedied.  The section would also prohibit the advertising of tax free betting.  Therefore, we are tackling tax free betting and inserting into legislation a provision that would make it illegal for bookmakers to carry on like that.</P>

They tend to go the other route in relation to bets.  They are being run as ordinary corporate businesses, not for the personal gain of those who run them. They are paying their duty.  I have no doubt that they will observe the law.  They will be tested the same way as every other bookmaker.  I have seen the list of those who have been brought to court and the penalties which were imposed, and I can tell the Deputy that the law is being enforced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>For the Deputy's information, the betting Act is simple legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be old but it is good legislation.  Under the most simple administrative structure £24 million is brought in.  The fact that it is old legislation does not mean it is bad legislation, far from it.  If parts of it are bad I will take a look at it, but I can tell the Deputy that the legislation places an onus on the bookie to pay his tax.  That is a very cheap, simple way of administering it. This new provision would be enforced in the same way as the present legislation is enforced by the Revenue Commissioners. I have little doubt that those who run large offices and offer tax free bets will obey the law, as they have done up to now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to some of the other queries raised by Deputy Doyle, I never said that giving money to the racing board was irrelevant.  It is relevant but there are many other aspects which are also relevant and these need to be tackled.  It is not my responsibility to sort out some of the deficiencies in racing.  It is not the responsibility of the Minister for Finance to do so, rather it is the responsibility of the racing board and everybody involved in racing.  I have no way of correcting them.  Having said that, the level of prize money is a major factor but then again so is attendances at meetings.  I was present at the Phoenix Park for the Cartier Million &mdash; I do not know if the Deputy was present &mdash; for which there was only a small field even though one could not get a bigger prize.  If one did not include all the invited guests the attendance was small.  On the other hand, <Col N="243" /> I could point to a Sunday race meeting at Leopardstown where, because the cost of entry was reduced, the place was packed with families.  Market research must be done as to why ordinary people are not attending race meetings but that is a matter for somebody else to deal with.  That is what I meant when I said that there were other issues to be dealt with in relation to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister and I may have been talking at cross purposes.  I accept that when I was interjecting I was out of order.  When I referred earlier to not one bookmaker being within the law, I was talking about the general legislation in relation to bookmakers and the Minister referred specifically to betting and the legislation covering that.  All the major bookmakers accept that none of them is operating with the law.  Small or big, they cannot operate within the legislation covering bookmakers at present and there should not be any argument about that.  We should not confuse the issue and perhaps I have contributed to the confusion by my interjections.</P>
      <P>We are all trying to arrive at the same point in relation to this and the previous amendment which was neither put to the House nor withdrawn.  I am sure Deputy Noonan accepts that the offer of the Minister for Finance to look at the overall situation in the short term &mdash; and certainly before next year's budget &mdash; is an indication of goodwill towards achieving what we proposed in our amendment. Indeed the Minister will have our support in what he is trying to achieve in the amendment now before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Test betting appears to be the means the Minister feels will be sufficient to enforce this amendment and all the other aspects of the betting Act.  We have had difficulty in this area before and evasion of taxation, which this loophole is supposed to close, by any means has been rife in this area.  There was an enormous improvement, as we said earlier, when the off course betting tax was reduced from 20 per cent to 10 per cent.  Could we tie the two amendments together?  I <Col N="244" /> wish to bring the Minister's attention to the fact that my proposal in the previous amendment would be a far easier mechanism of achieving what the Minister is now proposing in that the lowest possible rate of off course betting is the best weapon in his fight against tax evasion. Far more legal betting would be done if the tax was at a realistic level.</P>
    <P>I am still not quite sure what method the Minister uses at the moment or how the test betting in relation to telephone calls work.  I presume if one rings up as a Customs and Excise official and ask to put on a bet, the bet would not be accepted unless one was a regular customer of that bookmaker and had credit facilities with him.  I am quite sure they would not take an over-the-telephone bet from any Joe Smith on the street.  Maybe some of them are foolhardy enough to do so but the cleverer bookmakers will only take telephone bets from their regular customers whom they know on a personal basis.  Perhaps the Minister feels he has a tighter method of enforcing this legislation than the existing law.  I wish him well because we support the intention of the amendment.  In the long term, as we said before, it will be in the interest of the punter who should get better odds from bookmakers who will not have to find the tax themselves from their margins. The wording of the amendment in relation to the prohibition of advertising is still unclear.  Deputy McDowell also had doubts in this regard.  The present legislation forbids the enticement to betting and advertising of any kind is enticement. Therefore, under the present legislation enticement to tax free betting of any kind is illegal or perhaps the expression in section 41 (2) (b) accepts, or purports (expressly or otherwise) to accept payment ... contains an implication in regard to advertising, but it is far from clear.  Perhaps the Minister will indicate what section specifically prohibits the advertising of tax free betting, whether it is in this amendment or in the general legislation in relation to bookmakers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister indicated on the last day we debated the subject that he intended to bring forward this amendment and I welcome it.  He will recall that I made representations to him to introduce an amendment regarding off course betting and to make it illegal for the bookmaker to offer tax free betting.  I had long negotiations with the previous Minister for Finance, the former Deputy MacSharry, but he could not see his way to introducing such an amendment. I am glad that Deputy Reynolds has taken his courage in his hands in this regard.  On course betting it is illegal for the bookmaker to offer tax relief, he must deduct the tax when the bet is made. Many small bookmakers will welcome this amendment in relation to off course betting.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Doyle said, a previous Minister for Finance, Deputy Dukes, wisely reduced the off course tax from 20 per cent to 10 per cent which was a great step forward because it reduced the evasion in bookies' offices.  Deputy McGahon and I spoke about this and caused an uproar at the time but the reality was that most substantial bets off course were not recorded and no one paid the tax.  It is quite evident from the figures the Minister gave last year that in a few years the gross amount of betting in Dublin will yield the same amount of tax.  The world of betting is a twilight one and it is appropriate to recall what happened in the state of Nevada.  They reduced the tax rate there some years ago from 5 per cent to 2.5 per cent and there was such an increase in betting that they decided to reduce it to 0.5 of 1 per cent which caused betting to quadruple.</P>
      <P>I wholeheartedly welcome this amendment because, although some politicians on entering the Dáil lose sight of reality, the Minister is still in touch with the real world.  With all due respect to the officials in the Department of Finance I am sure they do not understand racing, unlike the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the tax was reduced from 20 per cent to 10 per cent the big chains of bookmakers have come in here but it is just not possible to offer tax free betting <Col N="246" /> as far as the small bookmaker is concerned. It is no secret that the gross margin on off course betting is about 14 per cent or 15 per cent, depending on how well the operation is run.  If you take 10 per cent out of that to pay the punter's tax you are left with nothing.  The big chains would do it because 4 per cent of £1 million is better than 12 per cent of £100,000.  They could offer tax free betting and squeeze out their competitors. It is not possible for small bookmakers to offer this facility as they are working on very small margins.  I do not know whether it is in the long term interest of the punters to have the big bookmakers here but business is business and they are welcome.  They have introduced great facilities and so on.  However, when they move into a town and want to get rid of a competitor they introduce better facilities and offer tax-free betting.  There is no doubt that the small bookmaker would be wiped out.  I am in favour of keeping small bookmakers in business because it will keep competition in the market.</P>
    <P>We should learn from what happened in Britain.  There the big four, Ladbrokes, Corals, Hills and Mecca &mdash; Corals have since taken over Hills &mdash; wiped out competition. The ordinary punter has very little chance and I speak as one who punts with the major bookmaking chains there.</P>
    <P>The difference between the Irish bookmaker and his English counterpart can be explained in a story which I shall relate. Some year ago there was a famous case regarding a horse called Yellow Sam owned by a person who is a friend of mine and of the Minister.  The course price was set up in such a way that he was returned at 20/1 with all the money placed off course.  Certain things may have been done one way or another but the horse was returned at 20/1 and the off course bookmakers paid out in Ireland.  They kicked up holy stink but they paid out. There was a similar case in Britain some years ago regarding a horse called Gay Future which was returned at 10/1 at a course known as Cartmel on a bank holiday Monday.  The same technique was used &mdash; all the money was off course and none on course &mdash; and the man who <Col N="247" /> organised the coup from Ireland &mdash; he has since passed to his eternal reward &mdash; figured in a subsequent court case in England.  Worst still, the British bookmakers neither paid out the money that was won nor refunded the stake.  If the bookmakers in England consider that there is price rigging of any kind they will not pay out.  The off course market in England is so bad now that the big chains are rigging the prices on the tracks to return low odds in the shops.</P>
    <P>If we do not continue to have small bookmakers in Ireland something similar will occur here.  The effect of the Minister's amendment will be that the independent bookmaker will have a chance of surviving and his survival is necessary if the ordinary punter is to have a chance. I do not want to see the big chains getting a monopoly, as occurred in the UK where they have control of the system.  The punter does not have any chance.  If the independent bookmaker continues in business competition will remain in the market and that will be good for trade.  I am glad that at last we have a Minister for Finance who lives in the real world and I congratulate him on bringing forward this measure.</P>

      <P>In case Members cannot recall I should like to tell them that the main punter who backed Yellow Sam had a bright future and those who backed Gay Future had a very bad future.  Yellow Sam, at 20/1 at Bellewstown, gave the owner a marvellous rolling farm in County Westmeath.  There again, had the horse broken his leg he would have lost his money and that is something Members forget.  It is naive to suggest that a Customs and Excise officer test betting an office, whether it is off course or over the 'phone, would declare himself <Col N="248" /> as a Customs and Excise officer.  He would not do that in a million years.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>I heard Deputy Doyle suggesting that if a customs officer wanted to open an account or place a bet with a bookie and the bookie knew who he was the law would not be broken.  We would never find anybody breaking the law if that was the real world.  The trouble about the Deputy is that she does not know what the real world is like.  In the real world a Customs and Excise official, looking like an ordinary country punter, places a bet in a bookie's office, goes to the local put and has a few jars with the lads who back on every race and returns to the bookie's office to place another bet.  That is done over a period.</P>

There would not be anything in the bookie's office to record its existence; it would be written on the back of a cigarette packet or on a piece of paper in the bookie's pocket.

People cannot place credit bets in Ireland; they have to place them outside of the country which, of course, is illegal.  Anyone who has been in another country and rang one of the big betting chains to place a bet will know that all telephone bets are recorded in the interests of the bookmaker and the client. Of course, a person would not ring England to place bets like that.</P>

    <P>The point I am making is that the test betting system which operates at present <Col N="253" /> is fairly efficient.  The tax rates are reasonably low at present and hopefully they will come down.  However, no matter what the tax rate is, there will always be a certain amount of evasion &mdash; there will be VAT evasion by shopkeepers and income tax evasion by other people.  I believe that if we do not make it attractive to evade tax there will be less of it.  The test betting procedures which operate at present are adequate.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="255" /> This amendment increases the annual turnover thresholds above which traders are obliged to register for VAT purposes. First, the threshold of £25,000 which applies mainly in the case of traders who sell goods will be increased to £32,000 and, second, the threshold of £12,000 which applies in the case of all other traders will be increased to £15,000.  The purpose of the amendment is to free additional traders from the burden of complying with VAT registration and accounting requirements.  About 1,500 traders should be eligible to cancel their VAT registration as a result of this amendment.  The cost involved in small, about £200,000 in 1989 and £500,000 in a full year.</P>
    <P>The last time turnover registration thresholds were adjusted was in 1983 when they were reduced respectively from £30,000 to £25,000 and from £15,000 to £12,000.  The present increases will do no more than adjust the 1983 threshold levels in line with changes in monetary values since 1983.  The amendment takes account of Deputy Noonan's amendments on Committee Stage and this Stage.  However, EC VAT law permits increases in turnover registration thresholds only in line with decreases in monetary values.  Based on the levels set in 1983 increases in thresholds above the level specified in this amendment are not possible.</P>
    <P>I commend the amendment to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick West) Mr. Noonan (Limerick West)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Limerick East</i>): I welcome the Minister's amendment.  On Committee Stage I suggested a doubling of all thresholds and on Report Stage I looked for a more moderate increase in thresholds.  I suggested that where the threshold was £12,000 it should be increased in all cases to £18,000 and where it was £25,000, that is for the sale of goods, it should be increased to £38,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has met the principle involved here and has moved his amendment to increase the thresholds from £12,000 to £15,000 in all cases with the exception of the sale of goods where he <Col N="256" /> is proposing to increase it from £25,000 to £32,000.  I am glad the Minister has pointed out that there is an inhibition on him under EC regulations which confine the raising of the thresholds effectively to indexation, using the existing thresholds as the base year at the time they were introduced.  I accept that the Minister has gone as far as he possibly can in this respect, and I welcome this.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to give an indication of the thresholds for similar activities in other EC countries, for example, in the United Kingdom and possibly in one or two other European countries, if he has that information to hand.  In the absence of that precise information I should like him to indicate the range of thresholds in EC partner countries from the highest threshold to the lowest threshold.  It seems to me that we are out of line with some of the European countries.  We bring people into the VAT net at very low turnover rates and I want to know what the comparative position is in other EC countries.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage I outlined the case very briefly and I think it is worth repeating the basis of the argument.  I will take, for example, a self-employed man who has developed a business in hanging curtains and who has worked his business to the extent that his monthly turnover has exceeded £1,000 per month.</P>
    <P>Under the old thresholds as soon as his monthly turnover exceeded £1,000 per month he would have to register for VAT and, in those circumstances, would be placed at an immediate disadvantage. Once he has to register for VAT his costs to his clients, most of whom will be housewives, will increase by 25 per cent.  This means that in effect what he had sold previously in the course of a year at £12,000 he would now have to sell at £15,000 per annum.  Of course, his overall position would be more complicated because, in the curtain-making business, he would have few enough purchases to set off against VAT once he had registered. He would not be trading in curtain materials and, consequently, his major input would be the cost of his own labour. Then he would be faced with the position <Col N="257" /> that most of his competitors would be operating in the black economy anyway. Therefore, legitimising oneself effectively puts one out of business and works counter to employment.  The raising of the thresholds does constitute a positive incentive to employment for self-employed persons.</P>
    <P>Historically it would have been difficult to do this &mdash; the previous Government moved to remove thresholds &mdash; because it was not evasion or possible loss of revenue on the VAT side about which they were concerned but rather the consequent loss of revenue on the income tax side.  When there was no liability to self-assessment the only reasonable cross-check was the VAT register.  Now that there is self-assessment the same rules of self-assessment will apply to the small trader as to anybody else, the same obligations and spot checks will apply. Therefore the necessity, for the sake of cross-matching, to have a trader with a very small turnover register for VAT simply as a method to check his liability to income tax is no longer applicable.  It is timely that this move be made.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased the Minister has again accepted the spirit of the amendment I tabled.  In view of his explanation of EC regulations imposing an inhibition on him, I am not quarrelling with the levels he is introducing here.  I withdraw amendment No. 15 in my name and I propose to agree to the Minister's amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the Minister's raising of the thresholds, I agree with Deputy Noonan, this is a reasonable response to the circumstances prevailing. However, on reflection I am amazed that when we reduced the threshold in 1983 to £12,000 &mdash; because of the limitation on subsequent indexation of levels within the EC &mdash; we actually prevented ourselves from having a more reasonable limit now, which is somewhat extraordinary. One would have imagined that it having been £15,000 in 1983 we would now have a limit of say, £20,000 or whatever without any bother.  However, that is water under the bridge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="258" /> The point I should like to raise with the Minister is the question of thresholds as they relate to occasional trading.  I have had a number of complaints &mdash; I have written to the Minister about them &mdash; about occasional traders coming from abroad, operating here and getting licences for occasional trading.  These people do not have to register for VAT at all.  I will not go into all of the details but a major concern is in the area of fur trading, occasional sales being carried on in hotels here, with the fur traders in question using foreign Access and Visa machines so that the whole operation means trading in Ireland in very strange circumstances.  Of course the Irish fur trade were very anxious that the proper declarations of value be made.  At the time I wrote to the Minister suggesting that nobody should be allowed to get an occasional trading licence here in certain areas unless they also registered for VAT.  I am not talking about grocers at fairs or the like.  But, in relation to high value goods there should be an absolute requirement that, for example, if one wants to trade in something like fur coats in Ireland, one must be registered for VAT; there should be a prohibition against such traders operating without having registered for VAT.  That is only in the interest of the Irish members of the fur trade.  They should not be wiped out by predatory raids on the part of people who can operate apparently with total disregard for the law.</P>
    <P>Bearing in mind that the Minister is raising the thresholds, of which I am in favour, I would ask him if he would now take on board the necessity to prevent people from making predatory raids from abroad in high value goods, such as watches and the like.  There is huge ease, especially in commodities which are difficult for Customs and Excise officials to value coming in at Dún Laoghaire, such as piles of fur coats, for people to declare incorrectly the value of the goods they are bringing in and re-export those they do not sell, when the Revenue are no wiser one way or the other.  If they use Visa and Access machines with English accounts the transactions never show in <Col N="259" /> any shape or form and VAT in Ireland is evaded completely.  They are being facilitated by being given occasional trading licences by this State.</P>
    <P>I wrote to the Minister about it because the Irish Fur Traders' Association wrote to me really annoyed about the situation. When increasing VAT thresholds I would ask the Minister to bear that in mind, that it is not sufficient.  There are some people who, by virtue of the fact that whatever their threshold &mdash; because they are exempt for a day's sales of £15,000 in Ireland, and would not have to register for VAT because they are effectively exempt &mdash; they can get a licence to trade occasionally and rip off the Irish tax gatherer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>In response to the points raised by Deputy McDowell with regard to traders coming in from abroad, taking in goods and conducting sales, I should say that, first, they are caught for VAT at the point of import.  I would accept that there are difficulties encountered with regard to the issuance of occasional trading licences, an issue that I placed under the microscope in the Department of Industry and Commerce before leaving there.  It is a difficult area. Customs and Excise officials have a difficult task in trying to keep up with them.</P>
      <P>It reminds me of a story told in the midlands about itinerants trading in watches, bringing them in from abroad, that they pay full duty on say, 1,000 watches, have the receipts and documentation available.  Yet every time a Customs and Excise official arrived they never had any more than 1,000 watches.  They might be selling them from, say, a false bottom in a van or the like.  There are difficulties encountered in that area.  The question of tightening up on occasional trading licences is one way of confronting the issue but would mean a partial solution only.  It is an area that is under review in the Department of Industry and Commerce, the relevant Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should point out that our thresholds are the highest in Europe at present.  To give the House some examples, in the <Col N="260" /> United Kingdom they are £27,579 or the equivalent thereof.  Thresholds in some other European countries are very low. Heretofore ours stood at £25,000, now they will be £32,000.  Those in Greece stand at £4,700, Germany, £7,500, so we are well at the top of the league in any of the examples one might care to take. That is as far as we can go.</P>
    <P>With the introduction of self-assessment there is less need for the circumstances that obtained some years ago.  With self-assessment, the value of VAT registration for income tax purposes and cross-reference does not exist to the same extent any longer.  That is why I have moved as far as I could in that respect.  I believe it meets the circumstances and should be acceptable to the House.</P>

      <P>(<i>Limerick East</i>): On Committee Stage I put down an amendment proposing that the Minister would extend the scope of the reduction of the 25 per cent VAT rate to 10 per cent in respect of other articles of craftsmanship.  The Minister had confined the original scope of the reduction to original hand executed works of art&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Limerick East</i>): &mdash;&mdash;hand manuscripts, hand paintings, lithographs and so on.  The issue was that we could extend the 10 per cent rate and reduce it from the existing 25 per cent in respect of antiques.  We were talking first of antique furniture, then of antiques which would be made of silver, glass or porcelain.  In an attempt to define what an antique was, we said it would be furniture or anything made of these materials and which would be more than 100 years old.  That was the intent of my amendment.  So far as I can see the Minister has accepted the spirit of the amendment and incorporated it here in this amendment.  This has received a wide welcome in the trade.  I am glad the Minister has done this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of issues arise.  First, it is the practice, certainly in rural areas, to include miscellaneous items of antique <Col N="263" /> furniture in the auction, say, of the contents of a house.  It is also the practice and it is widespread that, rather than selling antiques in an antique shop, to put them into the local parish hall in the course of a general auction of antiques and objects of art.  If something is sold at auction a VAT rate applies but not on the value of the article.  The VAT applies on the value of the service of the auctioneer, it applies to the auctioneer's commission.  It is not 25 per cent of the value of the antique table but it is 5 per cent of that again &mdash; it is the commission &mdash; or perhaps less because regularly it would be 2½ per cent or 2 per cent.  Secondly, antique works, which frequently are works of art, have been spirited out of the country.  Irish collectors cannot compete with the differentiation of VAT rates between here and the United Kingdom.  Even more than that, if, for example, a particularly significant object appears in Sothebys, or one of the London auction rooms, or wherever, and an Irish collector purchases it and brings it back to Ireland, at the point of importation he is subject to the 25 per cent Irish VAT rate.  This is bringing about a situation where very valuable artefacts &mdash; not only of cultural and artistic merit but of historic merit &mdash; cannot be repatriated without a 25 per cent levy and that is keeping things out of the country.  While collectors would obviously, in certain circumstances, purchase such items, there is a tendency to keep them in the country of purchase, which is the UK, rather than repatriate them to Ireland because of the disadvantage.  Now it will be possible for items such as those I have in mind to be brought back to Ireland and the VAT imposition will be 10 per cent, not 25 per cent.  This is very significant progress and I thank the Minister for listening to the arguments I made on Committee Stage and for bringing in an amendment to cover the points I made.</P>
    <P>There is a number of points I would like to raise about the amendment.  I notice that the Minister has repeated paragraphs (b) and (c).  I thought he had <Col N="264" /> made some change but when I cross-matched it with the section it seems to be a repeat.  I am wondering if there is some curiosity in drafting or if there is an actual change that I have missed in paragraphs (b) and (c).</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>It is just a drafting point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Limerick East</i>): Paragraph (d) is the new portion of the section.  The Minister intends to control this by regulation.  I have no objection to that.  It is appropriate that there would be regulations.  It would be very difficult to cover all eventualities in the text of the amendment so I do not have any problem with it.  An article of furniture, silver, glass or porcelain covers the range of materials I had in mind and whether hand decorated or not covers another point. Antiques of more than 100 years old are quite frequently manufactured goods. The original scope of the Minister's amendment was that everything had to be hand done, hand painted, hand made, etc.  Mass produced manufactured goods, especially in the furniture trade, can be very significant antiques.  I presume there is nothing in the section nor in the intended regulations the Minister has in mind which would confine this simply to items that are hand made, whether they are furniture, silver, glass or porcelain and which would rule out manufactured items.  If manufactured items are ruled out, there is not a lot of concession being given here.  In the case of furniture one is talking about furniture which was the highly skilled work of craft shops but certainly not hand made.  Frequently there was a manufacturing process.  The same is true of porcelain.  It would be in a situation where it would neither be a once off nor would it be totally done by hand.  I presume the intention here &mdash; in the absence of anything else being said &mdash; is to allow for that.  I also notice that the onus of proof is on the person who is claiming the VAT at 10 per cent.  That is right.  I do not think it is appropriate that the Revenue Commissioners or the Department of Finance would have to <Col N="265" /> put up a section to authenticate the date of antiques.  I have no objection, if people are looking for a concession, that the onus of proof should be on them.  As I mentioned on Committee Stage in the case of silver there is no problem because all silver is hallmarked.  In other areas, for example, furniture, porcelain and glass any reputable trader is in a position to authenticate age and I presume it will be authentication through the vendor rather than authentication on behalf of the purchaser which will be required.  I presume what the Minister intends is that in the regulations there will be some form of certification by the reputable vendor which will indicate or certify that a particular object is more than 100 years old and consequently that the purchaser can claim VAT at 10 per cent, or is it the intent that he will pay at 25 per cent and reclaim the 15 per cent?  I should like a comment on the mechanism there.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">

      <P>I move amendment No. 19:</P>
      <P>In page 64, between lines 19 and 20, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;68.&mdash;(1)  The First Schedule (as amended by the Finance Act, 1970, and subsequent enactments) to the Stamp Act, 1891, is hereby amended under the heading &lsquo;LEASE&rsquo;&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  by the substitution of the following paragraph for paragraph (1):</P>
      <P>&lsquo;(1)  For any indefinite term or any term not exceeding 35 years:</P>
      <P>Of any dwelling-house, part of a dwelling-house, or apartment at a rent not exceeding £6,000 per annum&mdash;&mdash;Exempt&rsquo;,</P>
      <P>and</P>
      <P>(b)  by the deletion of subparagraph (a) of paragraph (2).&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Committee Stage, I promised to consider favourably exempting from stamp duty leases of residential property where <Col N="267" /> the term of the lease is either indefinite or is less than 35 years and where the annual rent is less than £6,000.  New section 68 gives effect to this promise. The First Schedule of the 1891 Stamp Act, as amended by subsequent enactments, lists the instruments which must be stamped with the duty payable.  The exemption applies to any dwellinghouse or part of a dwelling or an apartment, which would include a flat.  Previously there was a distinction between furnished and unfurnished houses and flats, but this has now been removed.  The exemption applies only if the annual rent is less than £6,000 per annum, which is approximately £500 a month.  The lease must be for an indefinite term or any term not exceeding 35 years.  There is no change in the stamp duty charged on residential leases with annual rent of over £6,000 and where the term exceeds 35 years. Leases on commercial and industrial property are still subject to stamp duty regardless of the annual rent and terms of lease.  There will be a small loss of revenue here.  On the administrative side there will be savings, as there will no longer be any necessity to stamp short-term residential leases.  This takes on board, by and large, the suggestions made by the two Deputies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick West) Mr. Noonan (Limerick West)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Limerick East</i>): I genuinely welcome amendment No. 19.  It is an alternative to amendment No. 20.  I will, of course, accept the Minister's amendment and withdraw amendment No. 20.  This amendment was not put down for the purpose of giving people a monetary benefit of 1 per cent of their annual rent.  The stamp imposition on the lease was 1 per cent of the annual rent so if one were paying £50 a week for a flat in Rathmines one can easily calculate what the 1 per cent would amount to.  It is not huge money, anyway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point behind it is that one of the main factors with regard to rented accommodation is the lack of security of tenure. Three out of four tenants, I understand, are now on week-to-week tenancies, especially in flats but also in rented <Col N="268" /> houses.  Except in the case of formerly controlled tenants, leases of longer than one year are almost never encountered. In cases where a year's lease has expired the lease has lapsed and the tenant remains on a month-to-month tenancy. The limited security offered by the one year lease is lost.  Lack of security of tenure makes it difficult for tenants to secure their legal rights.  As their right to a quiet and peaceful enjoyment of the home is often affected by this, a complaint from the landlord, for example, or a complaint to the landlord, can often result in a tenant being issued with a notice to quit and having no rights whatsoever.</P>
    <P>Short-term letting arrangements offer much flexibility to students and other young people who would not be interested in long-term tenancies.  A significant number of people, mainly single people on modest incomes, remain lifelong tenants in the private rented sector. Such tenants are particularly affected by the chronic insecurity of tenure.  As they continue to rent privately and become older and their income remains modest, they are in a very insecure position.  They may be given notice to quit their flats, typically a week's or a month's notice, and never enjoy the security of a long-term home.</P>
    <P>Stamp duty is at 1 per cent and my amendment and that of the Minister exempt short-term leases from that.  It is hoped that in so far as the obligation to stamp leases inhibited landlords in the issuing of leases the exemption of leases from stamp duty would mean that leases would be offered more frequently to tenants who would require them.</P>
    <P>The level is appropriate, also.  Leases of under £6,000 per annum, about £500 a month, are appropriate.  I am glad to hear from the Minister that even though there is some small loss of revenue this will be compensated for by savings which will be made on the administrative side. Again, I thank the Minister.  Because he does exactly what we requested on Committee Stage, I am withdrawing amendment No. 20, which is an alternative to the Minister's amendment.</P>
    <Col N="269" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome what the Minister has done.  When I put down the amendment proposing something similar on Committee Stage it was done, I must confess, on the representation of the Threshold organisation which wanted me to put down another amendment in relation to another aspect which was disallowed on technical grounds &mdash; that was to make section 23 financial concessions, tax concessions, contingent on certain minimum standards of tenure for tenants.  There is much merit in that and I would ask the Minister to look into it. It may well be that the tax system, to return to the Commission on Taxation, is not the method of improving landlord and tenant law.  It might be better to bring in a full-scale charter for landlords and tenants rather than use the tax system as a carrot-and-stick method of getting them to do what they should do, anyway.</P>
      <P>A revenue loss of £.5 million is estimated here but the Minister says that on the other hand there will be compensating administrative savings.  That provoked in my mind the questions, what kind of efficiency audit goes on in the whole tax system as to small charges and administrative time used in collecting them?  Is there a unit in the Revenue Commissioners Office or in the Department of Finance which examines the use of personnel in specific areas doing detailed work which is not very remunerative in terms of revenue?  I know the Minister will say there is an ongoing review.  I have never seen a Department which is not in the state of constant ongoing review.  Is there a process to evaluate every tax system, to audit, especially in things like stamp duty, the efficiency of the system?  It seems that stamp duty is something which is built up by a process of accretion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Such things as changing the stamp duty in relation to cheques and cheque books can be the subject of a radical amendment to make it much more sensible.  Are there many more matters like this which, were it not for Threshold putting pressure on Deputy Noonan and myself to put down amendments, would yield similar <Col N="270" /> type savings on the administrative side? Perhaps the Minister would indicate whether there are not a number of other types of stamp duty which are so little used that it would be better to clear them off the Statute Book completely and change the 1891 Stamp Act so as to simplify matters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>To clarify matters in case there is any misunderstanding, the yield from stamp duty on all leases is £500,000, including residential, commercial and industrial properties, so the amount is tiny.  It is 25p each.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not 1 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Evaluating the whole area, it is small bread.  I had the same representations made to me by the Threshold organisation but they did not mention &mdash; or at least I do not recall their mentioning &mdash; the section 23 tax.  In any event I do not think that is the way to go.  There is an extremely small loss of revenue here.  There are compensations on the administration side in relation to evaluation and so on.  An added efficiency unit are set up on behalf of the Government to look at specific areas in each Government Department.  I have already given them certain areas to evaluate in my Department and I assume other Ministers are doing the same especially in those areas where much administrative time is spent on small stamping duty when you can be fooling yourself thinking you are getting in revenue while it is costing you more to do it.  Many other areas have to be evaluated when we get around to doing that.  Things have been there for many years which seem to escape notice but unless they are homed in on we will not give the results sought.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 21:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="271" /> In page 70, between lines 31 and 32, to insert the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(3)  Any person aggrieved by the imposition on him of a surcharge under this section in respect of any asset may, within 30 days of the notification to him of the amount of such surcharge, appeal to the Appeal Commissioners against the imposition of such surcharge on the grounds, and only on the grounds, that, having regard to all the circumstances, there were sufficient grounds on which he might reasonably have based his estimate of the market value of the asset.</P>
    <P>(4)  The Appeal Commissioners shall hear and determine an appeal to them under subsection (3) as if it were an appeal to them against an assessment to tax, and the provisions of section 52 of the Principal Act relating to an appeal or to the rehearing of an appeal or to the statement of a case for the opinion of the High Court on a point of law shall, with any necessary modifications, apply accordingly.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment gives the taxpayer a right of appeal to the Appeal Commissioners against the imposition by the Revenue Commissioners of a surcharge arising by reason of the undervaluation of an asset included by him in return for gift tax or inheritance tax purposes. Section 74 of the Bill introduces a surcharge in respect of any substantial undervaluation of an asset which is comprised in a gift or inheritance and is included in a return delivered by an accountable person for capital acquisitions tax purposes.</P>
    <P>The surcharge consists of a specific percentage, 30 per cent, 20 per cent or 10 per cent of the tax ultimately attributable to the undervalued asset.  To put this surcharge into perspective, I should point out that the real value would have to be one and a half times the submitted value before any surcharge would arise.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage of the Bill, Deputy McDowell made a plea that a <Col N="272" /> taxpayer should be excused from the surcharge if he could establish that he genuinely believed his submitted valuation was correct and his error was a bona fide error.  This amendment is a response to that plea.  It gives a taxpayer a right of appeal to the Appeal Commissioners against the imposition of a surcharge on the grounds that the taxpayer reasonably believed his submitted valuation was correct. This right of appeal is, of course, in addition to the taxpayer's normal rights of appeal in ascertaining the market value of the property concerned.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 22:</P>
      <P>In page 73, lines 19 to 21, to delete &ldquo;unless he has attained the age of 15 years prior to the commencement of the relevant period, and&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;unless&mdash;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 78 of the Bill introduces a revised paragraph 9 to Part I of the Second Schedule to the Capital Acquisitions Tax Act, 1976.  This revised paragraph 9 sets out the conditions on which a nephew or niece of a disponer is to be treated as the child of the disponer for gift tax or inheritance tax purposes, including the condition that the nephew or niece has to be over 15 years of age all through the relevant five year period.  This amendment deletes this age requirement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A child of a disponer is subject to less onerous gift tax or inheritance tax than a nephew or niece of the disponer.  Paragraph 9 of Part I of the Second Schedule to the Capital Acquisitions Tax Act, 1976 provides that a nephew or niece of a disponer is to be treated as a child of the disponer in respect of the gift or inheritance comprising business assets, but only if the nephew or niece has worked substantially on a full time basis for the disponer in the period of five years ending on the date of the gift or inheritance. Section 78 of the Bill introduces a revised paragraph 9 and, while this concession is being retained, it is being extended to gifts and inheritance taken by a nephew <Col N="273" /> or niece on the exploration of a limited interest created by the disponer.  At the same time, the opportunity is being given in the context of self-assessment tax to set out for the guidance of a taxpayer the conditions which constitute working substantially on a full time basis.  One of these conditions is that the nephew or niece has to be over the age of 15 years at the start of the relevant five year period.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage of the Bill, Deputy Michael Noonan asked me to reconsider this age requirement.  I have accepted that it may distort the intention of the uncle or the aunt.  Accordingly, this amendment rectifies that position.  In other words, the relief is available for nephews and nieces irrespective of their ages at the date the gift or inheritance is being taken by them.</P>

A favourite nephew or niece in certain circumstances would be treated as a son or daughter in respect of a gift from a disponer and here we are dealing with the conditions which would have to be complied with in the case of a nephew or niece.  I take it that the 15 years of age commencement date is being taken up completely and then it would be a matter of opinion when the five year period of work of appropriate length with the aunt or uncle would arise.  For example, I take it that if a child of 12 years of age went to live with an aunt&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In page 76, line 25, to delete &ldquo;consort&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;concert&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This, Sir, is in honour of yourself.  I looked at my Oxford English Dictionary today and at Chambers Twentieth Century Dictionary and I have arrived at the view that &ldquo;consort&rdquo; used in this context is obsolete and &ldquo;concert&rdquo;, to act in concert, is the normal modern expression.  It is a rarity to find &ldquo;consort&rdquo; used in this context.  Maybe the Minister has some other explanation, but I have not seen it used in any other Statute passed in this century.  I may be wrong in that and doubtless the Minister has a file of 25 precedents where it is commonly used. Certainly my understanding was that it should be &ldquo;concert&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;consort.&rdquo;&ldquo;Consort&rdquo; is 17th and 18th century language when used as a noun, apart from &ldquo;consort&rdquo; as a spouse, or as a verb, to consort with.  &ldquo;To act in concert&rdquo; is the more normal usage.  Since the Leas-Cheann Comhairle told me he has an interest in words, I thought I should not let the matter go by.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The meaning intended to be conveyed by the word &ldquo;consort&rdquo; is of a group of people acting together to bring about a <Col N="275" /> tax avoidance scheme.  It is intended to mean more than mere agreement.  In this regard it is used in the same context as &ldquo;consortium&rdquo; with which it shares the same root.</P>
    <P>Chambers defines &ldquo;consort&rdquo; as meaning, among other things, &ldquo;partnership&rdquo;, &ldquo;company&rdquo;, &ldquo;agreement&rdquo;, &ldquo;accord&rdquo;.  It specifically defines &ldquo;in consort&rdquo; to mean &ldquo;in company&rdquo;.  As such it is considered to be an appropriate word to convey what is intended.</P>
    <P>However the difference in shade of meaning between &ldquo;consort&rdquo; and &ldquo;concert&rdquo; is not sufficient as to make much difference to the efficacy of the section.</P>

The rebate will now be available to disabled drivers in respect of diesel fuelled cars as well as petrol fuelled cars.  For cars with power steering or automatic gear change diesel may be a more appropriate option.  It is a good amendment. I am very pleased with the section the Minister has now included in the Bill in respect of tax concessions for disabled drivers.  Last year the Government intended to scrap the scheme and replace it with a restrictive and most unsatisfactory scheme of grants from the health boards.  All of us, led by the Minister, were able to avert this and the scheme is being maintained whereby there will be a refund of VAT and excise duty on cars and a refund of excise duty on petrol.  We have clarified and expanded the criteria of eligibility for the scheme so that it meets needs more effectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One or two items have been brought to my attention by the Irish Wheelchair Association.  I understand they are worried about the reference to &ldquo;any vehicle&rdquo; in subsection (1) (b) and that they would prefer a reference to &ldquo;any motor vehicle&rdquo;.  In subsection (2) (a) they fear <Col N="277" /> that the reference to &ldquo;further medical criteria&rdquo; may open up the possibility of excessive bureaucratic intervention.  In subsection (2) (b) they would like to know who would determine appeals. They wonder how it is proposed to implement subsection (2) (g) which requires evidence that the vehicle is for the driver's personal use and evidence of his or her driving capacity.  They wonder if it would apply in the case of a progressive disease where at a given time a disabled person might be able to drive but the progress of the disease might render him unable to drive.  I understand there are cases where this happens and the disabled person who progressively becomes unable to drive continues to use the tax refunds and is driven about by a spouse.  That is a serious issue which the Minister might take on board.  He might look at these issues when drafting the regulations.  He might also confirm that the spokespersons on Finance will have sight of the regulations before they are promulgated.</P>

I would like, however, freedom to stipulate a different limit for vehicles adapted for use by disabled persons as passengers.  This amendment provides such freedom.</P>
      <P>I commend this amendment to the House.  I take the opportunity to tell Deputy Noonan and the House that I will take note of the matters raised.  It is not my intention to make this scheme over-bureaucratic. We all set out to find a scheme acceptable to this section of the community and we do not intend to stifle it by over-bureaucratic regulations.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 27:</P>
      <P>In page 92, between lines 28 and 29, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4)  The Minister may by regulation made under this section amend any regulations previously made under this section.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>When I put forward this amendment on the last occasion the Minister said it was implicit in the section and that he did not think it was necessary.  I was wondering if the Minister would reserve onto himself the right to revoke regulations made.  It would be quite serious if a future Minister for Finance simply revoked all the regulations and left nothing there.  I would not be keen to give to the Minister the power to end it by the stroke of a pen.</P>
      <P>When I looked for the revocation clause I found there was no right of amendment either.  Deputy Noonan made the point about the Opposition spokesmen seeing the regulations, but it might mean very little if amendments were made without a similar undertaking in relation to them.  It is not a very big point but there does not seem to be any power to amend.  The Minister may find this working to his detriment.</P>
      <P>Some disabled driver might claim he was prejudiced by an amendment made and might challenge the right to amend, saying the Minister was given only one power to make regulations once and never given any power to change them. Most sections which allow a Minister to make regulations seem to contain a power to revoke regulations by other regulations.  If a disabled driver thought that some restriction of cover made by some future Minister was improper, he might be able to make the argument that since there was no right to amend the regulations once made, they must stand for good.  There does not even seem to be the statement that the Minister may from time to time make these regulations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>Each year in the last two years in excess of 40,000 people have emigrated from Ireland.  Little has been said of these fine young men and women who are leaving our shores.  Let us be clear that these are not statistics but real flesh and blood people with hopes and desires going to Britain or America with aspirations of making a success of their lives.  Many of our young people have become very successful and are leading figures in industry, banking, building, <Col N="281" /> medicine, teaching, television and radio in the UK and the US.  They are the people we hear of on a regular basis.</P>
      <P>However, the television programme on RTE last week presented the other side of the coin.  This was devastating. For the first time we saw a side of life in Britain that we here in Ireland have closed our eyes to.  Jill Fahey is to be admired for having the courage to let us see at first hand the plight of our young people and the terrible tragedy of emigration as it exists for them leaving home and going to Britain.  Countless thousands of our kith and kin are now being forced to live in sub-human conditions. One can live for a while in such circumstances but over a period of time one's health is bound to deteriorate and can be irreparably damaged.  The thought of people eating and living in the conditions outlined in that programme alarmed me, as did the working conditions of our young people on building sites. The scenes of people being hired for work reminded me of the days of the spailpín fánach here in Ireland.  It was like looking at scenes from the last century, and those scenes were repulsive.</P>
      <P>It came across on this programme on Friday last that 150 Irish people died as a result of accidents while working on the building sites in Britain last year.  What do we have to do to prevent this occurring this year?  Unless something is done it is probable that 150 more of our young people will die in similar accidents.  This is a desperate indictment of safety standards on building sites in Britain; but it is an even greater indictment of our Government who are witnessing this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past Irish Governments have had a passive attitude to emigration. What worries me now is that it appears that the Government have a vested interest in emigration.  These young people leaving our shores remove thousands of people from the unemployment register and this allows the Government to publicise a fall in unemployment.  One person on that programme used the word &ldquo;criminal&rdquo; to describe what is happening. Our emigrants want us to utilise our <Col N="282" /> energy and our finances to provide jobs here in Ireland.  It is our duty to do so to save these young people from the loneliness, deprivation and exploitation that thousands are suffering from at the moment.</P>
    <P>In my constituency in rural Ireland one can stand at the back of a church or at the back of a crowd and look in front of one and see children up to the age of 17, and older people of 45 and upwards.  One sees nobody in between, or very few, because most of the young people are leaving.  Hurling, soccer and rugby clubs are being devastated.  Families and whole communities are being torn apart.  That is what is happening and it is our duty to provide answers, to provide jobs and prevent this occurring.  This is happening before our eyes and it is time something was done about it.  Whole generations are leaving.  Many a parent watching that programme must have wondered if that was his son living in those conditions without cooking, heating or toilet facilities or anything else.  We need to realise that these are the conditions under which our young people are living in Britain and to do something to prevent it happening. We must provide assistance for them when they get to Britain.  That is the message that came across on that programme. The young people must have the choice to live and work in the country of their birth.  That is their right.</P>
    <P>Unless we do something to provide those jobs more and more of our young people will be forced to leave Ireland and live in those sub-human conditions.  Can you imagine, a Cheann Comhairle, the worry and dread of any parent watching that programme wondering if that is his child living in such conditions.  They are somebody's children and that is why we must do something to prevent it happening. We must do whatever we can in the intervening period to provide advice and assistance in Britain.  The changes that have taken place there in the social services have made a bad situation worse for many of our young people.  The Minister should see the British Ambassador and bring home to him with the necessary forcefulness the urgency of the situation. <Col N="283" /> The Taoiseach should have discussions with the Prime Minister of Great Britain to see what action can be taken to ensure that our young people, who are helping to build that country, will be given an opportunity to live in normal conditions with the dignity that human beings are entitled to.  This is a very urgent matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>First I want to thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for giving us the opportunity to discuss this very important matter here tonight.  I also want to thank Deputy Enright for sharing his time with me and Deputy Deenihan. As Deputy Enright has pointed out, we are all well aware of the cancer of emigration at present sweeping Irish society and wiping out whole communities, particularly in the west.  I cannot understand why a greater effort has not been made to create more jobs in rural communities. The Government have failed to provide the necessary finance to create jobs and to encourage job creation in many of the rural areas.  If one picked up the paper in the last 12 to 18 months one could read of several job announcements in Dublin, Cork and elsewhere but unfortunately areas such as Roscommon, which I represent, have been totally ignored.  The young community in that area have no option but to emigrate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Enright has rightly pointed out, one only has to go to Mass on a Sunday where one sees children up to their late teens but there is nobody to be seen between that age group and 40 because they have taken the emigration boat to Britian and are working in London, Birmingham, Coventry and elsewhere.  As Deputy Enright also pointed out, many of these people have not made their fortunes there either. Some of them live under very poor conditions and work very long hours to try to keep body and soul together.  We are all well aware of the undocumented Irish in New York, Boston and elsewhere in the United States, many of whom work in slave labour conditions simply because they have not the necessary documentation and are not free to seek jobs <Col N="284" /> on the labour market which would give them adequate reward.</P>
    <P>We now find that elderly parents are left at home alone, all their sons and daughters having emigrated, whereas in the fifties and sixties when we experienced emigration, some of the children stayed at home to look after their elderly parents.  The present emigration trend will have a huge impact in the future on society and on social structures in the west in particular.  When we are discussing the plight of many of our Irish emigrants, I would appeal to the Minister and the Government to use their offices to alleviate the major hardships which many of those emigrants face when they go abroad.  Major difficulties arise with accommodation.  Unfortunately, many people do not make adequate provision for accommodation before they emigrate and do not have adequate finance to tide them over the first three to four weeks when they are looking for employment and accommodation.  Many emigrate without having contacts abroad and some, who may have an address, find that the person has moved on to another address when they arrive and they then have to revert to the Irish centres.</P>
    <P>Recently I had the privilege of visiting the Irish Centre in Camden Town and I was very impressed with the work being done by the Irish community there.  That centre provided me with a document highlighting the difficulties which emigrants face when they go there and also the age structures of emigrants.  It is frightening to see the number of teenagers who arrive in London without any skill.  Inevitably these people have to go back to school to learn a skill or a trade before they become employable.</P>
    <P>We see the terrible tragedy of families who are heartbroken because of this trail of emigration.  Of late we seem to have come to accept emigration and have given up the ambition of creating sufficient jobs here for the large numbers of young people who are coming onto the employment market each year.  It is only fair to recognise that of those who emigrate, probably 25 per cent emigrate by choice.  Very often their pals are forced <Col N="285" /> to emigrate and they leave jobs to follow them.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that Deputy Deenihan wants to contribute to this debate.  In conclusion, I would appeal to the Minister and the Government to tackle this problem and see what can be done to alleviate the problems of many of our young people who are emigrating.  If they must emigrate the Government should make sure that they are adequately equipped to take up a job abroad.  One of the major problems at present arises when somebody opts out of education at 15 or 16 years of age and it is impossible to get them back into the training system because a certain standard is required for FÁS training schemes and so on.  I would appeal to the Minister to address this problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I would like to cite a few statistics from a survey carried out last year by the action group for Irish youth in London.  It was discovered that of the total number of emigrants to England, four out of every five were from a city, city suburb or a town; 72 per cent had experienced unemployment since leaving school and prior to emigrating; 50 per cent had relatives living in Britain at some stage; 61 per cent had travelled to London alone; 34 per cent had less than £30 on arrival and 70 per cent had less than £100.  The basic cost of surviving in London is £95 per week.  Many of the people who arrive in London are very insecure and vulnerable.  The survey also showed that 57 per cent of emigrants made no definite arrangements for accommodation; 17.5 per cent spent their first night sleeping rough and 79 per cent were still unemployed two months after their arrival in London.  Before Christmas it was revealed that over 1,000 young Irish people sleep rough in London every night.  Those statistics speak for themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was fortunate to be a member of a delegation that travelled to London on 11 January, along with Deputies Dukes, Barry and Jim Higgins, the Fine Gael Chief Whip.  We saw for ourselves the conditions under which Irish emigrants <Col N="286" /> are living.  We visited centres such as Harringay Irish Community Care Centre, the Irish Centre in Camden Square, Conway House Hostel for males and St. Louise's Hostel for females.  We met the action group for Irish youths on that occasion and we also travelled to Birmingham and Manchester.  We witnessed the problems experienced by young Irish emigrants, which were highlighted on television last week.</P>
    <P>The two major problems are accommodation and employment.  The cost of rented accommodation in England at present is astronomical and is out of the reach of the majority of young people who arrive in London with little money in their pockets.  For example, if you want to take a bedsitter you have to pay four weeks in advance &mdash; the cheapest is about £35 a week &mdash; and you also have to pay four weeks' deposit, totalling about £280. If you want to rent a flat it costs at least £50 a week and again you have to pay four weeks in advance and £200 deposit, totalling £400, which is beyond the reach of most young Irish emigrants.</P>
    <P>There is also the phenomenon of families leaving this country.  One agency alone received 185 inquiries last year.  It would be safe to say that up to 1,000 families have left this country in the past year or two.  As Deputies Naughten and Enright have said, this has a devastating effect on Irish society.</P>
    <P>The cost of accommodation in England is doubling at present and it is estimated that that trend will continue.  There is also a problem with some of the older Irish emigrants who left in the forties and fifties.  They are being forced out of their accommodation now by the landlords who are getting more money from the new wave of emigrants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened to what the Deputies have said and I thank them for putting their points of view to me.  I can assure them that the Government fully share their concern for the welfare of all our emigrants &mdash; whether in London or elsewhere.  I accept that, despite all the warnings and publicity about the dangers of going abroad without proper preparation, some young people still leave the country ill-prepared and get into difficulties on their arrival, particularly in a large city like London.  I have seen such situations at first hand.  I have visited most, if not all, of the various emergency centres in London which help young people who get into difficulties, whether about accommodation, work, social security entitlements and so on.</P>
      <P>I know the trauma they experience and their anxieties in trying to cope and come to terms with a vastly different society and way of life.  However, it is necessary to place such situations in their proper context.  The fact is that the overwhelming majority of Irish people going to Britain do not get into trouble or encounter problems.  Most of them adjust very successfully to their new environment and are able to get a job and a place to stay very quickly.</P>
      <P>Secondly, the problem of homelessness among migrants to London is a very complex one.  A major world capital such as London has an attraction for young people, not only from Ireland but from all over the world, who flock to it for all kinds of reasons, many of which may have little to do with work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Young people who are unhappy at home, who have fallen out with their families, who want to avoid responsibilities or sometimes to avoid the police, may end up in London.  That has been proved in numerous surveys.  A city like London can be an exciting and glamorous place if one has enough money, a job and a place to stay in.  Otherwise, it is an inhospitable and hostile urban jungle <Col N="288" /> with all sorts of risks and dangers for those who are not particularly streetwise.</P>
    <P>The accommodation situation in London is now so serious that many people in employment cannot afford a place to live.  I hope that young people who have seen these programmes on RTE will take heed of that message.  As Minister for Labour, my message over the last two years has been clear and direct.  If you are under 18, do not go.  If you do not have accommodation fixed up in advance, do not go.  If you do not have the skills, qualifications and sufficient money to ensure a reasonable chance of success, do not go.</P>
    <P>Both the Government and various voluntary agencies have attempted in many ways to get this message across.  In 1987 I launched an information and advice service for intending emigrants: this is now provided through FÁS.  It aims at giving the maximum help and advice to anyone considering emigration and to help them decide if emigration is a sensible choice given their particular circumstances.  It helps them prepare carefully so as to avoid the pitfalls and, where appropriate, FÁS may be able to use their contacts with other European Community employment services, including the British one, to help the intending emigrant find a job.  Furthermore, FÁS are in the process of a major up-grading of their predeparture advisory services for intending emigrants.  Those for whom emigration appears to be a particular risk are most strongly advised against going. A special module, aimed at warning of the dangers of unplanned and thoughtless emigration, has been included in appropriate FÁS courses.</P>
    <P>Concern had been expressed in recent years about the problems faced by early school leavers, including that of emigration. It was suggested that some went to Britian to secure unemployment assistance &mdash; although such persons will not now qualify for social security benefits in Britain.  In an attempt to provide practical help for such youngsters, my colleague Deputy O'Rourke, Minister for Education, and I launched the Youthreach Programme.  This is an offer to <Col N="289" /> unqualified early school leavers of up to two years' further education and training with allowances being paid during this period.  We considered that not only would Youthreach help young people secure a foothold in the world of employment, it would make staying here and acquiring meaningful education and training an attractive alternative to emigration. My Department, on the advice of DÍON, the advisory committee on emigrant welfare, have provided an annual grant to Emigrant Advice, located in Cathedral Street in Dublin, which is also involved in preventing thoughtless and ill-prepared emigration.  In addition, the Minister of State at the Department of Education, Deputy Fahey, has made a grant of £20,000 to enable Emigrant Advice provide an information pack, including a video film for use in schools and educational institutions.  This year, I shall be allocating, on the advice of DÍON, £500,000 in grants to voluntary agencies concerned with the welfare of Irish emigrants.  This is a 100 per cent increase on last year's allocation and a 320 per cent increase on the 1986 allocation. In 1988, the £250,000 allocation to DÍON went to help fund 15 different organisations.</P>
    <P>This is a clear indication of the Government's concern for young people.  There is, however, a real difficulty to which I should like to draw the attention of the House.  The Government cannot, nor do they wish to, stop any citizen from leaving the country if that is the choice of the person concerned.  Our policy has been to offer advice, information and help.  It is not possible to force citizens to use the services available.  Many of the difficulties now being encountered might have been avoided had the young persons concerned sought the help available from FÁS and other agencies before taking the step of emigrating.</P>
    <P>At the same time, I fully share the concern at the dreadful situation these young people now find themselves in.  I have drawn the attention of DÍON to my concern about this problem and asked the committee to bear this in mind when <Col N="290" /> discussing their much increased allocation of funds with the voluntary bodies who have applied for grants.  I know that the staff of the Irish Embassy in London liaise with social workers in Britain about problems such as these.</P>
    <P>The voluntary emigrant welfare agencies are fully aware of the acute housing situation in the London area and for some time, have been actively engaged in trying to provide relief for Irish people affected.</P>
    <P>Here, I must pay tribute to the excellent work done by CARA, the Irish homeless project.  CARA was founded five years ago as a registered charity with their own director, researcher and administrator. Their main objective is to get an accurate assessment of the needs of the homeless Irish emigrants and, on that basis, to develop temporary supportive housing within the context of an overall resettlement programme.</P>
    <P>In the space of three years CARA have persuaded local and central government to invest in a programme of hostel development worth over £2 million. Annual revenue grants of £100,000 have also been secured.  They are now embarking on a futher project to get immediately, a bigger allocation of the available housing and hostel provision &mdash; 600 bed spaces &mdash; for Irish youth.  They also aim to pursue a longer term programme of development of specialist hostel and housing provision for vulnerable Irish people.</P>
    <P>CARA have developed an information project designed to increase public awareness of Irish youth homelessness by alerting relevant statutory bodies, such as local authorities and housing corporations, to the problems facing young people from Ireland.  They also aim to persuade such bodies to adopt an action plan to confront these problems and to work with them in its development and implementation.</P>
    <P>In order to ensure the success of such a project it is necessary to have facts and solid information to convince statutory bodies of the scale of the problem.  Most voluntary agencies have neither the capacity nor skills to undertake such a <Col N="291" /> task.  CARA have agreed to carry out a comprehensive study of the extent and nature of homelessness among the Irish community in London with a view to formulating a strategy to tackle the problem in a comprehensive and cohesive way.  I understand that DÍON also support this exercise.</P>
    <P>I know other voluntary organisations are also actively involved and totally committed to trying to come to grips with the housing situation in London which affects not only Irish emigrants or others from outside Great Britain, but is also a major problem for anyone coming from outside the London commuting area.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should say that the main thrust of Government policy is aimed at tackling the basic cause of emigration, which is the lack of sufficient employment opportunities to enable Irish people find work here.  The Government believe that no one should feel obliged to leave Ireland because of financial necessity arising from unemployment.</P>
    <P>That said, we must face facts. Although the indications are that the economy is on a sounder base, with unemployment figures dropping and employment figures growing, as shown from labour force surveys, this growing strength is not translating itself into employment as fast as we would wish.  I have stressed the importance, in a number of recent speeches, of the private sector playing their role in creating more employment.  The Government have created the right climate and now looks for the appropriate response, in particular <Col N="292" /> from those companies who are expanding and investing abroad, rather than at home.  In the meanwhile, we are faced with, and will continue to tackle, the problem of emigration.  I have noted the concerns expressed here this evening by Deputies Enright, Naughten and Deenihan. I shall bear them in mind in my consultations with emigrant organisations and in the ongoing review of the effectiveness of State assisted advisory services.</P>
    <P>The figures quoted by Deputy Deenihan were accurate, but lest they give rise to confusion, I would make the Deputy aware that the survey by the action group for Irish youth, which the Deputy mentioned, was a sample survey based on interviews with people already staying in hostels, rather than Irish people emigrating. That is an important distinction to make based on the statistics the Deputy mentioned.  I accept the Deputy's statistics in that context.</P>
    <P>I thank the Deputies for raising these points and I assure them that in centres like Camden Town FÁS have had a direct involvement in providing facilities for the older Irish emigrants whom Deputy Deenihan talked about.  I accept the Deputy's point that a lot of Irish people who emigrated in the thirties and forties are now in difficulties.  We have to continue to work to solve that problem.  I accept the points made by the Deputies in good faith and we will continue to do all we can to help.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 17 May 1989.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Defence, in relation to his speech at Skibbereen, County Cork on 30 April 1989: (1) the other elements of the comprehensive reorganisation of the officer rank structure in An Fórsa and An Slua Muirí (2) the number of company commanders in the Infantry Corps who hold the dual appointments of company commander and area commander (3) the number of officers who hold the single appointment of company commander, differentiating between those who hold the appointment at the rank of commandant and those who hold the appointment at the rank of (a) captain and (b) lieutenant (4) the number of commandants who hold the sole appointment of area commander (5) the number of second-in-command appointments in the (i) Infantry and (ii) other corps who hold the rank of (a) lieutenant and (b) captain (6) the anticipated date on which the gradual phasing out of area commander appointments will be achieved (7) the <Col N="48" /> anticipated number of officers who will be promoted, as a result of the announcement, in (a) 1989 and (b) 1990 and (8) whether the Permanent Defence Force battalion staff structure will be implemented in FCA battalions in 1989; and if he will make a statement on this important component of the Defence Forces.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>, <i>Limerick West</i>): As regards Part (1) and Part (8) of the question the organisation, role and structure of the FCA and the Slua Muirí have been and continue to be the subject of a detailed examination in the context of the Defence Policy Review to ensure that these elements of the Reserve Defence Force will have the capacity to fulfil their respective roles. However, pending completion of this examination it has been possible to implement a restructuring of the officer ranks in the FCA in order to bring it more into line with the structure in the Permanent Defence Force.</P>
      <P>The other information sought by the Deputy is in the form of a tabular statement which I propose to circulate in the Official Report.</P>

      <P>The Garda authorities inform me that the number of rural Garda stations to which a sergeant would normally be assigned, but which are currently without a sergeant, is 155.  The question of filling some of the posts concerned from the recently announced panel for promotion to sergeant rank is being considered by the Garda authorities.</P>

      <P>The former Garda sub-station at Corbetstown, County Kilkenny, was the only station closed in the period in question. The closure took place in January 1988. The decision to close the station was taken on the advice of the Garda authorities which was to the effect that adequate policing cover could be given to the area from other stations in the locality and that the closure would contribute to the more efficient use of Garda resources in the Waterford/Kilkenny Garda Division.</P>
      <P>There is no change in the general policy of keeping rural Garda stations open.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos.43 and 44 together.</P>
      <P>The value of fines collected is at present running at approximately £6 million per annum.  Fines become due as soon as they are imposed but they are not reckoned as being in arrear until the time allowed for payment has expired.  The value of fines for which the time for payment has expired is estimated at £7.5 million. There are some 55,000 fines warrants in the hands of the Garda awaiting execution.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if, in respect of fines imposed on persons totally dependent on social welfare payments or low pay for their livelihood, he will make arrangements for the repayment of these fines over a period by way of issuing a fines repayment book similar to a savings book in order that the fine will be paid by the weekly acquisition of a savings stamp; whether he has considered such a proposition or any variation of it; his views on the fact that the imposition of fines on persons depending solely on social welfare or low pay can cause grievous hardship, frequently ending in imprisonment of those who have never known prison before thereby costing the State extra money; his views on the fact that an alternative to this is long overdue; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>The question of introducing a system to allow for the payment of fines by instalments is under review in my Department at present in the context of improving the fines collection system in general.  The benefits detailed in the question will be among those which will be taken into account in that review.  I should point out, however, that a change to instalment payments would require legislation.  It would require additional staffing in the courts service which, having regard to current restrictions on staffing in the public service, would present a serious difficulty.</P>
      <P>In considering this whole area account must be taken of the fact that courts generally have regard to the means of defendants when fixing fines, allow a reasonable period of time for the payment of fines and may, on application, allow an extended period of time for payment.</P>

      <P>The question of purchasing some of the land for use as a centre for handicapped adults was one of the options examined by a committee set up by the Minister for Health but this may now be superseded by alternative proposals.</P>
      <P>It is proposed to sell the bulk if not all of the land by public tender and a firm of estate agents has been commissioned for this purpose.  To disclose the estimated value of the site at present could prejudice the sale price.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos.66 and 67 together.</P>
      <P>The prescribed relative allowance is the allowance payable as part of the pension to an incapacitated social welfare pensioner who is being looked after by a prescribed relative.  The allowance has been increased each year in line with increases in rates of pensions as they occur and the rate of the allowance in each of the years from 1979 to date is as follows: April 1979, £8.80; October 1979, £9.40; April 1980, £11.75; April 1981, £14.70; October 1981, £15.45; April 1982, £19.30; July 1983, £21.60; July 1984, £23.10; July 1985, £24.60; July 1986, £25.60; July 1987, £26.40; July 1988, £27.20.</P>
      <P>The weekly rate will be further increased to £28 from July 1989 in accordance with the provisions of the Social Welfare Act, 1989.  This is the normal annual increase provided for in the budget which is intended to keep the payment ahead of inflation.</P>
      <P>I am examining the present social welfare arrangements for persons who are looking after incapacitated pensioners. As a first step in improving those arrangements provision was made in the 1989 Act to enable, under conditions to be prescribed in regulations, the prescribed relative allowance to be paid directly to the carer rather than to the pensioner. The necessary regulations will be made later this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The National Pensions Board, who will be reporting to me at the end of 1989 on future pension provision generally, are at <Col N="74" /> present considering the position of pensioners requiring constant care and attention. The whole question of payments for carers will be considered at that stage in the light of the board's findings.</P>

      <P>Reviews of entitlement to unemployment payments are an ongoing feature of the work of the staff of the Department's local offices and can take the form of reviews of individual cases which warrant specific attention or they can consist of reviews of claims selected on a random basis.</P>
      <P>In some instances claimants are interviewed about their entitlement as they attend at the local employment exchange to sign and collect payment.  In other instances claimants would have notice, or may become aware otherwise, that they are to be interviewed about their entitlement.

      <P>In the case of the External Control Unit, statistics from January 1989 to the end of April 1989 show that, of a total of 6,259 persons interviewed, 1,984 voluntarily signed off the live register.</P>

      <Col N="83" /> As regards the final part of the question, the figures for Ireland are not significantly out of line with the general position disclosed in the table for the year for which comparable figures are shown. This reflects, <i>inter alia</i>, the fact that the level of social security contributions in Ireland is relatively low by European Community standards.  I am concerned, however, to reduce the burden of income tax.  That is why, in this year's budget, I introduced a package of income tax measures which are estimated to cost over £200 million in the 1989-90 tax year and include increases in the general and age exemption limits and the introduction of a child addition of £200 per child in conjunction with those limits; extensions of the standard rate and 48 per cent rate bands; and reductions in the standard and 58 per cent rates.</P>
    <P>Notes</P>
    <P>(1)  The 1987 information for all countries (including Ireland for 1987-88) is taken from the annual OECD publication <i>The Tax-Benefit Position of Production Workers</i>, 1988 edition.  This booklet shows the amount of tax and social insurance contributions payable by a worker earning the average wage in manufacturing industry, where the average is taken as the adult wage rate for males and females combined.</P>
    <P>The 1989-90 data for Ireland reflect an estimate of the average adult industrial wage (based on published CSO data for 1988).</P>
    <P>(2)  The OECD publication referred to above provides data in respect of only two marital status groups; a single person and a married couple with two children where one spouse has an income from employment outside the home.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>The following is the position in relation to legislation for which I am responsible.</P>
      <P>(i)  The Finance Act, 1988, was passed on 25 May 1988.  The new arrangements relating to returns, assessments and appeals provided for in Chapter II of Part I of that Act do not currently apply to companies.  They will, however, be extended to companies by regulations. As I indicated in my Budget Statement it is intended to extend the arrangements to companies this year.</P>
      <P>(ii)  The Superannuation and Pensions Act, 1976, which was passed on 6 July 1976, made provision for the eventual repeal and amendment by ministerial order of sections of the superannuation code dating back to 1834.  The Act provided that this would be done in conjunction with the making of a consolidated principal Civil Service superannuation scheme.  The scheme has been drafted and is with the parliamentary draftsman's office for clearance before being signed by me.</P>
      <P>(iii)  The National Monuments (Amendment) Act, 1987, came into force on 22 July 1987.  Section 4 of this Act, and the repeals contained in section 26 thereof relating to section 21 of the National Monuments Act, 1930, and section 15 of the National Monuments (Amendment) Act, 1954, have yet to be enforced by ministerial order.  These provisions would substitute the Historic Monuments Council for the National Monuments Advisory Council.  The application of the provisions is still being considered in the light of the recent setting up of the National Heritage Council.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that, in the wake of the recent tax amnesty, the major task of re-evaluating the status of the residual arrears in every case is under way.  This exercise is taking place concurrently with a rigorous and accelerated pursuit of current taxes and will therefore take some time to complete.  When its status is determined, a decision will be taken in each case on the most appropriate method of enforcing collection of the amount due and action will be initiated accordingly. However, until all cases have been reviewed, it will not be possible to establish the aggregate amount of money still outstanding in unpaid taxes.</P>

      <P>As regards the specific points raised by the Deputy in relation to the proposals the position is as follows: (a) Under existing food legislation samples of foodstuffs are offered for sale to the consumer, i.e. at retail level.  The draft directive provides for sampling at all stages of production, manufacture, import into the Community, processing, storage, transport, distribution and trade.  (b) The draft directive provides that member states shall draw up forward programmes laying down the nature and frequency of the inspections to be carried out regularly over a specific period and this country will be in a position to comply with these requirements.  (c) My Department will be in consultation with the other Departments concerned with a view to drawing up food inspection programmes and coordinating activities.  (d) A number of Government Departments have responsibilities in relation to various aspects of food production, labelling, etc., and it is envisaged that these Departments will become the competent authorities for purposes of the draft directive within their existing areas of responsibility.  (e) It is not envisaged that implementation of these proposals would involve recruitment of additional staff. The additional workload entailed by inspection and sampling at the various stages of production, manufacture, etc., can be offset by a reduction in the frequency of inspection and sampling at the retail stage.</P>

      <P>Although An Bord Altranais decided to exercise its powers under this section, agreement on the nature of the operation of the Central Applications Bureau (CAB) could not be reached with some of the health boards and a large number of voluntary hospitals, and a decision to suspend the CAB was eventually taken by the board.

      <P>I recently agreed, at the request of the chief executive officer of the Eastern Health Board, to the secondment of the deputy chief dental officer of my Department to the health board for a short time to review the board's arrangements for the delivery of dental services, including the orthodontic service, and, where necessary, to make recommendations for their improvement.  The deputy chief dental officer's final report is expected to be available shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the specific orthodontic case mentioned by the Deputy the person in question was put on the health board's orthodontic waiting list in October 1988. Due to the large number of persons still on the waiting list the health board are <Col N="103" /> not in a position to say when he will be called for assessment and treatment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>The management of the Regional Hospital at Galway is a matter for the <Col N="104" /> Western Health Board in the first instance.  I am aware that considerable difficulties have arisen over the years in managing the admission levels at the hospital and the board has recently put in place a bed management policy to address this problem.  The essential objectives of the policy are to ensure that adequate beds are available at all times for emergency cases; to allow for the management of the level of patients admitted for elective treatment and to ensure that all consultants at the hospital have fair and equitable access to facilities.</P>
      <P>This arrangement has been introduced following considerable consultations with the medical, nursing and administrative staff and is actively supported by practically all such staff in the interests of patient care.  The arrangement was the subject of some adverse media reports recently but I am informed that the consultants' medical staff committee and representatives of the nursing staff at the hospital have disassociated themselves from these reports.</P>
      <P>The hospital management has confirmed that there is no crisis at the hospital and the high level of admissions is being experienced by one consultant only.  It is the high level of admissions by this consultant which has given rise to some difficulties in ensuring that appropriate accommodation is available for all patients who have to be admitted.</P>
      <P>The person referred to as the &ldquo;admissions officer&rdquo; is in fact the &ldquo;patient relations officer&rdquo; and she has many years experience in this field and is in a position to ensure that no major difficulties arise if all consultants adhere to the agreed admissions policy.</P>
      <P>In relation to the closure of two surgical wards for two months, I can say that no such decision has been taken and this is one of a range of options which is being considered by the board to ensure that it operates within its approved financial allocation for the year.</P>
