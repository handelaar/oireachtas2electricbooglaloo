    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 8, subsection (1), between lines 16 and 17, to insert the following: </P>
      <P>&ldquo;(e) mines and quarries;&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This refers specifically to the inclusion of <Col N="1878" /> mines and quarries in the Bill.  My concern is that it is the opinion of people employed in the mining industry that the 1965 Act is deficient.  If the Minister gives me an assurance that this section will update the inspectorate I shall be prepared to withdraw the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised that specific reference to mines and quarries is not essential in the definition of the place of work because they are covered by the term &ldquo;location&rdquo; used in the definition.  In relation to the 1965 Act, if the Deputy wishes to raise some points I shall be glad to have them examined.  In any event deficiencies in the 1965 Act will be corrected by this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared to accept the Minister's offer on that because the 1965 Act is not very effective regarding the inspectorate.  I felt that my amendment would highlight the plight of people employed in mines, which is an extremely dangerous industry.  However, I will withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <P>Line 40 refers to (a) the council of a county, (b) the corporation of a county borough, or (c) the Corporation of Dún Laoghaire.  Dún Laoghaire is an non-county borough, one of six in the country including Wexford, Sligo, Drogheda, Clonmel and Kilkenny. Why is Dún Laoghaire specifically picked out as it has the same status and management structure as the other five non-county boroughs?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 9, subsection (1) (d), lines 26 to 29, to delete all words down to and including &ldquo;work,&rdquo;. </P>
      <P>This amendment will overcome the problems in serving notice to an offender.  We want to create a situation whereby people who do not live within the State and whose address cannot be ascertained can be contacted without difficulty.  By deleting the words mentioned in the amendment the section will be strengthened considerably.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 3 provides for a range of options regarding the serving of notices and it caters adequately for all possibilities.  Section 37 also specifies that a prohibition notice may be served on the person in control of the activity but this does not necessarily mean that the notice must be served on the employer at his business or other address.  It can be served on the person in charge of the workplace when the inspector calls and on a person over 16 years of age resident in or employed at a place of work by affixing it in a conspicuous position on or near the place of work.  These are standard provisions which strike a balance between the interests of a recipient and cases where notices may be difficult to serve.  Therefore, the deletion of the line suggested by Deputy O'Sullivan would tilt the balance to the possible detriment of the recipients.  The provisions of subsection (1) (d) would apply only if reasonable inquiries fail to identify the address of the person in question.  This section deals with the actions of the agency in attempting to locate or to serve the prohibition notices on an individual. They would probably start with (a) where it is addressed to him by name, by delivering it to such person, or in the case of a partnership by delivery to any of the <Col N="1880" /> partners; (b) by leaving it at the address at which he ordinarily resides: (c) by sending it by post in a pre-paid registered letter addressed to him at the address at which he ordinarily resides or in a case in which an address for service has been furnished at that address.  A combination of mechanisms would be used to try to track somebody down.  In the normal course of events I suppose (a) would be sufficient to locate an individual.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>My main concern is for firms &mdash; multinationals in particular &mdash; whose head office is outside the State. They could pose problems.  Legislation to deal with this problem was introduced 13 years ago in Britain and, following inquiries regarding their experience, we have come across some weaknesses.  One of the problems they encountered was in regard to companies not based in the country.  As more and more multinational companies are locating here it could also cause problems in this jurisdiction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an area in which there can be difficulty trying to locate someone.  One must make reasonable inquiries regarding an individual and this section provides a range of options which must be followed in trying to serve the notice.  I am sure the Deputy will agree that it is a fairly detailed section.  Normally (a) or (b) would cover most of the people involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to paragraph (d), what is a reasonable inquiry?  The Minister spoke about sending a pre-paid registered letter to the potential offender which would suffice, but that is on the assumption that the head office of the postal service is of a reasonable standard, and we have no guarantee that some country, say, in the Far East would provide a similar type of service to what we enjoy here.  The Minister has some reservations about fixing a notice.  In the case of shipping, when a notice is served it is common practice for it to be pasted to the mast or to some prominent part of the ship.  We feel this would be a good <Col N="1881" /> way of clearing up any doubt as to who would be responsible.  In my view the area of reasonable inquiry is week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the prohibition notice, we have strong indictable powers to pursue a person.  It would not be in the interests of an individual to ignore a prohibition notice.  Under section 3 and other sections we have power to serve a notice on an individual; we would not necessarily want to serve notice on the head of a multinational.  In the case of a multinational operation, the notice would be served on the recognised head, manager or supervisor at their Irish location or, as set out in the Bill, any person over 16 years of age.  There is a range of options available.  A prohibition notice would be served only in respect of a serious offence and, as I said, we would have strong indictable powers to pursue an offender.  I do not believe in the event of a prohibition notice being served that a person would be able to walk away from it very easily.  This matter has been considered at length.  I agree with the Deputy when he says that we should try, so far as we possibly can, to ensure that we would be able to serve a notice. Having considered this matter, we feel this provision adequately covers all possibilities.</P>

      <P>May I seek clarification in relation to section 3?  Section 3 (1) states &ldquo;Any document... authorised to be served, sent or give...in some one of the following ways&rdquo;.  Would it be necessary to state specifically that it could only be sent in one way or could it be sent in more than one way?  Assuming it can be shown the documents were sent or delivered in a particular way, can it be claimed that this is adequate if a court case arises?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The documents could be sent in any one way, and there would <Col N="1882" /> be a range of options available.  A prohibition notice would be served only in respect of a serious offence.  If evidence can be produced to show that an attempt was made to serve a notice, I presume it would be permissible in the event of a court case.</P>

      <P>In page 10, subsection (1) (j), lines 46 and 47, to delete &ldquo;section 133 of the Mines and Quarries Act, 1965,&rdquo;. </P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to allow the provisions of section 133 of the Mines and Quarries Act, 1965, which relate to offences, stand until it may be necessary to amend them in accordance with section 3 of this Bill.  Under section 51 of the Bill the Authority will have power to prosecute offences under the Mines and Quarries Act, 1965.  The position under that Act whereby prosecutions may be initiated by certain other parties, will remain unchanged unless the Authority in the future seek the amendment of those provisions.</P>

      <P>In page 11, subsection (1), lines 19 to 21, to delete all words after &ldquo;ensure&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;that there is at least one board member responsible for the safety, health and welfare at work of all employees&rdquo;, </P>
      <P>Very simply, we are asking in this amendment for one person to have overall responsibility for safety and health in the workplace.  This is a reasonable request. If that responsibility is not given to one person, the legislation could be weakened considerably.  For that reason I ask the Minister to accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>These amendments, if adopted, would create a conflict especially as regards the provisions in section 6 (2).  They would dilute the overall responsibility which must rest with the enterprise as a whole.  I can accept that there is a case for ensuring that responsibility for management, safety and health is where necessary delegated to a responsible person in the company.  However, this is framework legislation.  I would draw the Deputy's attention to the specific requirements on the employer outlined in section 6 (2), in particular subsection (2) (d), which will inevitably require the employer to make the appropriate supervisory arrangemants within the undertaking.  There is also provision in section 48 (19) whereby in particular circumstances any director, manager, secretary or other similar officer of a body <Col N="1884" /> corporate may be prosecuted for offences and punished accordingly.  This provision is in line with the spirit of the Deputy's amendments.</P>
      <P>On the question of including details on deaths, serious injuries and absences in reports, I would again point out that the provisions in this Bill are framework in nature.  The possibility of going into greater detail in regulations and codes of practice is provided.  Information of that sort detailed in the amendments will, in the normal course, be available to the Authority.  It has never been the practice to publish detailed information of this sort except on a cumulative basis.  I do not see any great advantage in imposing such a detailed requirement which might be more likely to discourage compliance with the overall requirements to publish in company reports an evaluation of safety and health in the enterprise.</P>
      <P>I would like to draw, again, the Deputy's attention to the provision in section 48 (19) whereby in particular circumstances any director, manager, secretary or other similar officer of a body corporate may be prosecuted for offences and punished accordingly.  I believe this provision gives what the Deputy is seeking and is in line with the spirit of the point he has made.</P>

I am concerned that somebody in a place of work has a job of ensuring that the proper standards are maintained.

Deputy O'Sullivan's point is that under a safety plan an individual would be required to be responsible for safety.  That is covered.  The point about <Col N="1885" /> being able to go after an individual is answered in section 48 (19).  Therefore, the Deputy's point is covered both ways. First, somebody is responsible for the safety plan and if you seek somebody under section 48 (19) you could follow the director, manager, secretary or other similar officer of the body corporate in the case of prosecutions.</P>

      <P>At the moment third level institutions are doing contract work in research and there is a possibility that some student engaged in such activity would be at risk and would not be covered specifically by the legislation. I ask the Minister to accept this amendment.  I think it extremely important. It is only the deletion of three words and their replacement by one word.  The implications are serious.  This practice is now commonplace and we will see development in this area.  Universities will have to do some research work to reduce the cost of running the institutions and students could be put at risk in some of our colleges and universities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the point the Deputy is making.  I do not think he is referring to every schoolchild.  I presume he is referring to trainees.  The main objective of the legislation is to ensure the safety and health of the working population, including persons working in the education sector.  It is not the intention to cover any other activities in which persons may be engaged, including normal schooling and third level education. I do not think that is what the Deputy is saying either.  There is a <Col N="1886" /> requirement on employers in section 7 to conduct their activities in a way which will ensure that persons who may be affected are not exposed to risks.  This will have some application in the education sector particularly as far as laboratories are concerned.</P>
      <P>However, this section is aimed at protecting the many persons engaged in training for employment working side-by-side with workers who may be subject to safety and health risks and who are covered by the legislation.  The main intent, therefore, of this provision is to cover trainees who come under the umbrella of national training bodies such as FÁS, CERT, Teagasc and other training organisations in circumstances in which they may not be working under a contract of employment for an employer. Where individuals are on a FÁS scheme or any of the other schemes I have mentioned for work experience, working side-by-side with workers who are covered under the legislation, they will also be covered.  I think that is the point the Deputy is making.  Any trainee, even one with no contract of employment on work experience, in for a week, a month or six months on work experience, will also be covered if working side-by-side with workers who are covered.  The effect of the Deputy's wording in the amendment would be to cover all schoolchildren. We are covering all trainees working side-by-side with people covered under the legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 12, between lines 21 and 22, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4) (a) It shall be the duty of every employer to ensure that no agreement is made with an employee or a representative of that employee to accept money by way of wages, salary or expenses in lieu of health or safety within the workplace.</P>
      <P>(b) It shall be the duty of every employee or that employee's representative to ensure that no agreement is entered into which accepts money by way of wages, salary or expenses in lieu of health or safety in the workplace.&rdquo;.  </P>
      <P>This amemdment aims to eradicate the practice of paying what we call danger money.  I believe the whole principle of this Bill is to eliminate once and for all the practice of employing young boys and girls and paying them a certain amount of danger money and I ask the Minister, even on principle alone, to accept this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Another Deputy made a large contribution on this point on Second Stage and we have been examining the position.  I agree that the concept of danger money is very undesirable. The difficulty is that a legal ban on agreements in this area would be extremely difficult to enforce and could be easily avoided.  The efforts of the Authority should be concentrated on encouraging co-operation between employers and <Col N="1888" /> workers on positive measures to improve safety and health, promoting safety and health matters in the education and training of both employers and workers and enforcing the legal requirements to eliminate risks to safety and health.  I am sure the Deputy will agree this is a more positive way of ensuring that unsafe practices such as danger money are stamped out.</P>
      <P>On checking this with the parliamentary draftsman I am advised it would be very difficult to get a legal ban on agreements in this area and it would be almost impossible to enforce them. We have had considerable discussion on how to cover this point.  I agree in some instances an employer will collude with the employees and provide a monetary benefit rather than comply with the provisions of the Act.  The inspectorate, regardless of any agreement on site, would take action and prosecute.  Where there was a practice against the spirit of legislation, despite any monetary benefit given by the employer.  The inspectorate would follow the safety plan and the legislation and issue the appropriate notices.</P>
      <P>In some cases dangerous work must be dealt with, possibly where the lives of other people would be at risk.  Firemen or people working on offshore rigs would have to undertake dangerous work which would not normally be desirable under safety regulations.  The expertise would be required to deal with this work and with accidents and emergencies, otherwise the lives of other people would be at risk.  In that case a monetary reward could not be banned because these people might be required to get additional money for what would be considered dangerous work carried out for the overall good.  I agree with the concept put forward by Deputy Wyse but it would be difficult to enshrine it in legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that there is a legal implication here, but if this amendment is not inserted in the Bill the payment of danger money will be legal.  If an employee had an accident at work he could take his employer to court and say that he was paid danger money.  I would <Col N="1889" /> assume that judgment would be based on the provisions of this Bill and the judge could easily say that the Bill does not prevent the payment of danger money. What happens then?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>These are extreme cases.  The judge would have to take the type of work into account.  Fire fighters take a risk when they tackle a serious fire. Their job is a dangerous one and they are not paid an additional allowance every time there is a fire.  The risk element is catered for in their basic salary.  It could happen that people would be asked to carry out some dangerous function.  Most normal rescue workers have effectively used that case when negotiating rates of pay.  We would implement the law if there were practices which were undesirable and for which there was no good reason. The inspector would not be influenced one way or the other by the fact that danger money was being paid.  An inspector would probably not go to the site because of being told danger money was being paid.  He would be visiting the site to see for himself what was going on.</P>
      <P>People trying to break the spirit of the legislation would find some other heading under which to pay additional money. They would not refer to it as danger money; it would probably be a savings fund or a holiday fund.  Even if this section were inserted they would find a way around it.  We must try to promote good health and safety regulations in the workplace with the co-operation of the employer and the workforce.  If people do not comply we will proceed to prosecute, without being influenced by an agreement between the employer and the workforce.</P>

We could be a laughing stock if we were seen to promote safety at work but yet to allow employers to pay danger money.  The amendment would reinforce our sincerity.</P>

      <P>While I appreciate that Deputy Wyse does not want somebody to put their life at risk for a monetary consideration we must still remember that there is a risk factor involved in the workplace.  For example take the Piper Alpha explosion in the North Sea.  We must ask whether it would have been correct to have offered the people who went out to extinguish that fire an average industrial wage.  That is the likely effect of Deputy Wyse's contention. Equally what does one say to a steeplejack whose ordinary daily activities of their very nature are dangerous? Are we to say to him: you will get the same as your counterpart working on the ground?  Then what about those people working in mines and quarries, handling explosives, who work with dirty, combustible materials?  All of these constitute conditions of employment which are, of their very nature, dangerous.  Take the example of people who convey chemicals when there is a bonus payment involved. Once the proper safety standards are not abused I think that would be acceptable. I realise what Deputy Wyse is endeavouring to achieve but I do not think it is workable.  There would be many jobs left undone if one were to tell such people they will get the average wage only because the response could be why should I take on this task when I could receive as much for sitting around?</P>

I was anxious to have his amendment accepted but, on seeking legal advice as to how it could be done, we encountered difficulties. I agree with the spirit and principle of the Deputy's contention but the difficulty arises in endeavouring to have it included and overcoming the problems presented by the extreme case referred to by Deputy O'Sullivan.  The parliamentary draftsman went to considerable trouble to ascertain whether we could include this provision but it appears it cannot be covered because it would create an anomaly.

      <P>We must accept, of course, that there are dangerous jobs of their very nature.  We are now debating another angle, contending that everybody would ignore the safety, health and welfare laws.  There will always be dangerous jobs and, as a community, we are happy that some people undertake such tasks.  Indeed it would be our view that they should be paid a higher salary for so doing.  Not so long ago we had a somewhat similar Bill in the House with regard to safety in offshore installations. Indeed unlike our neighbours, we were fortunate in having our legislation in place at the time of those horrific accidents in the North Sea.  It would be very difficult to argue against such workers receiving a higher rate of salary.</P>
      <P>The other aspect is blatant abuse of the legislation by employers and workers.

      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to afford some protection to people who would not be in receipt of a wage in their place of work.  It is commonplace nowadays to have students gaining work experience.  It has long been the tradition that children living in an area adjacent to industry would frequent such workplaces, thereby placing themselves at risk.

      <P>I share the Deputy's concern as regards securing the safety and health of workers in places in which several employers share a work place but it would be very difficult to draft a suitable amendment which would cover the intention the Deputy has in mind.  It is a difficult area in terms of responsibilities. I believe that it would not be appropriate to tackle the issue in this framework legislation. The problem is more relevant to particular industries than to others.  I consider that section 6, which deals with general duties of employers to their employees, and section 7, which deals with general duties of employers and self-employed to persons other than their employees, would have a similar effect to the proposed amendment.</P>
      <P>The combined effect of these sections is to impose duties as regards safety and health at work on an employer not only in relation to his own employees but also in relation to persons not in his employment but who may be affected by the way he conducts his undertaking.  The duty is also applicable to self-employed persons. For example, the requirements of section 7 (1) in relation to a construction site would require two or more contractors to conduct their work activities in such a way as to ensure, as far as is reasonably practicable, that persons not in their employment who may be affected by their work activities are not exposed to risks to their safety or health.  It should be noted also that the Bill makes no distinction between the penalties that may be imposed in respect of breach of general duties in respect of employees or non-employees affected by work activities. If the Authority consider that there is a need to deal with the issue in greater detail this can be achieved through the drafting of regulations following consultation with both sides of the industry.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is referring to the difficulties that arise where there are subcontractors on a site.  It would be difficult to frame a section to cover the Deputy's point but that is not the reason I am not accepting his amendment.  Section 6, which deals with the general duties of employers to their employees, and section 7, which deals with the general duties of employers and the self-employed to persons other than their employees, cover this issue.  They have the same effect as the Deputy's amendment. The combined effect of those sections is to impose duties as regards safety and health at work on the employer not only in relation to his own employees but also in relation to persons not in his employment but who may be affected by the way he conducts his undertaking. That would also be applicable to the self-employed.</P>
      <P>The change that will take place is that the inspectorate will have power to go on a site and issue a notice to the person they believe to be the employer.  Under the old Acts they had the difficulty of trying to establish who the employer was and ducks and drakes were played with inspectors, particularly on construction sites.  I do not like referring to construction sites very often but that is the area where we have had the greatest difficulty. When the Bill is passed it will be easier for the inspectorate to identify the employer on a site and proceed against that person.  They will not have to follow each employer.  The inspectorate can pick the main employer on the site and pursue him.  That will eliminate many difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The inspectorate, Members of the House and myself, will expect some people involved in the construction industry to try to find ways around these provisions and that is why the Authority will be able to get further powers.  This <Col N="1896" /> represents a great step forward from the present position in that the inspectorate will be able to go on site, identify the main employer and proceed against him. They will be able to issue prohibition notices against that employer and not have to chase after every subcontractor in an effort to identify the employers. This may not close off every loophole and that is why I will be asking the Authority to review the position periodically.</P>

      <P>The Minister has said it was likely that people would try to find a way round the legislation but the problem at present is that they are marching right through it.  It is difficult to establish who has responsibility on a site where many subcontractors are engaged. By making the main contractor responsible we will be ensuring that proper safety standards are maintained.  That contractor will have an obligation to ensure that the subcontractors engaged by him will observe all rules and regulations and will not put lives at risk.  If the Minister tried to establish who is responsible on many building sites he would have great difficulty.  There is a lot of detection as well as inspection work involved.  We have had a great loss of life in the construction industry and the last report to hand, that for 1985, spelt that out clearly.</P>

      <P>We have had successful prosecutions in relation to construction sites.  It is because of the number of serious accidents that have occurred on such sites that we are prosecuting those found guilty of such offences.  It is important to bear in mind that when the Bill is passed we will be able to pursue the main contractor who is normally identifiable on any large site.  In the first instance the inspector will go after the subcontractor if the accident relates to him but in case of difficulty the management of the main contractor can be proceeded against.  I know construction sites have to be monitored and there has been a lot of discussion in relation to these because these are areas with high levels of accidents. <Col N="1897" /> This provision will be a tremendous improvement.</P>

    <P>Section 8 agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 9.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 9 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>On Second Stage I referred to the fact that many industrial accidents happen not because the safety requirements of the law are not met by employers but frequently because they are not observed by employees.  While it is absolutely correct to impose stringent safety and health requirements on employers we have to do more to ensure that employees, in their own interests and in the interests of their colleagues, observe the safety laws and regulations. I speak with some experience in this respect because I was, for some years, a safety officer.  In my experience there was little difficulty in persuading the employer, in this case Arthur Guinness, to provide safety shoes, ear muffs, fire doors or whatever, but we had great difficulty in getting those we represented to observe the regulations and use what was provided, and most of the accidents arose because of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as I can see section 9 is full of exhortation.  Unless I am misreading it I do not see that any offence is being created by lack of observance and I know for a fact that there has not been a single prosecution since the foundation of the State against an employee who recklessly ignores safety procedures and regulations, ignoring their own safety and health and the safety and health of their co-workers.  It is a feature of our legislation in the industrial and labour areas, and possibly a feature of our society, that we frequently emphasise people's rights, and that is absolutely correct, but fail to emphasise their responsibilities.  If we are examining the whole raft of safety legislation in a detached way from the stand-point of preventing loss of life, loss of limb, loss of health and permanent injury in respect of workers, we will have to do more and more to highlight the need for <Col N="1899" /> workers to be conscious of their own responsibility for their safety and that of their work mates.  We are not going to do that by mere exhortation.  I would like the Minister to tell me if I am right in saying that there have been no prosecutions against employees who recklessly disregard safety procedures.  I would like him to tell me what provisions there are here for sanctions against reckless employees.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy made this point on Second Stage.  There are rights and duties on both sides.  The Deputy is probably right that it has not been the practice over the years to prosecute employees.</P>
      <P>I will answer the other questions raised by the Deputy.  On the previous occasion and again today he raised the question of prosecution.  An employee can now be prosecuted under section 48 of the Bill. It is important to point out that section 9 provides for basically the same general duties on employees at their place of work as currently exists under section 125 of the Factories Act, 1955, and as amended by the Safety in Industries Act, 1980.  Even where an employer provides and maintains a safe place of work, safe plant and machinery and a safe system of work there is still a necessity to ensure that the behaviour of employees at work, whether by act or omission, does not endanger themselves or others.  I think that covers the Deputy's point.  The obligation on employees is quite specific and they can be prosecuted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the bringing into operation of section 9 certain provisions of the existing enactments will be repealed automatically in order to avoid overlapping or duplication.  Subsection (1) requires an employee to take reasonable care of his own safety and health and that of others who may be affected by his acts or omissions while at work.  Employees are required to co-operate with their employers and others such as sub-contractors on site to ensure compliance with the relevant statutory provisions.  They are also required to use such protective <Col N="1900" /> clothing, appliances and so on as may be provided for their use so as to provide the protection intended.  Employees are also required to report to their employer or immediate supervisor any defects in plant or equipment at their place of work or a system of work which might endanger safety and health of which they become aware.  The latter duty is in addition to those which currently exist under the Safety in Industries Acts.  I think that covers the points raised by the Deputy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for that clarification.  What provision is the Minister making for enforcement? The other main point I made on Second Stage of the Bill was one of general application to much of the legislation we pass here, that we do not make provision to enforce the legislation.  I do not know any other country in Europe where the law is honoured more in the breach than in the observance.  Whether in regard to road transport, health and safety at work or whatever, there is widespread lack of observance and lack of enforcement.  In this House we are full of good intentions, like the road to hell.  We pass well-meaning legislation but do not enforce it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said in this House &mdash; the Minister was not present during the debate &mdash; and I will raise it now in his presence, that this legislation will be extended to public departments and that is new.  In this House there are fire doors all over the place.  Like every other factory or firm I know, they are always left open when the whole idea is to keep them closed to prevent the spreading of fire.  There is no enforcement in this area.  Those doors are left open by ourselves, the employees in this House, and if there is a fire it will spread very quickly around the building. That is the case in many factories and office blocks.  There is no enforcement and there is not enough consciousness in this regard but there would be if people were liable to more frequent prosecution. I do not want to see people prosecuted but I want people to be safe.  I do not <Col N="1901" /> want us to pass legislation which is well-meaning but ineffective and that is the danger here.</P>
    <P>We could impose on industry more costs, which would make it more difficult to employ people but, at the same time, end up with no safer work environment in reality.  The theory might be right but in reality the position might be no better. That is why it is very important that when we pass legislation in this House we should satisfy ourselves about its enforcement. I am not at all satisfied that adequate provisions are being made for enforcement in this case.  Anyone who has been in Government will know that in implementing the law passed by parliament the Minister needs staff.  A memorandum is circulated to Government Departments, including the Department of Finance, but the staff required is not provided because there is a public sector embargo or a staff of two is provided when 20 are needed.</P>
    <P>I know from my time as Minister for Transport that there are many illegal operators running buses and lorries that are not safe, that are overloaded and that certainly do not meet the safety requirements of this country or the European Community.  They are competing unfairly against those who are observing the law but we have no means of enforcing the legislation because we cannot get staff from the Department of Finance as that will cost money.  If we had the staff we could save a lot of money in areas where many people are not paying their road taxes, are using red diesel instead of white diesel and are defrauding the Exchequer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry, Sir, I will not stray any further.  I just wish to highlight a very real issue, especially in regard to health and safety regulations that of enforcement.  In the transport case I cited, safety and health of workers is very relevant to the unsafe state of many <Col N="1902" /> vehicles on our roads.  I raised the question on Second Stage as to whether this health and safety legislation covered the mobile workplace, the lorry cab or the bus cab.  Enforcement is a very important aspect of all legislation but particularly health and safety legislation.  It would be no good for the Minister or some successor to come into this House after some disaster when many people had died from burns, smoke inhalation or whatever and say that the safety regulations were there and all the safety requirements were met but they were not observed.  That is what will happen unless a serious attempt is made to enforce the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Mitchell that no worker has the right to put the lives of his fellow-workers at risk and I think any sensible person would accept that.  Is it not the case that there should be a proper disciplinary code in the place of work rather than in legislation? As I said earlier, the provision of safety should be the function of a particular person in any firm.  If somebody creates a hazard for a fellow-worker he should be dealt with through the normal disciplinary code of that firm.  Essentially, it would be extremely difficult to incorporate this in legislation but the responsibility should lie with the personnel manager, the safety officer or whoever is responsible.  Some firms are fortunate enough to be able to afford a safety officer.  Anybody who violates the safety code in a firm should be dealt with by his superiors.  At times people have been suspended for dangerous and reckless behaviour in the workplace.</P>

      <P>I notice that section 9 (2) indicates that no person shall intentionally or recklessly interfere with or misuse any appliance etc.  Does that subsection apply to employees only?  It comes under the description of general duties of employees.  I do not see any reference to the same obligation under the general duties of employers.  I wonder if &ldquo;no person&rdquo; includes employers as well as employee.  While I take the point <Col N="1903" /> Deputy Mitchell made with regard to employees having a responsibility as well as a right, it may be that work practices in a particular place may force an employee to take short cuts in order to increase productivity, get orders out or whatever.  I would like the Minister to clarify if section 9 (2) applies to employers also.</P>

The regulations are being enforced.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>There are more road checks.  I know this is a result of Deputy Mitchell's legislation.  I agree that the enforcement of legislation is important. It is not my role as Minister, his role as a former Minister nor the role of the Deputies who are working on this legislation, to implement legislation that will not be enforced.  I assure the Deputies that all I can do to ensure that the legislation is enforced properly will be done. As against the enforcement of other legislation, we are in the good position that we are starting with a considerable number of staff on the ground.  However, extra staff will be required over time to fulfil all the obligations of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will now deal with a number of other points the Deputy raised.  Mobile workers are covered by the Bill. There are inspectors on the road making inspections for dangerous substances and such matters <Col N="1904" /> under the current legislation.  As I said earlier, we have not taken prosecutions against workers but under the new system, employers and workers share the responsibility for safety and health.  In this legislation we are trying to get across the message that safety is everybody's responsibility and nobody can say it is only the role of the employer to try to provide the facilities, instruments and clothing for safety.  Deputy Mitchell gave some example where the employer was doing everything.  Employees should ask for protective clothing.  On construction sites there are certain instruments needed for heights and which are not provided by the employer but it is everybody's responsibility to ensure that there are safe work practices.  This legislation attempts to highlight this very important point.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Mitchell rightly points out the regulations in many areas are not being enforced because the people are not there to ensure their enforcement. However, this legislation provides that there be a safety plan at the workplace so it is not just confined to an Act or regulations that are filed away.  The employers, the workers and their representatives have taken this matter very seriously.  The Barrington Commission and the interim board have already commenced implementing certain provisions of the legislation but, like everything else it will be a case of educating people down the ranks.  There is a far higher profile being given to this by both the Federated Union of Employers and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  Under the Bill it will be a statutory obligation to have a safety plan which will have to be worked to.  Deputy O'Sullivan made the point that there will be a safety officer responsible for implementing the safety plan, but it will be the overall responsibility of the corporate body.  In Leinster House it will be the Ceann Comhairle&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>On a general point there are many reasons, apart from accidents, hardship and insurance costs, that both sides of industry will be anxious to implement the legislation.  Deputy Mitchell asked about a breach of section 9.  This is an offence under section 48 (1) (a).  The penalties which may apply under section 49 (2) are, on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding £1,000 or on conviction on indictment, to a fine not exceeding £15,000 but there will be some discussion on this point later because there are amendments tabled to this section.</P>

The <Col N="1908" /> question of consultation is comprehensively dealt with in section 13 (1) (a) where the employer must consult with his employees with regard to making arrangements to ensure safety and health.

The reason I cannot accept the Deputy's amendment is that there is an absolute requirement for the employer to draw up a safety statement.  In section 13 (1) (a) the employer must consult but that requirement is omitted from section 12 to keep the section as strong as possible.</P>

      <P>This amendment is central to the Bill.  If there is not agreement an employer could insist on his way of doing things.  Despite the reservations expressed by Deputy Mitchell on section 9, the record to date has shown that by and large most of the prosecutions were against employers who did not comply with the safety regulations.  My amendment is one way of ensuring that the <Col N="1909" /> proper standards are set down in the statement and are observed.  The only way to do that is through consultation. What I am asking is not unreasonable.</P>

      <P>If a difficulty arose both sides could call in the inspectors to try to get agreement.  Any problems that arose would probably be of a technical nature and they could be resolved with the help of the inspectors.  In relation to the Deputy's other point, the safety statements have already received statutory backing in section 40 of the Safety in Industry Act.</P>
      <P>The safety statement is a key element of this new scheme.  It requires an assessment of the specific hazards and needs in relation to each enterprise to be carried out so that each enterprise would be in a position to pursue its safety and health objectives in accordance with the written safety policy statement.  The aim of the statement is to involve management up to the highest levels in a clear programme of action to ensure compliance with the statutory safety and health provisions, to stimulate assessment and clarification of hazards and how to deal with them, to identify and assign clear responsibilities in relation to safety and health matters, to ensure a systematic follow-up of problems once identified, to ensure that resources are assigned to safety and health and to gain the commitment of all persons in the workplace.  That is the philosophy that must be incorporated in this agreement.  This philosophy cannot be rammed down somebody's throat but the employer has an obligation under law to present and discuss this safety plan.</P>
      <P>If there is difficulty getting agreement the inspectorate could be involved but any good employer would want to clearly set down what he is about and what he is seeking to achieve under those headings. A good employer will have no objection to setting down how he wishes to perform his obligations under the Act to his staff and under insurance regulations and so on.  I do not imagine there will be serious disagreement but if there is, an inspector could assist in resolving those difficulties.</P>

      <P>I see this statement as being part and parcel of normal industrial relations and an effort to avoid pitfalls. My amendment would also take care of the reservations expressed by Deputy Mitchell on section 9 in respect of participation by the employees.  The fact that the Minister has conceded that it may be necessary to call in an inspector to resolve difficulties, illustrates at a very early stage that it may be necessary for a third party to arbitrate.  This is not the correct approach as all that could be avoided if there was proper consultation within the firm between management and employees' representatives.</P>
      <P>By not accepting my amendment the Minister is excluding a very important element from the area of the safety statement. The Minister is putting the hands of the clock back in respect of normal industrial relations.  The Minister knows what I am getting at.  I feel very strongly on this issue because I, as a union official, have experience in this area.  I am not an expert but I have experience with regard to safety standards in the place of employment.</P>

      <P>We are dealing with a very important area.  We are now talking about the whole basis of the legislation and that is the worker and the employer working together as a team to eliminate any dangers that may arise where accidents are concerned on the factory floor or wherever it may be.  Section 13 (2) states that:</P>
      <P>Employees shall have the right to make representations to and consult their employer on matters of safety, health and welfare in their place of work. </P>
      <P>I know what Deputy O'Sullivan is getting at but I believe we are now talking about building up this kind of co-operation between worker and employer, working as a team, to ensure the elimination of any dangers that may exist within their industry.</P>

      <P>In case we get to the <Col N="1911" /> stage where we think there is no consultation, as I said at the outset it will be noted that under section 13 (1) the employer must consult his employees regarding the making of arrangements to ensure safety in such matters.  I outlined the aims of the safety policy, which are excellent; they are broad and cover anything that could be involved.  The difficulties would probably be technical and that is where the inspectorate would be able to assist.  They would not be involved in an industrial relations role trying to resolve them.  The provisions of section 30 are based on the belief that if adequate safety and health standards are to be implemented in the workplace there is a need for dialogue and co-operation between the employer and workers.  In broad terms the section requires employers to consult their employees on safety and health matters and it enables employees to choose the type of consultative mechanisms best suited for such discussions, it also empowers employees to appoint safety representatives to represent them in such consultations and to carry out certain other functions including the investigation of accidents and dangerous occurrences.</P>

      <P>The point being made by Deputy O'Sullivan is valid.  I am concerned with the statement by the <Col N="1912" /> Minister that he is anxious to ensure that the duty on the employer to prepare a statement is not diluted.  I am wondering if there is an alternative way of achieving what Deputy O'Sullivan is attempting to achieve in relation to this section.  Would it be acceptable to Deputy O'Sullivan, and would it avoid the dilution that the Minister is concerned about if the proposed wording was inserted elsewhere, say, as a subsection (4) (c) or a subsection (4) (d)?</P>

      <P>The concern I have is that under section 12 the employer cannot use any device to avoid drawing up a safety plan and he cannot say that consultation is not working or that any of the mechanisms for consultation cannot be agreed.  In section 12 there is an absolute requirement that the employer must draw up a safety statement.  The point which Deputy O'Sullivan has made &mdash; and it is one with which I agree &mdash; is that there must be consultation on the safety plan.  That is covered in the next section. He has an obligation to draw up a safety plan.  It is an absolute requirement that he draws up that safety plan.  He cannot avoid drawing up a safety plan by saying there is disagreement between the safety officer, the trade unions and some section of the staff.  He must get ahead with the drawing up of the safety plan.  I have outlined the aims of the policy.  In section 13 it is clearly stated that he must consult with the workers.  I do not think we can write in that they must reach agreement. I do not think we can go that far.</P>

      <P>If it was proposed that the employees or their representatives could seek an amendment to the statement, that would enable consultation to take place subsequent to the obligation being fulfilled of actually making the statement.  It would not dilute the obligation to make the statement but the employees would then be enabled to seek amendment to it and that would engage them in consultation.  I do not know whether that would meet Deputy O'Sullivan's requirement.</P>

      <P>Under section 13 they would be able to do that.  The provisions of section 13 are flexible enough to allow such consultation arrangements to continue despite the repeal of the relevant provisions of the 1980 Act under which they are established.  It is an open discussion once the employer has fulfilled his legal obligation to bring forward the safety plan.  I think the Deputy's point is catered for.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The employer's interpretation of what his obligation is, is all we are getting here as the Minister has presented it to us in section 12.  To ensure that there is no danger of shoddy work practices or people taking short cuts that could endanger lives, there must be proper consultation between the safety representatives and management.  My fear, in the event of conflict, is that the inspector could be brought in.  There would then be an environment where lives could be put at risk.  In the workplace while the management and the safety representatives are arguing on whether there should be a guard on a particular machine or whether the scaffold is safe, the danger is still there.  This is extremely dangerous and I would ask the Minister to give this matter consideration or, as suggested by Deputy De Rossa, to come back to us on a later Stage and perhaps incorporate what we are trying to achieve in the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>If I thought there was a lack of consultation in these sections I certainly would bring forward an amendment. I would ask the Deputies to look at section 13 (1) (a), which states that it will be the duty of every employer</P>
      <P>to consult his employees for the purpose of the making and maintenance of arrangements which will enable him and his employees to co-operate effectively in promoting and developing measures to ensure their safety, health and welfare at work and in ascertaining the effectiveness of such measures. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1914" /> This provision is written into the legislation. Section 13 (1) (b) provides that it will be the duty of every employer</P>
    <P>as far as is reasonably practicable, to take account of any representations made by his employees. </P>
    <P>The areas a safety plan should cover are written into the legislation.  I do not understand how an employer could get out from under that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>For the very reason I gave at the start of the debate &mdash; if it is included in section 12 it will dilute the absolute requirement in section 12 for an employer to have a safety plan.  If an employer who does not like this Bill is given the opportunity under section 12 not to commence with the process of a safety plan, he will use this provision as a device for saying he cannot agree on the mechanisms for discussion or the delegation who will discuss the safety plan. I am seeking in section 12 to set down that there is an absolute requirement for every employer to have a safety plan and section 13 sets down the process of consultation, which I believe is strongly in the interests of workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not agree that the safety statement is central to the legislation?  This is, as it were, the proclamation that safety standards will have to be set down in the safety statement. With all due respects, I believe section 13 is an afterthought and the only way to ensure that safety standards are maintained is to include them in the safety statement which will be put up on the wall in a factory or place of work so that everybody can see them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I have read out already the conditions which much be met in drawing up a safety statement.  These provisions are extremely broad and I will refer again to some of them: to involve <Col N="1915" /> management to the highest level in a clear programme of action; to stimulate action to ensure compliance with the statutory safety and health provisions; to stimulate assessment and clarification of hazards and how to deal with them; to identify and assign clear responsibilities in relation to safety and health measures &mdash; these responsibilities cannot be set down unless the roles of the employees and the employer are identified; to ensure systematic follow-up of problems once identified &mdash; again the employees will have to be involved in this process because it is no good setting down the difficulties and the hazards and trying to identify them if they do not have the good will of the employees; to ensure that resources are assigned, which will directly involve the employees; and to gain the commitment of all persons in the workplace.  It is fundamental that any employer endeavouring to have a safety plan agreed should have the good will of the workforce.  Those conditions and powers of consultation are provided in the Bill and the point raised by the Deputy is well covered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to sections 12 and 13, if an employer makes a statement on the safety requirements but in the course of consultation on how they are to be implemented the employees subsequently find that there is a material gap in the statement and they cannot convince an inspector that it is a serious gap, surely this could lead to problems between the employees and the employer, which could perhaps have been avoided at an earlier stage in the preparation of the statement.  I think Deputy O'Sullivan has a point without, as the Minister is concerned, diluting section 12 in trying to find a way of ensuring that employees are satisfied with the generality of the statement being made by an employer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister holds that the amendment as proposed weakens the obligation of the employer in section 12, then surely we should be searching for a means of ensuring that at some point the <Col N="1916" /> employees can propose amendments to that statement.  There is nothing under the consultation process in section 13 which enables employees to propose amendments to the statement, the basic document around which the safety proposals and procedures will be built.  Perhaps a statement could be included in section 12 (3) which would provide that a draft of the statement should be presented within 14 days and submissions made within a further 14 days.  Maybe a formula should be included in the section whereby employees would have the right to say the statement is fine and should go ahead, or the statement is defective in one, two or three respects and should be amended, then if there is a dispute about a statement an inspector can be brought in.  However, there should be some way of ensuring that there is a process of input from the employees.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that input is already provided in section 13.  If the system does not work, which is what we are arguing about, and difficulties arise, which I do not think will happen, the Authority could amend the statement by way of regulations.  Section 12 (5) states:</P>
      <P>Where a safety statement is prepared or revised pursuant to this section and an inspector is satisfied that the statement is inadequate in a material respect he may direct that the statement be revised and the employer shall comply with the direction within thirty days of the direction being given by the inspector. </P>
      <P>I think this paragraph satisfies the Deputy's concern in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy's other point related to the problems which would arise if a safety officer of a firm failed to convince an inspector that a safety statement was adequate.  In such cases the inspector, who would be representing the Authority, would try to get co-operation between employers and employees in ensuring that the legislation works.  The function of an inspector would be to try to get a compromise so that the safety plan can go ahead.  The employers and <Col N="1917" /> the unions involved must sit down together to draw up guidelines on safety statements for the information of employers and different employment sectors. As soon as the legislation is enacted we will try to get employers and unions in all workplaces to draw up guidelines on how the safety statements will work and as part of that, the Authority will be made up of the Congress of Trade Unions and the Federated Union of Employers who will try to ensure that there is compromise and that there will be agreed safety statements.  Otherwise the legislation will not work.</P>
    <P>I would be concerned if I did not think that adequate consultation was allowed for in the system, but I believe it is. The principle of the safety statement is contained in section 12 and the consultation process is contained in section 13.  What is necessary is there; this is not an area of difficulty.  I must, however, concede that something can always go wrong.  If it does not work, a regulation will have to be introduced, but I believe it will work.  The employer is asked to comply with the safety statement under section 12 and under section 13 to enter into consultation.  The safety plan I have been working on has a number of sections in it which state that the employer must have consultation, otherwise he will get nowhere with the safety plan.</P>
    <P>The FUE guidelines to employers and the Congress of Trade Unions guidelines to their members will be to seek agreement on these safety plans.  Otherwise the whole philosophy behind the legislation would be defeated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am reluctant to introduce any note of acrimony into what has now become a very constructive debate. The only objection I can see to this is that the FUE are an employers' organisation. I am looking at the matter from a somewhat different perspective, from the workers' point of view.  I have a certain bias.  The employee is at a disadvantage in not having a position within the safety statement.  It is absolutely necessary that he should have a role and this would come about by proper consultation <Col N="1918" /> between management and the safety representatives before the statement is published.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>

      <P>No. In the Department of Labour there would be little chance of picking anybody, because all these agencies pick their own members.  I could never put friends in anywhere, which is just as well.</P>
      <P>The advantage is that both employers and trade unions will be involved in the guidelines as to what the safety plan will be.  They would have to stress that for that plan to work there must be involvement. There must be not just involvement but negotiation with the workers.  There would be no point in an employer trying to draft a safety plan and railroad it through without input from the workers. I do not see Deputy O'Sullivan's comments as introducing any acrimony.  If I felt that the workers were not getting full consultation, I would be in agreement with the Deputy's amendment.  Under section 13, they are guaranteed that full consultation.  My concern is that under section 12 an employer might drag his feet and that is why I have argued the point.</P>

      <P>I cannot understand the rationale of the exclusion of an inspector or of the employer's representative from a tour of inspection.  It is in this section that there is a problem.

On the understanding that he will withdraw his amendment to subsection (6) (g), I do not see any difficulty in having the safety representative informed when an inspector calls to investigate an accident.  That is the point the Deputy has just now made.  This would certainly help to reduce suspicion and misunderstanding.  However, the inspector must be free independently to investigate accidents and inquire into matters which could be quite sensitive.  His investigations could very well have subsequent legal implications for either the employer or the workers.  In the event of court proceedings, either party can produce their own evidence.  In general terms, a considerable degree of latitude has been incorporated into the Bill with regard to the giving of information by an inspector to safety representatives.</P>

      <P>This is without prejudice to the general idea of sections 1 and 2 where the employees appoint their representative. I have had experience of the <Col N="1920" /> employee selected sometimes becoming a victim of his work as a safety representative of the employees.  He must go to the employer complaining on behalf of his colleagues and he could become very unpopular.  On the other hand, a safety representative could be very disruptive and could be going every minute to the employer with some complaint or other.  Where a representative of that kind is being selected on the factory floor, should there not also be negotiations with the trade union?  This would be so that the best person would be selected.  From my long observation of this area, I have seen people being victimised, being told that they were cranks.  The House would say that they were about their job.</P>

Perhaps the trade unions would resent somebody else deciding who should represent them on the safety committee.  In normal cases the existing practices are good.  I have presented safety awards and launched safety weeks and the people involved are recognised by the employers and the unions as having considerable capabilities in that area.  They are given time and resources to encourage and cajole their workers to adopt certain practices.

      <P>I want to raise a general point on the duty of employers. Should we not be making provision in the Bill that at least industries or workplaces of a certain type should be required to have medical surveillance for their staff, depending on the nature of employment? There is no reference to this in the Bill. I am thinking of places where radiology or chemicals are used frequently.  The Minister should consider this point for possible elaboration on Report Stage or in the Seanad.  In many workplaces employers and employee representatives have agreed on annual medical surveillance which would involve possibly blood tests, X-rays, spirometry, eye tests and so on as well as a physical examination.</P>
      <P>Is the Minister prepared to include provision for medical surveillance in workplaces of a particular nature?  I would be agreeable to employing regulations in this regard as it need not have general application but could be of importance in cases of specific types of workplaces.  The truism &mdash; prevention is better than cure &mdash; is as valid today as ever.  There is no sense in closing the door when the horse has bolted.  Medical surveillance could do an awful lot more to protect health and safety than many of the provisions in the Bill.</P>

On page 54, item (21) provides for requirements to be imposed as regards the making of arrangements for health surveillance of persons at work, including medical examinations, biological monitoring or special health surveys.  I take the Deputy's point and we attach great importance to prevention of illness. Many companies arrange medical checks for women and it is now a negotiated item.  They arrange breast screening facilities which trade unions have asked <Col N="1922" /> for.  I thank the Deputy for raising this important point and I am glad that it is covered.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 16:</P>
      <P>In page 17, subsection (6) (e), line 43, to delete &ldquo;unreasonably&rdquo;. </P>
      <P>This applies to wage agreements and inability to pay.  It will be very difficult to determine what is &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; as it will be open to interpretation.  I see it as an area of potential conflict where the management may claim that something is unreasonable.  For that reason it should be deleted as it puts the employer in an advantaged position and the workers' representative would have little right of appeal.  I ask the Minister to accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>The formula here for enabling safety representatives to carry out inspections was carefully worked out by both sides of industry on the Interim Board for Occupational Safety and Health.

      <P>I take the Deputy's point that this is a controversial area but it was a carefully worked out balance between both sides.  There was a lot of give and take on some of these aspects and compromises were reached.  The interim board did a great deal of work on this and worked out a compromise on this <Col N="1923" /> and other areas.  If it proves necessary to introduce a requirement for the carrying out of an inspection this can be done by way of regulations.  That would be the road to follow.  As the Deputy is aware, the question of changing the provisions in section 13 was a source of great debate but I would rather let it stand as it is.</P>

There was controversy in respect of a number of areas but in the end a balance was struck following a lot of negotiation.  We did spend a considerable amount of time on this matter.  If it proves necessary in the future to spell out the arrangements as we will have to do in many cases, this can be achieved by way of regulations.

      <P>My advice is that the <Col N="1924" /> amendment is unnecessary as elsewhere the duties on employers as regards the ensuring of safety and health are set out. In addition the safety representative would have access to the inspector. Therefore, if there are matters the safety representative brings to the attention of the employer and on which action is necessary and if the employer is unwise enough to fail to act he would face action on the part of the inspector.  Overall these provisions are designed to encourage co-operation between employers and workers in securing safety and health at work.  Over emphasis on coercion would prove counterproductive in this area.  As I have stated, the duties on employers as regards the ensuring of health and safety are set out in the Bill and the safety representative would have access to the inspector.  Therefore a protection exists.</P>

What I am saying is that the present wording in the Bill is weak in that an employer could go on considering for an indefinite length of time.

Workers who allow their names be put forward for selection as safety representatives could endanger their promotional prospects or security of tenure as a result.  Deputy Wyse already referred to this matter when speaking to an earlier section when he said that people who allowed their names be put forward could find themselves being discriminated against and it is because of this that I tabled this amendment which seeks to ensure that a person with the interests of his fellow workers at heart and who becomes a member of the board will not be put in a disadvantageous position.</P>

      <P>In page 20, subsection (2), lines 20 and 21, to delete &ldquo;, and may be removed from office at any time,&rdquo;. </P>
      <P>Let me ask the question: who would want to be the director general?  The director general would have no security what-soever and there is no way that he could act independently given the terms being offered to him.  This would be not in the interests of those who would be affected by this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The provisions contained in the Bill as regards the appointment of the director general are standard provisions in legislation of this sort.  Usually they complement the contractual arrangements in respect of such appointments. The type of amendments proposed by the Deputy in respect of such appointments would introduce an undesirable degree of inflexibility.  I regret therefore that I cannot accept them.  Under section 18 (3) the director general would have responsibility for carrying on, managing and controlling the administration and business of the authority and shall perform such other functions as may be determined by the authority.  A vital part of these functions <Col N="1927" /> and duties would undoubtedly be the reporting to the board of the Authority on the execution of settled policy and assisting the board in their discussions on the formulation of policy as well as all other relevant matters.  This is the normal role that would be given to a director general.  I do not consider that the amendments are necessary to ensure the appropriate participation by the director general at board meetings.  In most State boards the director general or senior manager would normally attend board meetings and participate as directed by the chairman and members of the board. He would not be a member of the board. In most cases he attends all board meetings and answers in his executive capacity.  They might often be chair-persons of the executive committees but on the boards in the vast majority of cases they would not be full members.  I do not think the amendments are necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 25 states the norm, but the director general could be excluded in this case particularly if any controversial issue was being discussed. That is extremely dangerous.  It is absolutely necessary that the director general sit on the board.  I am not seeking voting rights or anything like that for him, but part of his duty should be to attend every board meeting by right and not at the whim of the chairman of the board. The Minister should accede to this amendment to ensure that he has the right to attend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be the position in practice but it would be for the authority to decide.  All the agencies under my control are made up, as this one will be, by a majority of the social partners.  It will be six to four in this case and the social partners always opt to have their secretaries general at the meetings. I do not think it a matter for us.  It is an administrative matter for the board.  The FÁS Act, for example, does not specify the secretary general.  The chief executive of the Employment Equality Agency <Col N="1928" /> attends all board meetings without exception. It is a matter for the board concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is making one miscalculation in that he is assuming they will be social partners. There is nothing to guarantee this arrangement will go on indefinitely, desirable though it be.  At some later stage, the same sort of working arrangement may not apply within the partnership and the director general could be at a frightful disadvantage if it does not.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I see the Deputy's point. He wants to ensure this arrangement continues. I will write into the Bill that the social partners, three from either side, will always be on the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>A director general could to a large degree be dependent on the judgment of the chairman who may at any time exclude him, and that may not be in the best interests of the people we are trying to protect.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The social partners will always be a majority under the provisions of this Bill; there will always be six.  It is the practice to have general secretaries attend.  The Deputy can be assured they will operate that system.  In important decisions in none of the boards under my aegis as Minister for Labour, have the social partners left out the director general. Their normal practice, but perhaps not at every meeting, is to have the director general, general secretary and CEO attend.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>On Second Stage Deputy O'Sullivan touched on a very important aspect of the Bill when he raised the question of the activities of the Authority. Can a Deputy question the Minister on the conduct or misconduct of the director general?  Normally questions regarding a State-sponsored body are asked of the director of the State-sponsored body.  In this case, I am very keen to see every possible opportunity open to <Col N="1929" /> Deputies to question the activities of the director general.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has probably been frustrated by some replies to questions in regard to day to day matters. If they are administrative matters, Ministers do not answer.  However, the Deputy seems to imply that he is thinking about policy matters.  If it was a serious breach of conduct or maladministration it would be a policy matter, and it would be for the House to decide on it.  In such a case a Deputy would be entitled to put down a question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 18 (2) provides that the first director general shall be appointed, and may be removed from office at any time by the Minister.  Is this normal practice?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>In other areas perhaps, but here one could be determining whether people's lives could be put at risk, and the Minister still insists it is necessary to have the power to remove him.  Would the Minister not consider, as I have suggested, that the first director general be appointed for a minimum of three years, and that he would operate more efficiently and with greater independence if he could be assured he is in office for three years?  There could be a change of Government or another Minister may not be favourably disposed towards a director general and for some spurious reason would have him removed from office.  Does the Minister not think that by accepting my amendment that the first director general be appointed for three years, he would be appointing somebody with clout and independence whose judgment will not be affected by the threat to his employment?  We have said that the promotional chances and security of tenure of safety representatives may be put at risk by virtue of their involvement on safety committees. It could be very easy for the director general in this case to be compromised because a Minister can hold the <Col N="1930" /> axe over his head at any time.  That is not the proper environment for a man in such a position to be working in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not rejecting the principle of Deputy O'Sullivan's amendment, but in practice the Minister would appoint the director general and the director general would then be given a contract with various conditions laid down.  Normally contracts in semi-State boards such as this are for five years.  That contract would have to be cleared in this instance by the Department of Labour with the Department of Finance.  The normal term is five years, so the recipient of the first contract will be held to it, and I imagine the contract will be for five years.  That provision would be set out along with other conditions on pensions, sick leave, benefits and entitlements in the letter of contract, which is now fairly standard.  It varies slightly with the agencies but normally the chief executive of a semi-State company gets a five year contract from the Minister of the day.  I am not rejecting what the Deputy is saying but probably it will be effectively five years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister understands what I am trying to achieve. Maybe the manner in which the matter has been presented is questionable.  I am not suggesting the director general should not be subject to supervision by the Minister and his Department or that he should not have a great deal of scope to perform his tasks efficiently.  The Minister obviously has very set views on this issue.  He is using precedent which in this case may not be the best course of action.  We must agree to differ on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Sections of this Bill have been taken directly from the Acts dealing with Eolas, Teagasc and FÁS.  When the Authority is appointed the Minister will appoint the first director general but thereafter appointments will be made by the Authority.  The Minister will give a contract of employment but I would have very little room for manoeuvre.  It is a set contract drawn up by the Department of <Col N="1931" /> Finance for directors general and chief executive officers of semi-State companies. The salaries, conditions and pensions are set down and the contract is normally for five years.  This is the normal standard practice.  There is nothing sinister in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has cited FÁS but he will admit that the role of FÁS and the role of the director general in this instance will be entirely different. I am concerned that the type of contract offered to the director general may interfere with his independence and may compromise him in some way.  If there is some issue involving a Government Department who are negligent regarding safety standards, there is a possibility that pressure could be put on the chairman. That would be extremely dangerous.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Authority will have the legal powers and the protection of the director general lies in those powers. I take the point that if he intended to prosecute the Department of Labour the Minister of the day might try to get at him.  The Authority are answerable to the Minister for Labour in broad policy matters but they would be totally independent in regard to day-to-day matters. Responsibility ultimately rests with the Minister but in this case the director general would have to be responsive to the demands of his employer, the Minister for Labour, through the Authority. The director general will be well protected. I understand the Deputy's point but the legally empowered body is the Authority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has ultimate authority in this area.  The director general will be in a very vulnerable position. He will be doing more than fulfilling a management role.  At times he will have to act as arbitrator in areas of conflict and he could be compromised.  I am insisting on some consideration being given to these amendments to ensure the independence of the director general.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know how that could be done.  In the case of all agencies it is the Minister who has the final statutory function.  In this case it is delegated to the Authority, who will be the day-to-day administrators.  They will come back to the Minister on certain policy issues. The director general appointed by the Minister in the first instance and given a contract to be chief executive of a State company has his protection in that contract and in the legal powers of the Authority, who will be made up of the social partners.  He will be answerable to them as his employers.  If the Authority instructed him to issue a prohibition notice against some State or semi-State body, he would do so on that instruction. I could not say that the Minister of the day would not try to involve himself in doing something about it, but it would be wrong for him to do so if part of the arm of the State was breaking the regulations and the inspectorate saw fit to go to the Authority to seek a prohibition notice.  A Minister would be very unwise to involve himself in trying to block a prohibition notice or to put undue pressure on a director general.</P>

      <P>It is very difficult in this House to raise matters relating to bodies such as FÁS and Teagasc.  I have put down questions to the Minister for Labour relating to them but I have been referred to the individual bodies.  Is there a pattern in all this?  It seems to be a <Col N="1933" /> feature of the legislation introduced by this Minister that he sets up independent authorities and as a result he has had a fairly easy ride at Question Time.  I am not saying there is anything wrong with this, but it is taking away from this House the right to probe deeply into the activities of some of these organisations.  That is why it is absolutely essential that the director general be independent and not subject to pressure from any Minister. This is my main concern and I would ask the Minister to consider it.</P>

      <P>Regarding Question Time, I would often prefer to answer a question rather than refer it to FÁS or one of the other bodies.  The rule in the House is that only policy questions relating to semi-State organisations are raised here.  Not many years ago there were hundreds of questions on the Order Paper dealing with posts and telegraphs issues but responsibility now lies in the semi-State area and such questions no longer appear on the Order Paper.  There is a number of agencies under the aegis of almost every Minister.  FÁS is now just over a year old and and has been taken out of the ambit.  It is difficult to decide what is policy and what is not.  I leave it to the people in the House to discuss.</P>

      <P>Workers, whether in the public or private sector, who opt for voluntary redundancy or early retirement must satisfy the statutory conditions before they are entitled to unemployment payments and to credited contributions.</P>
      <P>To determine whether a person fulfils the statutory conditions which entitle him or her to sign the live register each applicant is asked to complete a special form called the UB1 Supplement which, I presume, is the form to which the Deputy refers.  This form asks claimants to provide details relating to their previous employment, domestic circumstances, occupation and general availability for employment.  Applicants are also requested to submit any documentary evidence they may have of their efforts to obtain employment, including whether they have registerd with FÁS.</P>
      <P>The completion of the UB1 Supplement form and the seeking of documentary evidence of efforts to find work are part of the normal application procedure. The questions asked are reasonable and necessary to determine entitlement to be on the live register.</P>
      <P>Persons who opt for early retirement or voluntary redundancy and who sign on the live register must fulfil the statutory conditions in the same way as all other applicants.  No special instructions have issued from my Department to employment exchange managers in respect of such persons.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that the problem has been highlighted following the introduction of the voluntary redundancy or early retirement scheme in the public service?  Is the Minister aware that council workers aged between 60 and 65 years who opt for the early retirement scheme have to sign on at their local employment exchange where they are requested to establish that they are seeking employment?  Is the Minister aware that they are asked to produce documentary evidence to show that they are seeking employment?  Will the Minister agree that it is ludicrous for the Department of Health or the Environment to be encouraging people to accept early retirement when the Department of Social Welfare asks them, when they opt for early retirement, where they are seeking retirement?  That is a contradiction in terms and I should like the Minister to comment on it.</P>

      <P>Yes, I recognise the problem identified by the Deputy.  There has been a tendency in recent times to recognise unemployment payments as a right, and they are a right but under certain conditions.  Those conditions apply to everybody in those circumstances.  A special problem arises where people are signing for credits.  I appreciate the point made by the Deputy about those who are over 60 years of age and are simply signing for credits.  I am certainly prepared to examine that position to see if we can come to a new arrangement whereby those over 60 who are signing for credits to keep their record in order up to the time they reach 65 years of age can be facilitated.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister have a look at the problem I have identified?  Public service employees who opt for early retirement are fearful of accepting the terms of the scheme because they do not know what they will have to face if they leave the service.  Many of those who opted for the scheme were signing for between six or eight weeks before they received unemployment benefit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare the reason many of those in receipt of unemployment benefit who have paid RSI contributions are in receipt of lower payments and benefits than those in receipt of unemployment assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>With the exception of claimants aged under 18 years, unemployment benefit is payable on any claim for a maximum duration of 390 days.  This means that, on becoming unemployed, a person may draw unemployment benefit for a total duration of 15 months.</P>
      <P>When the maximum duration of unemployment benefit was first extended from six months it was decided that payment at the full rate after the first six months would be subject to the additional condition that the claimant had an annual average of 40 contributions paid over the preceding seven years.</P>
      <P>If a yearly average of 40 contributions has been paid over the seven year period, there is no change in the rate of payment; that is to say that the claimant continues to receive the same rate of payment for the remaining nine months of duration as he or she received in the first six months of claim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If, however, the claimant does not satisfy this contribution average test, a special rate of unemployment benefit is payable for the remainder of the claim. This special rate is equivalent to the maximum rate of unemployment assistance payable to a person with no means who is living in an urban area and who has been unemployed for less than 15 months.  I am abolishing the lower rural <Col N="1937" /> rate of unemployment assistance in the current Social Welfare Bill.</P>
    <P>Persons who have been unemployed for over 15 months are categorised as long-term unemployed and receive a rate of unemployment assistance that is higher than the special rate which is payable to persons who fail to safisfy the yearly average contribution test.  Accordingly, the rate of benefit payable to persons in receipt of the special rate would, unless pay-related benefit is payble, be less than the amount payable to persons who are receiving the long-term rate of unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>It has been represented to me previously that there is something wrong with this position but this is to fail to understand the rationale behind the higher payment payable to people who are long-term unemployed.  A higher rate of payment for people who had been unemployed for over 15 months was introduced over five year ago in recognition of the special needs which arise for people as unemployment continues for a lengthy period.  Since then, the long-term unemployed have received special increases.  In 1988, for instance, an increase of 11 per cent was given to long-term unemployment assistance recipients and I am delighted to be bringing in legislation at present which will further increase these rates by 12 per cent from July next.</P>
    <P>I see nothing wrong in the fact that people who are short-term unemployed, whether on unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance, should get less than those who have been unemployed for a long period.  The position would be different, of course, if the rate of unemployment assistance payable for the first 15 months of unemployment were higher than the rate of unemployment benefit during this period.  However, this is not the case.  The position is now, and the same will apply after July next, that the rate of flat-rate benefit is always higher than the short-term rate of unemployment assistance.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister <Col N="1938" /> accept that as a consequence of the changes he made last year, and which have been operative since July, there is no incentive for many people in receipt of long-term unemployment assistance to take up temporary employment because on becoming unemployed again they would be far worse off?</P>

      <P>I agree with you Sir. That is why I am asking a very short question in response to a very lengthy reply.  Do I take it from the Minister that he intends to close entirely the gap created as a consequence of his decision last year to widen the differential between long-term unemployment assistance and unemployment benefit?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It is generally accepted that people who have been on long-term unemployment assistance are in the lowest income group and have become deprived by virtue of the fact that their resources are used up.  There are situations, the ones to which the Deputy refers, in which people on short-term unemployment can be lower than the long-term unemployed, but they are not lower than those on short-term assistance. The Deputy is, therefore, comparing two different things.  He is comparing long-term unemployment assistance with short-term unemployment benefit.  Certainly those on long-term unemployment assistance are getting ahead of those people on short-term unemployment benefit.  For that reason I am bringing in the measure that is in the Bill at present.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare the present position regarding the extension of dental treatment to the spouses of insured workers; the total number of dentists who are operating the scheme at the latest date for which figures are available; if the recently announced increase in fees is being paid to dentists who are refusing to operate the extended scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 15 together.</P>
      <P>I have had two meetings with representatives of the Irish Dental Association since the completion of the report of the Joint Working Group on the Social Insurance Dental Benefit scheme in July. My officials also had several meetings and have been in frequent contact with representatives of the association over the same period.  Following a previous meeting with the association I set up this working group in the light of the association's opposition to the extension of the dental benefit scheme to the dependent spouses of insured persons, mainly wives working in the home, and with a view to seeing whether improvements could be devised which would open the way to full participation by dentists in the extended scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The association in the context of the joint working group sought fundamental changes in the scheme which I could not accept and it was not possible to reach an agreement in the context of the discussions in the group.  Officials of my Department met the association in November 1988.  I met them again in December 1988 and discussed with them the possibility of certain improvements in <Col N="1940" /> the scheme.  A further meeting at official level was held in January 1989.</P>
    <P>Since it was not possible to reach agreement with the association I implemented a substantial package of practical improvements to the scheme in line with discussions which had taken place with the association's representatives.  These improvements have been notified to each member of my Department's dental panel.  They will apply to claims from all dentists from today, 1 March.</P>
    <P>A total of 36,363 dental claims in respect of dependent spouses have been received to date.  Those claim figures and the very high level of treatment required by the claimants, bear out the considerable need which there was for this extension to dependent spouses.  One hundred and eighty-three dentists countrywide have signed new agreements covering the extended scheme.  Twenty six dentists have returned from abroad (24 from the UK) and are operating the scheme which includes the dependent spouses.</P>
    <P>Some complaints have recently been received from patients that they have been refused certain items of treatment covered under the dental benefit scheme. It is understood that this is as a result of a motion passed at an Irish Dental Association conference, recommending that their members cease providing these treatments.  Further inquiries are being made regarding the complaints and if these complaints are substantiated I will have no alternative but to apply the appropriate sanctions provided for in each dentist's personal contract.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I regard the Minister's reply as a total abuse of the priority question procedure.  The answer to my question is either one or two.  I understood the answer was one.  The Minister says he has met the members of the Irish Dental Association twice.  However, I will not waste the time of the House.  Will the Minister accept that in the resolution of a difficult dispute the most important thing is to keep lines of communication open and the worst thing that can be done is to address the members on the other <Col N="1941" /> side of the fence by way of megaphone diplomacy issuing ultimata and that carrying on in the way the Minister has carried on is total arrogance towards the case made by them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy is probably, understandably, not fully familiar with the details of what has taken place and the importance of the scheme.  The Deputy might remember that this House unanimously favoured the extension of this scheme to dependent spouses.  Since it was extended in October 1987 the Irish Dental Association have opposed that extension as vigorously as they possibly could.  Notwithstanding that, 183 dentists signed and operated the extended scheme.</P>
      <P>I have tried to work along the lines agreed in the House to ensure the continuation of the service which we have been providing.  This is a very excellent scheme.  I would like to see it operating fully in all areas of the country.  I greatly appreciate the work of those dentists who have provided a service for dependent women working in the home and I look forward to the co-operation of all dentists on the panel in the future.</P>
      <P>In relation to the meetings, the difficulty I had with the Irish Dental Association most recently, and perhaps the one to which the Deputy refers, is that the Irish Dental Association made it quite clear that they wanted a two-tier system based on medical card guidelines which involved increased fees and charges on insured workers effectively without limits, with those who are strictly on medical card guidelines getting the existing treatments.  This was not acceptable to me.  I considered that it would under-mine the insured workers PRSI scheme and would involve substantial increases in cost for insured workers for treatment. I could not meet those demands but I have met many of the requirements and I have improved the scheme substantially.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Minister wastes any further time, would he accept that in relation to the two tier system he himself has increased charges on insured <Col N="1942" /> workers?  Second, to finish the matter, will the Minister now tell me that he will sit down with the officials of the Irish Dental Association in a real effort to solve this problem now?  Could I have a yes or a no to that?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer is not as simple as that.  I am certainly prepared to discuss any matters that will lead to the resolution of the problem and the extension of the scheme to all those who are entitled under the scheme as it exists.  I mentioned the letter which was received by my Department on 25 January in which the Irish Dental Association set out the basis on which they would consider extending the scheme and it was: (a) to negotiate agreed fees for the treatment of lower income eligible patients and (b) that optional grant-in-aid would apply to the majority of treatment procedures for patients whose income level is in excess of the income level for medical card holders. I think the Deputy would agree that he would not like to see the scheme taken apart in that way and virtually dismantled.</P>

      <P>Could the Minister indicate to the House the proportion of the payments that have been made to assist people to emigrate from this country? Has he issued a directive from the Department to the health boards concerning this matter, separate from the normal supplementary welfare allowance payments?  Could he also indicate the savings arising from these payments to people emigrating by way of the supplementary welfare allowance payments and social welfare payments which would have to be made if these people were not emigrating?</P>

      <P>Statistics are not maintained in my Department of the numbers of working days lost as a result of occupational accidents or occupational diseases. Injury benefit under the occupational injuries scheme in respect of accident at work or occupational disease is payable for a maximum period of 26 weeks following which the claimant may qualify for disablement benefit where the person suffers a loss of faculty. Injury benefit, however, is not payable for sick absences of less than four working days.</P>
      <P>Based on the numbers and average duration of claims allowed, the total numbers of working days for which benefit was paid in respect of incapacity or disablement arising from accidents at work or prescribed occupational diseases are estimated at approximately 1.069 millions and 1.021 millions for 1987 and 1988 respectively.</P>

      <P>The free television licence scheme is one of several schemes, including the free electricity allowance scheme and the free telephone rental allowance <Col N="1947" /> scheme, which are provided for persons who are elderly or permanently incapacitated, who are receiving certain social security-type payments and who are either living alone or only with a dependent spouse or other excepted person.</P>
      <P>The extension of the free television licence scheme to all long-term social welfare recipients would have implications also for the other schemes and would be very costly.

      <P>The question is prompted by the number of fines that are being imposed on people who do not have television licences simply because they are poor.  There was a case last November of a 42 year old mother of three being sent to jail for three days because she owed £4 of a fine which had been imposed for not having a television licence.  In view of that would the Minister not reconsider his position on this and introduce some form of relief in relation to television licences for those on social welfare and indeed those on low pay, particularly in view of the fact that it is proposed to increase fines for not having television licences to £500?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the difficulty the Deputy raises.  The problem that exists is that if the free television licence scheme was to be extended to those in receipt of long term social welfare payments it would cost approximately £11 million a year.  The Deputy can see that would be quite a costly extension.  In the meantime every effort should be made to solve these problems through the existing arrangements but I appreciate the difficulty.</P>

      <P>The problem is <Col N="1948" /> that there are no existing arrangements to deal with situations like this.  A person who does not have the money for a television licence cannot get that money, for instance, from the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  People can, if they are knowledgeable enough, go to a local TD or indeed write themselves to the Minister for Justice seeking relief from the fine but very few people, particularly those on low pay or on social welfare payments, are aware of this right. Will the Minister agree to look again at the question of facilitating or assisting people, particularly those on long term social welfare, to avoid them having to appear in court simply because they are poor.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9, 19 and 23 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As of 31 December 1988, 46 of an approximate 11,650 serving members of the Defence Forces were in receipt of family income supplement.  These members have an average family size of over five children.  The average weekly <Col N="1949" /> value of the supplement being paid to them is currently £5.30 bringing the total weekly cost to some £244.</P>
    <P>Under the terms of the scheme, family income supplement is awarded for a period of a year from the date of claim and entitlement is reviewed at the end of that period.</P>
    <P>Since January 1989, two members of the Defence Forces have had their supplement discontinued following their annual review.  Other cases will be processed when their review dates arise.  I cannot say in detail at this stage how the review will affect individual cases as this will depend on their family and financial circumstances at the date of each review.</P>
    <P>As already announced in the budget an additional £1 million is being provided for improving the family income supplement scheme.  A wide-ranging consultant's report has recently been received and the operation of the scheme is at present being reviewed in the light of this report. Improvements to the scheme arising from the review will be brought into effect in July next at the same time as other budget improvements to social welfare schemes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. Wallace Mr. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister ensure that the review of the family income supplement scheme will result in payments for families with a larger number of children? At present, as the Minister indicated, five is the maximum number of children eligible under the scheme.  I think this is too low and is possibly a reason that some people are not availing of the scheme.  Would the Minister consider increasing the number of children who qualify under the scheme to eight or nine and ensure that large families, where the income earner is on low pay, would qualify for the family income supplement?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>

I understood from the Minister that he would arrange accordingly, but so far this has not been made available.  May I ask the Minister again, particularly in the light of the Social Welfare Bill coming up for discussion next week, to arrange to have a copy of the review made available to those who want to discuss the family income supplement during the debate on the Bill next week?</P>

      <P>I have no objection to publishing the review, but I only received a copy the night before last.  As the Deputy may know, this is an internal document to advise me and the Government on what steps might be taken.  Naturally I will have to bring this to the attention of the Government when discussing the improvements that might be possible. The Deputy mentioned that he would like a copy of the review next week and I will certainly to be able to provide a summary of the review by next week.  In any event, it will have to be printed.  I had said that when I received it I would be open to making at least a summary available to Members.</P>

Second, when I raised the issue in January the Minister indicated positively that a summary &mdash; he indicated that there may be a difficulty with the full report &mdash; would be made available to Members who were interested.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if it is intended to act on the recommendation of the Combat Poverty Agency report, <i>Poverty and the Social Welfare System,</i> that a detailed study should be undertaken to establish the reasons for the non-take-up of social welfare benefits and to identify those most at risk; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The report <i>Poverty and the Social Welfare System in Ireland</i> presented the first results from a large scale national household survey on poverty, income distribution and the usage of State services, carried out by the ESRI.  The study was jointly sponsored by the Combat Poverty Agency, the EC Commission and the ESRI itself.  The survey results indicated that a number of people appeared to have incomes below the level of supplementary welfare allowance but did not establish the reasons for this.</P>
      <P>There are a number of possible explanations for this finding.  In surveys of this kind, which involve personal interviews, it can often be difficult to obtain reliable estimates of means.  Alternatively, some of the findings may be due to the fact that the researchers' approach to assessing income was different from the means tests used by the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Combat Poverty Agency's comments on the report included the recommendation that a detailed study should be instigated to establish the underlying reasons for non-take-up of benefits and to identify those most at risk in this regard. Additional funding has been made available to the ESRI, through the Combat Poverty Agency, to undertake research into the question of non-take-up of payments as part of a second phase of the study.  This research will involve reinter-viewing a proportion of the original sample to identify those whose incomes <Col N="1952" /> are still below the supplementary welfare allowance level and then returning to the households in question to explore the reasons for non-take-up of benefits.  The fieldwork for the study will begin within the next few weeks, and the final report should be ready by the end of the year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister must be aware that the non-take-up of social welfare benefits is not confined to supplementary welfare allowances and the question he dealt with earlier on the family income supplement is a case in point.  The projected take-up of this scheme was in the region of approximately 30,000 but the actual take-up was 5,000 or 6,000 at most.  Does the Minister not consider that the remit given to the ESRI simply to investigate the non-take-up of supplementary welfare allowance was too narrow and that he would need to broaden it, and in the interim that he would need to take up the second recommendation of the Commission on Social Welfare that the independent agencies be assisted and expanded to give more effective advice to people at risk?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The study found that 2.8 per cent of people entitled to benefit appear to be entitled to some form of payment but did not claim it.  The payments to which these people appeared to be entitled included unemployment assistance, supplementary welfare allowance and family income supplement.  In relation to family income supplement, it was originally thought that the number eligible would be in the region of 35,000, but having studied it again it has been found that the number eligible would be of the order of 20,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy looks at the record she will find that I have been doing a great deal to simplify the schemes. When the information booklet is published, the Deputy will find that because of steps taken in the recent budget and in the Bill that will come before the House there will be tremendous simplification in the number of rates for different circumstances. There is a great deal of simplification being undertaken at present. With regard to the question on publicity, we are also updating and trying to simplify as far as possible all our publicity information.  There is a difficulty in simplifying it in that there are legal constraints and one has to be very careful what one says not to misconstrue the situation.  That is the reason I am trying to have a good information service throughout the country where one can discuss the pros and cons, because no matter what way one goes about it there are technical difficulties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wallace</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>To some extent that is indicated in the reply I gave.  There is a difficulty in that when one comes to actually doing a means test this is different from a survey asking people how much they have.  In a means test you are actually assessing the value of various things which people may not realise at times have value.  This applies in particular when assessing farms and farming output.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister must be aware, as virtually every Deputy is aware, of people who have not claimed their entitlements simply because they were not aware of them.  Does the Minister not accept the case for targetting more effectively what publicity and information is available to people who are most at risk?  For example, the family income supplement should be targeted at low income earners through the Revenue Commissioners who presumably have vast records of people's earnings under the PAYE system.  An information leaflet sent out with the tax free allowance certificate would target the people most likely to qualify for family income supplement and similar types of schemes for other social welfare benefits would also produce better results than blanket television and newspaper advertising.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>In meeting our targets we have changed our approach to advertising and we will change it further to make it as effective as possible.  There is still an element of difficulty in relation to communication, as suggested by Deputy Harney.  Information officers will play a very important part here.  I want to have a good information system available so we are expanding that area.  The process of matching the two sets of records will give us that facility in the long run.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 25 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In keeping with the commitment given in the <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i><Col N="1955" /> a detailed study of the workings of the family income supplement scheme has been carried out and the final report on the review has now been received.  The review addressed the main policy issues in relation to the scheme, including the question of the lower than expected take-up.</P>
    <P>A main conclusion of the report is that the original estimates of take-up on the scheme were too high.  A reassessment of the potential claimant pool revealed a maximum of 20,000 families who would be eligible.  Allowing for take-up rates experienced internationally on this type of scheme, the consultant estimated that the maximum achieveable number of clients is unlikely to be more than 12,000 families.</P>
    <P>The improvements in the scheme, which I will announce shortly, are being finalised at present taking account of the consultant's report.  These will come into effect with the increases in rates of payment generally from July.  As already announced in the budget, an additional £1 million has been allocated to the FIS in 1989.  This will bring total expenditure on the scheme to over £6 million this year.  The additional money will be used to adjust and improve the scheme taking on board the increases in social welfare rates generally and the improvements in the taxation area which were announced in the budget.</P>
    <P>The number of recipients of FIS was 5,159 at December 1988 and 5,532 at December 1987.  Expenditure on the scheme was £5.11 million in 1988 and £4.40 million in the previous year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I take it that the Minister does not intend to make very radical changes in the scheme, in that there is no reference to amendments in the Social Welfare Bill just circulated. Do I take it also that the Minister has no great hope of any vastly improved uptake in the scheme in that there was an expenditure of £5.1 million for an uptake of 5,159 people whereas the Minister has only allowed £1 million extra for the current year?  How then, does the Minister <Col N="1956" /> propose to amend this scheme in any realistic way so that it can fulfil the role for which it was originally intended, to help those in low paid employment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is aware that the money provided for the scheme is allocated in the budget and that an additional £1 million has been allocated for this scheme.  The changes can be introduced by way of regulation, so the changes do not have to be outlined in the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that this scheme has not been effective in helping those on low pay and that the abolition of PRSI from the first £2,000 or £3,000 of income would be a more effective way of ensuring that everybody entitled to help would get it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The scheme has been effective for those who have benefited from it.  As far as the Government are concerned we have taken another major step this year which involves the allocation of £20 million by exempting those on lower incomes, especially those with families, from tax.  That is the way to go about things and that is why I said in the reply that we will be taking these things into consideration in considering what to do with FIS.  We will be considering the effect of the tax exemption level on those working for low incomes and we will be trying to make the best use of the additional £1 million which is available.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister accept that, whether it is a fact, people fear that they will lose the medical card because of the way the scheme has been promoted and the lack of clear knowledge and guidelines as to how it operates with regard to other marginal benefits, and that this needs to be cleared up if we are to assist the 20,000 people living below the poverty line, as far as the Minister's statistics are concerned.</P>

      <P>There are perception problems that will have to be addressed.  We can discuss this during the course of the Second Stage of the Bill.  There is nothing to stop us fully discussing it at that stage, though it will come in separately by regulations afterwards.  The perception of the family supplement is improving as more people are becoming aware of it. However, we even had questions asked here today which showed that some people in the House do not understand how this scheme works.  I was asked would people in the Defence Forces be affected.  The scheme works in such a way that a family gets a supplement for the whole year even if income rises during that year.  Only at the end of the year if the income has gone beyond a certain level is a person reassessed for another full year.  It is fairly good that a person would have it for a year even if the income did increase.  We will have an opportunity to reassess the whole scheme.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he will introduce a self-assessment means test for those welfare payments which currently require means testing; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 24 together.</P>
      <P>There are eleven social assistance payment schemes operated by my Department, entitlement to which depends on a means test.  A number of these schemes, for example, widow's non-contributory pension and deserted wife's allowance apply a similar means test.  In some cases entitlement under one scheme carries with it entitlement to additional benefits, for example, fuel allowance in the case of certain recipients of long-term social assistance payments.</P>
      <P>Means testing for schemes administered by my Department is carried out by 235 social welfare officers attached to the Department's inspection branch.  The number of social assistance claims referred to that branch in the last three years was as follows: 1986 219,856; 1987 227,249 and 1988 234,084.  These would include referrals of new claims for means investigation and of existing claims for review of means.  They would also include referrals of claim for review of conditions other than means and it is not possible to say what proportion of the referrals in each year related only to means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has generally been the practice to have means investigations for all claims carried out at the home of the claimant and this has advantages from the point of view of verifying the circumstances of claimants and also of being able to discuss <Col N="1959" /> with claimants the different conditions applying to the schemes.  In the context of reviewing the means testing arrangements, however, I have identified certain categories where home visits are not necessary and for some unemployment assistance claimants assessments are now carried out at the Department's local office.  Furthermore a measure of self-assessment has been introduced under the family income supplement scheme with entitlement being established on the basis of statements from claimants accompanied by appropriate evidence and with investigations by social welfare officers in only a proportion of cases.  The question as to whether self-assessment would be appropriate for other schemes where the conditions for entitlement are more complex is under examination.  In addition the possibility of using to a greater extent information supplied for the purpose of one scheme to determine entitlement under other schemes is also under examination.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for at least examining the possibility of self assessment.  Would he agree that if it is appropriate for people in this country to use self assessment for tax purposes surely the most deprived section of the community should be entitled to self assessment for social welfare purposes and obviously have stiff penalties included?  Would the Minister agree that in addition to the schemes operated by his Department for means testing the health boards have separate schemes and local authorities have other schemes for analysing the amount of money that is needed for differential rents and that this is a waste of the State's resources?  Would he agree that at a minimum there should be one central body involved in means testing claimants or applicants for State benefits?  Would be further agree that the sooner we move to a self-assessment system the more effective and the less degrading it will be for applicants for State benefits?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The issues involved differ. <Col N="1960" /> I agree with the Deputy that as far as possible the assessments should be done by one body.  This is being done to a certain extent and we are trying to increase the extent to which it is being done between the Department of Social Welfare and the health boards and also in relation to local authorities.  It is a matter which needs a good deal more work.  I agree with the Deputy that the question of self assessment is feasible.  It should be extended but there are limits. Over the years we have had examples of assessments which were quite different and which were seen not to indicate the people who were most likely to be eligible or in need of the benefits.  Leaving aside the fact that some control is necessary I would agree broadly with the Deputy.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not accept that there is an unanswerable case to be made for a system of single means testing?  This whole business, as Deputy Harney has pointed out, of applicants traipsing around from social welfare officers about their benefits to the health board officer for a medical card, to another health board officer for supplementary welfare, while awaiting social welfare money, and to the corporation or the council about their rents &mdash; each time they must go through a detailed examination as to their means &mdash; is degrading and costly for the applicant who has to travel to each of these offices and is immensely expensive to the State.  Would the Minister not accept that there is now a case to be made for the introduction of a single means test?  When I raised this issue previously he indicated that an inter-departmental committee was sitting. Can the Minister tell me whether this inter-departmental committee has been doing anything other than sitting on this issue?  Have they produced any recommendations or results?</P>

      <P>We are continually reviewing, revising, altering and updating schemes.  If Deputies look at what has happened in social welfare in the last few years they will recognise that there has been a phenomenal change in upgrading in many aspects of my Department's work.  That goes back to computerisation. I recall that in 1985, 80,000 claims were dealt with on computer in a year, now 2.2 million are dealt with in a year.  It has probably been one of the greatest changes of any major organisation in the country.  I have introduced the whole concept of the one-stop shop. These one-stop shops are developing throughout the country and are based on the concept mentioned by the Deputy of doing as much as possible in one place. We have introduced desk interviews for unemployment assistance where we talk to somebody over the desk and say: &ldquo;We will take your word for that, that is the situation, off you go and we will pay you unemployment assistance right away.&rdquo;  A tremendous amount of work is being done at a time when my Department's staff are under great pressure.  That is the reality.  Some compliment to the staff of the Department could be in order for the extent to which they are updating, modernising and meeting the kinds of requirements that are being suggested here in the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>

In relation to some of the areas there has been an enormous <Col N="1962" /> increase in the numbers involved.  There is a number of different kinds of fraud in existence.  The officers have to go out on behalf of the House, the country and the Department and find these things out.  If they did not do that work they would not be doing their job properly.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he will allow persons in receipt of invalidity pension, who transfer to retirement pension at the age of 65, to qualify for the same extra benefits with their retirement pension as they would if they were in receipt of invalidity or old age pension; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>In general entitlement to the free schemes is confined to persons who are over 66 years of age.  Persons <Col N="1964" /> under 66 who are in receipt of invalidity pensions and who satisfy the appropriate conditions also qualify for the free schemes.</P>
      <P>An invalidity pensioner can remain on invalidity pension after age 65.  Where, however, a pensioner opts to transfer to the retirement pension at that age he is not entitled to the free scheme as he is not in receipt of a qualifying payment.</P>
      <P>As Deputies will know, I am this year extending entitlement under the free schemes to additional categories, namely pensioners from other EC member states and recipients of certain pensions under the occupational injuries scheme.  I will be examining the scope for further extentions of the schemes as circumstances permit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that it was an oversight on his part and on the part of his officials not to have included this category before now because people on invalidity pension who have been on long-term disability and invalidity assistance and who have reached the age of 66, will bring their benefits with them?  Having reached the age of 65 they are notified by the Department that they have reached retirement pension age and they are asked to apply for this pension but having qualified for retirement pension they are then advised they will lose the benefit of free electricity. This is very traumatic because these people may have had this benefit for the past eight or ten years.  I ask the Minister to examine this issue as a matter of urgency and to advise those people that they are better off to stay on invalidity pension rather than apply for retirement pension.

      <P>No, they are given the option and they can take one or the other pension.  The reason for this is very simple.  A couple on retirement pension will get £93 per week and on invalidity pension they will get £82.40.  The Department will write to them and say &ldquo;You are receiving £82.40 per week and, if you wish, you can go on to retirement pension for this year before you come to old age pension and the rate will be £93&rdquo;.  Obviously a couple will make a substantial financial gain by going on the £93 per week rate as against the cost of the free electricity.  The extension of free electricity to, say, those on retirement pension is a separate question and separate costings and provisions would have to be made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>

      <P>I want to make what hopefully is a constructive suggestion. Would it not be fairer to a person in receipt of invalidity pension, when the option is being given to him, to point out in the letter of option that if he goes for the higher payment there is a downside as well and he will lose the non-cash benefits?  Would the Minister accept that <Col N="1966" /> as part of the answer to Deputy Sherlock's problem?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14 and 26 together.</P>
      <P>The pre-budget submission from the National Council for the Aged contained a number of recommendations arising from the council's report <i>Caring for the Elderly</i> which had been published previously. In their report the council examined the present arrangements for providing assistance to incapacitated old age pensioners who are being cared for by another person, through the prescribed relative allowance scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The council recommend that the assistance provided in this situation should operate on the principle of compensation for the cost to carers of lost work opportunities outside the home and also for the additional household costs incurred as a result of their caring role.  To this end the council recommend the payment of two separate allowances in cases where an elderly person requires care and attention. These are: an allowance on the lines of the prescribed relative allowance but payable in any case where an elderly person is incapacitated to a significant <Col N="1968" /> degree and requires care and an allowance to the carer equivalent to the unemployment benefit or assistance to which they would otherwise be entitled.  The council's recommendations would involve a major change in existing arrangements and would have very significant cost implications.</P>
    <P>I will keep the council's views in mind in the context of future developments in this area.  I have also brought these views to the attention of the National Pensions Board which will be reporting to me later this year on future pension provisions generally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>This issue has become something of a hardy annual and in all the years the Minister has been answering questions in this House he has given us the same answer.  Would the Minister accept that there is now ample evidence that a change is needed in the way the prescribed relative's allowance is paid and in the value of the prescribed relative's allowance?  The report estimates that there are about 24,000 people in need of full time care.  If those 24,000 carers withdrew their services the cost to the State would be phenomenal and we would be talking about perhaps £500 per week per person to cover the cost.  Would the Minister not agree it is only fair that the people who provide this care for their elderly relatives should be compensated?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that the people providing such care are providing a very valuable service.  The difficulty I have with the suggestion made by the National Council for the Aged is that it would cost £31 million in a full year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a suggestion to the Minister.  Taking the prescribed relative's allowance payable at present, would the Minister make a start by establishing clearly that the carers are entitled to a direct payment which would not be added on to the pensioner's payment?  Secondly, would the Minister not accept that the amount payable to those who at present receive the <Col N="1969" /> prescribed relative's allowance is so low at £27 or £28 that at a minimum it should be brought up to the basic SWA level? That start could be made for less than £1 million.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">

The future administration of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme is being considered in this general context.</P>
      <P>The integration of the scheme into my Department would have major implications for the Department and also for the health boards and the other services they provide.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4, 5 and 17 together.</P>
      <P>The proposal to apply an income limit for entitlement to child benefit was put forward by the Minister for Finance in his budget statement for discussion and examination.  It reflects the concern that has been expressed in regard to the payment of this benefit to very high income families and the importance of targeting resources within the child benefit scheme.</P>
      <P>As the Taoiseach stated in Dáil Éireann (Official Report, 1 February 1989, columns 898-9) it was never the Government's intention that the income limits contemplated would affect low or middle income families.  The kind of income limit envisaged was not less than £30,000 per annum.  Such a limit could achieve estimated savings of £5 million in a full year.  Such savings would be used to improve the child benefits for those on lower incomes.</P>
      <P>One of the drawbacks at present is that because of the complete lack of selectivity, Governments are inclined to give increases to better targeted schemes and give those schemes priority over child benefit.  If the child benefit scheme is to be improved on a regular basis for those who really need it, there should be some element of selectivity.  One way would be to give any new increases up to a certain level of incomes only.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government are firmly committed to improving the position of low income families.  The measures announced in the budget constitute a co-ordinated set of measures which taken together represent <Col N="1973" /> a major initiative in this area and build on the substantial progress made last year.</P>
    <P>First, special measures have been taken for families at work on low pay, which will be of particular benefit to those with children.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>These measures involve an increase from £5,000 to £6,000 in the tax exemption limit for married couples together with a new special exemption of £200 in respect of each child.  For a married couple with five children on £7,000 a year the net gain will be £13 a week.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>A similar family will continue to benefit at a reducing rate up to an income of £9,000.  In all, 136,000 children in some 65,000 families will benefit from this novel and practical arrangement.</P>
      <P>Secondly, in relation to social welfare payments, this year's budget contains very significant increases in respect of children.  Child dependant allowances rates generally are being increased by 3 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>In addition, a minimum rate of £10 per week is being introduced for all dependent children.

      <P>I had more or less concluded my remarks on this amendment.  The Director General is appointed under this legislation in the normal way and the contractual arrangements setting out his conditions of appointment would be given to him on taking up duty.  The legal power and status rests with the Authority.  I hope Deputy O'Sullivan is satisfied with the <Col N="1999" /> reply as there is nothing in this section that does not apply to normal State bodies when a Director General takes up the position.

It could equally be argued that there will be times when the board perhaps would not want the Director General to be present but that really is a matter for themselves.

      <P>In page 23, line 10, after &ldquo;State&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, provided that any enforcement functions are not depleted by such borrowing&rdquo;. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment relates to borrowing.  It is possible that people could be compromised if the Authority have to rely on borrowing to implement the enforcing procedures outlined in the Bill.  Indeed, the standard of inspections could drop, which would be in nobody's interest.  It would be quite legitimate to borrow for <Col N="2002" /> other reasons but it should be clearly spelt out that there would be no borrowing for this purpose.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I can give the Deputy an assurance that that is not what is involved here.  The Authority would have the power to borrow subject to the consent of both the Minister for Labour and the Minister for Finance.  It is expected that this power would be used sparingly and very infrequently.  Whatever restrictions or limitations that may be considered necessary will be imposed by the Department of Finance, who would be the final arbitrator in financial matters.  It is not intended that the Authority would borrow for the purposes of carrying out their enforcement functions.  I can assure the Deputy that they would not be able to borrow for the purposes he outlined.</P>

This provision would be used infrequently, but not to implement the enforcing of the procedures outlined in the Bill.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 27:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In page 23, subsection (1), lines 14 <Col N="2003" /> to 16, to delete all words from &ldquo;as it considers appropriate&rdquo; down to and including &ldquo;Minister) and&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;, except for advice and services, as it considers appropriate in respect of&rdquo;. </P>
    <P>This amendment relates to the charging of fees for services rendered.  I would adopt a far more serious approach to this section because the Minister is proposing to introduce a new element in regard to the carrying out of inspections.  The Minister is proposing that a fee be charged for these services.  If an inspection is carried out a charge will be levied against the employer.  Is that correct? Perhaps the Minister would clarify this for me.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me outline what is intended here.  I understand what the Deputy is getting at but I can tell him that that is not the intention.  The Deputy is concerned that the use of the word &ldquo;services&rdquo; in section 24 could imply a financial charge being made on an employer to cover the cost of inspections made under the Bill.  I can reassure the Deputy that under no circumstances could the Authority impose a charge for the enforcement of this legislation.  This would run counter to all law enforcement practices.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless the Authority may wish to charge for advisory work done on behalf of consultants or at the request of employers.  The proposed amendments would limit the activities in which the Authority would be in a position to make a financial charge.  Let me give an example of what may be involved here. If an inspector of the Authority gave a lecture, made a presentation or carried out some consultancy work, something which would happen and has nothing to do with the enforcement of the regulations, a charge might be levied to cover the staff time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has said that no charge may be imposed for the enforcement of this legislation but this <Col N="2004" /> can only follow after the carrying out of an inspection.  I suggest that he ask the draftsman to take another look at this matter as an element of doubt still remains.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not very clear. Section 24 does not spell this out too clearly.  It appears we are asking employers to pay for inspection.  We have given fair consideration to this section and have looked at it from many angles &mdash; when I say &ldquo;we&rdquo; I mean my party colleagues and I &mdash; and we believe it is rather ambiguous to say the least.  I can accept the points made by the Minister in relation to the imposing of a charge for the giving of lectures by members of the staff of the Authority, but as regards inspections this does not clarify the matter for me.  This area needs tightening up.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">

      <P>It is clear that under no circumstances could the Authority impose a charge for the enforcement of the legislation.  That would run counter to the principle behind the Bill and all law enforcement practices.  A charge may only be imposed in respect of advisory work carried out.  The Authority could never think of imposing a charge as for the enforcement of the legislation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2005" /> The determination of the amounts or charges by the Authority shall be subject to the approval of the Minister and the Minister for Finance.  The Authority could not force an employer to pay for an inspection and then prosecute him for not complying with the regulations.  There would be a conflict of interests here.  A charge may not be imposed on an individual for the enforcement of the legislation.  A charge may only be imposed for a service rendered.  It could not happen under the Bill. </P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me refer to my first amendment today regarding the Mines and Quarries Act, 1965.  The workers, the people employed in the mining industry pay for the inspection, and there is a precedent in that Act where somebody other than the Minister is paying for the service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a different concept. The term &ldquo;services&rdquo; applies to where the Authority would be doing the advisory work.  In no way is the interpretation to be stretched, nor would the Minister or the Minister for Finance be asked to allow a service charge to be linked to enforcement procedures.  Deputy Wyse is asking me to look at it again.  The fact that the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Labour would have to approve it means that never would the Minister for Finance or the Minister for Labour allow the Authority to start charging for an inspector's fee for going out to enforce laws. However, if the Deputy wishes, I will see if the regulation can be tightened up.  We are talking about a totally different type of service.  It was never envisaged in this legislation that workers would be charged for an inspector going out to enforce the law.</P>

      <P>I want to make a general point about the annual reports which come before this House.  First, they tend to be glossy and expensive affairs.  There is no need for a report to be glossy and expensive.  This practice has developed among State companies generally.  Secondly, reports should be required to highlight where inadequate resources are being provided.  It goes back to the enforcement question because the key to success of this legislation will be enforcement. The board should be given the duty and freedom in their annual report to the Oireachtas to highlight difficulties in relation to resources, be they financial or manpower resources.  If the board are not given due resources we are going to have problems in implementing this legislation. This is a real problem with all the legislation we are passing in this House.</P>

      <P>In page 25, between lines 33 and 34, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3)  In a factory or plant where an emission of a toxic substance is identified as being harmful to employees, be that substance inhaled or ingested, the following shall apply&mdash;</P>
      <P> (a)  all employees should have an annual medical check-up carried out by a registered practitioner in industrial health medicine,</P>
      <P>(b)  a minimum of diagnostic tests on all such employees should include a full blood count and an X-ray of chest,</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I attach much importance to this amendment. Many workers are exposed to toxic substances in the course of their employment. A recent survey carried out by the ITGWU estimated that over 77,000 workers are in daily contact with some form of toxic substance.  These substances are to be found in most industries but especially in the chemical and pharmaceutical industries.  Industrial dust can be found in industries ranging from steel production to flour milling.  It is of vital importance that employees exposed to <Col N="2011" /> such hazards should be medically monitored on a regular basis and a specific set of guidelines should be incorporated in the Bill which would be consistent with EC regulations.

      <P>The Deputy made this point on Second Stage and I have had the matter examined.  I am advised that it would not be appropriate in framework legislation to go into the kind of detail the Deputy is requesting.  It is more appropriate to be dealt with in regulations or codes of practice envisaged in the legislation.  I would draw the attention of the Deputy to paragraph (21) of the Fourth Schedule which foresees the making of regulations on subjects like this.  In addition, occupational medical advisers can have workers medically examined under section 34 (4).  I accept the Deputy's point about the importance of regulations in these areas.  A number of sets of regulations already exist which include details of this sort in respect of special risk areas such as working with lead or asbestos.  Last week I issued extremely detailed asbestos regulations. The lead regulations are similar.  The Fourth Schedule of this Bill sets out different areas in which codes of practice or regulations are required.  This matter will be looked at in that light.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 34:</P>
      <P>In page 26, before section 31, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;31.  &mdash;Where the Health and Safety Executive recommends to the Minister for Labour that a voluntary code of practice has proved inadequate, the Minister for Labour may introduce a statutory code of practice following consultation with the Health and Safety Executive by laying a resolution before the Houses of the Oireachtas for 21 sitting days.  Where the Minister is satisfied that a voluntary code of practice has proved inadequate, and following consultation with the Health and Safety Executive, he may introduce a statutory code of practice by laying a resolution before the Houses of the Oireachtas for 21 sitting days.&rdquo;. </P>
      <P>It is necessary to have a statutory code of practice rather than a voluntary one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The provisions on codes of practice are set out very clearly in section 30 and I do not see the need for another form of code of practice.  The Authority may issue, or amend, its own codes of practice.  It can also approve of other codes, in whole or in part.  By implication, if a code drawn up by another body is deficient, the Authority can choose to replace the unacceptable portion of it with its own ideas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment proposed has the particular difficulty that it seeks to equate a code of practice with a statutory instrument whereas, by definition in this Bill, <Col N="2013" /> a code of practice is not a legal instrument. To convert codes of practice into legal instruments would remove the very flexibility which the provisions in section 30 provide.  Codes of practice differ from statutory regulations in that they can be varied and updated, reflecting changes in technology without having to undergo the legal processes necessary to make regulations.  For example, where new technology is introduced codes or practice can be amended swiftly.  Statutory codes of practice are, therefore, a contradiction in legal terms in the context of this Bill and I would ask the Deputy to withdraw the amendment.</P>
    <P>As regards the amendments to the existing section 31, there may be some misunderstanding here.  Voluntary codes of practice are perhaps more a feature of industrial relations machinery where procedural arrangements are agreed upon and set down.  Safety and health codes on the other hand are more likely to contain detailed technical recommendations as regards the operation of machinery, safe procedures at work, the avoidance of health problems and so forth.  The provisions of section 31 are clearly intended to give a recognition in the courts and a status to codes of practice which have been drawn up or approved by the Authority under section 30.</P>
    <P>The insertion of the word &ldquo;voluntary&rdquo; in several places as suggested would entirely defeat the purpose of the section and would remove from the Authority the strength of the initiative intended for it as regards drawing up and approving codes of practice on safety and health. It would be a retrograde step to relegate such matters entirely to voluntary codes.  Of their nature, and if they are to be effective, these codes must contain detailed technical information which the Authority can stand over.</P>

      <P> (a)  there will be no self inspection (including any possibility of conflict of interest) in agency agreements,</P>

      <P>The primary aim of the Barrington report was the creation of a central Authority for safety, health and welfare of workers but it appears from the Bill that the central Authority will not have a key role.  It appears that it will hand over some of this work to agencies and there is a like-lihood of a conflict of interest in that event.  Some Government Departments may feel they should carry out inspections within their Department rather than having officers of the Authority do so.</P>

      <P>The Barrington Commission suggested that we should look at agencies.  The overall impact of this amendment would be to unnecessarily restrict the Authority's role in arranging agency agreements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards subparagraph (a) of the amendment, the Authority will obviously be aware of the problems of self inspection. However, there may well be certain limited areas where self inspection is acceptable under specified conditions and <Col N="2015" /> it may well be in the general interest of all concerned that the Authority has the discretion to permit it although it is unlikely to arise.</P>
    <P>Subparagraph (b) would restrict the Authority's range of action. The Authority must be allowed to carry out its functions without being excessively inhibited by legal constraints. The Authority which is a tripartite body must be given as free a hand as possible. As regards subparagraph, (c), the training, qualifications and conditions of employment of inspectors is a matter best left to the competence of the Authority.</P>
    <P>In general, it should be left to the Authority to investigate the possibilities as regards enforcing agency arrangements which can subsequently be enshrined in the regulations, made by the Minister, which will be necessary to give effect to such arrangements.</P>
    <P>The agency would usually carry out its own inspections but it may arise that it would be better for administrative purposes if the work was handed over to another agency.  That is a matter for the Authority to examine.  The Deputy will accept that inspectors of the State carry out inspections and it would amount to duplication if the Authority sent out inspectors to do the same work.  It will be a matter for the Authority to decide on when to use such agency agreements.  In the section we are allowing them flexibility and we are not saying that we have to have agency agreements.</P>

I have no doubt that a conflict of interest will arise, particularly in regard to Government Departments.

      <P>The Authority is a tripartite body covering both sides of industry and its members will be aware if anybody is trying to hoodwink or side-track an investigation.  The Authority will only use an agency's report where an inspection is being carried out on a location on a regular basis.  I am thinking, for example, of a health inspector. Rather than the Authority sending an inspector to view a location that is covered by a health inspector they will be in a position to make an agency agreement with those inspectors.  It would avoid duplication.  I am not saying that the usual or the important work of the Authority will be given out to another agency.  We are not telling the Authority what areas they should or should not cover.  The power we are giving to the Authority was suggested by the Barrington Commission and the interim board.  I agree with Deputy O'Sullivan that there are some pitfalls in this and I expect that the new Authority will be alive to them, as the interim board were.  It is not intended that the Authority should delegate important matters to an agency.  I do not think we should say what the Authority should inspect.</P>

      <P>There is no greater recipe for pitfalls than the inspectors not reporting directly to the Authority.  The Authority, for instance, will not be able to intervene if one of its agents does not report back.  A delay in reporting back to the Authority could have serious consequences. I am referring to reporting, accident investigation and taking proceedings in law.  The Minister is creating a buffer between the Authority and the inspectorate and that is not in the best interests of all concerned.</P>

      <P>It will be the function of the Authority to decide whether to use an agency in the first instance.  The Authority will be very careful where there is a danger of a conflict of interest. For example, they will not give a local authority the role of checking on themselves but will send their inspectors. Unfortunately to implement this Act solely with the staff of the new agency would require massive numbers and this cannot be done overnight.  In certain areas if inspectors are going out every day or every week or every month there is little point in sending one of their own inspectors; but important vital work will not be given out to agencies.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 39:</P>
      <P>In page 30, lines 31 to 34, to delete subsection (6) and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(6)  An improvement notice shall take effect&mdash;</P>
      <P> (a)  if the notice so declares, immediately the notice is received by the person on whom it is served,</P>
      <P>(b)  in any other case&mdash;</P>
      <P> (i)  if no appeal is taken against the notice, on the expiration of the period during which such an appeal may be taken or the day specified in the notice as that on which it is to come into effect, whichever is the later; or</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(ii)  in case such an appeal is taken, on the day next following the day which the notice is confirmed on appeal or the appeal is <Col N="2018" /> withdrawn or the day specified in the notice as that on which it is to come into effect, whichever is the later.   </P>
    <P>(7)  The bringing of an appeal against a prohibition notice which is to take effect in accordance with subsection (6) shall not have the effect of suspending the operation of the notice: provided, however, that the appelant may apply to the Court to have the operation of the notice suspended until the appeal is disposed of and on such application, the Court may, if it thinks proper to do so, direct that the operation of the notice be suspended until the appeal is disposed of.&rdquo;. </P>
    <P>What I am asking for here is that the improvement notice should take immediate effect.  Serving an improvement notice which allows for a time lapse is not in the best interest of safety.  Where an improvement notice is served and there is a delay in its implementation it is possible that the threat that exists to life or limb might have been removed by the time we go through the whole procedure to ensure that the improvement notice is served.  For that reason I ask the Minister to accept this amendment. It is reasonable and in the interests of safety.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been looking at exactly what is involved in this section which deals with contravention of the relevant statutory provisions which do not give rise to risk or serious personal injury.  In the case of a risk of personal injury a prohibition notice would be in order, not an improvement notice.  An improvement notice is applicable in the case of some minor offence such as not displaying information and so on.  A prohibition notice would be applicable where there is risk of injury or damage.  Consequently it is not essential for the improvement notice to have immediate effect. There is a distinction between an improvement notice and a prohibition notice.  The range of responses in the Bill covering both are complementary to one another and appropriate to the conditions <Col N="2019" /> to which they are addressed.  The powers available to the inspector are fully adequate and for that reason I would ask the Deputy to accept this as it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have reservations about the improvement notice.  A danger that exists today may not exist next week, particularly on a construction site, for instance, an unsupported wall or a scaffold not properly erected.  It is possible that by the time an improvement notice comes into effect the danger has been removed.  I see no reason for not treating the improvement notice in a similar fashion to the prohibition notice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy made this point before.  Improvement notices cover minor offences and it would be unfair to an employer to issue improvement notices to apply immediately.  The improvement notice gives him time to get his act together.  The prohibition notice applies to situations where there is a definite danger and the employer must act straight away.  If inspectors were to act like demagogues and were to appear on sites every day pointing out minor things and issuing prohibition notices to have these things remedied immediately employers would probably start ignoring the inspectors and trying to find ways around them.  As I said, the improvement notice applies to minor infringements and the prohibition notice relates to situations of major risk, and the inspector has the power to decide whether to serve an improvement notice or a prohibition notice so the situation is adequately covered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would see this essentially as a preventive measure.  I assure the Minister that I am not adopting an anti-employer stance.  I want to ensure the safety of the employee who may be the victim of negligence on the part of the employer.  Applying an improvement notice straight away rather than going the whole way and applying a prohibition notice which might stop the work would be to everybody's advantage.  For that <Col N="2020" /> reason I fail to see why the Minister is so reluctant to accept my amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>We are just trying to be fair to the employer.  I can see that where there is a possibility of a roof caving in or a frame or scaffold falling down the Deputy would have a point; but we are talking about minor things.  The inspector is going around and sees things which should be right but are not likely to cause a danger to life and can issue an improvement notice.  The employer has two weeks within which to appeal.  It is giving the employer a chance to do that.  If all infringements were treated the same there would be a difficulty.  It would be unfair to treat the employer who has loose scaffolding all over the place and the employer who merely has not put up notices, for instance, in the same way. There must be degrees of punishment for abuses.  The improvement notice covers minor infringements noted by an inspector who might, for example, walk into Dáil Éireann and see that those fire doors that we were talking about this morning were open and issue an improvement notice; but in the case of the fire doors being non-existent there would be a prohibition notice.  There is a very clear distinction between the two.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a distinction in as much as a prohibition order essentially means that all work must stop but if an employer were to heed the warning to improve one could possibly avoid the situation where all work would have to come to a standstill.  The improvement notice is essentially a warning shot to the employer.  I do not understand why the Minister is so hesitant.  It would be in the employers' interest to obey the improvement notice immediately; there would be no man hours lost leading to financial loss, which could happen in the case of a prohibition order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many examples.  I am not in disagreement with what the Deputy wants, which is safe sites.  I am just trying to draw a distinction.  If they go into a factory, an <Col N="2021" /> office or any other building and treat everything at the same level, as Deputy Mitchell has said earlier, the people will start ignoring the laws and regulations. An improvement notice is issued in regard to detailed works that are not urgent.  I presume most of the time the employer would have to buy the materials necessary to comply with the improvement notice and he would be given time to do so.  If he does not agree he can appeal within 14 days, but the spirit of this legislation is such that he would comply with the regulations.</P>
      <P>For example, there could be a loose guard on a machine and the employer would need time to get the parts to fix it or there could be a faulty ventilator, rubbish lying around the site which could ultimately cause damage, or worn conveyor belts etc.  These are the types of examples where improvement notices would be issued and the employer would be given time to get his act together.</P>
      <P>If an employee is working under live electricity wires &mdash; for example, a JCB driver, he could be electrocuted if a prohibition notice is not issued and work is stopped straightaway.  We are not trying to make this difficult, but an inspector cannot just throw the whole book on an employer's table.  He would have to give the employer some time so that at least he will take him seriously.  That is the distinction, and I think it is reasonable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I could well understand the Minister's position if an improvement notice was dispensed by an inspector at regular intervals or if many notices issued per day, but that is not the case.  Most of the inspectors have a lot of experience and they do not issue improvement notices lightly.  We are talking about the prevention of accidents in many cases.  They can be prevented by giving a little more strength to the improvement notice procedure.  For that reason I would ask the Minister to accept my proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The concept of <Col N="2022" /> improvement notices is new in this legislation. The provision is there as a preventative measure to try to stop people from ignoring fairly simple matters, procedures which they might not otherwise do anything about.  If they do not comply with the improvement notice the inspector can take further action and the person can appeal within 14 days.  We hope that under this Bill, where both social partners are involved, the inspector, before issuing any notice, would try to explain to the employer, the foreman, the site supervisor, manager or whoever, that he should do certain work.  If that person had a bad track record and was not likely to do the work, he could then issue an improvement notice.  I have no time for unscrupulous employers who do not look after the safety of their workers but at the same time we have to be reasonably fair and 14 days is not much time to allow people to get their act together when something has been noticed for the first time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree.  The inspector has to be cautious and has obligations under the Bill.  I have no doubt that if he felt there was a danger, such as in the example I have given where a JCB driver is working under electric wires or digging foundations, he will not give 14 days.  In that case he will not issue an improvement notice but rather a prohibition notice.  If prohibition notices are issued all the time, as Deputy Mitchell has said we would bring the law into disrepute.  Enforcement procedures will not work if every time an employer slips up over something small he is treated as if he had done something dangerous.  I think the Deputy understands my point.</P>

      <P>I will explain what is involved.  What we are doing here is setting down a period of 48 hours during which the Revenue Commissioners may detain goods to enable the Authority to <Col N="2024" /> send an inspector to investigate.  I am satisfied the 48 hour period in this section is adequate.  If the inspector, on examining the goods, is of the opinion that the goods in question pose risks of serious personal injury to workers, he can use his powers under section 37 of the Bill which provides for prohibition notices.</P>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners are being requested to hold the goods for a period of 48 hours and the obligation is on the Authority to get an inspector out to examine those goods and to act accordingly. I do not think the Revenue Commissioners could hold them longer, anyway.

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Wyse for his remarks.  In amendment No. 44 we tried to concede the point raised in amendments Nos. 43 and 45.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The specific purpose of section 40 is to provide an indemnification for inspectors in respect of the discharge of their duties in a bona fide manner.  This is an important provision that will enable inspectors to engage in a greater degree of dialogue with both employers and workers on safety and health matters.  It is tied specifically to functions discharged in good faith and I regret that I cannot accept the proposed substitution of a new section.  The addition of the words &ldquo;prescribed by the Minister&rdquo; is unnecessary as by definition the relevant statutory provisions are legal instruments made under the responsibility of the Minister for Labour.  With regard to the additional points raised in the various amendments, it would be undesirable as regards indemnification to discriminate between inspectors attached to an enforcing agency and those working for the Authority.  All inspectors who will have functions under the legislation will be provided <Col N="2027" /> with training and instruction.  Provided they carry out their duty in a bona fide manner they should be covered by this indemnification section and I cannot therefore accept this amendment.</P>
    <P>The amendments in the name of the Minister are necessary on the one hand to bring terminology into line with that used in the other sections &mdash; using &ldquo;authorised&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;appointed&rdquo;&mdash; and on the other hand to provide that the Authority will indemnify any member of its staff who discharges his duty in relation to the enforcement of the relevant statutory provisions in a bona fide manner.  It may well be that staff other than inspectors will be involved in bona fide communications or decisions on safety and health matters.  If they are to be effective they all will require to be indemnified against legal actions.</P>
    <P>Section 61 provides for immunity for the Authority or an enforcing agency against actions arising from the failure to perform or comply with any of the functions imposed on it.  It would not be appropriate to provide for total immunity relating to the actions of the Authority or any of its staff as proposed by Deputy O'Sullivan in amendment No. 87.  Neither is immunity for the Minister necessary under the Bill.</P>
    <P>As regards references in amendment No. 87 to &ldquo;any officer or servant&rdquo;, an inspector or other staff member of the Authority or enforcing agency is already protected by section 40, which provides for their indemnification.  In addition the provisions in section 37 as regards appeals against prohibition notices will have a part to play in this matter.  Employers can have recourse to the court under this section if they want to challenge the operaction of a prohibition notice.  The improvements I proposed with regard to section 61 under amendment No. 86a will help to alleviate much of the Deputy's concern regarding immunity in respect of other loss, and this satisfies Deputy Wyse's amendments.  I therefore ask the Deputies to withdraw their amendments and accept amendments, Nos. 44, 46 and 86a which cover the points raised.</P>

      <P>I find it difficult to accept the Minister's explanation that ample cover is being provided for the inspectors.  If anything is likely to under-mine the Bill it is the issue of the indemnification of inspectors.  If the inspectors are not properly indemnified there will be a reluctance on their part to apply the full rigours of the law where it is required.  For that reason I will be calling for a vote on the section.  If the Minister is not prepared to accept that, we will be sending inspectors out who could very well be intimidated by virtue of the fact that they could be held responsible for closing down a firm and for the subsequent loss of earnings.</P>

      <P>What would happen in this case is that if the inspectors act in a bona fide manner under the Act, they are fully indemnified.  We cannot give a blanket indemnification.  If an inspector acts in a manner that is not within the Acts, he would have to report and explain himself to the Authority.  However, if the inspector acts in a bona fide manner, he could still make a mistake, but he is still totally indemnified.  It is only in a case where an inspector acts in a way that is clearly irresponsible, and it is then a matter for the Authority to say that he acted irresponsibly.  The weight of power is with him, the wording is &ldquo;shall&rdquo; and the Authority would have to say that inspector A had acted in a non bona fide manner but this is an unlikely occurrence. It is a possibility and I do not think we could give a total blanket indemnity because we would be asking the taxpayer to cover the risk of a huge case where an inspector totally unreasonably and irresponsibly closed down a firm on a prohibition notice without regard to the law. This might never happen but if the inspector acts in a bona fide way he is fully indemnified.</P>

      <P>On the board of the Authority you have essentially two vested interests and it is reasonable to say that both sides will be looking after their own interests.  Undue pressure could be brought to bear on an inspector <Col N="2029" /> from that source, unless he is fully indemnified. I would like to know how many cases have been established &mdash; perhaps it us unfair to ask this question &mdash; and reported to his Department where an inspector has acted improperly in the enforcement of the law.  I do not think there is a precedent, that it has ever been established that an inspector was guilty of acting in an improper manner.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I gather there is none. Our present position on indemnification is the same as that in Britain.  If our inspectors act properly and in a bona fide manner they have the power of the Authority and the power of the law.  With regard to the Deputy's point on members of the Authority, an inspector will be acting under his powers in this Act and in regulations and in the code of practices provided in section 30.  Although it could happen, it is unlikely that that will cause a difficulty, because in law we cannot give a blanket indemnification to a person who could act irresponsibly.</P>

      <P>Up to now, inspectors have demonstrated that they are extremely responsible.  No charge has ever been brought against them.  I fail to see why the Minister is not prepared to accept my amendment.  When inspectors were answerable to the Minister and to the Department they at least had more independence than they will now have.  I <Col N="2030" /> am not suggesting that they would act improperly but there are two sets of people over them &mdash; they are the social partners, who represent a vested interest on either side, the workers on one side and the employers on the other.  It is reasonable to assume that at some stage pressure could be brought to bear on an inspector when it would not be in the best interests of safety.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Sullivan has a point.  Pressure could be brought to bear on the inspector, or an inspector may not be certain of the support of his superiors should he get into dodgy territory carrying out his duties.  If an inspector lacks confidence in the support of his superiors he may be less than enthusiastic or over-careful thus becoming less effective in his job.  What Deputy O'Sullivan is suggesting seems to be largely covered in section 40 as it stands, but in the light of Deputy O'Sullivan's point will the Minister in the Seanad if he has not an opportunity to do so today, give consideration to what is a valid point?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Wyse but the Minister's and Deputy O'Sullivan's points are not mutually exclusive.  No agent of the State should be insured against wrongdoing.  That is not what Deputy O'Sullivan is arguing for.  His point is that pressure could be put on an inspector not to perform his duties.  This pressure might not come from his superiors by way of any act, but it could be by way of the general aura of confidence.  Many of us have had the experience of discharging our duties to <Col N="2031" /> the best of our abilities only to be let down later by our superiors.  Deputy O'Sullivan's is a valid point.  We cannot afford to have inspectors who are not absolutely confident that they will get support doing their duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not disagree with Deputy Mitchell.  The inspectors received detailed training and instruction.  Under section 40 where the Authority or enforcing agent are satisfied that an inspector appointed by them has discharged his duties in relation to the enforcement of the relative statutory provisions in a bona fide manner, they shall indemnify the inspector against all actions or claims arising in respect of the discharge of his duties.  That is clear.  An inspector could make a mistake but if he is acting in a bona fide manner he is fully indemnified under the law.  However, we cannot give a blanket indemnity to an inspector who could do anything which could result in massive claims.  They have a very important job which requires a great deal of responsibility but there could be massive claims against the taxpayer.  In this case we could not give a blanket indemnity but if an inspector is acting in a bona fide manner he is fully covered.</P>

We are talking about the same person who, when he goes into the employment of the Authority, will not enjoy the same conditions of employment.  That will affect his judgment.  Human nature being what it is, the inspector will be subject to pressures to which he was not subject in the past.  Despite the fact that the inspector had total cover from the Department by virtue of the fact that he was a civil servant, he did not abuse his position in the past.  I fail to see why the Minister is so reluctant in this case because the pressure will increase by virtue of the fact that two conflicting interests will constitute membership of the Authority.</P>

I do not accept that the Authority responsible for safety and health will be in there bouncing the ball off one another.  I do not think that is what the social partners would do under this legislation.  That is not the point.  The point is that one can only indemnify an individual who acts in a bona fide manner under the rules and regulations under which they are bound to work.  They are trained and experienced people and they have proved that beyond all doubt.  To cover them outside of that is something&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>An inspector now has far more powers than he had under the 1980 Act.  An inspector would require it to be written in law that if he acts in a bona fide manner he will be fully indemnified. I do not visualise &mdash; and nothing has happened since 1955 which is 34 years ago &mdash; inspectors making errors; it is only in case somebody goes off in a totally irresponsible fashion.  It is unlikely to happen, but I am advised that that has to be covered.  If somebody does not act in a bona fide manner a blanket indemnity under this law cannot be given regardless of what inspector he works with and it is not saying he has to comply with the law. If he makes an error of judgment and if he has a bona fide reason he is covered. It is difficult to see why he would want a blanket indemnity &mdash; and I hope it would never happen.  Why should he be covered if he goes off and acts in a totally irresponsible manner?  Some responsibility must rest with the inspector as with every-one else.  He cannot expect to be able to go off and act totally irresponsibly and expect the State and the taxpayer to clear up the legal problems that would ensue. I do not believe that will ever happen. <Col N="2034" /> That is an academic argument.  It has not happened in 34 years but what we are saying is that if an inspector acts in a bona fide manner he is totally indemnified under the Act.</P>

Therefore there could be a situation where one or other of the representatives on either side could say: &ldquo;In my opinion, this inspector behaved improperly&rdquo;.

      <P>There is not and it will not arise now because the inspectors now have far greater powers under this Act than they had before.  For their protection they would want it written down.  Previously it was the understanding and it was the law, but it was not written into the Act.  If I did not insert this section that an inspector is indemnified, then the inspector would be very worried going out.  It is in his interest and for his protection that section 40 is written in to cover his functions and the regulations under which he is working.  The inspector would want to see that input.  In putting that in I cannot cover the position that at some future date some inspector will, <Col N="2036" /> because he is fully indemnified, go off and play havoc.  I do not think any of us in this House could ask that that be done because we would end up involved in libel actions, court actions and huge amounts of compensation when the taxpayer would be forced to pay for something for which an individual or perhap some pressure group, had lobbied.  I am trying to ensure that all the inspectors and the enforcement agencies who will work on the implementation of this Bill are given full indemnification where they act in a bona fide manner.

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>This section, which is the last section of this Part of the Bill, deals with enforcement.  I want to emphasise again the importance of enforcement. We have no doubt whatever about the commitment of the Department of Labour and of the proposed Authority to this area.  However, like everything else, this will be affected by the resources made available.  The big bad wolf of the Department of Finance always lurks in the background.  I am glad to see the Taoiseach present.  I want to say in his presence what I said earlier.  We are enacting a great deal of legislation which subsequently is not enforced.  Some of this non-enforcement is actually costing the State money &mdash; as in the case of the Revenue Commissioners not having the staff to pursue the misuse of red diesel, the non-enforcement of the road transport laws, etc.  It would pay us to hire a few additional inspectors but because of the embargoes of recent years we are not enforcing the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I emphasise the need for the Government to realise that if we enact legislation we should provide the necessary resources.  By not doing so, the State is losing money.  Even if money were not to be saved by enforcement, if we enact <Col N="2039" /> legislation we have a duty to enforce it. Otherwise we should not pass legislation and should repeal the legislation which has already been proved unsuccessful because of non-enforcement.  Road transport and road traffic law are two examples.  I could name several other areas where legislation is not being enforced.  The situation in this country is so bad that there is almost a need for a Minister for Law Enforcement to be appointed for about a year to sort many things out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>Enforcement would appear to be the all important matter, but the statistics with regard to accidents at work in the agricultural sector are alarming.  There are three farming deaths for every fatality in industry, and non-fatal injuries are comparable with those in industry, even though there are far fewer employed in the agricultural industry. Forestry is another critical area and the area of transport law which was mentioned by the previous speaker.  The number of accidents in the forestry area are certainly appalling.  I should like to ask the enforcing body who starts the procedures for enforcement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>On Deputy Mitchell's question, I have already stated that I agree with him.  With the resources initially available we will have to prioritise the areas that are most important, act on them and try to implement the legislation properly.  If the duties and very important functions as set down in this Bill are not properly dealt with, the whole philosophy behind the Bill will be lost. There are some very important provisions which cover the point raised by Deputy Sherlock because every firm will have to have a safety plan which covers all workers.  If the Authority and the agency pursue their work and functions properly this legislation could be extremely successful and I hope that will be the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of construction, factory and forestry workers and workers involved in dangerous chemicals, separate regulations within the framework of the Bill <Col N="2040" /> will apply.  In the case of forestry workers, detailed regulations have been worked out by the Authority and their officials with both sides of that industry and the inspectorate will enforce the regulations. Implementing safety and health regulations is like implementing the law, you cannot have a garda on every corner and at every crossroads.  If management and workers are not interested in their own safety it will be very hard to enforce regulations.  We must get to a position where everybody thinks about safety and health.  There are good reasons for doing so and it is not a nebulous concept.  I see statistics in regard to accidents which caused many deaths, misery, hardship and medical and insurance costs.  Safety and health affect everything and that is why this legislation is so important.</P>

      <P>If they see fit to do so for the purposes of facilitating the exercise or performance by the Authority or an enforcing agency or an inspector of the Authority or of an enforcing agency of any of the powers or duties exercised by them under any of the relevant statutory provisions, the Revenue Commissioners may authorise the disclosure to the Authority or to an enforcing agency or an inspector of the Authority... </P>
      <P>I cannot say that the Revenue Commissioners &ldquo;shall&rdquo; authorise the disclosure to the Authority.  The Revenue Commissioners are independent although they are associated with the Department of Finance.  I am advised that it is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners to authorise disclosure to the Authority or an enforcing agency. However, the Revenue Commissioners might be reluctant to be unhelpful, their view is that they will be helpful in disclosing information.  Of course it may be the case that the Revenue Commissioners may not always wish to disclose information, for many reasons.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me sound a word of caution.  In referring to the words &ldquo;in such manner as it thinks fit&rdquo;, there is the possibility of abuse in this area.  I admit that I have succeeded in having at least part of my amendment incorporated into the section but I would much prefer if the Minister would agree to delete&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Reports of this nature could contain very sensitive information and it would be for the Authority to decide whether to make a report public.  In some cases it may be inappropriate to publish a special report.  In order to maintain confidence between an inspectorate and an employer it is not the norm to make public such reports provided for under other legislation.  If the inspectorate can get an employer to implement the findings of a report and are able to monitor the way in which the employer implements those findings they are satisfied with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I can accept the Minister's explanation but I still have to sound a word of caution.  There is the possibility of abuse in this area.  I would much prefer if the Minister agreed to insert a new section into the Bill which would deal specifically with sensitive information contained in a report which, if published, would be likely to affect the performance of an enterprise or the character or welfare of a person.  It would be far more preferable to insert a new section rather than to maintain the proposed terminology.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>We are talking here <Col N="2044" /> about the making public of special reports or parts of special reports.  We wish to leave it up to the Authority to decide on whether a report should be made public but it is possible that they may decide to make part of the report public.  I am advised that sections of these reports could be included in the annual report.  I am also aware that some of the reports issued at present are confidential, and could contain the findings of a very detailed examination on the way in which an enterprise is run and information on what equipment is used and on the age of such equipment.  I am sure this information would be of use to a person involved in a commercial enterprise.  It would have been the aim of the inspectorate to try to remedy a fault and most good companies make an effort to help them achieve that aim.  If they were to fail to do so, difficulties would arise.  While agreeing to insert the words &ldquo;within a reasonable time&rdquo; I still wish to maintain this flexibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that the Minister wishes to maintain flexibility, however the Authority would be given a free rein in that they would be able to withhold reports.  I would be prepared to ask some of my colleagues in the Seanad to sponsor an amendment there which would meet the points made by the Minister in regard to confidentiality.  Rather than maintaining the very loose wording contained in the section &mdash; it is like saying to a jarvey &ldquo;I will leave it up to yourself&rdquo; when asking what the fare will be&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>In fairness I do not think that it amounts to the same thing.  We are talking here about making public special reports.  If a special report is to be made public within a reasonable period it is only fair that the Authority be allowed to decide in what way it should be published.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are in agreement in regard to the making available of the report within a reasonable period but I believe that the words &ldquo;as it thinks fit&rdquo; are very vague.  It is likely that many <Col N="2045" /> problems will arise in the future.  I would much prefer if the Minister agreed to insert a new subsection into the section. I am sure there are precedents for such a move.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Practically no special report is made public.  I recall that the last big one issued, the Cork one, which both of the Deputies would have an interest in, has not been made public. The reason for this is that the report contains a lot of technical data and other information not connected with the accident.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>

I will repeat once more that there is the possibility of abuse in this area.  I would prefer if the Minister agreed to insert a new subsection.  We are not in disagreement over the principle but rather over the method.  The wording is extremely loose.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>This subsection is aimed at avoiding duplication in investigations or inquiries.  Under separate legislation, for example, section 465 of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, and section 60 of the Air Navigation and Transport Act, 1936, the Minister for Tourism and Transport <Col N="2046" /> has power to direct investigations into air or rail accidents and the Minister for the Marine has power to direct investigations into accidents at sea.  The provisions in the Bill do not rule out an investigation or inquiry by the Authority or involvement by the Authority in an investigation or inquiry into an air, rail or sea accident. Therefore both of the matters raised by the Deputy are covered in other legislation. The amendment aims to avoid duplication but the provisions do not rule out the possibility of the Authority being actively involved in any such inquiry.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the Deputies' concern that an adequate level of fines be provided for under the Bill.  It is important, however, that the possibility of summary proceedings in the District Court be written in.  Summary proceedings under the Bill would be taken by the Authority or enforcing agencies.  Proceedings on indictment would be taken by the DPP if necessary on foot of an approach to him by the Authority or an enforcing agency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In taking proceedings a number of <Col N="2048" /> important factors would have to be taken into account including (1) the gravity of the matter which gave rise to the proceedings and (2) the need to avoid the higher level of costs which would arise in relation to less serious contraventions if proceedings could be taken only in the higher courts.  In the terms of District Court prosecutions the court rules are that the maximum fine which can be imposed is currently £1,000 as provided for in the Bill in respect of summary proceedings. I feel that the facility of taking summary proceedings in the District Court should remain and will be valuable to the Authority as regards many offences which can arise under the Bill even though the fine is limited to £1,000.</P>
    <P>The Deputies will see when we come to amendment No. 56 that I propose to make a change as regards the level of fine on indictment which will give the courts discretion to set as large a fine as they think appropriate in the case of serious offences.  Therefore, I ask the Deputies to withdraw these amendments under discussion.</P>
    <P>The aim of these amendments in the name of Deputy O'Sullivan and Deputies of The Workers' Party is to seek not to have a maximum for more serious offences.  In later amendments I have provided for that.  For small offences they will go into the District Court with a fine of a maximum of £1,000.  We talked about these types of things earlier in regard to improvement notices and providing a deterrent.</P>
    <P>On more serious offences the Authority or enforcing agency could bring the offence to the Circuit Court or a higher court as necessary and the upper limit for the fines would be removed in that case. The matter has to be seen in relation to the later amendments but we are discussing it at this stage and I concede the point.</P>

      <P>The Minister made a comparison between the District Court and Circuit Court.  I understand the problem with the District Court is that cases tried there cannot be taken as a precedent <Col N="2049" /> whereas in Circuit Court cases they can. What is the position?</P>

      <P>In our present position it is not creating a difficulty for us.  If we were to take minor cases to other than the District Court it would create substantial expense.  In a case of serious injury we would consider it necessary to go to a higher court and we would go to the Circuit Court or a higher court under this Bill.  Most of the smaller cases would be District Court cases.  It is not a difficulty in the procedure at present operated and as it will be operated under this Bill.</P>

      <P>I accept that the Minister has been co-operative and receptive generally, but he is reluctant to consider increasing the level of fines in this area. Some of the charges will be against firms which have quite a substantial budget, and £10,000 would be petty cash to some of them, whereas somebody who is injured as a result of negligence could be permanently incapacitated and would <Col N="2050" /> bear the scars for the rest of his or her life.</P>

      <P>In a case like that we would go to the Circuit Court.  I agree that it would not be appropriate to deal with a serious injury case in the District Court.  Many of the cases in the District Court concern improvement notices and warnings.  I agree with the Deputy's suggestion about the more serious cases and that is why in later amendments we increase the upper limit.  I hold the view Deputy Mitchell has been putting forward for weeks in this debate, that you have to be seen to be implementing the legislation and that it will be necessary for the Authority at an early date in some of these cases to go to a higher court.  In the agricultural area there is a death a week.  These are fairly serious cases which would be going to the Circuit Court and the higher courts.</P>

      <P>All these fines relate not to breaches of the law based on actual risks to workers or accidents or diseases but to the administrative arrangements under the legislative provisions in question, such as sending in notifications of accidents, diseases, occupation of premises, defacement of posters and notices and such matters.  It would be inappropriate to set the fines in respect of these matters at the same levels as the fines which relate to injury to workers. From a legal viewpoint it is not possible to provide in advance for increases in fines and from time to time it may be necessary in the light of changes in money values to seek Oireachtas approval for necessary increases.  The fines incorporated in section 58 represent an updating of the fines which were last brought up to date in the Safety in Industry Act, 1980.  We discussed this matter at length earlier today.  Minor offences cannot be correlated to the more serious offences which would arise.  We are dealing here with administrative arrangements which have not been followed.  The amount of money involved is not great but from experience we have learned that the majority of employers do not like the idea of being prosecuted.  The amount of the fine is not necessarily what matters but the harassment and embarrassment of a court case.  What the Deputy has suggested would be unjust.  All employers and workers are covered under the Bill and if we adopted the Deputy's suggestion we would be insisting on substantial fines being imposed for minor offences. We would be imposing big fines on the owners of small shops, small industries and small offices and that would be wrong.  We are talking about minor <Col N="2055" /> infringements and for those I do not think it is necessary to stipulate large fines.  I should like to ask the Deputies to withdraw their amendments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to clarify the position in regard to this.  I said I would meet the points referred to by the Deputies in regard to offences where serious injuries occur.  I am conceding that where an employer is prosecuted before the Circuit Court for a serious infringement there will not be an upper limit on the fine but in the cases dealt with in the amendments we could be talking about a person forgetting to send in a report, a person who does not erect a poster or whose poster is defaced.  In the main we are talking about small concerns and I do not think it is reasonable to suggest that we should impose a fine of £1,000 for such minor infringements.  I agree with the Deputies' suggestions where injuries are involved but in the case under discussion we would be hitting small business concerns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is unlikely that small shopkeepers would be prosecuted under the Factories Act, 1955.  What we are talking about are businesses that are covered by that Act and by the Mines and Quarries Act.  We are concerned about the high risk areas and if there is negligence at any level it should be punished.  Some of the fines stipulated are derisory and will not force any person to comply with the law.  For breaches of the factories Act we should be talking about a fine of £1,000 and not a fine of £25 or £150.  The Minister may not agree with what the Labour Party and The Workers' Party are suggesting but I am sure he will accept that the existing fines are ridiculous.  We could be talking about a breach of regulations that might lead to <Col N="2056" /> a loss of life or serious injury.  If we fall down in this area our efforts today will have been wasted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will note that I removed the £15,000 maximum fine in the case of injuries.  There is a lot of merit in providing for prosecutions under these sections because firms who will not be anxious to have reports of their cases published in the newspapers will be careful to comply with the regulations.  I accept that some industries will not. However, we are talking about offences of omission or administrative offences rather than people disregarding the law. One of the benefits of the Bill will be to reduce insurance costs.  If there is a greater awareness about safety and health in the workplace, as I believe there will be when we get the unions and the Federated Union of Employers working on this, I am sure insurance costs will fall. The insurance industry have made that clear.</P>
      <P>I would be unhappy to have large fines for minor offences.  However, if it is considered that the fines are too low at a later date they can be reviewed.  I do not think inspectors would be happy to have to deal with small firms if the fines are to be as suggested by the Deputies.  They have adequate powers to deal with the big companies.  It is not the amount of the fine that will be the deterrent but the bringing of the company to court.  I have no doubt that some companies would not be too concerned if the fine was as suggested by the Deputies but they would have second thoughts if they knew that a report of their court case would be published in the newspapers.</P>

In the course of my Second Stage contribution I called for more co-operation between workers and employers to ensure greater safety at work.  I was nervous about the fact that we could be inflicting substantial costs on small industries who are obliged to carry out renovations to comply with the provisions of the Bill.  We should be careful not to <Col N="2057" /> inflict any unnecessary costs on the many small industries who are finding it difficult to survive.

      <P>Some have increased from £5 to £300.  I am not making the point that the money value is high; it may be to a small businessman.  It is really a deterrent to get them to comply with obligations.  There is one matter I should have mentioned.  In the case of an inspector checking out an industry and finding that they were in breach by not reporting an accident, he could impose a minor fine but we will be pursuing larger cases in the courts.  A person might not be involved in a serious offence but if there were other breaches he would not get away with them.  The only person paying this fine is someone with administrative breaches.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fines have been looked at.  It could be argued that they should be another £20 or £30.  If I were to look at it again tomorrow I might say that they should be £10 or £20 more.  These are the rates <Col N="2058" /> that have been achieved and we are talking about ommissions and not serious offences.  I am totally in agreement with the Deputy in pursuing the more serious offences with great vigour.  I ask that these small ones be left as they are.</P>

On the question of employee participation I decided as a first step that participation of workers in the affairs of the Authority should be at sub-board level.  The Worker (Participation in State Enterprises) Act, 1988, provides for the appointment of an appropriate officer in the State enterprise who will have responsibilities in relation to the establishment of sub-board participation arrangements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sub-board participation arrangements can be initiated by one application from the trade union or similar body; petitioned by an employee majority; or by a ballot where the application must be signed by at least 15 per cent of the employees and submitted to the appropriate officer.  The provisions for agreement between State enterprises and the employees in respect of sub-board participatory arrangements must include regular exchange of views, information given in good time to the employees and dissemination of information to all employees.  The Act also provides for the review, amendment, replacement or winding up of the participative agreement. I propose to take under review the <Col N="2060" /> operations of board participative structures. In these circumstances I would ask for the withdrawal of the amendments.</P>

      <P>The Minister may say that he is following the recommendation, but on another section he chooses to ignore them.  There is a lack of consistency here regarding the vesting of power.  If I thought there was a uniform approach I would accept this without reservation.</P>
      <P>Once again there has been a drift away from industrial democracy in as much as the Minister is now offering to the employees representation at sub-board level and this has become the pattern. With all due respects to the Minister, he has created a precedent in that with regard to other bodies which he has set up the representation of trade unions is at sub-board level and this is not a welcome development.  We should be going in the opposite direction in respect of industrial relations.  To offer to staff members representation below board level is a development which I would like to see terminated but unfortunately the Minister is not prepared to go down that road.</P>

      <P>In relation to FÁS, there are worker directors on the board. Because it was an established practice I decided to put workers directors on that board.  Last year we brought in the Worker Participation Bill which gives effect to worker participation at sub-board level in 60 or 70 different organisations. My reason for doing so in this case is that in the first instance both social partners would be on the board, thus creating a balance.  There would be three members on the board, with the majority on the side of the social partners.  There would be three trade union representatives on the board.  Some of the amendments proposed two worker directors in addition to that, which would mean there would be five worker directors, five union representatives, and only three employers representatives.  The Barrington Commission recommended that there be a balance and therefore I am putting three workers on the board <Col N="2061" /> and three employers, out of a total of ten.  That clearly is a good balance.</P>
      <P>The individual workers in the firm should be involved in worker participation from day one.  I will move the orders to designate that there will be sub-board structures and worker participation from day one.  I am giving that commitment now to Deputy Sherlock and Deputy O'Sullivan who raised this issue.  As part of the composition of the board there will be three trade union representatives from day one and that should not be forgotten.</P>

      <P>The Minister is once again using this device of representation at sub-board level.  Having discussed at length the vulnerability of inspectors who are now working for the Authority and whether or not they behaved in a bona fide manner, it is absolutely important that there is worker representation at board level rather than at sub-board level to ensure that no decisions are taken regarding the employees that they do not know about.  Never before has there been a greater need for this.  I do not accept that simply because, in the Worker Participation Bill and other Bills, the Minister offered representation at sub-board level, this should necessarily be taken as a precedent.  There is a special case to be made regarding the inspectors in particular because under the Authority as distinct from the Department they are particularly vulnerable.  For that reason there is need for some representation at board level rather than at sub-board level.</P>

There is no point in enacting legislation in this House under the heading of safety, health and welfare at work and setting up a board for that purpose unless there is representation at sub-board level.  Participation by workers and employers together would be more effective.  I welcome that commitment by the Minister and we will certainly be asking him to <Col N="2062" /> implement that once the legislation is enacted.</P>

      <P>Deputy Fitzgerald agreed to share his time with me.  The Bill before the House, if passed into law, will have the effect of removing from vocational education committees the power of appointing teachers and will vest their powers in the Commissioners of Local Appointments.  Having digested Deputy Birmingham's contribution, I must congratulate him on his silken barristerial skills which managed, I believe, to cover up, or almost cover up, the real reason that this Bill was introduced.  If things were the same as they were prior to 1985 we would not have this Bill before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of his speech, Deputy Birmingham managed to insult and cast aspersions on the integrity of chief executive officers, of Department officials and <Col N="2066" /> councillors, Fine Gael councillors included.  He has made the innuendo that they were not fit people to select teachers who, over the years, have played a vital part in educating our students in the vocational sector.  Students from the vocational sector now hold positions of the highest rank in all disciplines in our society.  The Deputy has cast a slight on the teachers who were selected by county councillors of all hues and by other persons who were not county councillors on the selection committees.  These teachers were efficient and brought the students to the high standards they attained.  I think Deputy Birmingham should apologise for insulting these excellent teachers, the formers of students' characters.  I cannot understand why he should have found it necessary to insult these people.</P>
    <P>In the few minutes available to me I would like to refer to what I believe is behind the Bill &mdash; the philosophy, in Fine Gael especially, of centralisation.  Fine Gael have a philosophy to centralise everything in Dublin.  We have seen this happening in all walks of Government and in the period of the last Coalition it was evident that all steps that had been taken by the previous administration to decentralise Government Departments were rolled backwards.  Thankfully, the plans that were in force for those four and a half years of Coalition Government have been scrapped and we now see the process of decentralisation once again.</P>
    <P>I believe it is important that people who appoint teachers should select persons with an affinity for the pupils and the area in which they teach.  The danger of centralised appointments is that the interviewers will not have the necessary local knowledge to match the candidates with the particular job on offer.  This issue raises questions about democracy and education.  I am glad to note that the Minister in her contribution last Tuesday night referred in detail to this very important issue within education.</P>
    <P>Deputy Birmingham was concerned with a lack of public accountability but the Minister rightly pointed out that the democratic process is very much at work <Col N="2067" /> at a local level within vocational education committees.  Vocational education committees are subcommittees of the local authorities and are made up of elected members, elected by and accountable to the public.  The nominees to the committees are local authority nominees.  I do not know of any more ideal way to exercise local democracy. The connection between education and democracy was emphasised in the previous Government's <i>Programme for Action in Education 1984-1987</i> as one of its basic underlying principles.  The action programme called for delegation of responsibility and authority, and I quote &ldquo;with a view to achieving a full partnership between all the interests involved&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, the posts in question are of crucial importance for the educational careers of young people and it is appropriate that the Dáil should examine the existing procedures for making appointments. However, I believe that the road promulgated in this Bill is not the correct one.</P>

      <P>I am glad to support the Bill.  I congratulate Deputy Birmingham for bringing the issue before the House and I congratulate the Minister for her willingness to look at the issue and take on board, if not the detail, the general thrust of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a background in the education system both as a pupil and as a teacher. I also spent six years as a member of the City of Dublin VEC, the largest vocational education committee in the country.  The Dublin VEC have an over-whelming number of constituent schools, colleges and various background committees which examined areas such as curricular activity, sport etc. and did it extremely well.  I enjoyed those six years immensely and I gained a great respect for the people involved: for the democratic nature of the vocational education system and for the commitment of the people appointed to serve on a voluntary basis on the committees.  Becusue of the enormous size of the City of Dublin <Col N="2068" /> system and also because those were times when school numbers and staffing levels were expanding in the steady fashion we had come to expect &mdash; I am referring to the years 1979-85 but then the local elections resulted in a clean sweep and left Fine Gael with one representative on the Dublin Vocational Education Committee &mdash; I was called on more times than I could be present to sit on interview boards for college appointments from cleaning staff right through to senior lecturing positions.  I may not remember very precisely but I think the board comprised of two or three members of the vocational education committee, an inspector &mdash; or a slightly different composition depending on the level &mdash; and the school principal acting as an adviser. Things were allowed change very rapidly in the interim without adequate comment. I enjoyed that work.  It was interesting to get involved and experience interviews from the other side.  I am sure if I had to face an interview board, depending on my fortunes in this House and with the public, what I learned would have been very valuable to me.  I learned a great deal and I can see why I did not do as well as I might have liked earlier in my career.  It was really an amateur activity deciding on very important issues, deciding on the staff at all the various levels in schools and colleges.</P>
    <P>In Dublin every July and August there were interview boards running constantly to deal with the secretarial panels, teaching panels, temporary panels and lectureships that had to be set up.  It was a mammoth task.  To do it, were members of the board who were there on a voluntary basis, many with other occupations and very many of whom could not be available regularly or only occasionally.  It was extremely difficult to organise in that way, trying to find spare time from persons with other commitments. What tended to happen was that the people who made up the board tended to be the retired members who could make themselves available regularly. That was very nice for them but it was not necessarily the best profile for an interview board.  The persons involved <Col N="2069" /> became quite experienced but these were publicly known figures and as it became obvious that there was almost always a number of people who were on every board, there was always the danger that people would try to influence the decision.  To the eternal credit of all the interview boards in which I dealt, the decisions were made on a very valid basis. However the structure was ad hoc, and non-professional with many inadequacies and problems.</P>
    <P>At the very minimum, if one was not talking about an ideal situation where one had trained people involved on a professional basis, we were giving an enormous administrative task to the administrative officers in the committee who were struggling to manage and develop a very large and important educational system.  They had to take great quantities of time off from their important developmental work in trying to find out if X member of the committee could be available for half a day here or a week there.  It was a very unprofessional system.  The system was not just unprofessional but it took up immense quantities of time of very senior administrative personnel in the vocational education committees who should have been looking at the very many other issues which needed to be considered by the system.</P>
    <P>I am glad that this matter was raised here in the House, that Deputy Birmingham has brought it to the House and that the Minister has responded with openness and a willingness to at least look at the problem.  I gather that Deputy Birmingham will be making his views known in relation to the Minister's approach when he replies later this evening.</P>
    <P>Going on my experience in the City of Dublin there is a great need for the energy of the administrators of the City of Dublin VEC to look at the great structure, the many fine colleges and schools they have, and plan for their future.  In the last ten or 12 years we have had the emergence and development of the Dublin Institute of Technology, an organisation with great potential and making a great contribution.  There are <Col N="2070" /> some wonderful people in it, many of whom have carved out names for themselves in education and in research here and abroad, but they are tied by the most unsuitable historic structure in that this institute operates essentially still as if they were second level schools with a principal system and a totally unsuitable system of organisation for the way in which the colleges developed, where they have become third level institutes and colleges. They need to have their own resources freed and they need an input from the Minister.  At the announcement of the university status for the NIHE the Minister referred to the Dublin Institute of Technology and other colleges.  This is extremely important.  They are a resource that has not been fully exploited and developed and they could benefit from reorganisation whether within or outside the City of Dublin VEC structure. Because of the weight of history making it is extremely difficult for them to free their structures, an input from outside could be immensely valuable in sending them on the road into the 21st century in a better position to realise their full potential. I am referring to the various colleges that I know so well each of which has its own definitive niche in education in Dublin in particular &mdash; Bolton Street and Kevin Street Colleges of Technology, the College of Catering, Rathmines Senior College and the College of Marketing and Design.  Each of these institutes has developed its own profile and they are keen to emerge as a recognisable joint institute in even more clear form than they have achieved to date.  At the moment they are tied by resource problems and by the fact that so much of the time of those who should be planning these issues is caught up in matters such as the Bill refers to.</P>
    <P>These colleges are particularly important because the VECs in Dublin, particularly in the third level area, are the colleges that have proved to be most open to working class children.  Because of the links they have with the second level schools it seems to be easier for working <Col N="2071" /> class children with perhaps less of a background of involvement in third level education to move from a second level vocational school into a third level school, if only because at second level prize giving days and special days that occur throughout the year in post primary schools members of the City of Dublin VEC attend and invite them to consider third level education, and former past pupils who had succeeded would appear in their year book and so on.  There is that important link between the working class areas of Dublin, where the vocational education second level schools tend to be largely placed, and the third level vocational system.  That is something very precious and important.  No matter what development takes place in the Dublin Institute of Technology and in the City of Dublin VEC, that it an important link that should not be broken to achieve some gain in terms of status of a less substantial kind.</P>
    <P>We have an enormous problem in relation to the participation of working class children.  I suppose working class is the term &mdash; it is an odd term &mdash; but at least it is the one which everybody comprehends so I will continue to use it, even though it is somewhat imprecise. Children from very large sections of my constituency turn up very infrequently at third level colleges.  This can be broken down to some degree by participation in the vocational schools in Dublin.  I can speak particularly for the schools in my own constituency &mdash; Scoil Íde and Coláis-te Eoin in Finglas West and Whitehall House and Plunkett School in the Santry-Whitehall area.  The two schools in the Finglas area in particular form a bridge for the pupils from my area to find their way into third level, although not in adequate numbers or in numbers we would like.  That is a very important link and a very important bridge which should be preserved and maintained regardless of what develops.</P>
    <P>As I am talking about the second level schools and what has happened to them in recent years, I would draw the Minister's attention to the reduction in the number <Col N="2072" /> of ESF grants available, which is a direct consequence of cutbacks in funding from her Department.  In the Finglas West area alone there was an enormous reduction in the number of children enrolling for comparable courses as a result of the reduction in funds.  This has had a very serious impact on an area such as Finglas West because we are talking about very young children with very little prospect of employment.  If they are not in school, where are they, and what are they doing?</P>
    <P>The gross unavailability of ESF grants in recent years certainly had a major impact on the length of time that these children remained in school.  It is a programme I would not wish to see cut back any further but would wish to see developed and made available in second level.</P>
    <P>With those few remarks I commend the Bill to the House and support the case made for a change in the way interview boards and the recruitment system works, so that we could see an improvement in the quality of service.  The Bill refers to the use of a system similar to that of the Civil Service Commission. Everybody would agree that that commission served the country well since its establishment and that we have rarely, if ever, had a complaint about either the impartiality of that system or about the quality of the candidates selected.</P>
    <P>I commend this Bill to the Minister for her most serious consideration.  I thank Deputy Birmingham for bringing this issue before us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it very difficult to go along with this Bill which was introduced by Deputy Birmingham, Opposition spokesman on Education.  While there may be some good points in it, he is attacking the most democratic area of education in this country.  I suppose as Opposition spokesperson on Education he has to justify his existence by bringing in this Bill.  I do not agree with many of the suggestions he made when speaking on the Bill, but this gives us an opportunity to debate the educational structures of the VECs, the RTCs and, <Col N="2073" /> indeed, education generally.  Our educational system which has been nurtured and cared for over many years by different Governments and different Ministers is regarded as of the highest quality and on a par, and even better than many of our EC partners, and further afield.</P>
      <P>Last year a very good friend of mine emigrated to Australia.  In many ways Australia has been described as the land of milk and honey.  Recently we had a letter from this person from which I will now quote a paragraph as follows:</P>
      <P>We are enjoying ourselves here in Perth, the weather is good and the money is good.  However the one thing that will bring us back home in a few years time is the education system for the further education of our two children. </P>
      <P>She went on to say that:</P>

      <P>These few words really sum up the high regard and the excellent quality of our educational system.  Ministers from different Governments and the teachers generally deserve great credit for the manner in which they have provided an excellent facility for our young people.  Our present Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, is doing a tremendous job.  In difficult times she has managed to protect what we have and to bring about many essential improvements over the past two years in the area of school building, languages and other areas of education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill before us wants to change the system of selection and as a former VEC member I cannot understand why.  If Fine Gael had a majority on the VECs, or had a majority at local authority level, I doubt if this Bill would be before us tonight. The present structures have served us well.  I recall from memory that when I was a member of the VEC we had selection boards for principals, vice-principals <Col N="2074" />&ldquo;A&rdquo; post holders.  These boards of selection were usually the same &mdash; three members of the committee, a Department inspector, a CEO and it was compulsory for an IVEA member to be present for the selection of a principal and a vice-principal.  We had a different board for the selection of &ldquo;B&rdquo; post holders. I feel this Bill is now casting a reflection on the integrity and the honesty of the members on these boards.  I have to refute this.  The Department of Education are always represented on such selection committees and I know that the inspector involved has only one interest in mind, that is, to select the best.  The CEOs are also on such committees and I can safely say, judging from the knowledge I have from my own county of Wexford, that the CEO there has only one thing in mind.  He is very responsible and in the selection process he wants to select the best teacher, the best principal or the best vice-principal for his schools. After all, the CEO has to work with the person selected for many years.  Certainly he will not select a dud or anyone who in his opinion is not up to the required standard.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the political side of the selection process.  Normally the three people representing the VEC are politicians &mdash; in some cases there could be a clergyman, but generally it tends to be politicians.  These politicians are elected by the people.  They are answerable to the people for their actions and deeds at election time.  In my experience of selection boards &mdash; which is confined to Wexford during my eight years on the VEC &mdash; and in my dealings with eight vocational schools, we had only one problem with one particular teacher who was not up to the required standard.  I contend that over the years the process of selection which we have had at VEC level has served us well.</P>
    <P>It saddens me at times to see politicians undermining themselves and their abilities. Too often we cheapen ourselves and the role we have to play in the eyes of the public.  If we do not have respect for ourselves, it is very difficult for us to earn the respect of the general public.  The <Col N="2075" /> people this Bill wants to get rid of are the real salt of the earth.  They are public local representatives who give of their time voluntarily.  They are honest and above reproach.  This Bill questions the ability to make the right decision in the selection process.</P>
    <P>I should like to remind Deputy Birmingham that there are people from his party on selection boards.  In this respect I would mention Louise Hennessy from New Ross who is the principal of a secondary school.  Is Deputy Birmingham saying that she is not capable of making a decision on who should be selected as a teacher, vice-principal or principal?  I doubt it very much.  She is the principal of one of the biggest schools in County Wexford and I believe she is well capable of making the right decisions in the interests of the students and the vocational education committees in County Wexford.  It is important to have local representation.  These people know what is best for local schools.  They know the local climate.  It is important that the Minister, in whatever legislation is introduced, should maintain local representation and local democracy to ensure that the views, ideas and the educational needs of the local areas are protected by whoever is selected in the years to come.</P>
    <P>In many ways the Bill is an insult to the departmental inspectors, CEOs and members of VECs who have done much to provide the highest educational standards for, in some cases, the sons and daughters of less well off families in our community.  The VEC schools have served the people of this country well and I do not think this Bill would be in the best interests of any future road the VECs may decide to go down.  Over the years the VECs have provided second level education for their students regardless of their class or creed.  I have always contended that the VEC teachers are in a class of their own.  They do not have the advantage of selecting the best or brightest students; they cater for all students. There is no educational qualifying test involved for admittance to VEC <Col N="2076" /> schools and yet at examination time vocational schools turn out students who are top of the class.  The intermediate and leaving certificate results of these students are on a par with any secondary school.  The number of children from disadvantaged backgrounds catered for by the VECs is far greater than in any other sector of second level education.</P>
    <P>In recent times the VECs have on occasion moved too far away from their original role and now place too much emphasis on intermediate and leaving certificate results and not enough on the practical subjects for which they were renowned in the past.  For many years the group certificate was regarded as a very valuable document and people who had this certificate more often than not had an opportunity of serving their time as mechanics, carpenters, bricklayers, etc. The group certificate demonstrated itself to be the most practical examination of all at junior level.  Included in the group certificate were subjects such as home economics, carpentry, mechanics, commerce, metalwork, etc.</P>
    <P>I should like to compliment the Minister for Education on her initiative in introducing the junior certificate of education. This is an amalgamation of the intermediate and group certificates and will be introduced from September next for first year students, and for which teacher in-service courses are presently taking place.  I hope that very soon the same revolutionary approach will be introduced at senior cycle level.</P>
    <P>The vocational sector have an important role to play in conjunction with FÁS. There is a need for greater liasion between the two bodies and there should be greater co-operation in regard to apprenticeship schemes.  There is tremendous teacher expertise in the different skills available in vocational schools and these should be utilised to the full by FÁS.  What is happening at present in this area should be looked at. Local builders must send their apprentices to Waterford or Cork to complete the educational aspect of their training with FÁS.  This education should be given at local VEC level where apprentices <Col N="2077" /> could work three or four days with the local builders and attend the local VEC school on other days.  This would save a tremendous amount of money for the Exchequer, would ensure that many more people would receive the educational part of their training at local level and would ensure also a valuable increase in the number of apprentices who would come on stream for the different industries which exist at present.</P>
    <P>The possibilities in the adult education area are enormous.  Traditional adult education classes such as gardening, sewing, craftwork, art and leisure time classes are becoming less attractive and while a certain demand will always remain for these classes there is enormous potential for the providers of adult education in the area of second chance education &mdash; people who for one reason or another did not get the opportunity of a proper education and who now want to improve their education.  The whole area of adult education should be tied in with FÁS and the VTP courses.  RTCs should have a major role to play in adult education, particularly in the provision of evening classes which would enable adults to get another chance.  RTCs should embrace the area of community education, provide opportunities for working class people living in the areas where RTCs are situated, such as Waterford or Carlow, and give an opportunity to those people to further their education during the evenings, the same as people in Dublin, Galway and Cork can do in the universities.  The Minister should seriously consider the provision of evening classes in RTCs for adults who want to further their education or diversify into other careers but who can only do so if the educational system suits them.</P>
    <P>There is also potential for married women to participate in day time certified adult education courses such as computers, secretarial skills and language programmes.  This area should be looked at seriously so that such opportunities can be provided for married women who are anxious to further their education or learn an extra skill.  These women have time to attend courses during the daytime <Col N="2078" /> when their children are at school and the vocational schools and RTCs should make space, time and teachers available to teach such classes.</P>
    <P>The RTCs have been the success story of third level education.  They follow through at a very practical level second level education and hopefully as a result of the new development at second level they will become even more relevant. The range of opportunities provided by the RTCs is enormous and they have given some students the opportunity of a third level education that otherwise would have been denied them because of a lack of financial resources which would have prevented them from attending universities. The RTCs have given these people an opportunity of third level education and have proven to be the success story of the last decade and this decade. This success has been due to the close liaison the RTCs have with industry.  They are capable of providing the expertise for the various industries operating in the different counties.  This expertise is becoming increasingly important with the vast technological changes which are taking place and I believe the RTCs will have an even greater role to play in expanding the Government's policies in relation to the development of natural resources, which tend to depend so much on the development of high technology, which will enable us to compete and take our place in the competitive marketplace with other EC countries.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to look seriously at the possibility of creating spurs or extensions from the RTCs to local VECs within their catchment areas. Programmes under the auspices of the RTCs, whether in Waterford in my constituency, in Carlow or elsewhere, should be provided in VEC schools which have the necessary facilities, particularly in my county where there is a number of new vocational schools.  The Minister should look seriously at this area, particularly in regard to County Wexford which is an agricultural county.</P>
    <P>There is a tremendous opportunity for development in the food, fruit and other areas relating to agriculture.  In the area <Col N="2079" /> of agricultural science, I should like to remind the Minister that the only place available to us for this type of education is Tralee regional technical college.  I would ask her to select County Wexford as a pilot area for the introduction of agricultural science courses under the auspices of Carlow or Waterford regional technical colleges.  That would be a tremendous boost to the county and to the young people who want to pursue this type of career.</P>
    <P>The Minister has given her approval to accepting the broad outline of the Bill. There are sections in it that would not be acceptable to many of our people who would like the present democratic system to continue within the VEC.  I ask the Minister to ensure that when her own legislation is brought into the House it will have enshrined in it much of what has been in existence up to now, that the local VEC would have an input into the selection process and that the local elected members would have an input into that process.  The greatest interview board of all is the electorate.  If you pass that interview, you can sit on any board up and down the country.  If you make mistakes, the electorate will decide to get rid of you.</P>
    <P>The people who have been on the VEC selection boards have served us well. They are of the highest integrity and honour.  If a survey were done on the teachers selected over the years, or the principals or vice-principals appointed, it would prove that there was very little wrong with the selections made.  I have first hand knowledge of being a member of a VEC committee.  I found, with regard to my county, that all the teachers within the VEC, whether ordinary teachers or those with posts of greater responsibility, vice-principals or principals, were of the highest integrity.  They are of the highest standard so far as the teaching our young people is concerned. The results in the leaving certificate, group certificate and other certificate examinations have proved that.  I would like to see very little change in this area. Naturally, the winds of change are <Col N="2080" /> blowing through the whole educational system and we must move with the times. The Minister has been doing a good job and she will continue to do it in the area of education.  Whatever changes she decides to make will be in the best interests of our teachers, our students, and our educational structures generally.  If our education is regarded worldwide as being of the highest quality, there is not much need to change the present structures.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill before us and congratulate Deputy Birmingham for his initiative in bringing it forward.  I compliment the Minister for Education for the magnanimous manner in which she greeted and treated the Bill. There seems to be a general consensus that it is a measure worth having, worth implementing and worth making part and parcel of the development and advancement of our vocational educational system.</P>
      <P>Apart from the Minister, one notes that there was a certain amount of exaggerated comment from some Members on the other side of the House, in particular in relation to the purpose and nature of the Bill and what it actually sets out to do.  It is a very short Bill, very clear and very unequivocal.  It addresses a long standing problem in relation to vocational teachers and the vocational education system, that is, the need to introduce a proper, administrative and structured approach to the appointment of teachers and others within the vocational system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I taught in a vocational education school in the early days of my teaching career and saw a system under which we had to go cap in hand to the county councillors and members of vocational education committees.  That was the only interviewing process.  Having done the circuit of your respective county, or borough, or whatever it might be, you then had to wait for the outcome of a meeting. Mind you, we were not supposed to go around the circuit at the time.  The general theory was that canvassing would disqualify, even in those days.  There was <Col N="2081" /> no interviewing procedure.  It was a question of impressing them, and not so much impressing with your academic qualifications, or your strength of character, or your ability to do the job, but in many cases &mdash; and we know it applies to all sides of the House &mdash; it largely depended on your political credentials.  In terms of many appointments, the stronger your political credentials, the greater the chance of your being appointed.</P>
    <P>We welcomed the long overdue introduction of interview boards.  It was a basic procedure that if somebody wished to apply for a job the least that he or she might do was face an interview board, be properly questioned in relation to competence, interests, skills, aptitude and, after that, have a decision made in relation to their competence or otherwise for a particular job.  I would largely agree that the system worked relatively well, but it is one of the last bastions of the preserves of politicians.  As long as politicians are operating, particularly at local level, there is a prospect, chance and, in fact, danger that the system will be abused.</P>
    <P>By and large, the vocational education system benefited from the manner in which it was administered thus far, but, in an era in which we have independent local appointments commissions I cannot see why the vocational education system local authority members, or anybody, should claim that this element of the education scene should be excluded from a proper appointments procedure.  What this measure purports to do is to introduce a method by which appointments henceforth will be made by the Local Appointments Commission, independent in composition, seen to be independent and having the absolute trust and confidence of both the people outside and those who are subjecting themselves to interview for appointments.</P>
    <P>The vocational education system is one which has never really got cothrom na Féinne.  Going back to the days before Professor Louden Ryan's tribunal in relation to salaries, we had at that time four salary scales.  In the top bracket were the newly conceived comprehensive <Col N="2082" /> schools, then on a slightly lower tier we had the secondary system, next we had the vocational education system and finally at the bottom rung, very wisely or judiciously &mdash; not that it reflects on the primary schools &mdash; you had the salaries for the primary schools.  Many people welcomed the long overdue introduction of a common basic salary for all.</P>
    <P>In the sixties it was decided by the Minister's party to introduce into vocational education schools, for the first time ever, intermediate certificate and leaving certificate courses.  We felt that now the vocational education system was being afforded a real chance to compete on equal terms with all and sundry, and particularly with its counterpart in the secondary school system.  It was no denigration of the former régime that operated within vocational schools that they should be given this chance, the opportunity of studying for the intermediate and leaving certificates.</P>
    <P>The group certificate is an examination that has been greatly under-rated.  Its suitability or merits were, however, well recognised, particularly by the semi-State agencies such as the Electricity Supply Board, the predecessor of Telecom Éireann, the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, Bord na Móna and so on. They were prepared to take on people directly after they obtained their group certificate and to bring them straight into their apprenticeship schemes.  They could more than compete with the best because vocational schools have a curriculum that is well suited to cope with the demands of the 20th century.  It has a range of subjects which gives it an aura of diversification because, now that they have been granted full status in regard to the leaving and intermediate certificates, there is a full range of academic subjects as well as the traditional ones of metalwork, woodwork, technical drawing and other new subjects.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, one of the most recent happenings is that, in relation to the degree of cutbacks that is expected to be borne by the various sectors which have come under the Minister's guillotine, the vocational sector has been asked to bear <Col N="2083" /> an undue burden.  It has been proved by Professor Swan of University College, Dublin, that the literacy difficulties encountered by vocational school pupils are in the region of 30 per cent, whereas in the secondary schools the figure is in the region of 8 per cent.  However, we have failed to inject the necessary capital and finance to enable the vocational schools to cope with this disability.</P>
    <P>At present at junior cycle in the vocational system there are 50,531 pupils and at senior cycle there are 19,217.  If you take a 30 per cent element deemed as having considerable difficulty with literacy, it demands that we should give the vocational system the necessary resources to develop their full potential and to cope with the demands put on them by the children attending vocational schools.  It has been proved that a higher proportion of disadvantaged children attend vocational schools.  This has always been so and it looks as if it will always be so.  We must ensure that in future the necessary resources are made available so that vocational schools can do their work properly.</P>
    <P>There are several reasons for introducing this Bill.  It sets out to eliminate the possibilities of political interference, and it succeeds.  It wants to appoint people of expertise to do the job and while many vocational education committee members are former teachers, serving teachers or parents on management committees, at the same time there are people on these committees who do not have the competence, skill or expertise to do the job properly, which is the least we might expect.  The argument was made from the other side of the House that this will downgrade and weaken democracy at vocational educational level and that it will in some way damage it.  I argue to the contrary.  It will enhance and strengthen the vocational system because it will be seen to be above and beyond reproach.  Never again can anyone outside the system point the finger and say there is a danger of political interference or contamination.  We know that it has been one of the inhibiting factors when <Col N="2084" /> it has come to rationalisation in post-primary centres.  When we have tried a system with secondary and vocational schools working in common enrolment, sharing subjects or taking it to its logical conclusion, by way of a community school, we have seen that the main reason the secondary system in particular tended to pull back is the fear of political interference in the management structure which would emerge within the new development.  I do not see why, therefore, we should flinch in introducing this measure.</P>
    <P>I disagree with Deputy Michael Higgins when he asked that the new régime be extended to secondary schools.  It is not that I hold any particular grá or brief for secondary schools, but in fairness to them, they are private schools, privately owned and privately managed and, by and large, in terms of capital development they have been funded&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">

    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, in terms of capital development they have been funded by the nuns, priests and brothers long before the State got involved in post-primary education.  These were the people who committed their resources to building those schools&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is expecting too much to think that private schools should now take on a public system of appointment. The salaries are funded in terms of revenue but in terms of capital input the majority of the fabric that has been put in place has come unselfishly from their own resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The secondary system has tended to be generously funded in <Col N="2085" /> terms of resources and subject development, but it was the religious orders who provided the money, and built and developed them.  We should take one step at a time instead of cutting across the post-primary school area.</P>
      <P>The recent survey carried out by the Teachers' Union of Ireland is in stark contrast to the claims made by the other side of the House in relation to our so called development and advancement of the vocational sector.  The TUI survey points out that on average over the past year each vocational school has lost at least one subject.  In most schools students' options were considerably curtailed. Three out of ten schools had to cut the length of their day by about four or five minutes per class which amounted to one and a half hours per week.  The vast majority of schools &mdash; where you had a number working in unison &mdash; lost either career guidance or remedial teachers despite the fact that the statistics show that there is an increasing burden on the vocational sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anything I say by way of praise for the vocational schools would be inadequate. Over the years, since the Vocational Education Act, 1930, they have done enormous work.  These schools pioneered night classes, adult education classes and indeed day classes for adults.  They introduced innovations that are now hailed as having been major flag bearers in the development of the post-primary sector. Community and comprehensive schools have formed the bulwark of the curriculum but in terms of pupil-teacher ratio, they never got fair play.  The same applies to capital investment.  The vast majority of vocational schools, when there was a major expansion programme in the sixties and seventies, were given substandard, prefab dwellings in which to inculcate learning into their pupils. These are the areas of education, the vocational sector in particular, that have the greatest potential if they were only given a chance.  By adopting this measure <i>glasnost</i> will emerge and there is a consensus on all sides of the House that it is a good measure.  By doing so we will have gone another step down the road towards <Col N="2086" /> the proper evolution of our vocational system.  This is a significant night and perhaps, in the years to come, we will get round to advocating and accepting a local appointments commission for the secondary scheme which Deputy Michael Higgins wants.</P>

      <P>I welcome the debate on this Bill and the contributions made by various speakers from all sides of the House.  It has given us an opportunity to have a very worth-while debate on local and vocational education in the past and how it will shape up in the future. It has been a very constructive debate and it is a compliment to the spokesperson on Education, Deputy Birmingham, and the Minister that we have had such a constructive debate.  Many interesting points have been made on all sides of the House by the various spokespersons, including Deputy Higgins.  The report of this debate makes interesting reading.  It has helped to bring forward the general debate on education.  It is timely that it should take place now and perhaps it is an omen for the future.</P>
      <P>There has been much comment from all sides of the House on this Bill.  Much of the comment from this side was favourable. Members on this side of the House did make some criticisms and there are points on which there are differences, but there are also many points on which there is agreement.  The speech made by the Minister is worthy of study because she outlined many of the developments which have taken place and her general agreement with the ethos of this Bill.  She also said there may be a necessity to take another look at some of the detail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill seeks to remove from vocational education committees the powers they exercise in the selection and appointment of teachers in schools run by the vocational education committees. It is proposed that the function of the selection of teachers for appointment by VECs should be exercised by the Commissioners of Local Appointments. <Col N="2087" /> There are some merits, and perhaps some demerits, in that proposal.  In general we on this side of the House, given that the Minister has already initiated very significant and radical changes in the education process, would agree that on this specific question there is a need to review the system which has worked well.  While some problems have been experienced and the system has its disadvantages, it is fair to say that the system has worked well during the past 60 years.</P>
    <P>However, the changes proposed in this Bill would represent a significant change in the statutory position and in the selection and appointments procedure which has been in place for those 60 years. Given this background one would be justified in dwelling on the need for change, the objectives of change and the actual effect of the Bill at present before the House.  Any proposals to amend legislation obviously require detailed and careful consideration by Ministers, the Government, their advisers and all those who have an interest in the future of education to ensure that all aspects of the proposed law are appropriate to the situation which it is desired to address and that any practical problems in implementation are identified and resolved.</P>
    <P>One of the difficulties for an Opposition spokesperson in introducing such fundamental legislation is that it is quite difficult to assess all the implications which such a fundamental change would bring about, and to make an objective assessment of the effects of such fundamental changes.  The present system of selection of teachers by VECs which has been in place, as I said, for most of this century has by and large operated quite successfully.  Any proposals for change have to be subjected to a searching examination to ensure that they would operate effectively.  I am sure the Members of the House would agree with me when I say that the aim in establishing selection procedures should be to secure a system which is equitable, efficient, effective and as economical as possible.</P>
    <P>In this context a series of questions <Col N="2088" /> spring to mind about the proposed new procedure envisaged under the Bill now before the House.  Will the shift in authority from the VEC to the Commissioners of Local Appointments result in a more equitable and effective system? Do the proposals have the seeds of movement towards greater centralisation which would be totally in conflict with the aims and spirit of the Vocational Education Acts?  Is there not a distinct danger that the costs involved in the proposed system will exceed those under the existing system?  Will the proposed selection procedures offer the speed of response often necessary in the filling of teacher appointments?</P>
    <P>In this context I would remind Members that teaching is not a bureaucratic activity and it is possible to countenance delay in the filling of administrative and clerical positions which, in the context of teaching, could cause unacceptable dislocation to the learning process of pupils and the life of the school generally.  With the potential loss of detailed knowledge of the local environment, would the needs under the proposed selection procedure be detrimental to the selection process or at minimum render it less effective than the present <i>modus operandi?</i>  It is this point which has thrown up some of the most interesting contradictions in the contributions to this debate.  Deputy Deenihan in contradicting the points made by Deputy Batt O'Keeffe said and I quote from the Official Report of 22 February 1989, Volume 387, column 1305:</P>
    <P>I think Deputy O'Keeffe said that these people need local knowledge and knowledge of the ethos of the school. Does that mean that even though a teacher may be well qualified, because they would not fit into the ethos of a school, they should not be appointed? </P>
    <P>He went on to make the point that local knowledge should not necessarily be an important factor in the appointment of teachers.  However, he proceeded to inform the House, and I quote:</P>
    <P>I taught in a comprehensive school <Col N="2089" /> in Tarbert where there were teachers from all over Ireland in that school. Those teachers were appointed by an appointments committee who were based locally and I am sure they had no local knowledge when they appointed those teachers.  It appears that there is a contradiction there, as quite clearly the appointment of teachers to community and comprehensive schools are made by people who come from the locality &mdash; the local VEC, parents and teachers. </P>
    <P>This system was only put in place in recent years and as far as I can establish it is working extremely well.  Therefore having local knowledge and having a fully decentralised system of appointments does have very significant advantages. One of my reservations about the proposal to give over to the Local Appointments Commission the sole responsibility for the appointment of teachers is that it inevitably would become a very centralised system of appointment which may not have the local knowledge which forms a very important and significant part of the vocational education system and, as I said, of our community and comprehensive schools.</P>
    <P>It would be appropriate to advert to the fact that the Vocational Education Acts provide for a management committee representing a range of expertise at local level to ensure that the statutory responsibilities of the committee are carried out to best effect.  Chief among these statutory responsibilities is the delivery and development of education services within the committee's area. Against this background is there not a case for arguing, in view of the committee's legal responsibilities, that it should have the commensurate power to take decisions on one of the most fundamental factors influencing the delivery and development of educational services, namely, the appointment of suitable teachers?</P>
    <P>Having argued over important general aspects of the Bill and its intent, I would now like to address some issues of detail which may present practical difficulties. For instance, the Bill, as drafted, would <Col N="2090" /> appear to involve the Commissioners of Local Appointments in the filling of every type of teaching post, be it part time, whole time, temporary or whole time permanent.  In drafting this Bill was any consideration given to the case of substitute teachers in the vocational education system arising from sick leave, maternity leave or other circumstances which may give rise to short-term teaching vacencies?</P>
    <P>I raise these issues not out of a desire to be negative or critical about the Bill but to ensure that Members approach their consideration of the measure as fully informed about the pro and contra arguments as possible.  As the House is aware, the Minister for Education is in the course of preparing legislation to provide, <i>inter alia,</i> for the rationalisation of vocational education structures and to accord greater autonomy to third level colleges under the aegis of the VECs.  In this context the Minister is taking the opportunity to examine other desirable changes in the existing legislation which has served the country well over 60 years.</P>
    <P>Let me take this opportunity to compliment the Minister on initiating a whole range of reforming legislation not alone in this sector but in the post primary and primary school sector generally.  I am sure Members of the House will agree, particularly the Education spokespeople, that the work being carried out by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment is reforming many aspects of the curricula in both the primary and post primary sectors, reform which is long overdue.  One would not wish to forget about the contribution of the Minister's predecessor in initiating this work in the first instance.  These are exciting times for education.  It is significant that we have a Minister who is prepared to make fundamental reforms which many of us feel are long overdue.  In that context the reform being proposed in this Bill is appropriate.  The Minister for Education will be taking into account the views which have been put forward by the speakers in this debate particularly by the <Col N="2091" /> proposer of the motion, Deputy Birmingham, and by my favourite Opposition spokesman on education and my former teacher, Deputy Higgins.</P>

Once again let me say that the view of the TUI is very important in the considerations of the Minister.  The Minister is careful at all times to consult with and listen to the advice of the TUI, as she does with the other unions.</P>
      <P>In general I welcome this Bill and the provisions contained in it.  The specifics and the details have to be considered further perhaps and I am glad to say the Minister will be giving full consideration and will welcome an opportunity to have further discussions with the various spokespeople on the drafting of the legislation for the development and rationalisation of the vocational education sector.</P>

      <P>We have a fairly full public gallery at the moment and I suspect they may be finding it a somewhat unusual occasion because in the nature of things the reports we tend to have in the Press and on TV of events in this House seem to concentrate on occasions when the Dáil is suspended because of grave disorder or a Member is ordered from the House having disagreed with the Chair or whatever.  The degree of consensus that has fallen on the House this evening will come as a surprise to the people in the gallery and perhaps somewhat of a disappointment.  I suspect it might have provided a more memorable occasion for their visit if we were at each other's throats.</P>

      <P>I am sure Deputy Higgins will be in a position to give advice to any Members bringing delegations in as to when controversy can be guaranteed.</P>
      <P>I want to begin by thanking all those who contributed during the debate.  In particular I thank the Minister for the openness of her response and for the fact that she has sat here throughout the four evenings of the debate and listened to every contribution.  I thank her very warmly for that.  In thanking the contributors I would like to thank you, Sir, and also the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and the Ceann Comhairle because you have shown a degree of indulgence to all of us in allowing us broaden the debate and perhaps at times go beyond the strict scope of the Bill.  The result has been that we have had a fairly wide ranging debate in relation to vocational education in Ireland, and that has been a very useful exercise.  The debate has been of very high quality and I must say I have learned much and that I have been privileged to listen to many of the contributions.  Even on the specific issue of the method of appointment the degree of personal experience which has been brought to bear on the debate has been striking.  We have had contributions from a number of people on different sides of the House who have participated on interview boards and they brought that background to bear.  Others have been there as candidates at the interview boards and subsequently gone on to serve as teachers in the vocational system.  All told it has been an extremely well informed debate and I am very pleased with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I was pleased to listen to the contribution from every Member who contributed, I have to say that in some instances I detected a note of what seemed to be an undue defensiveness, a slight tendency to be a little over sensitive and thin skinned.  There was no wish whatever on my part to cause offence and no one should take offence from the measure we are putting forward.  When I <Col N="2093" /> opened this debate last week and moved the Bill on behalf of the Fine Gael Party I was careful not to criticise any VEC or any member of any VEC.  Individual instances had been brought to my attention and of course they were in my mind when I was framing the Bill.  Since the Bill was published and achieved a degree of publicity further instances have been brought to my mind, but that is what they are.  They are individual people putting individual views.  Clearly I would not have seen the other side of the coin and in each of those instances there may well be another side, so I pass no judgment on the validity of any one of them.  My purpose is not to criticise, not to condemn because I am satisfied that the individual committees and individual members have done the best they can with the system. My purpose is to address the system.</P>
    <P>I was struck by Deputy Browne's anxiety that the Bill was in some sense an example of politicians selling themselves short, politicians doing down politicians. That criticism would concern me because I would not wish to be part of that kind of thing.  I do not think democracy is well served by the constant campaign of criticism directed against politicians from some quarters.  The belief, which is peddled from some sources, that politicians exist for whatever they can get out of a system is not healthy or conducive to strengthening our democracy.  I would not want to be any part of such criticism and I would not want anyone to see this Bill in any sense associated with that trend.</P>
    <P>This Bill would be good for the vocational system.  It would be good for those people right around the country who have made such an enormous contribution to the vocational education system and its development by serving in an unpaid capacity as members of VECs and it would be good for teachers in the system.</P>
    <P>I said last week that the purpose of the Bill was to assert and vindicate the professional status of the vocational teacher and it is on that principle that we stand.  In principle there can be no justification for distinguishing between <Col N="2094" /> the position of the teacher in the vocational system and every other professional employed by the State who comes for appointment before the Civil Service Commission or the Local Appointments Commission.  He submits his application; it is considered on its merits and he is either appointed or not. The vocational teacher, uniquely, has to subject himself to a quite different system of appointment, a system where at least the possibility of lobbying and political influence arises.</P>
    <P>It is good that this change should be made in the interests of those who serve on vocational education committees.  The present system places them in an invidious position.  The have to receive the applicants and respond to those who will make representations and lobby on behalf of individual candidates.  It is good for democracy that politicians should remove themselves from the act of making individual appointments.  Our democracy has been well served by the fact that from the foundation of the State no party has been in a position to influence appointments to the Civil Service. Our system of local democracy has been strengthened by the fact that, from the very early years of the State, no party has been in a position to make appointments of senior staff at local authority level.  Those who make their contribution to public life through vocational education committees will be strengthened in their work by being removed from the suspicion associated with the present system.</P>
    <P>I indicated last week that we are seeking to address a longstanding irritant with the teaching profession.  They felt that the present system which differentiated them from every other profession working for the State represented some question or shadow being placed over their professional status.  I suggested that it was important to address such an anxiety in order to respond to a crisis of morale within the vocational education system. I indicated then that I did not believe this was in any sense a complete or comprehensive response and that clearly there was much else to be done. <Col N="2095" /> Response from different parts of the Chamber have taken up the line that, while the principle of this Bill is to be welcomed, there are other areas to be addressed as well.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats, while going along with this Bill, indicated through their spokesman, Deputy Máirín Quill, an impatience to see wider reforms being introduced.  She was anxious to see legislation dealing with rationalisation of the VEC system and the number of vocational education committees around the country.  I share that sense of impatience and I accept entirely that it would be preferable not to proceed on a piece meal basis.  It would be preferable if the House were in a position to deal with a comprehensive reform package for the vocational education system, a packge that would deal, for example, with the question of rationalisation, the role of the RTCs and affording them the autonomy they have so richly earned, but still establishing clearly that there is to be a relatioship with a democratic local structure, either the VEC or whatever structure might replace it.  I should like to see a Bill which would address the particular needs of the Dublin Institute of Technology, for whom Deputy Flaherty made such an eloquent plea earlier.</P>
    <P>I would much rather that this important question of appointments would take its place within that wider context, but I would be concerned not to reach a position where the best would become the enemy of the good, where by waiting around to achieve agreement on everything we would not make progress on issues which are now available for decision.  The Minister said she proposes to introduce legislation and indicated that this question of appointments can be addressed in the context of that legislation. I would be anxious to see that legislation before the House as quickly as possible and I would be very content to see the question of appointments dealt with in such a Bill.  If the House will agree to give a Second Reading to this Bill, we will be content to wait, but not too long, to see what proposals the Minister has to <Col N="2096" /> offer.  The view has been expressed by every party who contributed that if comprehensive legislation can be achieved for the vocational system within a reasonably short timetable, that is the way in which to proceed.</P>
    <P>Some of those who spoke seemed to be just a little defensive, nervous of change and sensitive.  Some of them went so far as to express anxiety that this might be seen as an attack on or a weakening of the vocational education system.  I am rather bewildered as to how they could reach that conclusion.  Whatever they might think of my intentions, I do not see how they could imagine that the Teachers' Union of Ireland would lend their name to any legislation designed to criticise the vocational education system. Members on all sides of the House, particularly on the Government side, went out of their way to express their admiration and appreciation of what is happening within the vocational education system.</P>
    <P>It is entirely right that this opportunity should have been taken during the past two weeks.  I can only express regret that the opportunity was not availed of on the last occasion the House debated vocational education.  On that occasion the issue was the provision by the State of the basic resources to allow the vocational education system to maintain its level of service.  Those who spoke in the course of this debate from the benches opposite in defence of the traditions of vocational education were silent on that occasion when measures were being put through the House which have inflicted woeful damage on the vocational education system.  Those who spoke with such obvious knowledge and feeling about the very particular contribution the vocational education system has made to teaching and the education of the disadvantaged were strangely silent when this side of the House opposed the ill-thought-out proposal to put all schools on the same pupil-teacher ratio, a measure which rejected and denied the whole tradition and mission the vocational system has had in caring for the needs of the disadvantaged.  How <Col N="2097" /> much better it would have been had they contributed on that occasion.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Minister for Education and her Department, as well as her colleagues in Government, will take it from this debate that on all sides of the House there is a very strong recognition of the contribution vocational education has made and is making and a widespread recognition of the difficulties under which it now labours and a very strong desire on all sides that the cuts to which the system has been subjected during the past few years should now be reversed.  There is a recognition on all sides of the House that it is not acceptable to say that all schools are the same and should have the same pupil-teacher ratio.  There is a system of education which has taken to itself in a very particular way the task of educating the disadvantaged.  That sector deserves the support and encouragement of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The Bill represents a limited but important reform.  I hope it will not be too long before it finds its way on to the Statute Book.  Whether it finds its way on to the Statute Book in its present form, a modified form or is to be incorporated into more widely drawn legislation I mind little.  My anxiety is that two things should happen, first that the principle we have raised will be addressed reasonably expeditiously and, secondly, that the Minister will realise the impatience with which all sides of the House await the legislation which has had such a lengthy gestation period.  There has been talk for years about the need to reform the Vocational Education Act, 1930, but, despite all that talk, we still await with growing impatience the legislation that has been promised.</P>
    <P>I urge the House to give support to the Bill and to indicate to the Minister that we eagerly and impatiently await a more widely drawn reform.</P>

      <P>The Shannon Free Airport Development Company have assumed the statutory role of the IDA in the mid-west region. At present the Minister for Industry and Commerce, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, may provide moneys to the Shannon Free Airport Development Company to meet its expenses.  Its industrial development functions cover counties Limerick, Clare, Tipperary North Riding and south-west Offaly and the Bill provides for the addition of north Kerry. The area is defined by reference to district electoral divisions.  The Bill represents an integrated plan for the area which we feel will be successful.</P>

Deputy Cullen referred to the anomaly that appears to exist between the proposals introduced in the House in recent days for the Shannon Estuary Development Corporation.  It appears that the powers of the two bodies are the same and refer to the same areas. It is puzzling to find the Department of the Marine granting the same powers to the estuary corporation as the Department of Industry and Commerce are prepared to give to the Shannon Free Airport Development Company.  Will the Minister of State say if there has been liaison between the two Departments about the granting of these powers?  Will he outline the different roles that will be played by the two bodies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make it clear that we are debating the Committee Stage of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company Limited (Amendment) Bill and that we are not discussing the Harbours (Shannon Estuary Development Corporation) Bill.  I do not have any intention of getting involved in a debate on the latter Bill.  I should like to tell Deputy Carey that a decision in regard to the two Bills was taken by the Government.  Obviously, there was discussion as to what should be done about the two Authorities and there was no question of anything being done in an isolated way.  The Bill had its origins in a decision taken in July 1988 to divide the country into seven sub-regions for the purpose of optimising the operation of programmes for the national development plan subject to European Community Structural Funds.  The Government, on natural geographic grounds alone, decided to include north Kerry in the mid-west region.  The purpose of the Bill is to increase the remit of the Shannon Free Airport Development Corporation <Col N="2100" /> to include north Kerry, and nothing more.</P>
      <P>This marks a development on a Government decision last year to assign responsibility for tourism and industrial development, including medium and large scale industry, in the mid-west to SFADCo.  Prior to this, as Deputies will be aware, SFADCo were responsible for the promotion and development of small industries in the region while the IDA were responsible for medium and large industries.  I am not going to get involved in a debate on the Shannon Estuary Development Corporation.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister indicate how SFADCo propose to deal with their expanded role?  The Bill gives effect to Shannon Development taking responsibility for a much enlarged area with greater responsibility also within that enlarged area, and they are being asked to do this at a time when there is a substantial and significant reduction in the funding available to them.  Will the Minister indicate to the House tonight what proposals SFADCo have to deal with this programme?  Will it involve rationalisation? Will it involve job losses or will we have a less significant role on the part of the Authority in this expanded area? It certainly does not make sense to give a company an enlarged area, an expanded role and then ask them to do that with a very much reduced budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government are happy that Shannon Development corporation have fulfilled their role effectively. The Government have been particularly pleased with the progress which has been made since SFADCo assumed their new remit on 1 January last year.  In relation to the expanded territory, SFADCo propose to establish a county development centre in Tralee which will be staffed by three executives. The key role of the team's work will be to accelerate the flow of entrepreneurs into the very small firms sector of manufacturing industry, to support the creation and maintenance of viable jobs in the domestic trading sector of small industry, to promote the establishment <Col N="2101" /> of a number of sharply focused highly visible new tourist projects, develop a number of new projects in the natural resources area based on local raw materials and skills, improve the urban and rural environments through promoting and participating in specific renewal projects and develop a county development plan specific to north Kerry. As the Deputy is aware from developments in his own constituency, SFADCo have been very effective in promoting new industrial development and only events of recent times that appertain to a town in Deputy Lowry's constituency will, I am sure, convince him that they have been quite excellent in fulfilling their responsibility.</P>

It is quite obvious that Shannon Development will have to establish an administrative structure in the south Offaly area and also in north Kerry.  There are many new calls on the funding that is available to them and I would like to know if Shannon Development have plans to cope with this?  Will it mean that they will have to rationalise their administrative structure in Limerick?  Will it mean that they will be less effective in the total area as a result of the reduced funding?  They <Col N="2102" /> must have some plan of action and I would like to know what is it.</P>

The total number of jobs created in the Shannon region was 2,817 with a net gain of 929 jobs over that period.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State has been asked a number of questions. He has not replied to some of them and has replied to others rather evasively in a rather propaganda-like manner which is totally irrelevant, dragging in things that have no bearing at all and, in fact, probably are not accurate anyway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is obvious that unfortunately the Minister is not terribly familiar with this <Col N="2103" /> subject.  I am sorry that the Minister for Industry and Commerce is not here, or the Minister of State who dealt with this on Second Stage.  I want to repeat the question Deputy Cullen asked at the outset.  Would the Minister explain to us exactly what is the relationship of the IDA to this region?  In particular will he explain who is now supposed to do the overseas industrial development of this region?  The IDA tell me they are precluded by Government decision from doing it.  Shannon Development are not in a position to do it because they do not have overseas offices; I think they have one small office in New York by way of liaison in which there are two or three people.  Those people are principally concerned with airport and tourist aspects and with the development of banking establishments and insurance establishments at Shannon but have nothing to do with industrial development.  Who is developing this region abroad?  I am concerned about it.</P>
    <P>As I said to the House on Second Stage, the IDA produced a map.  They did not want to do it and I do not in any way blame them for it because they had no option.  They do not use this map in Ireland but abroad.  On it the island of Ireland is drawn and two parts of that island are blacked out, Northern Ireland and the mid-west region.  That is obviously a matter of concern to me, as it is to the people of that region.  It cannot help the people of that region.  The IDA have 12 or 14 offices abroad, perhaps more.  They have people of great experience in the promotion of Ireland as an industrial location.  In the past they have had a great deal of success in that.  Shannon Development have no experience or almost no experience of promotion abroad.  They have not the facilities to do it, nor will they ever have as a regional organisation.  It seems unreal to me that, in a tiny country like this with a tiny population, we have a region, a small region with a population of only a few hundred thousand, expected by Government decision to promote itself against its own country.  It makes no sense.  It <Col N="2104" /> does not work in practice and the people of that region are the losers.  For that reason an explanation of exactly how the thing is supposed to work is called for.</P>
    <P>Precisely the same thing was proposed by this Government in July 1987 in respect of tourism when the Shannon Free Airport Development Company were to take over the tourist promotion role or functions of Bord Fáilte.  They were to take over all this role with the exception of one or two things that were specified at the time like the grading of hotels and a few other statutory functions of that kind.  Otherwise they were to do everything.  That has not happened and it has not happened because commonsense dictated that it should not happen.  The agencies concerned were wise enough, notwithstanding the Government decision, not to follow it and left the thing much as it was.</P>
    <P>The only change that has taken place in relation to tourism relates to the Shannonside Regional Tourist Organisation which has been dissolved and whose functions have been taken over by SFADCo. Happily the Government decision has been in practice, ignored or over-ruled on the tourist side.  I cannot be certain that has happened in relation to industrial development and that is why Deputy Cullen asked the question and I repeat it now.  It is very important that it be spelled out here precisely and accurately what is supposed to happen and how it is envisaged that this overseas promotion in particular can take place.</P>
    <P>I think we were told in July-August 1987 that the IDA would be generous and that they would lob the odd project into the mid-west region.  The truth of the matter is the poor IDA are demented, I am told, with Government Ministers screaming and roaring at them, looking for job packages as they call it.  They now have to make up things out of extensions of firms and they say they are taking on more people while at the other side of the factory they are letting them go.  That is regarded as a sort of job packet.  When the IDA are driven by ministerial pressure to reduce to that level, obviously they are not in a position to spread around any <Col N="2105" /> surplus major foreign projects.  I notice now there are ministerial announcements for even the smallest of projects as if they were hugely significant.</P>
    <P>For these reasons we would like to have this spelled out.  People simply do not know where they stand, in particular since the overlap in that area is compounded by another Bill that is before the House which proposes that a third agency be set up to do these jobs in respect of part of the region.  A double overlap is bad enough but to have a treble one is unbearable and is the height of bureaucratic nonsense.  This should be clarified and swept out of the way so that the most appropriate agencies can get on with the most appropriate jobs.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, until 1987 SFADCo promoted small industry in the mid-west region which excluded the Shannon free zone where they had legislative authority to give grants under delegated authority from the IDA.  The Government decided in July 1987 that as and from 1 January 1988 SFADCo should take over responsibility for medium and large industry in the mid-west as well as for small industry. This responsibility was formally designated in December 1987.  Obviously a new delegation will be needed to include north Kerry after the present Bill is enacted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The basic working arrangements have been already largely agreed between the two agencies.  For example, detailed agreements have been drawn up to deal <Col N="2106" /> with agency contact with overseas companies, multi-plant indigenous companies, other indigenous companies and financial services projects.  Guidelines have been issued to IDA overseas offices in relation to site visits, existing foreign-owned companies and accommodation of SFADCo's representatives in IDA offices &mdash; there are four representatives in the United States and one in the Federal Republic of West Germany and the costs have to be borne by SFADCo.  In that area there is clear and close liaison between the two agencies.</P>
    <P>The objectives of the guidelines are to avoid competition and duplication and to promote Ireland to the customer as a single industrial location.  As regards liaison, agreement has been formally reached between the IDA and SFADCo on cross-representation on each other's boards and committees.  Up until 1987, SFADCo were represented on the Dublin East Regional Small Industry Committee and the IDA were represented on SFADCo's Building and Grant Committee.  An IDA official was appointed to the board of SFADCo.  At that time when SFADCo were given responsibility for medium and large industry it was felt that greater cross-representation was needed to ensure consistency of approach.</P>
    <P>SFADCo officials are now represented on the following IDA committees: the FÁS-IDA Training Grants Committee, the International Services Committee, the Enterprise Development Committee and the Product Development Committee. In addition, the managing director of SFADCo has been appointed to the IDA board.  I cannot understand why there is confusion as to whether there might or might not be liaison between the two bodies.  They are working very closely and that clearly defines that there is close co-operation and that they are working hand in hand.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to take the Minister back to the whole aspect of funding.  I do not think he answered the question he was asked in that respect. <Col N="2107" /> Like Deputy Lowry, I am quite concerned that with the decrease in funding for SFADCo the services will be stretched over a wider area and as a result peripheral areas like north Kerry will suffer.  The Minister must admit that the SFADCo allocation for administration was reduced substantially in the Estimates. Where will SFADCo get the extra resources to make up this reduction?  It has been said they will get some moneys from renting the landbank in Ballylongford, for example, but that will go nowhere near meeting the shortfall in the region of £500,000.  I fear for the future of industrial and tourist development in north Kerry.  That area will suffer as a result of this as indeed will the whole mid-western area.</P>
      <P>I am not happy that three officials based in Tralee will cover all of north Kerry adequately in terms of industrial and tourism promotion.  I would like the Minister to state tonight if it is his intention to set up permanent tourist offices in the north Kerry area, especially in Listowel and Ballybunion.  Listowel is the centre of north Kerry and Ballybunion is our main tourist resort.</P>
      <P>One of the greatest disadvantages as far as the landbank in Ballylongford is concerned is access.  The road from Limerick to Tarbert should be included in the national programme.  In that programme I understand it is proposed to develop roads that lead to ports and it is only right that this road should be upgraded. Otherwise it will be very difficult to market the landbank in Ballylongford harbour area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned about another matter &mdash; Deputy O'Malley went into it in some depth &mdash; and I would like the Minister to explain it further.  He said there is close co-operation between the IDA and SFADCo but obviously there has to be some competition as well.  Surely the two bodies will be vying with each other.  I am sure the IDA in south Kerry will be vying with SFADCo in north Kerry to see who can bring most to the county. We in Kerry County Council will be comparing the performance of both bodies.  I <Col N="2108" /> am sure there will be no co-operation in bringing projects to Kerry.  If the IDA can get a project for south Kerry they will not offer it to SFADCo in north Kerry.  The IDA officials with whom I have discussed this matter were very irate about north Kerry being taken out of their remit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I was looking for it and I think it was right but I am very concerned about funding of it.  I am worried about the personnel SFADCo have in Europe and in America.  Is the Minister confident that they will be able to match the IDA when it comes to promoting the area?  It must be remembered that our main competitor for port business in the southern region is Ringaskiddy, County Cork.  They have infinitely more facilities than are available in Ballylongford.  They have a very good infrastructure.  They have gas, a good road system, and a more than adequate water supply whereas the land bank in Ballylongford has none of those advantages.  I am worried about SFADCo's funding and I would like the Minister to explain how SFADCo will operate efficiently with less money.  This bothers me and I do not accept that SFADCo can promote the area as vigorously as they should.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I would like to seek some information from the Minister before agreeing to section 3.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We are on section 2, Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>My apologies, a Cheann Comhairle.  I was moving on to the next parish in section 3.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like the Minister to give us more detail on how the SFADCo operation will work in relation to their new responsibilities in north Kerry.  Together <Col N="2109" /> with Deputy Deenihan I sought information from the Department of Industry and Commerce, the Department of Finance and the Department of Tourism and Transport with regard to the amount of money that will be provided specifically to assist the enlarged SFADCo in their new responsibilities.  Unfortunately, from the information received it would appear that there are no additional moneys available for promotion at home or to assist in promoting north Kerry as a new part of the mid-west region.</P>
    <P>The people of Kerry will no doubt be totally confused if not quite schizophrenic in their attitude to SFADCo.  For many months people were saying it was desirable that north Kerry should be in the SFADCo region.  Now we hear Deputy O'Malley saying that SFADCo have out-lived their useful life and are failing the mid-west region and that the Limerick area would be far better off within the ambit of the IDA.  The IDA in fulfilling their role for south Kerry had an office in Tralee over the past number of years, but this was given only after a great deal of persuasion and agrument on the principle that they had an office in Donegal, which is a separate region.  The IDA were very reluctant to have an office in Kerry because of the fact that Kerry was within the Cork region but eventually they agreed to locate an office in Tralee. They have agreed to leave it in Kerry for another two years until the lifetime of the office has expired.  However, without any political or other persuasion they made a great scene in the past two weeks about opening their office in Killarney.  I had to ask myself why there was this great palaver about opening the office in Killarney, given the office in Tralee was opened after nightfall with a slight degree of embarrassment on the part of the IDA and without admitting that political pressure had been used.  Now we have the spectacle of banner-waving and great public display when the office in Killarney is opened.  I can only conclude &mdash; and I would like the Minister's comment on this &mdash; that the reason there was such a display in Killarney was that in south Kerry the IDA will now have to compete <Col N="2110" /> with SFADCo in north Kerry.  There will be very obvious comparisons made between how SFADCo are doing in north Kerry and how the IDA are doing in south Kerry.  I only hope it will work to the benefit of County Kerry as a whole. Perhaps for every factory in north Kerry we will get one in south Kerry as well.</P>
    <P>I have serious misgivings about what is happening in the regions generally.  I have actually been a victim of the competition between SFADCo and the IDA when trying to sell this country abroad.  You were never quite sure who was going to stab you first and which official was going to run off and announce the news: the IDA or SFADCo.  I would like the Minister to comment on this duplication and the cost of the duplication to the State.  I have reason to believe that to maintain one official abroad for either of these bodies costs in the region of £200,000 per annum and I am beginning to wonder &mdash; and I have heard this from many Ministers who have worked on foreign trips for the benefit of SFADCo and the IDA &mdash; whether the number of officials available confuses the people we are trying to attract into the country.  We can bring somebody as far south as Tralee in the mid-west region but if they express an interest in Killarney they will have to be handed over to another escort.  I now wonder about the wisdom of this move and what it holds out for the promotion of employment in areas that need employment.  I would like the Minister to comment on the figure I suggested as the cost of maintaining an official abroad.</P>
    <P>Since the tourism function for the mid-west region was given to SFADCo I would like the Minister to give us more detail as to how they have operated in this new area of responsibility.  In a question to the Minister for Tourism and Transport I sought to find out how much funding was available to SFADCo to promote their areas of extra responsibility in north Kerry.  It appears from the answer I received to my parliamentary question that despite the fact that SFADCo have <i>de jure</i> responsibility, Bord Fáilte are still charged with responsibility for selling Ireland abroad.  Perhaps the Minister <Col N="2111" /> would clarify what function SFADCo have in relation to tourism promotion abroad and how this is differentiated from the function of Bord Fáilte?</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to give me some specific reason why we have competing bodies charged with the same responsibility albeit for different regions, functioning abroad for the same purpose. Would it not be more clinical and perhaps more expedient if we decided to rationalise our services at a time when the Government seem to be cutting back on everything at home and provide a single Authority to try to sell Ireland abroad and attract investment to the country with that one body operating on behalf of the Government?  I have heard from many industrialists that there is an element of confusion with one group trying to attract them to a specific region as opposed to another group who can offer them the rest of the country.  Perhaps the Minister will comment on that.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to ask the Minister if he is satisfied that all of the areas of north Kerry are included in section 2 and that on the information available to him every parish in the county is covered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will now reply to the various questions raised by Deputies Lowry, Carey and Spring.  First, I want to make it very clear that the extension of SFADCo's remit will not result in any additional cost to the Exchequer as it simply represents a new division of areas between various bodies with the same task being performed in a more co-ordinated and integrated way by one body. As Deputies are aware, when this Government assumed office on 10 March 1987 they inherited a disastrous economic situation.  We then had to make very firm decisions about reducing public expenditure, rationalising Government programmes and reducing the numbers in various organisations.  We now have a very slim, fit organisation representing the country and selling Ireland efficiently at home and abroad and this is something of which we are extremely proud.  As Deputy Spring is aware, the number <Col N="2112" /> employed in the industry in north Kerry at present is 3,450.  This is relatively small by comparison with the numbers in the existing mid-west.  It is clear that the additional work incurred in promoting and servicing north Kerry will not be of major significance and should be incidental to SFADCo's additional activities. The Deputy is correct in saying that the IDA at present serve north Kerry from a sub-office in Tralee staffed by one person.  I hope that that role will be assumed by SFADCo.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Deenihan said there will be a transfer of IDA property in north Kerry to SFADCo.  This will result in SFADCo receiving extra current own resources from factory rents and grazing fees from the Ballylongford site which is currently let for grazing.  The IDA indicated that the net increase in SFADCo's current own resources as a result of the transfer of an IDA property in north Kerry is likely to be in the region of £60,000.</P>
      <P>Another point adverted to by Deputy Spring and Deputy Deenihan was competition between the IDA and SFADCo particularly in the US.  I visited the US in December 1988 and arranged an official meeting with the representatives of the IDA, SFADCo and CTT.  I could not have found a group of people more collectively supportive of each other in relation to what they were promoting.  I had no experience of one organisation trying to take business away from the other and trying to divert it to other areas. The personnel representing SFADCo and the IDA abroad are playing on the same team for the one country.  I am satisfied that they support each other and effectively fulfil their roles.</P>
      <P>There is a need for a regional organisation to serve the mid-west which will now encompass Deputy Spring's constituency. I hope this organisation will be very successful in bringing many major industries to north Kerry and I have no doubt that the Deputy will be pleased with the results which will be achieved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards tourism, SFADCo will be fully responsible for promoting north Kerry on the home market.  They will work with Bord Fáilte in the overseas <Col N="2113" /> promotion of north Kerry by Bord Fáilte who are responsible for the marketing and promotion of Irish tourism overseas. There is already a tourism consultative council in SFADCo in the context of the Shannonside region.  The council chaired by SFADCo comprises of representatives from industry and the Shannonside region.  It is envisaged that SFADCo will consult with tourism interests in north Kerry as to their inclusion in this council. I have no doubt that south Kerry will do well too.  The IDA are very happy with the resurgence of confidence and interest in Ireland as a result of the firm decisions that have been taken over the past two years.</P>

It is sounding more like a Second Reading than a Committee Stage measure.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;your anxiety to get rid of this Bill.  Section 2 of the Bill is giving authority to SFADCo to take over parts of the River Shannon estuary to Beale, Carrig, Lislaughtin, Tarbert and Tarmon, a role which was already undertaken by different bodies.  Bord Fáilte had the tourism role and now SFADCo has it.  Also, and as the Minister said, a Shannonside tourism council will now hopefully include people from north Kerry tourist interests, in particular from Beale, Carrig, Lislaughtin, Tarbert and Tarmon.  My only difficulty with that is that the Minister for the Marine is also taking on board the very same authority for tourism in Beale, Lislaughtin, Carrig, Tarbert and Tarmon.  Will the Minister tell me now that Shannonside tourism will also take in the member from north Kerry who will be representing SFADCo, or the tourism interest of SFADCo or these people along the estuary in Beale, Carrig, Lislaughtin, Tarbert and Tarmon?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is the Minister saying that SEDCo will have the total responsibility for tourism promotion in the Shannon Estuary area, for the dispersal of funds, and that the powers being asked of the Oireachtas in the SEDCo Bill are not necessary?  That is irrelevant to section 2 of this Bill.  The Minister has his own point of view, with which I do not agree, about the political <Col N="2115" /> events which took place in the past four or five years, but I will find another platform to discuss them.  I am very interested to hear the Minister's position.  We will have plenty of opportunity between this and June to air our views.  Will the power being given to the development company in this Bill be limited by the power the Minister for the Marine is asking this House to give in the other Bill?</P>

      <P>In relation to subsection (2) and the areas mentioned in this section of the Bill &mdash; I do not propose to read them out &mdash; I would like to ask the Minister a direct question.  Earlier the Minister in his response referred to Structural and Regional Funds.  This is an area of great importance and of interest obviously not alone in the mid-west but every-where, but in the context of this Bill it is of interest specifically in the mid-west. Am I to take it from his response that the Shannon Free Airport Development Company are the primary body responsible in this area for formulating planning within this area and that they would be used for approaches to Europe in the context of seeking funding?  Are they the body the Government are listening to exclusively and primarily with regard to the national plan?  If so, have all the other bodies in the area been made aware of that fact?  When was this established? I understand there is confusion on this specific point.  I was very interested when the Minister raised this matter this evening.  It would be a great help if he could now nail down that point and tell us specifically if Shannon Free Airport Development Company are speicifically responsible and charged with this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the Minister's last response I shall try to confine myself directly to the purport of this Bill. There is one aspect of the Bill to which I would like the Minister to reply directly, that is, his statement that there would be no additional cost to SFADCo.  I am alarmed to be informed of that because north Kerry is now in this area but it is <Col N="2116" /> either so insignificant or so incon-sequential that it does not require any additional expenditure.  I would like if the Minister would clarify if funds will be transferred from the IDA to SFADCo? Will the Government give funding?  After all, we received a message from the Government on today's Order Paper to authorise funds in relation to what we are doing here this evening.  What sort of money are we talking about?  Is the Minister saying money is not required or, that money will be required for this additional responsibility SFADCo are taking on?</P>
      <P>In relation to the parishes from the register of electors in Offaly and north Kerry, can the Minister give me an indication of what I should say to the people in, perhaps, Abbeydorney, Ballyhorgan, Kilflynn, Duagh, Lixnaw, Lisselton, or other areas?  Is there a specific message to be taken from the passage of this Bill? Can I tell them that because of the transfer from the IDA to SFADCo, they will see some industry, there will be some action around the place and that is why the Government are making this move? Is there a specific message from the Government or a specific sales pitch in relation to Kilfeighny, Ennismore, Gunsborough, Knocknagoshel or other districts, or will it be much the same, that what we are talking about is emigration and unemployment or, is the Minister saying he will stand over this and that I can go back to the people in my constituency at the weekend and tell them there is a new move to create industry and to create opportunities for employment in these areas?  The Minister told us the situation he inherited in 1987 but he will have read the speeches made in this House by the Leader of the Opposition and by the chairmen of the health boards, in the previous four years.  There was not enough money not only in Ireland but in Europe to satisfy the expenditure which Fianna Fáil wanted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the query which Deputy Spring raised about what sort of message he could bring back to the people in the electoral area of north <Col N="2118" /> Kerry which are included in the Bill it is certainly the judgment of the Government that including north Kerry in the SFADCo region would improve the opportunities available to north Kerry to acquire more industry.  I have no doubt he will fully support us in that.  We also hope that it will improve tourist potential in the area.</P>
      <P>Regarding Deputy Cullen's question about Structural Funds and the role SFADCo played in the preparation of the projects for structural funding for the mid-west region, they were the authority who prepared and submitted them to the personnel at Government level, who examined them before they were sent to the Commission.  I hope that clarifies that particular question.</P>
      <P>For Deputy Spring's information, one of the reasons which helped us decide on increasing the remit of SFADCo to take in north Kerry was that we felt that bringing north Kerry into the mid-west region would exploit the very clear links that now exist between Limerick and Tralee and that it would enable this link to be used as a lever for development.  As the Deputy is aware the Limerick-Tralee route is a very heavy tourist route and bringing it into one region will allow the tourism potential along that route to be maximised.  Tralee Regional Technical College has a very strong tradition with regard to programmes and courses which assist economic development in the area. There is a close association on the education-industry interfaces established by the RTC in Tralee and the designation of NIHE, Limerick, with university status&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I believe it is unwise to divide areas and I would ask the Minister to bear in mind the division of parishes. County Offaly is being divided in two&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is saying that there will now be an industry on both sides of the parish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>Hopefully, but it is doubtful and we will have to work in an effort to ensure that it comes to pass.  It is a tragedy that County Offaly is being divided but it is even worse to see parishes being divided.  I should like some of the areas I have mentioned to be included in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other areas referred to in section 2 are Kinnity, Knockbarron, Lea, Letter and the District Electoral Division of Aghancon. Some of those areas are included in the Slieve Bloom area.  A Slieve Bloom development association has been in existence for the past 15 to 18 years and this association have received numerous awards for their approach to tourism development and the provision of small industries.  They are a community based organisation made up of people who voluntarily give of their time.  I would ask <Col N="2120" /> the Minister to keep the views of this association in mind.  The people of County Offaly have been working in co-operation with the people of County Laois in the development of tourism in the Slieve Bloom area but because the Slieve Bloom area is now being divided in two &mdash; two-thirds of the Slieve Bloom area is in County Laois and one third in County Offaly &mdash; the work carried out by these people will also be divided. SFADCo will be responsible for the development of tourism in the Slieve Bloom area of County Offaly whereas I presume Bord Fáilte will be responsible for tourism development in the Slieve Bloom area of County Laois.  I put it to the Minister that sub-dividing such an area will lead to problems with regard to development plans for tourism in that area.</P>
    <P>There are beautiful sign posts in the Slieve Bloom area of County Offaly which indicate where the beauty spots are but there are very bad roads in these areas.  It is important that the organisation responsible for tourism development in this area, whether it is SFADCo or Bord Fáilte, have sufficient funds available to help the county councils provide roads in these areas.  It is essential that this type of division of responsibility should be avoided.  It is wrong that the Slieve Bloom mountain is being divided because the people in County Offaly who have contributed so much for so long will be unable to continue with their plans for the development of the area.  I do not think this point has been appreciated either by the Minister or the officials in the Department.  Since SFADCo have taken over responsibility for this area the personnel and staff involved have worked extremely hard.  They have been most helpful and co-operative.  However, dividing responsibility for this area in my constituency has met with disapproval and disappointment by the people affected.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to concede how he can change this situation before the Bill comes before the Seanad.  Even at this stage I would be in favour of putting down an amendment on Report Stage to <Col N="2121" /> see if this section could be amended.  By dividing this area the heart has been knocked out of the people who have contributed so much up to now.  This is an unwise move and no consultation took place with anybody on the matter.  This decision was announced on, I think, 28 December but no consultation took place and the people in my area are very resentful and upset about this.</P>
    <P>I am speaking because the Bill affects my area, Deputy Spring is speaking as it affects north Kerry, Deputy Carey is speaking as it affects Clare and Deputy Lowry and others as it affects their areas. The people in my area are disappointed and upset that this division has taken place.  Ballyboy is part of Kilcormac parish but that area has also been excluded.  If one was to draw a line around the area, Ballyboy would come within that line and I believe it should be included in the Bill.  The IDA have a very extensive budget and if SFADCo are to do their job in County Offaly they will need to get some increase in their funds. The Minister should be seeing to that. Without sufficient funds, I cannot see enough tourism development taking place in the south Kerry area.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Deputies Spring and Carey rose.</i>
    </P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Spring stood up first.  The Minister did not answer my question and I intervened three times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps while I am seeking to prise some information from the Minister he will also be considering a reasonable response to Deputy Carey. One aspect on which I would like some clarification from the Minister is that of the role of SFADCo as opposed to that of the Shannon Estuarial Authority which, it would appear, the Government are intent on setting up in the coming weeks, that is, if the rod angling industry does not bring them all down on their heads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The aspect on which I seek information &mdash; at a time when we hear much talk about rolling back the State and taking it away from freedom of movement and of <Col N="2122" /> thinking &mdash; is how SFADCo and the new Estuarial Authority will dovetail their responsibilities.  I envisage that the new Authority, wherever they are located, will be developing a serious marketing programme to sell an estuary which we are led to believe has unrivalled deep water and unrivalled possibilities for shipping. Because of SFADCo's role in relation to industry and tourism and the role that will be given to the Estuarial Authority do I take it that there is a distinct possibility that industrialists may well approach the Estuarial Authority in relation to projects that may well happen to fall within the industrial ambit of SFADCo, thereby bringing about a certain amount of duplication?</P>
    <P>Could the Minister clarify for me what discussions have taken place between the Department of Industry and Commerce and the Department of the Marine, discussions which I assume have taken place to avoid duplication in the areas of promotion. The <i>raison d'etre</i> for promotion is obviously to attract industry and shipping movement into the area.  I assume a certain amount of the shipping promotion will overlap with industry.  Does the Minister consider that it would be wiser if we were talking about having a single body? It is bad enough to have the two promotional bodies competing with one another &mdash; and I am convinced, and will remain so, that they are competing with one another and costing the taxayer more money.</P>
    <P>Will not that be exacerbated by virtue of the fact that yet again in what is, relatively speaking, a small land mass and a small population centre, we are talking about creating yet another body?  We will have the IDA working in south Kerry, SFADCo in north Kerry and the Shannon Estuarial Authority working within part of north Kerry and part of Limerick and Clare.  There will be some very confused people in localities in County Kerry.  I can envisage people addressing one another in the morning across the divide when they meet at the creamery &mdash; or at the Kerry co-op truck as it is nowadays &mdash; asking how things are with the IDA and how things are with SFADCo, <Col N="2123" /> whether the climate is any better in south Kerry now under the IDA, or if there are still the same problems that have been there in north Kerry over the past number of years.</P>
    <P>I would particularly like the Minister to clarify for me and the House, before we give consent to section 2 of this Bill, what discussions have taken place between the Department of Industry and Commerce and the Department of the Marine and how he envisages the distinct role being played by both in attracting industry to the respective areas.  We are talking, in effect, about a number of parishes listed in section 2, the parishes of Beale, Tarbert and Ballylongford, which will also be very much within the ambit of the Shannon Estuarial Authority Bill which the Government are hoping to get through this House in the coming weeks. How does the Minister envisage both bodies being charged with the setting up of industry, be it marine, or shipping, or other industry in these areas?  Is there not a distinct possibility of major duplication yet again?</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>How does the Minister of State envisage the proper functioning of the new Authority, given the resources that are available?  Are we really talking about an extension of the area, a fairly drastic extension as far as the present region is concerned, to be serviced effectively, efficiently with a budget that is £500,000 less than it was?  Is the Minister really serious about serving the extended area?  I refer in particular to parts of my own constituency at present under the remit of the Industrial Development Authority.  I fear that the southern parts of County Offaly will be transferred from being the hind tit of the IDA midland region to becoming the hind tit of the SFADCo region.  I look for certain assurances from the Minister in this regard considering the number of townlands in west Offaly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are dealing with the heart of the Shannon Valley, an area with tremendous tourist potential and one which is lagging well behind other areas.  I hope <Col N="2124" /> the new Authority will give precedence to developing the tourist potential not alone of the Shannon waterways from Athlone down to Lough Reagh, but also the Grand Canal waterways of west Offaly.  Given the current budget available to the Authority I fail to see, how any great progress can be made for the benefit of the people of that area.</P>
    <P>Before we agree to this extension, is the Minister in a position to give us some assurances on the staffing that will be available in the Offaly region?  Again, it is particularly important for us to address this before this House gives consent to the elaborate extension as envisaged in the Bill.  If the legislation is passed I would like to see the Authority looking seriously at conservation tourism in the midland plains of west Offaly in conjunction with both private turf development and Bord na Móna.  There is marvellous potential there as far as bog oak is concerned and the general conservation of the midland peatlands.  With a sum of £500,000 less for an extended area, I do not think the Minister is taking the legislation seriously at all.  These matters are of extreme importance to my constituents and the Minister should give the necessary assurances before we proceed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>My fellow Deputies from the Offaly region are very concerned about their area being included in the tourist remit of this Bill.  This section outlines the areas that are to be included. In the course of his previous contribution, the Minister said that since 1988, SFADCo have assumed responsibility for tourism in their region.  He told us that within that there are people from a tourism council called Shannonside that was self sufficient and which has now become a Shannonside tourism council heavily dependent on the taxpayer, which I suppose is beside the point.  However, it is worth noting that the body the Minister abolished was self sufficient and that the new one is now dependent on the State. In any case, the membership of this council is to include people who were represented on the old Shannonside.  There <Col N="2125" /> will also be people from the wrong side of the Slieve Bloom Mountains and from the wrong side of Kilcormac parish. There will also be people from Beale, Carrig, Lislaughtin, Tarmon and Tarbert which is along the southern bank of the Shannon in the north Kerry area.</P>
      <P>Will the proposed Shannon Estuarial Development Corporation, who are also seeking powers from this Dáil with regard to the tourism remit they expect to have for the Shannon estuary, be included by Shannon Development on the Shannonside advisory council?  If so, will they have overall responsibility for the Shannon estuary and other areas of north Kerry so ably illustrated by Deputy Spring and areas of south Offaly equally ably illustrated by Deputy Enright and Deputy Flanagan?  Will they include members of the proposed Shannon Estuarial Development Corporation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisFoley" hpid="Mr. Foley Mr. Foley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to refer to the industrial position in regard to the region. Deputy Spring made a very good point a while ago and, in fairness to him, when he was in Government he was instrumental in opening an IDA office in Tralee.  The Minister mentioned that SFADCo were taking over the north Kerry region and they opened an office in Killarney in a blaze of publicity.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill as it is a positive step for north Kerry.  We have a lot to gain from becoming involved with SFADCo in regard to industrial development and I look forward to progress being made.  However, I am slightly concerned about the tourism side and I support the point made by Deputy Enright.  There will be also duplication in so far as Kerry is concerned because, heretofore, we were within the Cork-Kerry region.  I should like north Kerry to be included in a Kerry promotion by agreement with Cork and Kerry tourism.  The mid-west region, with the inclusion of north Kerry, will now become a major tourist attraction as we have wonderful scenery and a lot to offer.  Will the Minister ask SFADCo to issue a supplement to their brochures illustrating north Kerry?</P>

      <P>Queries were raised about the function of Shannonside and their effectiveness in relation to tourism promotion.  The remit of SFADCo to include north Kerry means that they will take over the tourist functions currently exercised by the Cork and Kerry Regional Tourism Organisation in that area.  That organisation, like all the other regional organisations, is limited by a guarantee to over 700 subscribing members drawn from the industry over the entire Cork-Kerry region and local authorities.  The organisation operates in accordance with and under the direction of Bord Fáilte.</P>
      <P>SFADCo would assume functions covering visitor information services, product development and the promotion of north Kerry in the domestic market.  Bord Fáilte would continue to retain the responsibility for the promotion of the area overseas and for the inspection and registration of tourist accommodation.  SFADCo have already met with the Cork Kerry Regional Tourism Organisation and Bord Fáilte to prepare the ground work for the transfer of functions to SFADCo.  No problems are envisaged in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the meantime the north Kerry area <Col N="2128" /> is to be included in the 1989 promotional literature of the Cork Kerry Regional Tourism Organisation, and SFADCo will include supplements on north Kerry in their promotional literature.  I have no doubt that Deputy Spring, who claimed that an advertisement which appeared in a daily newspaper &mdash; which I did not see &mdash; contained no reference to north Kerry, would accept as I do that it would be inappropriate to include north Kerry until this Bill has become law.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>SFADCo would also provide visitor information services to visitors to north Kerry and operate the tourist information office in Tralee.  I am pleased to inform the House that in 1988 this office handled 67,000 personal callers and booked over 4,500 bed nights, which is an impressive performance.  SFADCo would be involved in encouraging the development of tourism products, visitor attractions and facilities in the north Kerry area with the co-operation and investment of tourism interests and with the aid of European Community Structural Funds.  All applications for European Community Structural Funds in respect of north Kerry have been passed on to SFADCo by the Cork-Kerry Regional Tourism Organisation and are being dealt with by the mid-west sub-regional planning group.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Spring and Deputy Foley are well aware, north Kerry has many tourist attractions, such as the cultural activities offered by Siamsa Tíre and Comhaltas Ceolteóirí Éireann and Listowel Writers Week&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>SFADCo would be responsible for the promotion of north Kerry in the home market and would work closely with Bord Fáilte in the promotion of north Kerry overseas.  Bord Fáilte, as I have already stated, are responsible for the marketing and promotion of Irish tourism overseas.</P>
      <P>Just as they did when assuming responsibility for the promotion of tourism in the Shannonside region SFADCo would enter into discussions with local authorities and tourism interests in the north Kerry area so as to ensure that they continue to make financial contributions to the tourism effort for the area in 1989. Last year income from these sources and that generated from commercial activities of the Tralee tourist information office came to approximately £34,000. Even though it has proved impossible to apportion Bord Fáilte's subvention to specific areas they consider their contribution to north Kerry as negligible in view of the size of the area and the healthy financial position of the Tralee tourist information office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Carey made a number of points in relation to the involvement of the tourism consultative councils.  As he <Col N="2130" /> is well aware, and I think I have adverted to this already, SFADCo have a tourism consultative council for the Shannonside region.  This council is chaired by a representative of SFADCo and comprises of representatives drawn from industry in the Shannonside region and representatives of most of the interested bodies in the area.</P>

      <P>Let me reiterate what I have said already.  Two Bills were placed before the House following a Government decision.  There is close co-ordination between the Department of Industry and Commerce who have responsibility for the Shannon Free Airport Development Company Limited (Amendment) Bill, 1988 and the Department of the Marine who have responsibility for the Harbours (Shannon Estuary Development Corporation) Bill, 1988.  I have no intention of getting involved in a debate on that Bill.  The Deputy will have an opportunity to discuss that Bill when it comes before the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>For the information of Deputy Carey, since he is talking so much about the Shannon Estuary, let me make a number of points even though I do not want to get involved in a debate on that Bill.  Another logical reason for extending the remit of SFADCo is that it is increasingly being recognised that the Shannon region is a distinct area and has significant potential for development.  It has long been recognised that the estuary is a tremendous natural asset to the region. It has many advantages from an industrial and tourism point of view.  Among the facilities available along the estuary are a good water supply, up to 90,000 cubic metres or 20 million gallons per day can be made available; an electricity supply available from power stations at Tarbert and Moneypoint; good harbour facilities including bulk, solid and liquid pipeline loading facilities at Moneypoint and Aughinish; a supply of natural gas available by pipeline to a point in the estuary between Limerick and Aughinish; large oil storage and handling capacities and a coal handling facility at the Moneypoint site.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Up to now for industrial development purposes the Clare and Limerick portion of the estuary as it was included in the mid-west region was promoted by Shannon Development while the north Kerry area was promoted by the IDA as it was included in the south-west region.  This division did not help in the drawing up of an integrated development plan for the estuary.  Having one unified region would <Col N="2132" /> allow the adoption of a more comprehensive approach towards planning, promotion and development of the estuary, which could be promoted and marketed as one unit.</P>

      <P>Economic investigations and other studies could be carried out in respect of the entire estuary which could be developed without the disadvantage of internal demarcation. Another example of the Government's commitment to developing the estuary as a coherent unit is the decision to establish a single harbour authority for the river mouth.  There are obviously good, compelling reasons why this decision has been taken.</P>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Carey, the Shannon Estuary Development Corporation will deal only with port and marine related matters &mdash; I have said that &mdash; because they are functions of the Department of the Marine.  There will be no duplication of activities as far as SFADCo are concerned. I hope that answers it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has outlined a considerable amount of work to be undertaken by SFADCo in different areas.  He has mentioned the area I represent, my home area, where questions are being asked of me about what is happening in the Birr south Offaly west areas.  I wish to put a couple of simple questions to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What exactly will be the brief of SFADCo in regard to tourism development in this whole area?  Will SFADCo be responsible for the development of tourism for the home market in south and west Offaly?  Secondly, will SFADCo or Bord Fáilte be responsible for tourism development in south and west Offaly? Which of them will be responsible for the promotion of tourism from overseas in south and west Offaly, in other words in <Col N="2133" /> Kilcormac, Ferbane, Cloghan and Shan-nonbridge? Thirdly, Clonmacnoise is famous throughout Europe and attracts huge numbers of visitors each year.  Will it to be included under SFADCo?  It appears to me that it is not being included, although it seems part of the area there is being included.</P>
    <P>Excellent hotels have been developed there.  The River Shannon comes right across the area.  People have spent a considerable amount of money developing boating on the Shannon which brings in numbers of visitors from Germany, France, Britain and all across Europe who spend a great deal of money there each year.  Bord Fáilte have been doing certain promotional work attracting visitors from Europe.  Who is to be responsible for that now?</P>
    <P>There are a number of lakes in the south Offaly-North Tipperary area which are used for fishing and boating.  Who is to be responsible for them?  We have been reasonably successful with golfing and it has been well promoted.  Who is to be responsible for that?  People there own a number of stables and horses are available for hire and so on.  Those people have spent a great deal of money to attract overseas visitors.  Who is to be responsible there?  I ask the Minister to outline what will happen here.</P>
    <P>The IDA will be responsible for part of Offaly in regard to industrial development. They will be responsible for the remainder of my constituency and for Deputy Flanagan's constituency.  Part of Offaly is to be under the SFADCo remit. Whatever development for industrial purposes takes place, I hope there will not be demarcation lines, red lines or lines of division.  We have enough divisions, in this country without having more in Laois-Offaly.  We should try to promote Ireland.  Be it SFADCo, the IDA or Bord Fáilte, we should promote Ireland and attract investment and tourists into Ireland.  I hope there will be no overlapping due to certain individualistic approaches by different organisations.  It is important that that should be avoided.</P>
    <P>In regard to the literature, if Bord <Col N="2134" /> Fáilte are doing the promotion their brochures should cover all the area, and similarly for SFADCo.  In the past few weeks mention has been made of some areas not being included by the IDA in their promotions for industrial purposes.  I have not seen the brochures referred to, but whatever areas are included under the IDA, SFADCo or Bord Fáilte, we all represent different parts of Ireland but we represent the one country and that should be in the forefront of our minds. I have described the position to the Minister. There is a great deal of disappointment and upset in regard to the Slieve Bloom area.</P>
    <P>We will not push this matter to a vote tonight.  It will be coming before the Seanad.  I ask the Minister to consult with his advisers to see if we can find an overall strategic approach to Slieve Bloom. People have devoted a lifetime to the development of that area when to do so was unpopular, when nobody knew about Slieve Bloom.  People worked away night after night in cold schools and halls promoting the area.  After all that work the prospect of the area being divided is causing problems and upset.  I ask the Minister to see if it can be rectified.  I do not believe it was envisaged or even remotely in mind that such a situation could arise when this legislation was being drafted or these Cabinet decisions were taken.  A great deal of work will now be seen to have gone a-begging when too many volunteers have contributed so much.</P>
    <P>In the Shannon area wonderful tourism work is being done in a place called Lusmagh in County Offaly.  Old canals have been developed that had gone dry because water was not allowed into them. The work there was all done by hand because for grant purposes under the schemes the people were not allowed to bring in machines.  By pure muscle and sweat those people did a great deal of development work.  I do not know whether SFADCo at present can contribute financially towards these works or the development of this area.</P>
    <P>The people in that area have done Trojan work.  They are planning to develop trout, salmon and all types of <Col N="2135" /> fish.  An effort should be made by SFADCo to assist these people further. I have found the staff of SFADCo to be professional, hard working and enterprising in their approach.  The Minister should ensure that there will not be further divisions in the area.  It must be sorted out in consultation with the people concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked the Minister on previous occasions to give a clear indication that there will not be a duplication of power and responsibility.  The Minister has not, however, conceded one iota in regard to duplication or lines of demarcation. It is most frustrating not to get an answer on this matter.  When the Minister is replying he will talk about powers in relation to tourism which will be exercised by SFADCo, but many of these powers are also to be exercised by the Shannon Estuary Development Corporation. I have already named the areas affected in north Kerry.  Under the Harbours (Shannon Estuary Development Corporation) Bill, 1988, it is proposed in section 4 (1) (a) that the functions of the corporation shall be to promote, coordinate and develop, in conjunction with Bord Fáilte Éireann, the Industrial Development Authority, the Shannon Free Airport Development Company Limited, and the appropriate local authority, investment in marine-related industrial, tourist recreational and amenity facilities....</P>

Have arrangements been made for a transfer of these properties to SFADCo?  Some of the properties have been on the open market for a considerable time and prices have been negotiated for them.  Will the money accruing be transferred to SFADCo?  It would assist in meeting the shortfall which currently exists.  I am quite concerned that lack of funding will inhibit SFADCo in fulfilling their role and responsibilities in this extended area.</P>

      <P>Regarding Deputy Enright's points, west and south-west Offaly have been in the mid-west region under the aegis of SFADCo since 1983 and since that time SFADCo have had responsibility for small industries there.  As and from 1 January last year, SFADCo also assumed responsibility for large and medium-sized industry and tourism in that area.  There is a demarcation in regard to the promotion of tourism.  SFADCo promote tourism on the domestic market, while Bord Fáilte promote tourism on the overseas market.  The two bodies will work hand in hand to promote Offaly.  Obviously Bord Fáilte promote all activities in parts of Offaly not included in the SFADCo administrative area.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Ruairí Quinn gave notice of his intention to raise on the Adjournment the subject matter of the design, construction and financing of certain schools under the aegis of the Department of Education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to express my gratitude to the Chair for seeing fit to give me permission to raise this matter tonight, despite the many claims on Adjournment time.  As the House will be aware, I have been seeking to raise this matter for some time.  To many outsiders <Col N="2139" /> this issue may appear to be professionally intricate and of interest to a minority but it relates to the specific waste of £750,000 of taxpayers' money which has already been paid out, and the legal complications in relation to consequential claims which may arise if the Government persist in pursuing a policy which is part and parcel of the <i>nouvelle economique</i> to translate a phrase from culinary language.  The policy seems to be <i>de rigueur</i> with this new political consensus.</P>
      <P>I am referring to the fashion that has won widespread acclaim in the Department of Finance for the procurement of buildings for public use, be they offices or, as in this case, schools by reference not to the traditional method with which every Member is familiar but by the use of a method that is known in the construction industry as developer competitions. I should like to ask the Minister of State at the Department of Education, who is present, if he will confirm, in the first instance, that the Department of Education have been obliged, indeed coerced, by the Department of Finance to go down that policy road in respect of the three schools.  The Minister of State, who is not accompanied by his technical officials tonight, may, or may not, have that information with him and if he does not have it to hand perhaps he will, at a later date, furnish it to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Three schools were put out for design tender to three different design teams working to a brief prepared by the building unit of the Department of Education, a unit whose professional and technical competence is recognised by the private sector design profession.  A set of comprehensive documents were prepared and fees were paid in accordance with the due process agreed between the relative institutions representing the profession and the Department of Education.  The total amount involved was £750,000.  The <Col N="2140" /> next stage was for those three schools to go for tender for construction in the conventional way, a process with which the House will be familiar, public advertisement followed by the submission by reputable contractors of a tender based on the documentation available.  The most acceptable price, not necessarily the lowest price, is then recommended and the work commences.  The protection of the citizen as taxpayer, and the protection of the occupant and user of the building, would then fall into place in accordance with established procedures and law.</P>
    <P>It is because the Government want to find an alternative way to finance building projects which they cannot do publicly throughout the public capital programme that they have come up with a formula known as the developer competitions. Under that formula, the State acquires property on the never-never, or through a complicated and relatively sophisticated form of hire purchase &mdash; in this instance, schools &mdash; which it would otherwise have to pay for in the traditional way through an allocation of taxpayers' money put into the budget and the Book of Estimates through the public capital programme. Everybody in the world of reality knows that if one pays cash up front for any commodity, particularly one of some substance like a school, one gets the best value possible, that if one raises a loan from a bank one has to pay interest leaving a higher cost on top of the first option. Everybody knows that the dearest way to buy anything is through a hire-purchase company.  The only people who traditionally have to resort to that method of purchasing are the most vulnerable and the least well positioned people economically.</P>
    <P>What the State is doing in this instance is not only wasting the £750,000 of taxpayers' money that has been paid out to date but is buying three sets of buildings in the dearest manner possible because <Col N="2141" /> of the rolled up interest charges that will accumulate over the 20 to 25 years under this developer competition.  I should like to put on record the view of the chairman of the Society of Chartered Surveyors, Mr. Michael Webb, as reported in the property supplement of the issue of <i>The Irish Times</i> of 9 February last.  Mr. Webb, a professional quantity surveyor who is renowned in the profession and with no particular axe to grind, was referring to the waste related to developer competitions. He stated:</P>
    <P>On top of all this, the Department of Education decided to join the band-wagon. But they haven't got any new schools on the horizon.  So they decide to redesign three schools for which full designs and bills of quantities have already been prepared &mdash; for which £750,000 has already been spent on fees, £750,000 of our, the taxpayers, money, is to be wasted on a futile exercise with no point or no purpose. </P>
    <P>In reality it would probably be fairer from the political point of view of democratic accountability if the Minister for Finance was present to reply to the debate.  It is because he is not present that I will confine my comments specifically to the question of schools, but their relevance extends to the whole question of developer competitions.  I submit that the Government are engaged in a method of financing the construction of buildings, specifically schools but also offices &mdash; some are under construction and others are almost complete &mdash; through a sleight of hand which they think makes it look cheaper from an overall financial perception. However, no matter how attractive that mechanism may appear to the people in the Department of Finance and the subservient Office of Public Works or, indeed, the Department of Education, it is my view and that of the Institute of Architects, of the Construction Industry Federation and of a <Col N="2142" /> large number of people who have some specific knowledge in this area that this is a very wasteful, inefficient and perhaps very irresponsible way of going about the community's business because of the way in which liability with respect to the future performance of these buildings might be affected in the event of defects or faults manifesting themselves.  We are given to understand that liability which currently prevails and is accountable under the existing arrangements would be waived under the terms and conditions of developer competitions, and perhaps the Minister could clarify this.</P>
    <P>Let me quote from a note I obtained from the Royal Institute of Architects in Ireland who are this year celebrating 150 years of professional incorporation on this island and, therefore, have some degree of wisdom:</P>
    <P>The following factors should be considered:</P>
    <P> 1.  In three of the four community schools proposed, full tender documents have been prepared and fees paid to the design teams.</P>
    <P>2.  It would appear that the system of appointment could allow the design teams to sue for the full balance of fees due even if they are not appointed to the contracts.</P>
    <P>3.  The Department of Education has embarked on this process in the knowledge of the legal difficulties with regard to fees and copyright.  The legal opinion is that the design teams concerned would have right of action for the balance of fees due for the entire contract.  Representatives of the Institute are due to meet the Minister for Education on 8 March next to discuss the situation.  </P>
    <P>There follows a general observation as follows:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2143" /> General</P>
    <P> 1.  Developer Competitions represent a form of off-balance sheet financing, similar to leasing which would ultimately devolve to the taxpayer to pay.</P>
    <P>2.  Developer Competition documents, as produced by the Government, provide indemnity to the Developers in respect of defects, which absolve the Developers from responsibility in these areas.  This has been done to enable the Developer to borrow from the financial institutions.</P>
    <P>3.  The Institute has discussed funding arrangements with the various financial institutions that could allow the State to finance buildings in this way while retaining the independence of professional consultants and proper accountability for the State.  </P>
    <P>Before I go on to make a proposal to the Minister, I want to state that it is my understanding that on 14 February this year the Construction Industry Federation which represents the main contractors in the construction industry which is the largest single employer after the agricultural sector in our economy made the following point: that developer competitions would not be opposed in principle.  I concur with that view but I am deeply worried about the way in which the Government are administering it.  They, like myself, are concerned at the waste of resources which is perceived as the major problem and agree that measures should be taken to reduce that waste.  A code of practice should be drawn up to permit developer competitions along the lines which they set out.</P>
    <P>I want to confine my final remarks to these three explicit proposals.  There is a clear waste of money involved potentially if the Minister pursues his course.  That has been the net point raised here tonight <Col N="2144" /> and I would like the Minister to address it.  The industry, at all levels, is not against the concept of developer competitions, but we are totally opposed to the way in which it is currently managed and operated. There is, undoubtedly, a waste of resources at all levels.  We would argue that the perceived benefits in terms of net value to the taxpayer through the administrators in the Department of Finance can be maintained if certain ground rules and methods of operation are taken on board by the Department of Finance in the main and by the Department of Education in particular.</P>
    <P>I will not try to put on the record tonight the minutiae of such ground rules but they are available.  The principle essentially is to eliminate waste, retain competition, invite a limited number of people to go to the first stage with regard to design and, having satisfied oneself with regard to the suitability of the design from a number of different groups and having come up with a preferred design one would then go to the next stage in relation to cost and subsequently in relation to financing.  That is a very tight summary of what is a much more elaborate process.  Thus we would get the benefits of both worlds.  Most important, the industry at all levels would not be led up the garden path.</P>
    <P>Because of the downturn in the economy generally two or three years ago people were so hungry for work that they would compete against each other either at no cost or on the possibility of recouping that cost down the road.  That is no longer the case and anyway, if people lose on the first round, it is their obligation &mdash; and they are certainly exhorted to do so by their bank manager &mdash; to try to recoup that further on.  It is not in the interests of the community to try to impoverish or impose unnecessary costs on any sector of industry or on any sector of the community and the present operation of developer competitions leads to that.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2145" /> In relation to the proposed meeting on 8 March or in relation to any way in which the Department of Education propose to use this mechanism, I suggest to the Minister that, before he goes any further, he should open up a line of discussion through the building unit which is well respected within the profession and within the industry and with the relevant institutions to agree terms and conditions and means of operation that would meet with general approval.</P>
    <P>I want to restate that there is no opposition in principle to the concept of developer competitions.  There is an articulated concern across the spectrum. The architectural, quantity surveyoring and engineering professions are not a hot bed of revolutionary socialism so the fact that I am hearing it from them is not to be seen in any party political sense.  I am concerned that this community is imposing additional costs on itself which it could avoid while, at the same time, retaining some of the benefits that undoubtedly exist in keener pricing and keener competition that may come from developer competitions.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that off-balancesheet financing has considerable attractions for any administration and it is not the concern of the industry or the professions what option the Government wish to take in that regard.  That is for a wider audience and a different kind of debate.  The net point I make, specifically in relation to the schools, is that this is the wrong way to introduce developer competition in the Department of Education. If it is a question that the Department of Education are being coerced by the Department of Finance perhaps, through whatever political convention, that coercion might be relieved or some satisfactory resolution obtained.</P>
    <P>In the broader sense and I know the Minister is part of a Government who have collective responsibility, I have to conclude by saying that this is not the <Col N="2146" /> way to go about getting the kind of buildings we need and can afford.  There is a better way.  The Minister should please respond to this plea by opening up meaningful discussions with the relevant institutions and the relevant sectors of industry in the spirit of social dialogue that is so much part of the new <i>bon mot</i> of the 1992 project.  We should get the formula right.  There is no argument about the principle but there is great concern about the way in which the scheme is being currently operated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. F. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank Deputy Quinn for his contribution. I will take up some of the points he made later but first I will give some of the background to the matter and dispel any misunderstandings there may be about this project.</P>
      <P>It is a trial scheme as the Deputy said, which is merely confined at this stage to just four post primary schools.  Its extension to other such projects has not even been considered and will not be until such time as the pilot scheme has been fully evaluated and found to be satisfactory. If, on the other hand, it transpires at any stage that the experiment is not successful, it will be discontinued.</P>
      <P>My purpose and that of the Minister in initiating the design, finance and construct scheme for post primary building projects was to examine the feasibility of funding such projects from sources other than from State funds.  The scheme is being introduced on a pilot basis initially and should it prove to be uneconomical, when compared with the conventional system of funding, then, as I have already said, it will be terminated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the scheme as currently proposed, developers may be invited to submit proposals to design, finance and construct four post-primary building projects on the basis that the developers would meet all related costs and that the <Col N="2147" /> completed developments would be made available to the State on a deferred payment basis over 20 years.  Accordingly, funding of the projects would be provided from outside the State sector and no payments by the State would arise until the completed buildings were handed over.</P>
    <P>The four building projects which have been selected to participate in the scheme are as follows: (a) Cashel: A new community school for 800 pupils to replace a vocational school, a convent secondary school and a Christian Brothers School; (b) Newcastlewest: A new secondary school for 550 pupils to replace two existing secondary schools, Scoil Mhuire and Scoil Íde Naofa; (c) Castlerea: An extension to the existing convent school to provide a new community school for 675 pupils, to replace a vocational school and a convent secondary school and (d) Newbridge: A new extension to bring the capacity of Newbridge College to 425 pupils.  It will be seen, therefore, that different categories of schools and structures have been selected so that the pilot scheme would be broadly representative of post-primary projects generally.  It was considered that this approach would make evaluation of the experiment of greater value.</P>
    <P>I was anxious also to facilitate centres such as Newcastlewest, Cashel and Castlerea in which rationalisation had been agreed with the school authorities in an effort to ensure that the required school accommodation would be provided as speedily as possible.  It will be appreciated that the current financial constraints under which my Department must operate its building programme inevitably affects the rate of progress of individual projects.  In these circumstances, I consider it important to examine any possible alternative methods of financing projects, particularly at centres where rationalisation has been agreed so the necessary facilities <Col N="2148" /> could be provided at these centres without undue delay.</P>
    <P>The pilot scheme, as the Deputy may know, was publicised in the daily newspapers and the present position is that applications have been received from developers interested in submitting tenders. These applications are at present being examined in my Department.  The legal formalities arising from the proposal are also being considered in consultation with the Department's legal advisers and while these are complex, I am hopeful that the difficulties will be resolved and the matter can be finalised in the near future.  It is my intention to proceed with the invitation of tenders as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of designing of the projects, it is true that designs have already been prepared.  It was felt however, that it would be more attractive to developers if they had the possible option of using the existing designs or of presenting their own.</P>
    <P>The relevant professional bodies have written to the Minister and have indicated that they wish to discuss constructive proposals with her with a view to resolving general difficulties in relation to the scheme.  As the Deputy has said, a meeting for that purpose has been arranged and the Minister will consider carefully the matters put forward by the relevant professional bodies during the course of that meeting.</P>
    <P>With regard to a number of points specifically made by Deputy Quinn, first there is no question of the Department of Education being coerced into anything by the Department of Finance.  This was a Government decision taken in an effort to establish if it would be possible to make available school buildings of the best quality, faster and cheaper than has been done up to now.  The Department of Education, the Minister and I are enthusiastic about the possibilities that exist for the provision of these school <Col N="2149" /> buildings.  There is no sleight of hand involved and I reject completely that this is a wasteful, inefficient or irresponsible way to go about this task.</P>
    <P>I questioned Deputy Quinn on his difference of opinion regarding the scheme which is being proposed &mdash; I accept he does not argue in principle with the idea of inviting tenders for these projects by competition &mdash; and I understand his only objection is that he would prefer if a limited number of people were asked to design the projects.  There is of course, as Deputy Quinn will appreciate, a difficulty with that because the Department would be obliged to invite tenders from the professional bodies in the construction sector at large.  It simply would not be acceptable by Deputy Quinn or indeed by many other people to pick a selected number of people.  Therefore, it would be only correct that a general invitation be made to anybody who is interested in tendering, as has been done in this case.</P>
    <P>I take the point made by Deputy Quinn that if a large number of people go through the fairly expensive business of designing projects of this size, because there can be only one winner, there will be a number of losers.  I would not argue with that but Deputy Quinn must accept that it would be impossible for the Department to invite selected individuals to design the projects as this would leave us open to accusations of choosing some professional people at the expense of others.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>There are mechanisms to deal with that but it is a fair point.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. F. Fahey Mr. F. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a fair point.  I am sure the Minister will be quite happy to hear the views of the professional bodies on that and to give consideration to what they have to say and to what the Deputy has said here this evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the other question raised by Deputy Quinn, that of liability with <Col N="2150" /> regard to future performance, I would find it rather difficult to accept &mdash; I have not the information here, I am giving a personal opinion &mdash; that the Department or indeed any public body would allow projects of this magnitude to proceed without the developers having full liability for providing the quality of buildings they contract to supply.  Clearly this is an issue which will be taken up in the course of consideration of the projects.  It is nothing new to select design, construct and finance proposals by competition at present.  I think it is fair to say that the State is getting very good quality buildings at a very competitive price.  That, at the end of the day, is what this scheme is all about.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I would remind the Minister that the most expensive housing this country ever built was the so-called low cost housing of the seventies which we are still paying for today.  The Government are now going down the same road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. F. Fahey Mr. F. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a big difference between a low cost housing scheme and the type of schemes that are now being put in place.  There is no question, in this scheme, of accepting low cost buildings or buildings of a lesser quality than those we are used to.  That is a very essential difference.  The quality of buildings will be as good if not better than those being made available at present.  An interesting statistic in the Department of Education for the past two years is that there have been reductions in the cost of primary school buildings of up to 40 per cent and 50 per cent compared with those which were provided three years ago.  That has come about as a result of much more effective operations in regard to the design and construction of primary schools.  We also have been able to build many more schools in the past two years and that is what we hope to continue doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2151" /> I hope Deputy Quinn and anybody who is interested would see the advantages of this scheme.  For our part in the Department, we will gladly take into account the points the Deputy has made here tonight.  We would be happy to have further discussions with him and indeed, as the Minister has already indicated, with the professional bodies involved so <Col N="2152" /> that we can sort out any difficulties that arise to the satisfaction of everybody involved but with the principal objective of providing good quality buildings at the lowest possible price and as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if his attention has been drawn to the fact that those who have worked and paid PRSI contributions for many years and who are obliged to emigrate for two years or more may not be entitled to welfare benefits; whether this <Col N="1975" /> may cause hardship; if he has any plans to change this situation; if so, the nature of such plans; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>To qualify for short-term benefits under the PRSI system two conditions must be fulfilled.  The claimant must have a minimum of 39 contributions paid since entry into insurance and must have a minimum of 39 contributions paid or credited in the governing contribution year.  To qualify for maximum rate of benefit a claimant must have at least 48 contributions paid or credited in the governing contribution year.  If a worker goes abroad or leaves the workforce for any other reason entitlement to short-term benefits is retained for as long as the contributions paid prior to leaving retain their currency.  This can be for up to two years.</P>
      <P>The contribution conditions are designed to ensure that claimants of short-term benefits have a recent attachment to the workforce.  A change in these conditions to give entitlement to benefits to persons who had left the workforce for long periods would have major financial and other implications for the social insurance system.</P>
      <P>A worker returning from abroad in the circumstances as described by the Deputy may, however, be eligible for unemployment assistance or supplementary welfare allowance depending on his circumstances.</P>
      <P>Entitlement to long-term benefits and pensions is determined by reference to the yearly average number of PRSI contributions which have been made over the claimant's working career and as such a gap in his record of a number of years while he was working abroad will not necessarily affect his entitlement to pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are special arrangements under EC Regulations on social security for migrant workers under which benefits earned through contributions in one member state can be paid in another and contributions paid in different member <Col N="1976" /> states can be aggregated for entitlement to benefits and pensions.</P>
    <P>In addition, my Department have embarked on a programme of bilateral agreements with countries which have traditionally been the destination of Irish emigrants.  These agreements operate principally on a similar basis to the EC Regulations on social security.  An agreement with Austria was signed last September and negotiations are underway with other countries such as Canada and Switzerland.  We have also started preliminary discussions with Australia and the USA.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>At present a person can be appointed on behalf of a claimant to receive and deal with amounts of benefit payable in respect of adult and child dependants.  Regulations under this provision allow the increase in respect of dependants to be paid directly to the dependent spouse of the claimant where the claimant does not provide the spouse with sufficient money for ordinary household expenditure because of personal problems such as gambling, alcoholism or drug addiction.  These payments are referred to as separate payments.</P>
      <P>I have been concerned for some time about the difficulties experienced in some cases by spouses in receipt of separate payments.  I have already indicated to the House that I intend to amend the existing provisions so as to enable the spouse to receive a greater proportion of the overall payment including the increases in respect of the adult and child dependants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Social Welfare Bill, 1989, which was circulated on Monday, contains a provision in section 16 which is designed to remove the restriction whereby only the increases in respect of dependants may be paid directly to the spouse.  This section will enable regulations to be made which will allow such amount of the social <Col N="1977" /> welfare payment as is considered reasonable in the circumstances to be paid directly to the spouse.  The detailed provisions to be made in this area are under consideration at present.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if his attention has been drawn to the anomaly under social welfare legislation, whereby the maternity benefit payable to a woman is artificially deflated if she has previously been on maternity leave in the year used for determining reckonable earnings as maternity benefit itself is not considered to be reckonable earnings; if he intends to take any action to deal with this anomaly; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The rate of payment under the Department's maternity allowance scheme for women in employment is set at 70 per cent of reckonable earnings in the relevant income tax year subject to a minimum payment of £76 per week and a maximum payment of £154 per week. The allowance is normally payable for a period of 14 weeks.</P>
      <P>The earnings used in the calculation of the amount of benefit payable under the scheme are the same as those used in the calculation of pay-related benefit payable with unemployment and disability benefits. Payments made in the relevant income tax year by way of social welfare entitlements, including maternity allowance, are not regarded as earnings and accordingly are not taking into account for the purposes of determining entitlements to any earnings related benefits. I consider, however, that the minimum guaranteed payment which I have already mentioned is an important financial safeguard in the circumstances mentioned by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>There are no plans at present to change the method of calculating entitlements under these schemes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The prescribed relative allowance scheme is intended to provide additional income maintenance support for households comprising a pensioner and a caring relative.  In order to qualify, the pensioner must be so incapacitated as to require care and attention on a full-time basis and the prescribed relative must be living with him or her solely for the purpose of providing such care.  The allowance is payable by way of an increase in pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The case to which the Deputy refers involves a farmer on a small holding. Following a review of entitlement on 29 February 1988, it emerged that the number of stock held on the farm had been increased significantly since the intitial date of award of the prescribed relative allowance.  As a result, it was considered by a deciding officer that the prescribed relative was no longer in a position to provide care and attention for the pensioner on a full-time basis and the allowance was revoked with effect from 26 May 1988.  An appeal against the decision was lodged but was disallowed by an appeals officer on 12 August 1988. The case has since been referred again to the appeals officer who concluded that there were no new facts or evidence <Col N="1979" /> which would warrant a revision of his decision.</P>
    <P>Where a pensioner is residing on a farm, the relative who is looking after the pensioner will, in many cases, also be engaged in running the farm.  In these cases the question to be determined is whether the farming activity conflicts with the objective of providing full-time care and attention which is a statutory requirement for receipt of the allowance. Each case is decided on its merits having due regard to the particular circumstances. In this case, it was considered that the number of hours' work required on the farm conflicted with the qualifying condition of the scheme of providing care and attention on a full-time basis.</P>

      <P>As I informed the Dáil last week, my Department have been assured that it is not US immigration policy to refuse holiday visas to unemployed applicants. I am advised, however, that the relevant section of US law places on non-immigrant visa applicants the burden of overcoming a presumption that they are immigrants.  Before the US embassy can grant holiday visas it is required under US law to ensure that the applicant has demonstrated compelling family, social, economic or other ties in Ireland which will oblige the individual to return here after a temporary stay in the US.  If the US authorities are not satisfied on this count they are obliged to refuse the visa application.  This rule is applied to all Irish citizens, irrespective of their employment status.</P>
      <P>Regarding individual cases where visas have been refused, the US embassy have indicated that they are prepared to review each such case if new evidence, particularly in a documentary form, can be produced which will assist the applicant in meeting the requirements of US law.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the statutory conditions for the receipt of unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance is that a person must be available for and genuinely seeking, but unable to find, employment suitable to him or her having regard to his/her age, sex, physique, education, normal occupation, place of residence and family circumstances.  The legislation provides also that the onus is on the individual claimants to prove that they are available for work.  It does not, however, state what form such proof should take.  It is accordingly a question for the deciding officers and appeals officers to decide whether any claimant has shown that he or she fulfils the condition having regard to the available evidence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All claimants are asked when making a claim for unemployment benefit or assistance to complete a questionnaire regarding their efforts to obtain employment. Claimants may also be asked subsequently at any stage of their claim about this matter.  In most cases, the replies given by claimants to this questionnaire will, when taken in conjunction with other evidence available regarding the claimant's employment history, be sufficient to satisfy the deciding officer that the person concerned is available for and genuinely seeking work.  If, however, there is any element of doubt about the position, the deciding officer may seek further relevant information on such matters as the extent to which the claimant has made efforts to obtain employment since becoming unemployed; the type of work the claimant is seeking and the reasons for any restrictions which the <Col N="1987" /> claimant may be placing on the type of work he or she is available to do; whether there are domestic or other commitments or circumstances which limit the claimant's ability to accept full-time employment which would normally be regarded as suitable and whether the claimant has a history of leaving employments frequently, without good cause.</P>
    <P>It is on the basis of the replies given that the deciding officer determines whether the person is or is not available for and genuinely seeking work.  Each case has to be considered on its own merits and it is a matter for the deciding officer to decide the exact evidence required in any case having regard to the individual circumstances of the claimant.</P>
    <P>Any person who is dissatisfied with the decision of a deciding officer has the right of appeal to an appeals officer.</P>

      <P>Following a meeting in December last with representatives of the school, I have asked my Department's inspectorate to review and report on the likely enrolment trends in the area of special education in County Galway.  The Department have also received an application for the provision of special education facilities for this population in the East Galway area and concern has also been expressed by people in the Gaeltacht areas at having only centralised facilities.  When my inspectorate's report on these matters has been received, I shall have its terms considered as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>The provision of the type of information requested by the Deputy in respect of actual grant payments from my Department's capital grant scheme for the provision of recreational facilities would involve an inordinate amount of time and I am not prepared to divert staff for this purpose.  Should the Deputy wish to inquire about a particular project I will endeavour to supply the information sought.  However, the Deputy is referred to the beneficiary compendium compiled by the national lottery which gives details on a county basis of grant allocations.</P>
