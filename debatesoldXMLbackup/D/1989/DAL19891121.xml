      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach the reason he has recently informed the National Youth Council of Ireland that their representation on the board of the NESC may be reduced from two to one; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if his attention has been drawn to the positive contribution to the work of NESC made by the National Youth Council of Ireland representatives; if he proposes to maintain the representation of the National Youth Council of Ireland on the council of NESC at their present strength; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will reconsider his decision to reduce the representation of the National Youth Council on NESC as this reduction would represent a vote of no confidence in our young people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to reply to <Col N="946" /> Questions Nos. 1, 2 and 3 together.  In renewing the mandate of the National Economic and Social Council for another five years, the Government and the social partners agreed to revise the constitution of the council so as to provide for a wider and better contribution from the independent members.  The revised constitution, therefore, provides for six independent members appointed by the Government, of whom one is nominated by the National Youth Council.  The Government and the social partners were satisfied that one representative from the National Youth Council, with an alternate, could fully convey the views of the council.</P>
      <P>I would point out, also, that under the new constitution of the NESC, bodies with one representative only include the Construction Industry Federation and the Irish Co-operative Organisation Society who, since the NESC do not conduct their business on a voting basis, are not constrained in presenting their views by having only one member on the NESC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not agree that those bodies which are represented by only one member on the council represent or bring to the work of the NESC the experience of a fairly narrow range of operations?  That could be said, I think, of the Construction Industry Federation and also the ICOS. Would the Taoiseach not also agree that those who are nominated by the National Youth Council of Ireland represent or can bring to the work of the NESC the experience of a very wide range of activities and would he not, therefore, agree that would be a better input to the work of the council rather than the operation of one single member?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so.  Only six places are nominated by the Government. It seems to me, and to most of the other people concerned, that as long as the National Youth Council would have a voice, with an alternate if required, there would be no restraint or constraint on them voicing the views of the youth <Col N="947" /> council on the NESC.  I would point out that when they had two members, those two members very rarely attended.  More often than not they were represented by only one member.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Taoiseach tell us what other changes, if any, are being made in the representation of other bodies on the NESC?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I can give the Deputy the full composition as it will be.  One of the principal changes is that there will now be a representative from the European Commission.  He will not be a member but he will have a right of audience there and he has already taken up this offer by us.  If the Deputy wishes, I will give a list of the representation.  The independent members nominated by the Government are Michael Conlon, Dr. Miriam Hederman-O'Brien, Mr. Conor McCarthy, Mr. Colm McCarthy&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I would just like the numbers representing each group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There are six independent members nominated by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the other groups?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two members from the Confederation of Irish Industry; one from the Construction Industry Federation; two from the Federation of Irish Employers; five from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions; one from the Irish Co-Operative Organisation Society; two from the ICMSA; two from the IFA; one member from the European Commission and the Secretary of the Department of Finance, the Secretary of the Department of Industry and Commerce and the Secretary of the Department of Labour.  On the whole it is a good balance.  I do not think there is any great disadvantage to the National Youth Council in just having one member.  If there was, I would not have <Col N="948" /> made any change, particularly in view of the fact that the National Youth Council were normally represented by only one member during the last NESC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from the Taoiseach's last reply to the various supplementaries that have been put to him, I would like to ask him two questions. Why he decided to reduce the NYCI's representation from two to one and was he not aware that in a letter of 9 November from the NYCI to him they expressed dismay at having their representation on the NESC reduced from two members to one?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of that but I do not think it is a matter for dismay.  I do not think anybody should get unduly excited about this.  The National Youth Council of Ireland are represented by a full member with the provision for an alternate and that should not inhibit them in any way, particularly as I have said as the whole purpose of the NESC is to get as broad a spectrum of views as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not agree that, whether in Galway or at the NESC, if people express dismay at how they believe they are being treated, that dismay is real whether the Taoiseach considers it to be justified or not?  In this instance the NYCI have expressed very clearly to various parties represented in this House their dismay, which is a repeat of that expressed in a letter to the Taoiseach. If the Taoiseach accepts that their dismay is real, can he justify his reason for reducing their representation from two to one and perhaps indicate that reason to the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason is very simple.  Basically, the Government nominate only six places and I have tried to get as broad a cross-section of views as possible.  Secondly, I think one representative from the National Youth Council of Ireland is perfectly adequate to express the views of the council.  Basically there <Col N="949" /> is no need for two representatives, particularly when I am confined to six for the rest of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I ask the Taoiseach&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Order, I want to call Deputy Jimmy Deenihan who also has tabled a question on this subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Taoiseach to confirm the accuracy of a statement issued from his Department on 10 November, that the reason given for the cut in membership was that the National Youth Council of Ireland had a very poor attendance record at the meetings&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>So, that statement was not accurate?  That was the reason given by the Taoiseach's Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a very simple matter.  As I say, I have six places and I want to try to use those six places to get as broad a spectrum of views as possible on the NESC.  I do not think that two members from the National Youth Council would be any more valuable to them than one.  One out of six is not a bad representation.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Order, please. A number of Deputies are offering.  I appreciate there are three questions tabled, nevertheless, we must have finality in this matter.  A final supplementary from Deputy Deenihan.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach one final question?  Given the fact that the representation of the National Youth Council on the NESC has now been decreased would the Taoiseach permit the involvement of the National Youth Council in phase 2 of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and allow them to play some role in the Central Review Committee as a full participating social partner?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is extending the scope of the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach consider that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a constructive suggestion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>May I take it that the import of what the Taoiseach is saying to the House is that he considers the representation of the NYCI on the NESC, with two members out of the discretionary number of six, to be excessive and that they are only entitled to one?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is putting it rather tendentiously, which is not my intention. I do not attach any particular significance to numbers in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The PDs do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>What I am saying is that I have only six places and I tried to use those six places to get a wide sweep of opinion into the affairs of the NESC. I think all Deputies will agree with that. There would be no advantage to the National Youth Council in having two persons out of six, rather than one.  One person, with provision for an alternate, should surely be in a position to give full expression to the views of the National Youth Council on the NESC.  I do not think the National Youth Council would gain anything by having two instead of one.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I call on Deputy <Col N="951" /> Creed, to be followed by Deputy Mac Giolla and Deputy Dukes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to express my disappointment at the reduction in the representation of the National Youth Council from two places to one by the Taoiseach.  Given the importance of the National Economic and Social Council as a body with considerable influence on Government policy, the fact that representation of youth has been reduced and that the youth of the country have been most affected by Government policy during the past few years, that decision will lead to a further reduction in the impact of youth on Government policy.  With emigration now running at 46,000 per annum and high youth unemployment, it is vital that young people have some influence on Government policy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach clarify that he has reduced the representation from two out of five to one out of six and if this was done with or without consultation with NYCI?  Secondly, who are the social partners?  Are the youth council and the youth federation considered to be social partners, whom the Taoiseach says were consulted before this change was made in the constitution?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The discussion was of a general nature, mainly with employers and trade unions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

      <P>An assessment of the existing security measures in place in the National Museum is underway.  A major programme of works to strengthen internal and external security in the museum has been in progress and when fully implemented will cost approximately £160,000.  The question of staffing levels is being considered in this context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The frequent listing and checking of materials required for exhibition, loan or conservation provides the basis for the <Col N="955" /> checking on the security of materials not on regular display.</P>
    <P>There is an ongoing inventory of material in all sections of the museum and an active acquisitions policy which includes the registration and logging of artefacts as soon as they become part of the collections.</P>
    <P>Access to materials is given to bona fide researchers who are recommended by reputable sources.  Such researchers are supervised at all times by relevant members of the museum's technical and professional staff.</P>

      <P>I have received no such proposal.  Yeats is well represented in our National Gallery and in the Hugh Lane Municipal Gallery.

Is the Taoiseach's Department not aware that a close relative of Jack B. Yeats has indicated to the State that if a separate specialist museum dedicated to the memory of Jack B. Yeats was made available, all of the personal papers which have nothing to do with the works of art currently in possession of either the Municipal or the National Galleries would be made available and that together they would constitute quite an extraordinary asset.  It is either here or to Minnesota that these papers might go.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, to take Questions Nos. 7 and 8 together.</P>
      <P>I attended the meeting, over dinner, on Saturday, 18 November, hosted by President Mitterrand in the Elysee, Paris and attended by the other Heads of Government of the Community countries and by the President of the Commission. Foreign Ministers met separately, as is the custom at European Councils, and joined us later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The meeting was called to consider the implications for the Community of, and how it should respond to, the momentous events happening daily in Eastern Europe where barriers are being swept <Col N="960" /> away and fundamental changes are taking place which will have a profound impact throughout our modern world. Our meeting lasted almost three hours and since it was, of its nature, informal no communique was issued.  At a press conference after the meeting, which President Gonzalez of Spain and I, along with President Delors also attended, President Mitterrand outlined certain principles on which the meeting decided.</P>
    <P>The Heads of State and Government had no doubt about their responsibility to take all measures open to them and adopt the necessary policies to support the peoples of Eastern Europe in their efforts to achieve democratic freedom.</P>
    <P>Our meeting was of the view that the dramatic and welcome changes in Eastern Europe, emphasised the need to proceed even more expeditiously and effectively with the integration of the Community so that it would provide a focus for progress throughout Europe and be in a much stronger position to respond positively and effectively to the changes taking place.</P>
    <P>One of the most significant and trenchant interventions was that of the Federal German Chancellor who stressed that the Federal Republic always has been and always will be part of the European Community, which it regards as essential to its future and to the future of Europe.</P>
    <P>The meeting decided to ask a Troika, consisting of the French President, the Spanish President and myself together with the President of the Commission, to study a French proposal to establish a new international bank which would help in the restructuring and economic development of the countries of Eastern Europe.  This group is to report to the European Council in Strasbourg on 8 and 9 December.</P>
    <P>A second proposal was for the establishment of a foundation for training which would monitor and co-ordinate the provision of management training for the countries of Eastern Europe &mdash; already provided or in the course of being provided by a number of Community countries, including Ireland, on a bilateral basis.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="961" /> Proposals were advanced for the participation by East European countries in a number of Community programmes, such as ERASMUS, dealing with the exchange of students, Lingua on the teaching of languages, and certain projects in the area of science and technology.</P>
    <P>The meeting was firmly of the view that financial aid should be provided for Poland and Hungary and that a decision must be given by the International Monetary Fund before the end of this year on the requests submitted by these countries.</P>
    <P>The question of how some or all of the East European countries concerned could be more closely involved in the work of international organisations like GATT and the Council of Europe was also considered.</P>
    <P>The point was stressed that the situation of the different countries varied greatly.  Poland is, for example, critically in need of food aid.  The position of Hungary is better; and that in East Germany different again.  The approach of the Community and the mechanisms for assistance must be adapted to the needs of each case.  However, it was agreed that aid would be conditional on a verified or verifiable return to democracy, respect for human rights and free and secret elections in the countries concerned.</P>
    <P>The meeting agreed that concentration on the events of Eastern Europe should not be permitted to call in question the relationships of the Community with the United States, the European Free Trade Area countries or its exiting commitments to the African, Caribbean, Pacific, Arab and other States and territories with which the Community has a long and valued association.</P>
    <P>The meeting was regarded by those who took part as successful and well worthwhile.  There was a feeling that history was unfolding before us as we considered the evolution of the East and the further integration of the West.</P>
    <P>At his press conference, President Mitterrand used the words solidarity and unity to summarise the tone of our meeting. <Col N="962" /> He was speaking of the solidarity of the Community as Eastern Europe comes to its rendezvous with history, and of structural change leading to greater integration within the Community.</P>
    <P>The Government will deal with the Birmingham Six case and other Anglo-Irish questions during the course of this week's statements on Anglo-Irish relations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle.  May I take it from the Taoiseach's reply that he did not have the opportunity of raising the question of the Birmingham Six?  In regard to the British Prime Minister's remarks which she made at a press conference in relation to safe havens for the IRA, can I take it that those remarks were directed at the Republic of Ireland?  Was the Taoiseach aware at the time of the discussion that the British Prime Minister was going to mention the contents of that conversation at a press conference?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the British Prime Minister used the phrase &ldquo;safe havens anywhere&rdquo; in her television broadcast.  I was not aware that the British Prime Minister intended to give any press conference after the Summit meeting. In fact, as far as I understood the situation, the troika led by President Mitterrand were to conduct the necessary press conference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>It would appear from the conduct of the British Prime Minister <Col N="963" /> at the weekend that she has a habit of conducting Anglo-Irish relations or Anglo-Irish diplomacy through the medium of press conferences.  Has the Taoiseach conveyed to her that this is particularly unhelpful?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As soon as I became aware of the statement by the British Prime Minister I availed of the earliest opportunity to place on record my view, which I am sure would be the view of all Members of this House, that we are not aware of any safe havens anywhere for terrorists, and particularly for the Provisional IRA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like some response from the Taoiseach in relation to the Birmingham Six.  Did he have the opportunity of raising this case?  Perhaps I could be accused of suffering from historical amnesia if I was not aware of the fact that Mrs. Thatcher's press conferences sometimes convey a totally different impression from what took place at meetings she has had with Irish Taoisigh, but could the Taoiseach inform the House if the impression she gave at the press conference on Sunday afternoon reflected what happened at his short meeting?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already indicated that the British Prime Minister and I did not have a meeting.  As the Deputy knows from his own personal experience, as these conferences break up and people move away, frequently the different participants have a word with each other. Very often it is just to wish each other good luck until the next conference.  That is the sort of conversation I had with the British Prime Minister, no more and no less.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me say first how much I welcomed President Mitterrand's initiative.  I must thank the Taoiseach for the substantial answer he gave outlining what was discussed.  I am glad to see that the question of further participation in various programmes, such as ERASMUS <Col N="964" /> and GATT, were discussed there.  Was there any discussion of the question of extending the EC further east at a later stage with a view to bringing the whole of Europe into the Community?  Was there mention of how dangerous outside interference in the internal affairs of these countries during the course of the changes which are taking place could be if emphasised?  I would like to know also if the question of further disarmament in Europe, under both the NATO and the Warsaw Pact, was touched upon?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of the relationship, now and in the future, of Eastern European countries with the Community was, of course discussed.  I think I would be right in summarising the views by saying that the general view would be that it is too early to think of anything specific in that regard.  As the Deputy knows, the relationship between a third country and the Community can vary from a trade agreement simpliciter to associate membership and, in that connection, the phrase &ldquo;privileged association&rdquo; was used, but more in the context of the future than the present.</P>
      <P>In regard to the question about intervention by the Community in the affairs of these countries, that can best be met by my saying that the member states were very clearly of the view that all these issues in these countries are a matter for the countries themselves and that would apply particularly to questions about the reunification of Germany where the standard position is that this is primarily a matter for the German people.</P>
      <P>On the question of disarmament, there was a clear view at our meeting that any questions of security or anything of that nature should be left to be dealt with in the context of the alliances which exist. In fact, they were not dealt with or discussed at all at our meeting, nor indeed was the question of frontiers and international boundaries.  Again the view was that our meeting was not concerned with those issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Taoiseach confirm that the view of the member states <Col N="965" /> of the European Community in relation to external interference in the events in any of these Eastern European countries would be very much along the lines that the kind of democratic centralism we saw up to not so long ago is totally inappropriate in those cases and that they would wish to see that ruled out?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>Centralism, not democratic centralism.  There is a difference between centralism and democratic centralism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Taoiseach would probably agree with me that if events in Eastern Europe show anything, they show that a particular brand of Stalinism is now totally outmoded over there.  I think the day is going to come when it will be totally outmoded over here.  In the light of what the Taoiseach has been saying about Anglo-Irish relations and a very brief conversation with Mrs. Thatcher, would he not agree that the time is now ripe for the Taoiseach and Mrs. Thatcher to have a meeting, no matter how informal, in order that a number of rather vexatious impressions, on at least one side, and perhaps on two, could be got out of the way so that Anglo-Irish relations could get back on some basis of frankness and normality?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Tourism and Transport if his attention has been drawn to the long delays in air traffic at Dublin Airport; the plans he has to improve air traffic control facilities there; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. S. Brennan) Seamus Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am fully aware of, and regret, delays to air traffic.  Such delays can arise from a variety of causes such as weather, problems with the aircraft or the lack of capacity in the air traffic system as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The capacity of an air traffic control system is determined by three factors &mdash; the amount of air space available, the number of air traffic control and support staff and the range of equipment provided. At present the capacity of the Irish air traffic control system is limited because of a shortage of trained staff and <Col N="969" /> to a lesser extent by equipment inadequacies.</P>
    <P>Safety of course is paramount in any air traffic control system.  Delays occur when the air traffic control service, in the interests of safety, restrict the amount of traffic operating in the system.</P>
    <P>Plans to substantially expand the capacity of the Irish air traffic control system are well in hand.  Recruitment of staff has recommenced; 27 have been recruited in recent months and we will continue to recruit additional staff over the next few years.  The normal training facilities and programmes have been substantially expanded to maximise the training of both new and existing staff.</P>
    <P>I should also mention that a major re-equipment programme for the provision of radar, communications and landing systems at all the State airports is now well in hand and will be completed on schedule in 1992.  It should be appreciated that we are not unique in experiencing congestion in the air traffic control system.  The welcome traffic growth of recent years has put unprecedented pressure on air traffic control systems throughout Europe.  Both here and particularly at European level we are participating fully in the urgent task of expanding the national and international air traffic control systems with a view to eliminating delays as quickly as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that flight delays in certain cases have been as high as 90 per cent at Dublin Airport, 75 per cent on a few occasions, and that 40 per cent is the average, most of which is Dublin Airport related and not European?  Would he agree further that air traffic control is such a specialist activity that his Department may not be the best equipped to manage this technical activity, that it should not be necessary to be a civil servant to be an air traffic controller, and that this activity will function more efficiently if either transferred to Aer Rianta or set up as a separate State agency?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I reject the 90 per cent figure and, indeed, the 40 per cent <Col N="970" /> figure.  The figures in so far as they are officially available indicate they are not in that region.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>In regard to the second point about ATC and its structure I have already announced that I am examining whether the future of ATC is best put into an autonomous structure or retained in the Department.  I certainly welcome the Deputy's proposals and suggestions to assist me in proceeding with that inquiry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me ask a final supplementary which is relevant to this. Would the Minister agree that ATC at Dublin Airport is hampered by the fact <Col N="971" /> that the airport is located between two military airfields, Gormanstown and Baldonnel, and that military aircraft control in those areas restricts aircraft at certain times flying in and out of the airport?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 44 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been recognised for some time that Irish industry, and particularly hauliers and exporters, are at a disadvantage <i>vis-à-vis</i> their Northern Ireland counterparts in relation to overall transport costs. One of the ways in which this is manifested is the loss of traffic to ports in Northern Ireland.  This diversion of traffic is attributable to a number of interwoven factors which operate in favour of the Northern ports, including shipping costs, <Col N="972" /> frequency and capacity of shipping services, port charges, lower costs of Northern Ireland hauliers and so on.</P>
    <P>This problem has been addressed in the <i>National Development Plan,</i> which includes proposals for major EC-assisted investment in special sea and air freight services linking Ireland with Britain and the European mainland.  A major feasibility study into these proposals will be commenced shortly.  The study, which will be steered by a committee representative of the Departments of Tourism and Transport, the Marine and Finance and the European Commission, under the chairmanship of a senior officer of my Department, will have broad terms of reference.  Apart from considering specific investment projects, it will examine the factors in the Irish transport sector which impose excessive costs on Irish exporters.</P>
    <P>Recommendations arising from the feasibility study will be given careful consideration with a view to appropriate action being taken to improve Ireland's freight links with Britain and the Continent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that it is the practice of certain operators to go as far south as Cork to collect goods, to export these via Northern Ireland at Larne or Warrenpoint and to deliver them in England as far south as London and to do so more profitably than bringing the goods across the Irish Sea via any port in the Republic?  Would the Minister agree that transport and sea freight rates in the Republic, and specifically from Dublin, are twice what it costs to transport sea freight via Larne and other ports outside the Republic and that this is one of the main contributing factors?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I admit there are cost disadvantages here <i>vis-á-vis</i> Northern Ireland.  Various studies, for example, the Department of Finance analyst report, the Chartered Institute of Transport report and so on state that although these figures are not totally reliable the cost disadvantage ranges from 11 per cent to 27 per cent.  I am aware, as the Deputy <Col N="973" /> has pointed out, that goods are transported from far south through Northern Ireland.  That is a feature of the higher cost pertaining in the Republic &mdash; of which the Deputy will be aware &mdash; of excise duties, fuel taxes, insurance, port charges and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the cost of transporting freight across the Irish Sea from the Republic is up to twice that for a similar exercise from, say, Belfast docks and that this gives rise to a reasonable suspicion of a cartel in shipping prices from the Republic which is contributing to a major loss here of revenue, jobs and enterprise? Will he tell the House what plans he has to reduce the cost of commercial vehicles used by the Republic's road haulage carriers in order to allow them to compete with the Northern Ireland carriers, particularly coming up to 1992 when there is supposed to be more rationalisation in the whole area of tax, duties and motor insurance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will admit that there are many questions there, some of which are interesting and which I would like to reply to but obviously I cannot do so now.  I would like to share an interesting statistic with the Deputy, namely, that 1,900 licences have been issued under the Road Transport Act in the domestic haulage area. Currently there are some 600 applications in my Department awaiting consideration. I was interested to find that there was no fall-off in the number of people who want to run road haulage businesses in the Republic.  If the difficulties are as severe as they seem to be I am anxious to reconcile that with the increasing number of people who applied to my Department for licences.  As part of the general taxation strategy which the Government are following and as has been pointed out, there are higher excise duties on our vehicles, a higher tax element on our fuel and our insurance charges are higher.  All in all our freight people do extraordinarily well.  I am concerned that something of the order of 26 <Col N="974" /> per cent of exports from the Republic still go out through Northern Ireland.  I want to have a very close look at that to see of we can get some of the business back and I would welcome the Deputy's suggestions in that area.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to tell the House that the Government have decided, in principle, that financial assistance should be made available to Swansea Cork Ferries Limited for the provision of a Cork-Swansea ferry service in 1990.  This decision, however, is subject to a number of stringent conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principal condition is that the service must be operated on a management contract basis on behalf of Swansea Cork Ferries Limited by an existing experienced <Col N="975" /> ferry operator.  The terms of the contract will be subject to my approval. Another condition is that the performance of Swansea Cork Ferries in 1990 must meet very specific agreed financial limits.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moynihan</NameTxt>

I would remind the Minister that there are still problems so far as it could well take, by the time all the loose ends are tied up, a further three or four weeks before the sailing rosters and the sailing times are determined and indeed before the brochures go to the tour operators and the travel agencies.  It is absolutely futile to put a ferry boat on the Irish Sea. What makes it a success is the marketing and promotion and my worry is that time is running out.  I say to the Minister that having made the financial commitment yesterday he should now take the absolute initiative in ensuring that not a day or an hour is lost in completing this work.

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that the stop-go situation in regard to this boat over the last three years has not enhanced the marketing and promotion of the service. The Minister, being satisfied that this service is absolutely necessary for the tourist potential development of Cork and Kerry should, having completed this agreement, view the possibility of having a three or five year commitment which would enhance the marketing and promotion and thus ensure that this is a continuing rather than a stop-go process?</P>

In fact, this very day discussions are taking place to progress it rapidly.  Both the Minister of State at my Department, Deputy Lyons, and myself are working very closely on this matter.  We have processed it through Government and a decision will be announced as quickly as possible.  May I take this opportunity to put something on the record which I regard as important.  I undertook an independent consultancy study in this regard which, to say the least, was not optimistic about the commercial viability of the service.  In spite of that I have taken the decision to support this ferry because I have accepted the arguments of the people of Cork and Kerry that they can respond to this kind of support in a short time.  I am taking that in good faith and I am putting my money on the support of the people of Cork and Kerry.  I now say bluntly that it is up to the exporters in that region to avail of the service and to bring in the targets which have been given to me for 1990.  I will be as helpful as I possibly can in this regard.  It is now over to the people who use the service to show me and the Government that consultancy reports and independent commentators are wrong and that this can be a viable service.  That is my attitude to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13, 28, 38 and 40 together.</P>
      <P>Following the Government decision in 1987 that no further consideration should be given to extending the DART system, because of the high costs of such development and the state of the public finances, CIE were instructed to prepare transport investment plans for the Dublin area involving only bus-based options or diesel services on existing rail lines.  These plans were received in August 1988.  They provided for improvements to the Maynooth-City rail services, a new rail service between Clondalkin and the city, new services on a number of peripheral bus routes, local minibus services in certain suburbs, the satellite towns and some city areas and limited-stop services to the city on certain longer journeys.</P>
      <P>The rail proposals for Dublin West embrace feeder bus services in the rail catchment areas affected.  Tallaght would be in the catchment area for a feeder bus service to Clondalkin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposals for rail developments, which would cost about £28 million have been included in the <i>National Development Plan 1989-1993</i> for assistance from EC Structural Funds.  Pending the outcome of that appication it is not possible to speak in terms of the timing of these <Col N="978" /> projects.  The local link bus service in the Tallaght area has already been extended and Tallaght is included on the routes of the proposed new peripheral bus services, which Bus Átha Cliath expect to introduce next year.  In addition, the bus services between Tallaght and the city centre were improved late last year.</P>
    <P>There is, of course, a need to study transportation policy for the longer term and in that connection the framing of proposals will no doubt take account of recent developments elsewhere in the field of tram systems.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that a recent study showed that Dublin is one of the most traffic snarled cities in Europe?  Would he agree that a light rail or tram system, such as is now being introduced in Manchester, might be reconsidered in view of the pollution which the city has experienced since 1987?  The light rail or tram system would be more environmentally friendly and circumstances have changed since the Government directive was given to CIE.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The light rail suggestions are interesting and I should like to study them very carefully, perhaps then coming back to the House.  The existing solutions relate to bus or diesel based options.  If it can be shown that the light rail option would be a better solution, I am not wedded to the existing strategy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that a light rail or tram system would be preferable to motorways through such areas as the Liberties and that, given the pollution problems, his Department should issue a policy directive that this whole area should be reexamined in detail?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not in a position to give such a policy directive just yet.  I have an open mind about it and I am very interested in it.  We have existing rail lines from Clondalkin and Maynooth and <Col N="979" /> there are also the remains of rail lines in other parts of the city and county.

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Tourism and Transport if he will update the Air Transport Act, 1936 to ensure that persons affected by aircraft noise in their homes adjacent to airports can be compensated for the cost of insulating their homes against such noise; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no plans at present to update the Air Navigation and Transport Act, 1936, to provide for compensation towards the cost of insulating houses in the vicinity of airports against aircraft noise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this context, however, the Deputy <Col N="980" /> may wish to note that following detailed consideration of the question of noise insulation for houses in the immediate vicinity of the new runway at Dublin Airport, Aer Rianta were asked earlier this year to undertake a programme of insulation of houses which had been identified as coming within the internationally accepted noise intrusion limits.  This process is ongoing and the level of insulation required is being negotiated with the residents on an individual basis.  I can assure the Deputy that an adequate level of insulation is being provided in all cases.</P>
    <P>Much of the disturbance caused by aircraft noise is being progressively eliminated. Two EC Directives which have been given effect in Irish law already prohibit the operation of non-hush kitted aircraft to and from Irish airports.  This process is ongoing and a further EC Directive which is due to come into effect next year will prohibit the addition of aircraft to an operator's fleet unless they meet even more stringent noise requirements.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will be aware of the detailed submission made by St. Margaret's Community Council who commissioned their own experts in acoustics and sound installation.  The Minister says that adequate insulation is being installed in the houses.  Since 21 June Dublin Airport has opened the new runway 1128, causing tremendous inconvenience for the residents in the St. Margret's Community Council area.  Their day-to-day lives are being disrupted, their outdoor activities hindered and communication is being interfered with by noise levels.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is embarking on a long statement.  Let us proceed by way of relevant and brief supplementaries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to recognise that Dublin Airport is growing very rapidly.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Col N="981" />
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Planes coming in on this new runway are causing tremendous noise polution problems for people in the immediate area.  Would the Minister agree that the level of insulation proposed by Aer Rianta is insufficient and has been proved to be so by independently commissioned reports?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>St. Margaret's Community Council have carried out their own survey and are seeking substantially increased levels of insulation in their houses, including double and secondary glazing, extensive roof insulation, air conditioning in some cases, inner and outer wall insulation and double glazed porch doors.  Aer Rianta estimate the cost of these extensive insulation measures would average £20,000 for each house.  I am not in a position to proceed with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The question related to airports in general.  Would the Minister agree that people living in the Tallaght/Clondalkin area and generally in the west of the city might equally suffer from the use of Baldonnel Aerodrome and that any consideration given to people adjacent to Dublin Airport might also be given to people in these areas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy were on this side of the House he would be as cautious on this as I have to be.  We could reach a position where aircraft noise was being heard in every house in the country. Aer Rianta have finished their survey. They identified about 100 houses that came within what is known as the internationally accepted noise intrusion limit. If a house comes within that limit, Aer Rianta will discuss it with them; if it is outside the limit Aer Rianta will not be in a position to discuss it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the St. Margaret's problem and that the Minister has basically passed the ball to Aer Rianta to resolve it, given the major difference that exists between the vast majority of the residents and Aer Rianta and also that the amount of money made available to <Col N="982" /> Aer Rianta is totally inadequate, will the Minister state that the necessary money will be made available through his Department or through Aer Rianta to insulate adequately the dwellings in question? There is a big gap between Aer Rianta and the residents and that problem will have to be resolved before the airport comes into full operation at the end of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Aer Rianta's acoustics experts advise them that the insulation being provided, which has been accepted by half the applicants so far, is more than on a par with the best insulation schemes available at comparable airports in the UK.  I could not recommend to Aer Rianta that they expend sums in the order of £20,000 to insulate each house.  That would not be justified. They are trying to be as humane, helpful and flexible as they can on an individual household by household basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister consider publishing the relevant tables of the internationally accepted noise pollution limits so that people living in areas other than those immediately adjacent to Dublin Airport might be enabled to ascertain exactly where they stand?  Is the Minister aware that there have been a considerable number of complaints even with regard to training flights in respect of which people feel they should receive a degree of compensation for this source of pollution?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>These internationally accepted noise intrusion limits are very technical as the Deputy will appreciate. Any householder who feels intrusion in his case may come within those limits can be furnished with that information by my Department or Aer Rianta.  I will certainly examine that matter.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Tourism and Transport if he has received a preliminary report, or a final report, on the Iarnród Éireann train derailment near Claremorris, County Mayo on 24 September 1989.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16 and 24 together.</P>
      <P>I expect to receive the final report of the Iarnród Éireann Board of Inquiry within the next few days.  When the report is received it will be examined in my Department to determine the need for follow-up action or remedial measures.</P>
      <P>The board of inquiry appointed to study the accident at Claremorris also has the additional mandate of examining the possibilities for eliminating, where possible, or reducing the hazards in the operation of accommodation crossings on the railway system.  Since the accident larnród Éireann have been discussing with the IFA and the ICMSA the safe use of the accommodation crossings used by farmers and 95 per cent of all known users of such crossings have already been visited by railway personnel and instructed on the safe and proper use of the crossings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that there are approximately 2,000 accommodation rail crossings nationwide and that as recently as last week there was another incident of a tractor in collision with a train leading to an unfortunate death on the lines?  Is he aware that there are virtually no formal procedures for controlling the use of those 2,000 accommodation crossings whereas, in England, British Rail would not allow the activities engaged in by our farming community and others to be carried on their railway lines?  For example, is the Minister aware <Col N="984" /> that they have banned all crossings on their high speed routes on which trains travel at between 70 and 90 miles per hour?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Furthermore, would the Minister not agree that, as we near 1990, the <i>ad hoc</i> arrangements obtaining between our farmers and Iarnród Éireann are not sufficient and that we should seek immediate improvement in communications between those using the line and the statutory body?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully share the Deputy's concern.  In fact, the figure for accommodation railway crossings is approximately 2,500.  We have taken two actions: first, we have sent somebody to visit, as of now, 95 per cent of owners at all such accommodation crossings who have been reinstructed in their safe usage.  We shall complete that programme very shortly.  Second, I have instructed CIE, as soon as possible, to dispense with all wooden bodied carriages &mdash; although a very small number &mdash; they still use on the rail lines.  I am satisfied that, in the short-term, that position will improve.  I shall be examining longer term solutions to what is a very difficult problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of Question No. 24, given that this is a very serious matter and in view of the fact that the so-called Asahi express as it is known locally &mdash; uses this line continuously, can the Minister inform the House whether there was consultation between Iarnród Éireann, the ICMSA and the IFA in regard to the control of traffic on that line?  Is he aware that, in the week preceding this latest derailment, the supporters of the Mayo team returning from Croke Park had their train delayed for a considerable period, again because of cattle on the line?  Furthermore, is he aware that this is a more widespread problem than merely that referred to in <Col N="985" /> this question?  Lastly, will the Minister publish the report as soon as it becomes available.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>As soon as I receive the report I will consider the latter part of the Deputy's question.  In the meantime I should like to tell him that a whole list of suggestions has come to me in recent weeks about, for example electric fencing, special fittings for engines, special cattle grids and so on, all of which the Deputy will appreciate are complex, costly and must be examined separately and carefully.  If the Deputy has any further suggestions I shall certainly examine those also.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome an opportunity to make a contribution on the Bill.  While I welcome the Bill I do not want it to be taken that I agree with all its provisions. It is important that we should have regulations concerning the development of nursing homes and there is no doubt that the caring for people in nursing homes is a growing business.  In my constituency there are three nursing homes that I am aware of and I understand that a fourth is in the course of construction.  I have visited the three nursing homes on many occasions and I have the highest regard for the treatment people receive in them. They are excellent homes by any standards and the care and nursing treatment the patients receive is first class.  There is no doubt that the people who stay in those homes are very happy.  Those involved in running those homes agree that there is a need to introduce regulations governing the establishment and running of such homes.  However, we will have to deal with the difficulty that arises as a result of a variation in the standards operated by the health boards.  It appears to me that under the Bill health boards will be empowered to issue licences and I do not think that will be in the best <Col N="1092" /> interests of nursing homes.  A register of such homes would be more appropriate.</P>
      <P>If health boards are to decide who is a fit person to run such a home and on the suitability of the buildings for this type of care we should have national standards. There is no doubt that the health boards differ in the way they apply health care and that is evident in the reports produced by many organisations down the years.  Some health boards are more flexible than others and it appears that they are easier to approach in regard to services.  I do not think it would be in the best interests of nursing homes if different standards were to apply.  I hope the Minister will clarify that matter when replying.</P>
      <P>The Minister will be aware that his suggestion that licences should be issued has not been well received.  I understand that a licence will be issued for two years but patients of such homes, and their relatives, will not feel comfortable bearing in mind that after two years they may have to seek alternative accommodation. With a growing elderly population, and a big increase in emigration, nursing care is very important.  In the past young people cared for their parents or elderly relatives but our young people are emigrating with the result that there is nobody at home to care for those people. We have had a great tradition of caring for elderly people and it is difficult to see how that will continue.  Unemployment has meant that young people have had to move away from home or go abroad to seek employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know of many sons, daughters, nieces and nephews, who gave up their jobs to care for elderly parents or relatives.  We are all aware of people who stayed at home to look after elderly parents or relatives.  Those people, when their parents died, had great difficulty rebuilding their lives.  For that reason the State should make a better contribution towards the work they are doing.  I have come across cases of young couples, with young children, having to look after an elderly parent or relative.  There is a great strain on the mother of that family <Col N="1093" /> because she has to look after the children and the elderly relative.  The State does not recognise that work.  If it did couples could improve accommodation in the home for the elderly person living with them and thereby take the burden off the State in having these people placed, unwillingly in many cases, in nursing homes, private or public.</P>
    <P>In regard to St. Phelim's hospital in Cavan, with which I am very familiar, at present there is a waiting list of 80 to 100 people.  I have received numerous representations in that regard.  At present in the case of an elderly couple in County Cavan where the husband of 83 or 84 years of age falls ill, and his wife is not able to look after him it is impossible to have him placed in St. Phelim's nursing home because of the cutbacks in the services. That is sad and tragic and creates a great burden on these people and indeed on the neighbours who try to help. In other cases, people who can afford it are placed in private nursing homes. There is a considerable cost involved &mdash; in the region of £130 to £160 per week. That money is not always available no matter what pension these people get or what savings they may have made during their lifetime.  In that regard there is an onus on us to ensure that sufficient care is available in our nursing homes but that is not the case at present.</P>
    <P>In regard to private nursing homes, a number of queries have been put to me. At present there is a scheme in operation whereby people, perhaps those who have their families reared, can board out old people.  The same conditions as regards the quality of accommodation are not laid down in these circumstances as in the nursing homes.  I am not saying the people are not being well cared for &mdash; there is no doubt they are&mdash;but the same standard of regulations which govern nursing homes, for example, inspections by health boards with which I agree, should apply to the people who board out old people for the purpose of caring for them.  Obviously these people are given some income by the health boards for this purpose.</P>
    <P>In my estimation it is not the number <Col N="1094" /> of staff present in the nursing homes that is of importance but rather the quality of the staff.  Is it necessary that all these people must have nursing qualifications or can the owner of the nursing home operate without nursing qualifications? In the light of the increasing number of old people and the demand for this type of accommodation, people could be attracted to this business for the sake of financial reward without any consideration to their qualifications or their ability to run such a home.  The qualifications of the nursing staff and the numbers employed are vital but it is the quality rather than the number of nursing staff which should be looked into.  Is it intended that the State provide training courses for people going into this business or will it be a free-for-all?  Hopefully, with the register, it will be possible to keep a close eye on what is happening in that regard.</P>
    <P>There are many difficulties at present in relation to the care of the aged.  It is worrying for parents whose children have moved out of the home as to where they are going to end their days.  In that regard I welcome this Bill.  It certainly came as news to me when I heard that the Eastern Health Board give a pitiful allowance of £6.80 per week towards supplementing the cost of a nursing home.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware if that money is available in all the health boards.  I received a number of inquiries as to whether it is available in the North Eastern Health Board area.  Is it dependent on the budget of the health board or is it there as of right to people when they look for it?  These matters should be made public.  Again, it comes back to the point I made earlier in relation to the standards that apply.  If there are criteria laid down for one health board it should be uniform throughout the country.  If £6.80 per day is made available in the Eastern Health Board area, a similar amount should be available in the North Eastern Health Board area and right <Col N="1095" /> across the country.  That would be only right and proper.</P>
      <P>Is it the intention that the health boards will send a doctor on a regular basis to these nursing homes to see that the patients are in good health and are getting attention for ailments they may have, or will it be left to the discretion of the nursing homes to decide whether a physician is necessary?  Again, I could see abuses in this regard.  Old people who are prone to colds and flu might be left too long before receiving medical care.  The health boards should provide doctors in these cases, similar to the position in private nursing homes where a doctor calls once a week or more often if necessary. During a flu epidemic a doctor should be available regularly to ensure that the patients are receiving the care to which they are entitled.</P>
      <P>Again, I would come back to the problem of the numbers on waiting lists for the nursing homes provided by the health boards.  This is a major problem and is at a crisis at present.  Finance will have to be made available immediately to the North Eastern Health Board to provide accommodation for people who are on the waiting list for the last six to 12 months.  That is too long a period for people to have to wait to be taken into nursing care when there is no doubt in people's minds that there is a necessity to have them placed in care.</P>
      <P>The Minister should make provision immediately for Lisdarn hospital.  The medical centre and maternity unit there has been closed down due to the opening of the general hospital beside it, which is a welcome development.  That excellent building is now lying idle.  It would be an ideal place for old people because it is on ground level, it has lovely surroundings and, to my knowledge, it has accommodation for at least 120 patients. Whether it is accommodated sufficiently for old people I do not know but it could be developed and improved so that these people could be taken from the care of their families, if only for a short-term.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Couples have come to me who need a rest from nursing their aged relatives who <Col N="1096" /> require a lot of attention.  What they were seeking was a break of a few weeks and the placement of the patients in rota beds but believe it or not I could not get those patients in for that duration.  This was in no way due to the staff of St. Phelim's Hospital who are working around the clock to provide what I must describe as outstanding accommodation and wonderful care for the patients of that hospital. The building is very old and very much out-dated.  It consists of three storeys which results in a lot of to-ing and fro-ing for the nurses and staff of that hospital, but notwithstanding this everyone is high in their praise of the work done and the care and food provided in that hospital.</P>
    <P>The problem is that insufficient accommodation is available.  This will be an increasing problem and one we will have to face up to.  As I said in my opening remarks, we have a growing elderly population. I do not think we should depend on the private nursing homes to solve this problem for us.  Certainly they have a role to play but it is more a matter of providing accommodation for people who can afford it.  Generally I am talking about small farmers and small business people who would have small savings. They could not even dream of taking up accommodation, even on a short-term basis, in a private nursing home.  Therefore an onus rests on the Department of Health and my own health board, the North Eastern Health Board, to provide such accommodation.  I am sure this problem is not confined to the North Eastern Health Board area.  I imagine the position is the same in each health board area.  It is a problem we will have to face up to.  As I have already pointed out, accommodation is available there, it is a matter of bringing it up to the required standard.</P>
    <P>It is important that we have this Bill on the Statute Book and that we keep a close eye on its implementation.  I have the highest regard for those who are involved in this area but I would be wary of those moving into this business.  In one case in Dublin, the health board quite <Col N="1097" /> rightly moved in and brought a prosecution for abuse of the system.  If the introduction of this Bill helps to prevent this it is to be welcomed, but I would ask the Minister to consider establishing a register rather than introducing a licence. We had enough problems with licences in the past and this word does not go down well with many people.  Bord Fáilte operate a register and their inspectors call on a regular basis to inspect accommodation registered with them to see if it is up to standard.  The same could apply with regard to nursing homes.  As to who should inspect these homes, I do not think a doctor would have the necessary qualifications to enable him examine the building for defects.  The person appointed to do this work should have the necessary training and qualifications in that field, otherwise we could end up with much annoyance being caused.  We should remember it can be disheartening for old people if an inspector calls and asks for changes to be made.</P>
    <P>If the Minister takes these points on board, which I am sure he will, he will have my own and my party's support for this Bill.  We welcome it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill before the House sets out the standards of care for dependent persons in nursing homes, boarding out and the changes in arrangements for subvention to such homes.  As many Deputies have said, we have a steadily increasing elderly population with more and more living until the age of 75, 85, 95 years and longer.  Many people are inclined to stereotype this group of people and admit that the elderly are dependent on somebody, that they are sick, troublesome and over the hill.  This is not so.  In fact the vast majority of our elderly population are healthy and can enjoy an independent living.  From statistics available, many of our elderly population are living alone on restricted incomes in their own homes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Usually these homes are mortgage free and hence they do not have to make monthly payments.  Often, however, the homes are in a poor state of repair and <Col N="1098" /> require a level of spending on maintenance which may not be possible due to the income of the owners.  A large proportion of our elderly population who are living alone avail of services within the community, such as meals on wheels, home helps, public health nurses, day centres, respite care and other such services.</P>
    <P>Sadly, the fourth largest killer of our elderly population is accidents and the vast majority occur within the home.  The most frequent type of accident is a fall. In fact it is the most common cause of death among our elderly population. Most of these accidents are due to the surroundings within the home.  Elderly people in rearing their families may have developed their homes so as to have four or five bedrooms or a couple of living rooms, but once their families were reared and left or got married and they were left on their own they found their homes to be totally unsuitable and unadaptable to their needs.</P>
    <P>This highlights one very important fact and that is that the elderly could enjoy an independent, active and long life without having to resort to nursing homes if suitable co-ordinated structures were in place between the health authorities and local authorities, especially in the area of housing requirements for the elderly. Suitable housing units have been designed for independent living and I suggest we should follow this line of thought. The elderly could avail of suitably designed housing units developed on a parochial basis with support services where they could continue to enjoy the environment they are familiar with.  In the past the need for sheltered housing and care units was highlighted and I think we should pursue that line of thought and seek development in that area.</P>
    <P>All of the elderly do not enjoy full mobility and do require nursing care, or perhaps respite care, on a long or short-term basis.  If this is to be provided we should ensure that the highest standards are attained and respect the dignity and individuality of the elderly person.  I believe there are in excess of 6,500 people presently accommodated in nursing <Col N="1099" /> homes.  In Dublin there has been an increase in the number of nursing homes, from 45 to 96, during the past four years. No legislation is specifically directed at nursing homes, other than sections of the 1964 and 1970 Health Acts.  It is important that we have guidelines in relation to the State's role.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a step in the right direction. It is therefore correct that there should be legislation to cover nursing, boarding out and subvention.  I welcome the regulation of subvention payments to eligible patients.  However, I have some doubts as to whether the subvention reflects the patient's needs.  We are aware that the dependency of elderly people who require nursing home care usually progresses and in some cases progresses quite rapidly.  I also recognise that the existing arrangements for subvention are totally unacceptable.  In some cases the patient is means tested and in others the bed is subvented regardless of the patient's needs.</P>
    <P>It is important for me to correct the record.  Speakers on the other side of the House made alarmist statements regarding the EHB, saying they had stopped paying subvention in recent weeks.  This is untrue.  As a member of the EHB I can say that all existing subvention payments are being paid and new patients are being assessed, passed and subvented.</P>
    <P>Under existing Health Acts anybody can design, develop and open a nursing home, notifying the health board 30 days before opening the door.  If we are serious about policies and standards for the elderly, the licensing, maintenance and registration of homes is essential.  It should not pose a problem in relation to most existing nursing homes.  I am concerned about the question of boarding out.  Under the present system and under the proposed system there would be widespread concern.  However, the Minister will be able to ensure that adequate resources are made available to the health boards to supervise the system.</P>
    <P>Previous speakers said that the Department of Health should be the inspecting authority in relation to the regulation and <Col N="1100" /> the follow-up to the Bill before the House today.  The health boards are the statutory authority for the development of health services and therefore I go along with the Minister in that the health boards should be the administering authority for this Bill.  I would ask the Minister to ensure that the fundamental principle of confidentiality of patient's records will govern the implementation of the terms of section 6 (2) (g) of the Bill.  Section 2, paragraph 2, gives the Minister the right to exclude and include certain classes of nursing homes.  I am concerned about the section.</P>
    <P>Many speakers talked about the need to provide nursing care and about the need for the State to highlight its role in relation to the quality and level of service being provided.  The Eastern Health Board have a visiting group committee who visit all the health institutions who care for the elderly in their area and I am satisfied with the level of care in those institutions.  There has been a large growth in private nursing homes particularly in Dublin.  This legislation poses no problem for the existing homes but it will set a standard.  I welcome this Bill and congratulate the Minister and his officials on bringing this legislation before the House to provide regulations and a high standard of care for the elderly and the infirm.</P>

      <P>The quality of any political system can be judged by its treatment of the elderly and the infirm.  The system here leaves a lot to be desired.  Deputy Sherlock, The Workers' Party spokesman on health, outlined a broad welcome to the thrust of the Bill.  The laudable aims of the Bill are to promote the highest standard of care, a system of subventions for boarding out and the licensing of nursing homes.  We definitely need this Bill and this is a good opportunity to bring in a strong Bill to counter excessive zeal by nursing home proprietors who might wish to maximise their profits by providing unsatisfactory services or an unacceptably low level of care for the most vulnerable in our society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been mentioned that there has <Col N="1101" /> been a massive mushrooming growth in the number of nursing homes in this country particularly in Dublin.  That is not surprising because nursing homes are now big business and big business entrepreneurs research where they will invest. The research shows that in ten or 11 years in the greater Dublin area, for example, there will be a 30 per cent increase in the numbers of elderly requiring nursing home care.  Obviously big business entrepreneurs are moving into a developing market.  Years ago there were voluntary and religious organisations and charitable institutions whose motivation was other than profit but nowadays there is a new breed of developer buying up old estates and plots of land and developing nursing homes with the aim of making a profit as in any other business.  It is, therefore, important that this legislation be strong, that it protects people against the zeal to make money and will guard old people by ensuring that there is maximum compliance with the law by proprietors of nursing homes.  This Bill will have to ensure that health boards will have sufficient powers and finance to police the industry.</P>
    <P>The average rate being charged for accommodation in a private nursing home in the Dublin area nowadays is between £150 and £200 per week.  This accommodation is clearly more expensive than luxury hotels.  At the moment about one-third of our population is living in proverty.  In ten or 11 years' time there will be a 30 per cent increase in the need for nursing home care.  These elderly people will mostly comprise people on low incomes, people with State pensions. How can they afford to pay for nursing homes even at today's average prices?  In ten years' time the cost will be substantially greater.  We should examine the reasons for the growth in nursing homes. One reason is because the State is cutting back on beds in this area and also because our attitudes have changed towards the elderly.</P>
    <P>The State cannot rely on a Nurse-Nightingale-type response from spouses or family members, particularly daughters of elderly parents, to the degree that they <Col N="1102" /> could ten or 12 years ago because the family unit is not as cohesive now as it was then.  The fact that the State is unable to provide sufficient jobs for its citizens obliges many to leave behind in Ireland elderly parents while they emigrate to England or America in search of work. The moral exploitation of families by the State does not work to the same extent as before when people, usually a daughter, would be pressured into not getting married in order to do her Christian duty and care for an ailing and aging mother or father.  Now people expect the State should have a role to play and these tremendous moral obligations should not be put on family members who have their own lives to live.</P>
    <P>This brings me back to the question of subventions.  Where are the increasing number of elderly people going to get £100 to £200 a week to pay for a place in a nursing home?  In the absence of sufficient facilities and beds being provided by the State, substantial subventions must be provided by the health boards, and this is the kernel of the debate.  Deputy Yates said that in his view people have a legal right to subventions and section 54 of the Health Act, 1953, stipulates that people who require institutional care should, if they cannot fund it themselves, be given assistance. The relevant section of the Act, which Deputy Yates quoted, provides that it shall be the duty of a health authority, subject to and in accordance with the provisions of the section and the regulations thereunder, to give to every person in their functional area who is eligible for institutional assistance such institutional assistance as appears to them to be necessary or proper in each particular case.  The Minister more or less supported Deputy Yates saying that, technically, every person entering an approved nursing home is eligible for subvention since the extension of eligibility for care in public hospitals to the whole population in 1979; and that under section 54 of the Health Act, 1970, a health board may pay a subvention to a person in a home approved by the Minister for Health.  He went on to say that the scope <Col N="1103" /> of section 54 had been curbed as no new homes had been approved since 1980; that unfortunately, due to constraints on the financial resources of the health services it was not possible to approve new homes; that there were 94 approved homes out of 332 private and voluntary nursing homes and that the present system of subvention discriminates against the many excellent modern homes which have opened since 1980. Who discriminates?  The Minister is the discriminator.  He discriminates because he has decided that after 1980 no further beds will be receiving State or any Eastern Health Board subventions.  This happened because the Minister put insufficient funds at the disposal of the health boards to enable them to recognise the increasing number of homes that are being built.  The question for the Minister is what difference it would have made to the 238 nursing homes not approved for subvention if they in fact had the Minister's approval?  The question of subventions is the kernel of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister talks about discrimination against the many excellent homes which have been opened since 1980.  He has discriminated against them. How now does he propose to abolish that discrimination?  In July of this year the subvention scheme in the Eastern Health Board area collapsed because of inadequate funding and the unavailability of subvention beds.  This threw the whole system into crisis.  Geriatricians and hospital social workers, having assessed their patients and passed them on for subvention, discovered that the Eastern Health Board had run out of subvention money for new applicants.  The trauma for the very distraught family members trying to get their loved ones into a home was disgraceful.  I dealt with a number of these cases myself.  They had to wait for subvention patients to die before they could be facilitated.  In the Eastern Health Board area, because we had such a mild winter last year, subvention patients were not dying quickly enough to vacate subvention beds in order to allow to come onstream those applicants <Col N="1104" /> who had been waiting for a subvention bed with the Eastern Health Board or in nursing homes.  A queueing system developed adding further to the misery of the families depending on subvention beds.  This resulted in a bottleneck.  It meant that there were patients occupying now scarce acute hospital beds because their family members could not afford to place them in expensive nursing homes. I know of one woman who placed her mother in a nursing home because she understood the subvention was forthcoming. In the meantime, she was borrowing £50 per week.  This working class woman could ill afford to take out a loan of this size to keep her mother in a nursing home, only to discover that there was a huge waiting list of people waiting for subventions building up &mdash; in the region of 100 at that stage &mdash; in the Eastern Health Board area.</P>
    <P>The Minister says that £15 million of public money was paid by way of subsidy to private and voluntary nursing homes. Will the Minister say how much is paid in subvention when only £15 million of public money is going into the voluntary religious and private nursing homes? How much of that is subvention?  My point is that if the Eastern Health Board subvention scheme lapsed because of the lack of subvention beds and lack of funds, how and by what method can more nursing homes be covered for subvention without a corresponding input of financial resources?</P>
    <P>Financial resources are the key to this Bill.  The Minister said he would like to give an assurance that the overall level of financial support for people cared for in nursing homes will not diminish as a result of the Bill; that this provision is not about saving money but about enabling health boards to target their available resources most effectively.  We have already seen what happened in the Eastern Health Board.  Their available resources were insufficient for their needs.  How can we debate a Bill here today without the Minister putting on record how much money will be made available?  I do not see how a system that is not working in the Dublin area can be <Col N="1105" /> extended nationally when it has already been proved that the key element, finance, is missing in the Dublin area.  The rate of subvention is £6.78 a day, or £47.46 a week.</P>
    <P>When talking about using existing funds, is the Minister implying that £47.46 a week might be too much?  Is he talking about a four-tier structured approach to funding?  Is there a need for four different scales for subvention? What does it mean to a person or the person's family with a limited income who cannot afford to place their parent or loved one in a home if they are being assessed at a very low level?  Is the Minister talking about the present subvention of £47.46 being the basic subvention available or it is the maximum?  If it is to be the maximum, are there three other levels below which will be smaller than £47.46?</P>
    <P>What is the basis for calculating the needs of the patient?  Is it the health needs, is it because he needs extra drugs or is it his financial needs which will decide how much subvention will be available?  For example, as patients grow older, how will one monitor claims by nursing homes or family members for a higher amount, and who will monitor them?  If someone is assessed at a low rate because he is reasonably healthy entering the nursing home and his health deteriorates, who starts the lobbying process? Is it the nursing home?  Is it the son or daughter claiming that their parent has deteriorated and now should fall into a different category in order to get more money?  Do we need the extra paperwork that might be involved by doctors, geriatricians, social workers, family members or politicians?  I would like a further explanation of how this tiered system is envisaged to work.  I have reservations about the sliding scale scheme of these proposals and unless the Minister can convince me otherwise I feel a single weekly payment might have more merit.</P>
    <P>How does the Minister propose to control prices in nursing homes?  If he extends this subvention scheme and opens up more hospitals to the availability of subventions, will the extended <Col N="1106" /> application of subventions be seen more as grant assistance which in turn will allow nursing homes to increase their charges? This Bill will be next to useless unless it is taken together with other areas.  If it supersedes the Health (Homes for Incapacitated Persons) Act, 1964, how soon can we debate the new regulations outlining the requirements a home must meet that are promised?  When can we see the regulations for the light, moderate and heavy categories and dementia as listed? How are the light, moderate and heavy categories to be applied?  What levels of funding will be available for subvention? How does one move from one classification, say moderate to light or moderate to heavy?  Are we to involve a massive bureaucratic machine, with doctors, geriatricians, social workers, parents, nursing home operators and politicians lobbying the Minister?  If that is to be the scenario we might be better off addressing the system of having one lump sum weekly allocation.</P>
    <P>Without these regulations before us I cannot see how we can seriously consider the Bill.  When are we to get the regulations? How soon?  They will be an integral part of the debate on the Bill and in their absence we are creating a debate minus 50 per cent of the information.  I will leave it at that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to a number of debates in this House and I have seen Members of the Opposition benches literally jumping up and down at times in an effort to make a point.  To date I am delighted and heartened that there seems to be a general consensus on this issue.  It shows the humanitarian aspect of politicians when too often you read about other aspects.  All speakers who have contributed here have done so out of a sense of responsibility and their contributions were geared so that we got all angles of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this we are making sure that the elderly are cared for.  Let us not forget that one day that Bill might be dealing with some of us.  Old age will creep up on us all.  During my reading this year I came across a quotation from a man <Col N="1107" /> called Trotsky who said: &ldquo;Old age is the most unexpected of all things that happened to man&rdquo;.  Therefore it is important that we have consensus here and that we get things right at the very beginning.  I compliment the Minister and his officials on the excellent presentation and the work they have obviously put into this Bill.  Being involved in that business myself, I can see it is not before time somebody came up with this.  I congratulate the Minister on the package he has put together and I am sure that the elderly can only benefit from here on in.</P>
    <P>As I have come in at such a late stage in the debate most of the points I wish to make have been covered already. However, I feel it is imperative that we get nursing homes registered right in the beginning and that registers be compiled and sent to the relevant people, doctors, nurses, community workers, etc.  One of the words used most commonly in this debate has been &ldquo;mushroom&rdquo;.  Let us face it, nursing homes have been mushrooming around the place and in my own practice I have found that sometimes I am called to an area which previously I did not know existed.  It is important that registration be brought in and that a licence be introduced for the people involved.  I feel nursing homes have been inclined to mushroom because one which has better amenities, is nearer to churches, etc. may open up at the expense of another which closes down.  Perhaps expense enters into this too.  I do not think the closing down has anything to do with nursing care or anything else that goes on in these homes.  Our Irish Nurses Organisation is one of the most up to date and professional of all.  We are proud of our Irish nurses.</P>
    <P>While I have complimented the officials concerned in this, I agree with a certain amount of what Deputy Yates and other Members of the Opposition said.  I am sure from the way the Minister and his officials have prepared this Bill that all those points have been clarified. I am a little hesitant about Deputy Yates' solution of boarding out.  This is a fine way in which to approach matters, but <Col N="1108" /> boarding out seems to be a Cinderella solution which can also save taxpayers' money.  I am wary of it because, let us face it, would any of us reputedly reasonably well off people be prepared to take an elderly person into our families?  I have great admiration for those of us who do this, but boarding out can be abused. In certain areas people may be brought in for profit.  I would like to see boarding out houses categorised and graded if necessary in the way Bord Fáilte grade houses and that they be thoroughly inspected with regard to the type of householder we are permitting to do this. I hope I am not misunderstood here.  I have seen people who were excellently well boarded out, but I have also seen elderly people boarded in circumstances which were far from ideal.</P>
    <P>Deputy Howlin asked why all these nursing homes were springing up and he said it was because we were closing down district hospitals.  I fail to agree with him on that and I could argue the point but then we would be getting away from the matter of this debate.  However, even if he is right I feel some good has come out of it.  District hospitals are fine.  They are grand places and well looked after, but a great many of our elderly are imprisoned in district hospitals.  Much better care can be taken of them in properly designated nursing homes.  It is well known that elderly people can be dumped into nursing homes and spend the rest of their lives in them.</P>
    <P>The idea of nursing homes is a good one provided they are properly organised, as the Minister and his officials have set out to ensure.  The Minister and his officials have now directed their attention where it should be.  In relation to the day-to-day existence of elderly people a number of speakers asked how often have you walked into a nursing home and seen a row or two rows of elderly people literally embedded in their chairs with nothing to do except look at the television set or at each other.  When they are aroused from this stupor of boredom and medication, how often do we treat them <Col N="1109" /> like children or demented people?  Actually, they are normal human beings who have come to a certain stage in their life and this is all that is left for them.</P>
    <P>Being isolated, house-bound, lonely and bored is a sad way to be at any stage of one's life, but more so when one is aware that not much is left and particularly when there is no reason to expect any improvement.  That is why from today onwards we are expecting an improvement.  As doctors, as health boards and as Government we are laudable in the way we think about our community services.  Our community services are doing an excellent job.  If they can keep that claim on excellence we, as doctors, health boards and Government must literally harass them so that the reality will match the rhetoric.  It is important that our community services are kept on their toes &mdash; I know they are &mdash; and that excellence is maintained at community services level.</P>
    <P>I would urge much more local community involvement in the care of the elderly.  There is a responsibility on us to highlight the nursing home in a different vein not as a profit-making organisation or that it should be regarded as the responsibility of the health board to look after them.  These are places where people exist.  The local community could make the people's lives much more fulfilling. As Deputy Barrett and others have said, we should stop asking for more grants for this and that.  I would like to see voluntary committees set up at community level independent, if necessary, of the health boards and of the Department. Perhaps representatives of the community could be put on these committees so that more local communities can take care of the shortfalls and provide better amenities in the actual nursing homes.  We have a project &mdash; of which the Minister is aware &mdash; whereby a great deal has been achieved by the local community. When it comes to a deserving cause the people of Ireland, and certainly the people of Donegal, will rise to the occasion and will provide these amenities. Perhaps health board moneys could be diverted to these projects.  A lot more <Col N="1110" /> could be done at community level.  At this point I would like to thank the People in Need from whom I received a cheque for £40,000 last Monday week.  People in Need is run on a national basis and it goes to show what the people of Ireland can do when a deserving cause comes up.  I take the opportunity to thank the People in Need and I hope that the good work will continue.  I believe that much good work could be done at local community level.  I understand they are going ahead next year and I am sure they will be twice as successful.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned the high regard in which I hold our Irish nurses.  I urge the health boards, when these licences are being granted that they be granted to the people who will take care of the elderly. The properly trained nurse is vital in the private nursing homes and in nursing homes in general.  Elderly and demented patients can be quite a handful with getting up at night, hallucinations and so on. The quality of our nurses in these homes must be maintained.  Too often the elderly are overprescribed and the Minister has admitted that there is a tendency to over-prescribe for the sake of convenience. I hope that the nurses can be geared towards the proper care of the elderly rather than with the use of so many drugs.  I will not continue much longer as, perhaps, there are others who wish to contribute.  The matter of confidentiality is important.  I know that the Minister and his officials will look into that aspect.  I agree with Deputy Wallace that it is imperative that where we get a husband and wife or a brother and sister, while it may cause problems at ground level, we should ensure as caring people that they be placed together and not be put at different ends of the county.  These are the teething problems that will arise in different localities from time to time. With the community services we now have I feel they will be well and truly looked into.</P>
    <P>There is an old saying that old dogs cannot be taught new tricks.  I am not sure whether I agree with that saying in its entirety.  Many of our elderly people have a little experience of receiving <Col N="1111" /> instruction.  I am not saying I am advocating education for the elderly but certainly I would like to see more stimulation being brought about because I do not think that these old &ldquo;dogs&rdquo;&mdash; which I call them, on perfectly friendly terms &mdash; could not be taught new tricks.  I have done some reading on the matter and I found that in the University of Queens-land a survey was carried out on 55 people over the age of 60 where they tried to experiment with teaching them German: 38 passed, and seven passed with honours. There is a feeling that as we get older our intellect tends to diminish as well.  I would like to see more studies carried out on elderly people as I am sure there is an area of brain stimulation that would keep people active.</P>
    <P>I again congratulate the Minister and his officials on bringing forward this Bill. There are other aspects such as subvention etc. which the Minister and his advisers are qualified &mdash; rather than my making any suggestions &mdash; to look into it.  The improved legislation is necessary in this area.  I am delighted that we have general consensus on the matter from across the floor.  This legislation is fair and reasonable and I hope it will go through this House efficiently and in the manner which it should and which we would all like to see.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say to the Minister that the Green Party, Comhaontas Glas, broadly welcome this legislation but at the same time it must be said that the primary motive for the setting up of these private nursing homes is financial and sometimes the quality of care provided is less than desirable.  Therefore, we agree that minimum requirements be enforced by the health boards.  The ideal, of course, is that the elderly could be cared for by their own relatives.  This could be made possible if the proposed subvention was first offered to family members and if provision could be made to allow for some short career breaks throughout the year.  Elderly relatives could then be boarded out to a nursing home of their choice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1112" /> I agree with Deputy McDaid when he said that we need more community involvement in nursing care.  It is very important to have care for the elderly less State-centred.  Unfortunately, some elderly people cannot be accommodated at home due to chronic mental or physical illness and the need of nursing care and good medical back-up.  Successive Governments have failed to provide care for these people.  In recent times they have closed down district hospitals wherein the sick and elderly were looked after. The onus has now fallen on the private sector to provide for the needs of our elderly population.  This is not a desirable situation, especially in the absence of enforced standards.</P>
    <P>There are a couple of points I must raise.  Sometimes elderly people choose to reside in nursing homes not for reasons of mental or physical infirmity but for social support, company and security. Nowhere in this Bill is there any reference made to the provision of recreational facilities.  Most institutions care adequately for the physical needs of patients.  When I have had occasion to visit a nursing home patients have been sitting in armchairs beside their beds without stimulation of any kind.  We all need some form of recreation or stimulation to function properly and the elderly are no exception.  I should like to see a section which would include provision for the recreational needs of the patients in the form of dayrooms with games, newspapers and regularly organised social activities.</P>
    <P>One other point concerns me.  If a new nursing home is refused a licence under section 4 (3), could the applicant be entitled to monetary compensation?</P>
    <P>The Green Party broadly welcome this Bill.  I ask the Minister to take note of the points I have raised, which I believe to be very important for the successful operation of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I broadly welcome this very necessary Bill.  Most organisations and individuals involved in this field have called for a code of standards and regulations governing all nursing homes, as <Col N="1113" /> well as the registration of such homes. The purpose of the Bill is to promote higher standards of care for dependent people in nursing homes and to change the arrangements whereby subventions can be made available to all people in nursing homes.  The Bill is also designed to facilitate health boards in making arrangements for the boarding out of persons who can no longer live at home.</P>
      <P>The care of elderly and dependent persons is a growing phenomenon which will in time demand greater Exchequer allocations. The demographic trends are quite evident.  By the year 2011 a population of 414,000 elderly people is forecast, an increase of 10 per cent.  In urban areas the increase will be more marked. There is obviously a need for a greater degree of forward planning and over the years there will be a greater need for the allocation of resources.</P>
      <P>In many ways the Bill meets the demands of those who have been calling for regulations in this area.  It will also improve the public perception of nursing homes.  Unfortunately very many good nursing homes suffered from a rather poor public perception which did not marry with reality.  If this Bill can bring about uniformity of standards it will help to rid the country of that perception.</P>
      <P>The Bill proposes a licensing system for all nursing homes.  I agree with the Minister's proposal that the health board should be the licensing authority.  The private nursing association have suggested an independent licensing authority, claiming that this would lead to greater uniformity.  In my view the health boards represent the better option in that they would have a greater degree of objectivity in issuing licences and inspecting premises.  Objectivity is more important than uniformity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill also authorises the health boards to provide training for nursing home staff and to provide a range of ancillary services such as chiropody and physiotherapy.  This is very welcome.  It is essential to have properly trained and well qualified people in nursing homes. It is important that standards of training should be on a par with the standards for <Col N="1114" /> training nurses in hospitals.  I welcome the Minister's intentions in this regard. He might also bear in mind the point raised by Deputy McDaid concerning intellectual stimulus for the elderly in nursing homes so that they can have an active and participatory intellectual life to the end.</P>
    <P>The health boards will be given power to inspect premises on an on-going basis. This is important in order to prevent abuses.  Two areas are giving cause for concern to those engaged in running nursing homes.  One relates to the subvention. The Bill provides that all nursing homes open since 1980 will be entitled to a subvention, but it is important that some commitment should be given to provide increased resources in the future to care for the growing number of people who will need nursing home accommodation.</P>
    <P>The concept of boarding out is also giving cause for concern.  If boarding out of more than one person is allowed in a private dwelling, this could leave a very convenient loophole for those who would wish to avoid meeting the standards laid down in this legislation.  The Minister might clarify whether boarding out will relate to one person or to more than one person.  The Bill defines a nursing home as an institution which will cater for two or more than two dependent persons.  If boarding out can cover two or more than two people, this Bill could be undermined. The Minister might clarify that matter.</P>
    <P>There was a general perception that nursing homes were of a low standard, lacking in care and almost merciless in their approach to the elderly.  I visited a number of private nursing homes in my area of Cork, particularly some of the newer homes.  The standard of care and comfort was exemplary in many of them and they met the highest standards in regard to fire regulations.  There is a role for the private nursing home in the care of the elderly.  As demographic trends demand that society provide greater care, private nursing homes will assume greater importance.  There are many fine operators in this field and we should not <Col N="1115" /> constantly make derogatory remarks about them.</P>
    <P>Regarding fire regulations, any new nursing home should have to comply with the requirements of the fire officer in the locality.  An inspection should take place before the issuing of a licence to ensure that the regulations are being fully complied with.  The Minister might consider including such a provision in the Bill.</P>
    <P>This Bill represents a watershed in the care of the elderly.  I welcome it and compliment the Minister on his initiative.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Rarely has there been such a spirit of <i>glasnost</i> or consensus in the House in relation to any measure as we are witnessing in regard to this Bill.  I compliment the Minister on bringing it before the House and on the considerable detail contained in it.  The legislation puts in place a very definite set of standards for the supervision and regulation of nursing homes.  In an era when we are so conscious of applying minimum standards and maximum standards for services in every area of activity, it is doubly imperative that we set down, regulate and stipulate the highest possible standards for our senior citizens.  These people took our country through its formative years, reared families, worked hard for their kith and kin and saw the country through changing times and &mdash; very often &mdash; difficult changing economic circumstances. Some of them now are totally dependent on others and need to be cared for.  As a modern generation and as legislators it is our social and political duty to ensure that the dignity of our senior citizens is upheld and that their welfare is not just protected but promoted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ultimately, as has been said, it is the duty of the State to ensure that those who cannot look after themselves are fully looked after.  Like speakers on all sides of the House, I want to pay tribute to the marvellous level of care that has been provided for such people over the years in private nursing homes and hospitals. They have done marvellous work looking after the elderly, they have given a standard of care and accommodation second <Col N="1116" /> to none and, in many cases, this has been under-appreciated and unrecognised. These institutions have stepped in, picked up the pieces and filled the vacuum when the State has not been in a position, or has not been required or called upon to do so.</P>
    <P>When one considers that almost 40 per cent of the elderly people placed in institutional care are looked after by the private sector, one appreciates the scale of their contribution.  When the Irish Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes' Association were set up in 1974 their aims were very basic and straightforward, to encourage and to promote adequate standards of accommodation, facilities and patient care in private nursing homes specialising in the care of the elderly. They were essentially a self-monitoring body, which was very commendable, because they set out to ensure compliance with essential basic requirements. The association set down the same set of guidelines as those laid down by the Department of Health.  However, the important thing is that they were not just relying on the Department, the health boards or their officials to monitor, implement or enforce these requirements. Each nursing home is inspected by members of the association and they are very rigid in their insistence on adherence to the standards they have laid down.  They are adamant that these must be observed and members are compelled to supply adequate medical staffing, satisfactory hygiene conditions for storage and in the preparation of food and adequate accommodation for the safe keeping of drugs, and so on.</P>
    <P>The owners of nursing homes would be the first to acknowledge that, by and large, they have been responsible for bringing a certain amount of public odium, or a bad image, on themselves. Unfortunately, this adverse publicity arose because of the relatively small number of bad apples in the barrel.  This always arises when there is a small number of sensational but well publicised cases.  It is regrettable that a small number of transgressors of the code, discipline and regulations have been <Col N="1117" /> responsible for besmirching the good name of the private nursing homes operating in this country because, as was acknowledged on all sides of the House, these people have done invaluable work. It is, therefore, something of which the members are very conscious and they realise more than anybody else that they have a public relations role to fulfil, that it is in everybody's interest to ensure that standards are maintained and that they must eliminate any question mark that might possibly exist in relation to how private nursing homes are operated.</P>
    <P>It has been acknowledged that there is nothing more natural than for someone to spend their final years in the safe keeping and company of their own family. Nothing can supplant the relative security of mind of spending one's final days in the extended family.  It is mutually beneficial to the family and to the elderly person.  However, this is not always possible and anyone placing a relative or friend in a nursing home must be absolutely satisfied and have total confidence in the management and operation of that home.  To place someone in a nursing home is a sad and &mdash; very often &mdash; traumatic experience but sometimes it is necessary.  There must, therefore, be no doubt, not even the slightest taint or suspicion, about the sensitivity and the quality of care provided.</P>
    <P>One of the most commendable aspects of the homes run by members of the IPHNA is their size.  Generally they care for between 15 and 20 patients which means there are obvious advantages from the point of view of patient care.  It is obvious that the smaller the unit or institution the greater the sense of personal care, identity and community.  Given that the IPHNA have imposed their own standards, I would like to see them adapt a fairly binding principle that they would not go above this threshold of 20.  Size must be a determining factor from the point of view of community, fellowship, quality of care, the elimination of anonymity and, generally speaking, providing a high level of care and sense of belonging.</P>
    <P>Members of the nursing profession <Col N="1118" /> have a special advantage and the IPHNA exhort and encourage people who set up private nursing homes to have basic nursing qualifications.  There is nobody more qualified to give this kind of nursing or care than someone who has been through the rigours of nursing training.  Again, from the point of view of the elimination of any taint or suspicion that something is speculative or commercial by nature, we should encourage and exhort &mdash; and maybe even eventually insist &mdash; that anyone who decides to set up a private nursing home should have basic nursing qualifications.</P>
    <P>As other Deputies said, this legislation is required and welcomed by all conscientious people inside and outside nursing homes.  However, the Minister will have to give certain assurances to the management of such institutions.  I am talking about complaints that surface from time to time, and very often validated by experience, that there tends to be a general tardiness on the part of health boards to making subventions to these homes.  The management of such institutions very often complain that they are left for many weeks &mdash; in some cases months &mdash; before they receive subventions. These people must balance their books, like the Department and the health boards, and they should be relatively confident that they would receive such subventions within a specified period of time.  That is why I would like to see the Minister and the Department insist that health boards should be compelled, within a specific period, to make the necessary cheques available to the management of such nursing homes.  At present if a person has a medical card and is being looked after at home he or she is entitled to incontinence sheets and pads. Unfortunately, however, if that person is taken into a private nursing home he or she does not enjoy that facility at a cost to the State.  When one considers that the cost of these pads is something in the region of £20 per month it is clear that it is a considerable imposition on nursing homes which are already operating on a tight budget.  In all fairness, in relation to the application of the new guidelines and <Col N="1119" /> subventions, it should be looked at and sympathetically addressed by the Minister, the Department and the health boards.</P>
    <P>The level of subvention, which was mentioned by Deputies McDaid and Martin, will have to be seriously looked at.  A similar institution in the UK receives £140 sterling per patient per week.  I know we are living in two different economies, but the level of subvention here will have to be enhanced and increased by virtue of the fact that there will be a considerable influx of people to private nursing homes who, hitherto, were not in a position to avail of them.  It is obvious that something will have to be done in this respect.  I concur fully with the point made by Deputy McDaid that it goes without saying that, when and if somebody is admitted to a nursing home, apart from basic nursing care, there are other aspects of their wellbeing that must be taken into consideration.</P>
    <P>It also goes without saying that, if somebody is to stave off or avoid senility they must be stimulated.  As Deputy Garland has said, very often the only way one can maintain such stimulation, staving off senility, is by the provision of the necessary group therapy dynamics and activities within nursing homes, thereby ensuring that people operate to their full potential and capacity at all times.  That is in the interests of everybody concerned and the long-term atmosphere of the nursing homes, apart altogether from the welfare of the patient.  This should be regarded as a basic or core facility in nursing homes.</P>
    <P>I share the apprehension expressed on all sides of the House in regard to the need to regulate on a more formal basis the boarding-out scheme which was pioneered in the Western Health Board area. Indeed it was the brainchild of a community care supervisor within that health board area and appears to work fairly well.  However, that system is capable of being abused.  There is undoubted evidence that in some cases there is overcrowding when the necessary care and <Col N="1120" /> concern do not obtain.  Certainly the need for group therapy dynamics or stimulation does not obtain at all in some of the boarding-out facilities provided in the Western Health Board area.  Such therapy and stimulation has a central role to play in the overall geriatric care and is something we shall have to regulate and monitor on a continuous basis.</P>
    <P>I share the apprehensions of those who seek the substitution of the word &ldquo;licence&rdquo; by another.  While the word itself does not have any deleterious connotations, generally one tends to associate licences with, say, cars, guns, public houses, dogs and so on.  When talking about the quality of human care I should prefer that some other word be used. The association accept the need for the concept of a licence.  Of course, we have heard also about the rod licence.  It appears we are talking about a technical substitution there also.  I share generally the views of people within the profession and managements of nursing homes that some other word be substituted.</P>
    <P>Like everybody else we wish this Bill a speedy passage and look forward to the implementation of its provisions which can only be good for all concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>A large part of nursing home accommodation for the aged and disabled is provided in privately-run premises.  It is crucial to the overall health care programme that such facilities be properly maintained.  With the increased life expectancy of recent decades accommodation for the aged constitutes an even more pressing need than was the case heretofore.  It is necessary that there be adequate control to ensure that nursing home accommodation is of a satisfactory standard, thereby ensuring that our aged citizens are not neglected or exploited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Bill before the House. We must also pay tribute to those who have provided such accommodation on a voluntary or private basis over the years. I am a member of a health board who has visited many institutions over the last 15 or 16 years.  One cannot but be struck by the overall improvement effected <Col N="1121" /> whether in psychiatric, geriatric or general hospitals but particularly by that effected in geriatric institutions within health board areas.  Such institutions have improved beyond all expectations in recent years.  Nonetheless there remains a problem with regard to securing accommodation for our aged.  The demand for such accommodation will continue to exceed that available at either health board or private level.  We know this problem is aggravated by longer life expectancy, by the number of households where entire families are working and who are unable to take care of their elderly members.</P>
    <P>Approximately three years ago the North Eastern Health Board, of which I am a member, established a committee to prepare a report on the care of the aged and examine all aspects of accommodation, assessment and so on.  One point emerged from this undertaking which was the need for a strict system of monitoring all patients admitted to homes.  We discovered that approximately 20 per cent of residents in some health board institutions &mdash; and this would apply to voluntary institutions also &mdash; were admitted to such residential care much earlier than was considered necessary. With the present emphasis being placed on community rather than institutional care there must be a reduction effected in the numbers being admitted to institutional care.  In the course of preparation of that report the members of the North Eastern Health Board visited many institutions outside our area, provided by health boards and privately. In drawing up that report it clearly emerged that there is no substitute for allowing people to remain as long as possible in their home and local environment. This concept has been advanced considerably by the work undertaken in recent years at health board and local authority level.  For example, there is the provision of sheltered housing for elderly. This constitutes the most effective system of accommodation for such people and carries the added advantage of minimising inconvenience for home help, district nurses and doctors.  It also <Col N="1122" /> means that some residents can help others on the spot.  Many such local authority group housing schemes have small community centres sited adjacent thereto, not alone for the use of residents but for the community at large on a day-to-day basis when they can avail of the various services provided.</P>
    <P>The housing aid for the elderly scheme has met a great need in recent years. There has been much work undertaken, such as refurbishment, draughtproofing of windows and doors, slate replacement and so on carried out by AnCO and other tradesmen engaged under the provisions of the scheme.  There was the very laudable suggestion by the Department of the Environment recently also which was that the scheme be extended for the provision of water and sewerage facilities. Certainly the implementation of that scheme has improved the living conditions of many in rural areas.</P>
    <P>In the course of our committee deliberations some pertinent statistics were highlighted.  For example, with a population of fewer than 287,000 in the counties of Cavan, Monaghan, Louth and Meath we discovered there were in excess of 30,000 aged 65 years and over; that is according to the 1981 Census.  The breakdown of that figure showed that 32 per cent were aged 75 and over, 16.8 per cent aged 80 and over, 58 per cent were single and widowed, with 19.3 per cent living alone.  That statistic of almost 20 per cent of those in excess of 65 living alone presents enormous problems.  Persons in that category are vulnerable to health-related problems, loneliness and lack of support.  There is a great need to provide this service for them so as to ensure that they can stay in their own environment.</P>
    <P>The previous speaker referred to what has been done for the aged in his county. One of the institutions we visited at that time was in Castlebar.  It was our view that the general principles and practices operated by the Western Health Board in the institution in Castlebar represented a very appropriate model of care in areas of geriatric assessment, rehabilitation, out-patient clinics, extended nursing care, domiciliary care of the elderly in <Col N="1123" /> the community and the integration of hospital and community services.  It was one of the best models of care which we saw and I hope the Department of Health will bring this institution to the notice of other health boards so that they can base their services on it.  Any scheme which works satisfactorily like the one in Castlebar should be extended to all health board areas.</P>
    <P>The voluntary institutions which maintain elderly people in suitable conditions near to their relatives and friends also provide a valuable service to the local community.  They can also make a significant contribution to the development of day care and shelter services which are aimed at keeping elderly people active and independent in the community especially when their premises are strategically located.</P>
    <P>Some of the previous speakers referred to boarding out and the FAS scheme.  For an elderly person boarding-out can be a good substitute for a normal healthy family home.  It is especially good for people who cannot live alone or who live in isolation and who do not need medical care.  It can also be used very effectively to give short-term assistance to families who have to care for elderly relatives. Careful assessment is needed of the people being boarded out, the families receiving them and the accommodation being provided.  These arrangements must be monitored continually by the health board staff.  The boarding out scheme is operating effectively in some areas and it could be developed further in many other areas.  As has been mentioned in some cases, part of the cost of boarding-out is met by subvention from the health boards.</P>
    <P>Some nursing homes have expressed concern that the licensing system proposed could militate against owners who might seek funds for extensions or repairs and there could also be problems when the property is being handed on to somebody else.  Reference has been made to registration rather than a licence.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that there has been terrific improvements at all levels of care <Col N="1124" /> for the elderly.  It is only right that our elderly people should get the care and attention in their declining years which they deserve.  As I have said before I welcome this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>I also very much welcome this Bill, not as a total answer or the definitive charter for nursing homes but as a progressive step in the right direction. The position of my party has been very thoroughly and clearly outlined as always by our spokesperson, Deputy Ivan Yates, but as a Dáil Deputy who comes from the north-west and represents the Sligo-Leitrim area I should at least make a contribution, however brief, to this debate.</P>
      <P>As many Deputies have already outlined, we have an ageing population.  This problem will get progressively worse in the years ahead and will become more acute after the year 2000.  All the negative aspects which manifest themselves nationally in our demographic trend are all the more manifest in the north-west area.  This, of course, is part of our history and is a legacy of emigration, particularly the emigration which took place in the fifties and the emigration which is taking place at present.  The social structure and fabric of whole communities has been changed by emigration but of all the areas hit by emigration down through the years the worst areas hit &mdash; when broken down on a district electoral area basis &mdash; are Kilkelly and Swinford in Mayo, Aclare, Tubercurry, south Sligo and Leitrim.  All of these areas lost more of their population through emigration than did any area of Vietnam during the horrific war which took place there in relatively recent times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Not alone have I a particular interest in this area but obviously all Deputies who have contributed to the debate have a particular interest also.  It is only right that all of us should give major priority to our senior citizens.  There is an obligation on all of us to do that.  The people who are now in nursing homes or about to go into nursing homes lived through the very hungry times of the twenties and thirties, the formative years of this State. <Col N="1125" /> These people gave of their very best in building up this State and it is only right, as Deputy Leonard said, that in their declining years they should be treated with dignity and given freedom, comfort and maximum care.</P>
    <P>As I have said the north-western area, even extending over to the Minister's area of County Monaghan, has always been very badly hit by emigration.  That trend which was forced by economic necessity was accompanied by another factor, the extraordinary care people at home gave to the elderly often in inadequate housing and without the facilities which are now available in old persons' homes.  The overall result of this combination of factors is that a large number of elderly people live on their own and they are the people who are being considered in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I want to give an example of the emigration which I have been talking about and which happened during my father's time.  I have three first cousins living in Ireland, 37 in New York city, six in Boston and five in Chicago.  That is a reflection of the emigration which went on at that time.  Perhaps I should be running for election in the United States and not in Sligo.</P>
    <P>Excellent work is being carried out in the North Western Health Board area particularly in St. John's Hospital, by the Sisters in Nazareth House in Sligo, in the nursing home in Ballymote and the homes for the elderly run by the North Western Health Board and by different orders of nuns in the area.  However, this work alone is not sufficient.  Their services need to be supplemented and extra care and space is needed.  The nursing homes can have excellent potential in this regard.  A well run nursing home &mdash; hopefully this Bill will ensure that all nursing homes are well run &mdash; can be of enormous advantage and very attractive. One of the big advantages is that they will all be small with a limited number of people living in them.  As a result the patients will receive personalised care and treatment.  With more nursing homes starting there is a greater prospect of <Col N="1126" /> people being cared for in their own community.</P>
    <P>Medical and nursing care are very important but equally important for the general wellbeing of the people in those nursing homes is the environment in which they live.  It is important that they should live in an environment they know and that their family, friends and neighbours be able to visit them.  Indeed, it is important that school children, when returning from school, can call to see their relatives in nursing homes.  Small nursing homes can be of great advantage if they are located adjacent to the homes of the patients in that burdensome travel is eliminated.  If there is a lot of travel involved friends and neighbours find it difficult to visit patients in those homes.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister will agree that the training and professional qualifications of the staff in such homes is important.  I hope the Minister in the course of his reply will elaborate on his views about the qualifications of staff of such nursing homes.  It is important that the staff should be properly trained and we should have such a provision built in permanently into the structure we are proposing.  As a medical doctor the Minister will be familiar with the need for the ongoing training of staff.  In this and other areas of medicine new developments are taking place almost daily.  The new techniques being introduced will help the elderly and make their life more pleasant. Great attention should be paid to the ancillary facilities to help people pass the time in a constructive and entertaining fashion.</P>
    <P>Deputies have referred to the need for specialised inspectors to visit such nursing homes.  There is a need for chiropodists to visit nursing homes on a regular basis. There is also a need to arrange a well organised independent supervisory system.  I support that nursing homes should be visited regularly by a medical doctor, as distinct from the doctor employed by the nursing home.  Perhaps, it will be possible for the GP of a patient, or another doctor, to visit those homes on a number of occasions annually.  It is natural that elderly people feel uncertain <Col N="1127" /> or afraid to make legitimate complaints. They fear that there may be repercussions for them.  For that reason it is important that the nursing homes be visited by a person in whom the patients have confidence.  They should be able to make complaints confidentially to a visiting doctor and feel happy that action will be taken.  That is an essential part of any supervision of nursing homes.</P>
    <P>Many Members referred to the question of the subvention by the State towards the cost of keeping people in nursing homes.  The State should pay an amount equivalent to that which it costs to keep an elderly person in a State hospital or home for the elderly.  I accept that there may be new developments in that area and that a boarding-out scheme may be introduced.  The Minister should introduce legislation to cover such developments at a later stage.  There is a potential for such a scheme but there are dangers involved.  However, it will be good if we can have our elderly people cared for within their own community.</P>
    <P>There is no question but that the motivation in running nursing homes is one of profit and the owners of them are entitled to a reasonable return for their efforts. They consider the running of those homes to be a business venture and that is fair enough but we should, as far as we can, keep the business aspect to a minimum and allow for reasonable profits for those who run nursing homes.  We should encourage dedicated people to get involved in running nursing homes because of the value of the service they give to the community.</P>
    <P>I should like to thank the Minister for introducing the Bill but I should like to suggest to him that he should not leave the matter as it is.  We should ensure that there is constant examination of all aspects of care of the elderly.  I suggest to the Minister that he request the Taoiseach to appoint to him a Minister of State, one of the existing Ministers of State, and give that Minister special responsibility for the care of the elderly. Such an appointment need not cost the State one penny extra but it would mean <Col N="1128" /> that the person appointed could work out ways to give better attention to our elderly.  We should give the elderly all the care and attention they need.  The State owes them a debt of gratitude.  Indeed, I suggest that a committee of the House be established to work in conjunction with the Minister and his Department for the care of the elderly.  I have no doubt that Members would be queueing up for membership of such a committee, if one is to judge by the content of contributions to the Second Stage debate on the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister should consider establishing a visiting board whose responsibility it would be to visit nursing homes on a regular basis.  They should have strong powers enshrined in the legislation.  I am not suggesting that the members of that board should act in a voluntary capacity; they should be paid for their work and should be ruthless in ensuring that all nursing homes conform to the regulations. The board should be responsible for ensuring that there are no breaches of regulations and that undesirable practices, not covered by the regulations, are reported so that action can be taken by the appropriate authority.</P>
    <P>All politicians, in the course of their constituency work, are approached by elderly people seeking accommodation in a good home for the elderly.  It is not always possible to procure that accommodation because of the pressure on such accommodation but, generally speaking, it is possible.  I do not think there is any more rewarding job that any politician can do than to look after elderly people.  I might add that no person is more grateful than an elderly person if work is done on his or her behalf.  Generally speaking, ours is a thankless job but the rewards come if we are able to help an elderly person procure accommodation.</P>
    <P>This has been an extraordinary debate. Indeed, it is one of the best I have heard in the Chamber in recent times.  The work done by Members at their clinics, which is often denigrated, is reflected in the contributions to this debate.  TV coverage of the proceedings of the House of Commons commenced today and it is inevitable that we will have TV coverage of the <Col N="1129" /> proceedings of this House.  I have mixed feelings about such a development because in my view it would change the character of the House and the type of contributions made.  The appearance of a Member on TV may become more important than what that person has to say.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I am sorry we did not have TV coverage for this debate today because this Bill is worthy of such coverage.  Had it been televised Deputies would emerge with a slightly better reputation than they are often credited with.  I congratulate the Minister on this Bill.  It is very welcome but it should not be regarded as the total definitive work.  If improvements are needed the Minister should have an open mind and make them as they become apparent.  Very often our elderly are not able to speak for themselves, and what is required from us as legislators, and from the entire community, is constant vigilance to ensure that they have the kind of life they richly deserve.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MattBrennan" hpid="Mr. M. Brennan Mr. M. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister for bringing this Bill before the House.  It is a very good Bill and it is time such a Bill was brought before the House. There is a large elderly population in this country at present and, as the previous speaker, Deputy Nealon, said, there is a great need to look after these people.  I congratulate the North-Western Health Board for the way they are looking after the elderly people in their area and also the doctors and nursing staff at St. John's Hospital, Sligo, Nazareth House, Sligo, and Ballymote nursing home.  I hope the Minister will make a decision soon in regard to the welfare home in Tubbercurry, County Sligo.  The Minister provided money last year from the national lottery toward the provision of this welfare home.  I welcome that.  I also welcome the fact that some sheltered housing will be provided in the grounds of the nursing home.  This is a step in the right direction.  In this sheltered housing people will not be confined to a hospital <Col N="1130" /> or a nursing home but they can live in the nursing home complex.</P>
      <P>I would like to speak very briefly about the spate of break-ins in the homes of elderly people in recent times, particularly in the west.  Elderly people living on their own are the most vulnerable people in our community.  Some greedy violent and ruthless thugs broke into their homes, robbed them and sometimes beat them up.  These people had to go to St. John's Hospital or to Nazareth House in Sligo because they were afraid to live on their own.  A Bill such as this will provide for these people, elderly people who worked so hard and did so much for this country.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister once again for making the necessary money available to enable us to set up the welfare home in Tubbercurry.  The Taoiseach turned the first sod on that project over 12 months ago, and now that it is getting underway I appeal to the Minister to make the necessary finance available to continue with this project because this welfare home is needed.  I feel very strongly about elderly people being 30 or 40 miles away from their own community.  The idea would be a 20 bed welfare home in the community, where people could live in their own environment and among their friends.  That would be a step in the right direction.  Again, I welcome this Bill and congratulate the Minister on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister for introducing this Bill and express the hope that it will eliminate some of the difficulties experienced over the years.  We have identified them by virtue of our experiences in the institutions run by the existing hospitals and health boards.  The general purpose of the Bill is to set out the structures in relation to the buildings and care which we proposed to give to the elderly.  There is no ground in society today more vulnerable and subject to the whims of economic pressure than the elderly.  There are many instances where elderly people, having been admitted to general hospitals, are then discharged and shunted from post to pillar, as it were, in an unceremonious <Col N="1131" /> and undignified fashion that ill befits them.</P>
      <P>Let us examine what happens at present.  When an elderly person &mdash; for instance, a stroke patient &mdash; is admitted to a general hospital he is likely to be there for a week or two at the most and then he is referred elsewhere.  When alternative accommodation is available, either in another hospital specialising in geriatric care or in a health board institution of a minor nature, that is all right but in many instances there is no such accommodation available.  Over the years we have had an opportunity to evaluate the suitability of some of the accommodation that was available, both in the private and public sectors.  I have no hesitation whatever in going on record and saying that up to a few years ago some of the accommodation which was available in the public sector left an awful lot to be desired.  Old, decrepit buildings were being utilised to accommodate the elderly and this, to my mind, was a complete reversal of the manner in which we should have been dealing with the matter. Obviously the elderly are much more subject to climatic changes than any other sector, with the possible exception of babies.  Some of the old buildings in which our elderly were housed over the years were, to say the least, totally and absolutely unsuitable and it was impossible for staff to operate and give a proper degree of service in them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It does not really matter who provides accommodation as long as it is there and a good standard of care is available.  Good solid buildings should be made available wherein that accommodation could be provided.  In the great majority of cases, in recent years in particular, where private accommodation has been provided, the regulations laid down by the Department of Health, the health boards and the fire departments of the various local authorities are sufficient to ensure that the standard of those buildings is equal to if not better than many of the older State-run establishments.  That may well reflect on ourselves as legislators and as members of various boards.  I see nothing <Col N="1132" /> bad in allowing the private sector provide this much needed service provided of course that we never lose sight of the main objective which is to ensure that the right degree of care is provided.</P>
    <P>In that regard I would like to dwell for a few moments on the categories of patients being referred to institutions at present.  We should remember that the extended family is not as available as it used to be to cater for an elderly person within a family.  In recent years, and I am not making a political point, there has been large-scale emigration with the result that in many cases the extended family is not available to the extent it was some years ago to care for an elderly person.  That elderly person is faced with three options.  The first is to enter a welfare home.  This is acceptable where the person is not immobilised and does not require regular medical treatment provided that the patients are categorised and are placed in that kind of environment in the knowledge that they will not have to have recourse to the kind of medical attention provided in a geriatric hospital.  As I see it, we will have to make sure that patients are categorised properly and ensure that we do not have in welfare homes a patient or patients who require regular visits from a doctor or specialist.</P>
    <P>We now come to the person whom nobody wants, the immobilised patient or the patient who requires what is described by the health boards as heavy nursing.  It is not good economics for a private nursing home to take on too many immobilised patients for very obvious reasons.  One reason is that they require a very high degree of medical attention. It is important that a good proportion of those who require heavy nursing are spread between the public and private sectors, otherwise we will end up with those institutions in the public sector which are already overburdened carrying the weight of the problem, the most seriously affected and those most in need of attention.  It is of vital importance that in each community care area there are two to three private institutions and a similar number of public institutions.  In <Col N="1133" /> placing patients we should have regard for the degree of medical attention required at all times and ensure a similar number is placed in both the public and private sectors, thereby ensuring that everybody carries their fair share of responsibility.</P>
    <P>I am sure that most Members of this House have had access to private institutions in recent years and I must say that the degree of service and attention available is absolutely amazing.  In many cases patients are not being maintained in subvented beds but rather the cost is being picked up by their families.  It is not possible to do this in all cases but in a countless number of cases the extended family have clubbed together to pay for the upkeep of an elderly relative in a private institution.  Let me also add that many of these patients have been holders of medical cards for quite a long time.  It is particularly ironic that after a lifetime of work, be it in the public or private sector, and holding a medical card they find it is of no benefit to them whatsoever and they have to go to their relatives and friends to ensure that they get the attention they need at that stage.</P>
    <P>Sheltered housing has been referred to by many Deputies, including Deputy Mattie Brennan who referred to it a few moments ago.  It has an important role to play in the context of this Bill in this sense.  It is not necessary to place all patients who require care and attention in an institution, be it private or public. It is possible, and desirable from the point of view of the State and the patient, to provide sheltered housing where regular medical supervision can be provided, where meals can be prepared in a central commune and where, at the same time, the individual patient would have a degree of privacy not available in a nursing home, hospital or welfare home.  I am thinking here of small blocks of custom-built houses adjacent to a hospital to which medical staff would have ready access and where patients would have a degree of privacy which many elderly people desire and have striven for all their lives.  We should attempt to give them that at this stage of their lives.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1134" /> I would now like to refer to what I would describe as the in-between patient. I referred earlier to the role played by welfare homes.  Incidentally, there are very few welfare homes providing this kind of service.  I can see us arriving at the point where it would be much more economical to provide a service in a welfare home than in a nursing home or in a hospital for a patient who does not require that service at this stage.  We would have no reason to put that person into a hospital.  If it is possible for them to gain access to sheltered housing where they can be supervised and looked after without being totally dependent on either the public or private system then this should be done.  Unfortunately, an insufficient amount of this type of accommodation is available at present with the result that more and more pressure is being put on our general and geriatric hospitals.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be parochial but, for instance, in north Kildare where I live the main geriatric hospital is St. Vincent's in Athy which provides a very acceptable standard of accommodation and which has long since been a leader in providing that service.  All credit is due to the sisters and staff of the hospital for the work they have done during the years.  In fact, this was the only institution providing that service in County Kildare for a long time.</P>
    <P>In recent years we have witnessed the advent of private nursing homes and the subvented bed.  In north Kildare, from the point of view of family visits it is a long way, almost 50 miles, to Athy and it is virtually impossible to expect relatives to travel that distance on a regular basis either to the satisfaction of the patients or the relatives.  There is an on-going problem in endeavouring to achieve that sort of accommodation within a radius of about 20 miles.  Twenty miles in Dublin city would seem a long distance but in the country it would be quite acceptable.  However, we do not have that service within 20 miles.  The point at issue is that the subvented beds available in north Kildare do not nearly meet existing requirements.  I know that in the context of this Bill there are proposals for a <Col N="1135" /> means test so that subvented beds would be available to a wider section of the community.  That would be all right provided it met the problem which is that poor people who do not have the means at present have to go to relatives to try to get sufficient money to place an elderly relative in a private institution since they cannot gain access to the public one which has reached capacity.  The availability of subvented beds is of major importance and this problem has been discussed at every health board meeting and certainly at EHB meetings in recent times.</P>
    <P>While people may say that there have been cutbacks and that the number of beds have been curtailed, the essential problem is that the need is now greater, that more elderly people need accommodation. With each year that passes more and more elderly people have to be catered for.  We do not have the resources within any of our health boards to go even half way towards meeting the requirements.  Different areas may have different problems and in some counties the problem may not be as bad as it is in Kildare.  Will the Minister carefully consider how this Bill will deal with the existing problem &mdash; and deal with it it must, because we cannot go on as we are. I have about ten different patients on my files at the moment who were referred to me by local GPs looking for accommodation for them with geriatric care.  I am only one public representative and I am sure every other public representative is in the same boat.  We have a long waiting list for subvented beds and unfortunately the only way in which a bed becomes vacant is when somebody dies.</P>
    <P>That is not dealing with the problem at all.  The patients trying to gain access to the beds know the situation.  The problem results in old people being shifted from one institution to the next.  A person might be in a Dublin hospital today and back down in a hospital in County Kildare next week and back in Dublin the following week.  That is a most unfair and undignified way in which to treat the elderly.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1136" /> There is a debate whether or not nursing homes could or should provide the kind of service we are talking about.  They should and they can.  In many cases they are doing so more economically than the State.  That is another irony we would need to address.  It is rather peculiar if a bed in a private nursing home turns out to be cheaper than maintaining a patient in a bed in a public institution.  One of the reasons given why that should be is that there is a higher level of expertise in medical attention available in public institutions.  That may or may not be the case and the reverse may be the case in some instances.  We have an opportunity within the context of this Bill to provide a service for which there is an urgent need and at the same time save money. We need a certain amount of loosening up in relation to providing money for subvented beds.  We could build new public institutions but they would cost a lot of money.  We would not have to involve ourselves in such a large capital outlay if we used the private institutions. The only resolution to the problem that I can see in the short-term is to use private institutions provided proper medical attention is available to the patients.</P>
    <P>Like every other Member in the House I have had correspondence from nursing homes.  Without exception a most impressive degree of care and attention is provided by the people running those nursing homes.  Far from it being a business, it is more a vocation because the people who set up these homes generally have a long experience in the nursing or medical professions or in caring for the aged.  This experience stood them in good stead when they set up the nursing homes.</P>
    <P>A few years ago I advised somebody who was in the process of setting up a private nursing home for the elderly.  This person had a large old house which he proposed to adapt.  At that time, and now in hindsight I can honestly say that I gave him good advice, I advised him to forget about adapting the old house and to operate from a green field site and provide new buildings.  After some consideration he did so and it was the right step.  He <Col N="1137" /> provided very high quality accommodation for the patients and the old house is now more valuable because it has never been interfered with.  The quality of the buildings provided adjacent to the old house were complementary from an architectural point of view.  There was a happy blending of the two types of development, the private residence and the nursing home, with the effect that medical attention was readily available to people living in a chalet-type accommodation with a high degree of privacy.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Bill will deal with the problem about which we have all spoken. One could speak for hours outlining the problems that all public representatives have encountered in dealing with the elderly. If there is one group in society that we owe something to it must be the elderly who have worked long and hard for this economy.  When they retire and require care and medical attention or housing we should be in a position to give it to them.  It is unfortunate that up to the present we have not been able to give them the degree of attention they require.</P>
    <P>There is a system of assessment for elderly people.  The degree of assessment that some elderly people have to go through is outrageous; by the time many get through that assessment they can no longer be catered for in a nursing home or in a geriatric hospital.  I would ask the Minister to streamline things so that it will not be necessary to bring a patient anything up to 100 miles to a central location to be assessed, kept there for two or three days, sent back to wherever they came from and told they might have to wait six months or a year, or until accommodation becomes available.  It must be soul destroying for the unfortunate individual in such circumstances. Let us not forget that the elderly depend on those around them.  The more immobilised they become the more dependent and, therefore, the more irritable they become.  Anybody who is dependent on others is subject to the whims of those around them and knowing that is a big problem.</P>
    <P>We are all getting older.  Because of <Col N="1138" /> the age structure in our population there will be more demands on those providing care for the aged as time goes on.  I hope that in this Bill we will set out a resolution to the problem by providing the care and attention that the aged deserve and desire without much more ado.</P>
    <P>I would like to compliment the Minister on bringing in the Bill.  We will have more to say on Committee Stage.  I deliberately refrained from referring to the sections of the Bill at this stage but will do so at a later stage.  Hopefully a degree of agreement will be reached within the House as to how best to deal with the problem because this issue should not be dealt with as a political issue but on the basis of delivering the best possible standard of service for those for whom it is intended.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>First I would like to welcome the Bill which is long overdue.  The original Bill which dealt with the area of care for our senior citizens was defective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At this stage I would like to deal with the problems of subventions.  There is no point having a Bill unless there is a commitment and the finance is provided to ensure that the old can get into a home regardless of their means.  We can all make cases for particular individuals. One case that came to my attention was of a person in their seventies who was brought by ambulance into a general hospital in Louth and, that person's condition having got worse, was told to transfer to a city hospital but under no circumstances could an ambulance be made available.  This person's relatives had to put that person, with drips, into a small car, with no medical care or attention, and make the journey all the way to Dublin, stopping on the way at a public house to get a glass of water for this person.  The relatives felt very aggrieved and wanted to go to the media at that stage, but they allowed things to cool down.  That is an utter disgrace, and this sort of thing still happens in our health service.  This is not relevant to the Bill and I apologise for referring to it but I feel so aggrieved about it that I had to use the opportunity to say that if we are really <Col N="1139" /> concerned about our elderly we have to make the facilities available, and for the very frail and physically incapacitated the right to nursing home care is vital.</P>
    <P>While I welcome the Bill there are certain elements of it that I would like the Minister to have a look at.  Section 52 of the 1970 Act states that a health board shall make available in-patient services for persons with full eligibility and persons with limited eligibility; but while that is written into the existing Bill, we are not providing it.</P>
    <P>Even medical card holders are not being granted their rights.  A constituent of mine was speaking to me about the subventions last week.  All the money has dried up and this person was left with only her pension and, having been in a home for the last ten or 12 years, she is now threatened with being put out of that home.  If we were serious, even under the existing legislation, we should be able to deal with such situations, but we are not doing that.  Every one of us here, as public representatives, is well aware of the extent of the problem in relation to subventions. It is not good enough for the Department to say they gave more money this year than they did last year. The fact remains that there are people worried out of their minds because they cannot get into a home.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister not to delete section 54 because it gives a lot of powers and leaves the Bill much stronger.  Section 7 (2) reads:</P>
    <P>The Minister may be regulations prescribe the amounts that may be paid by health boards under this section and such amounts may be specified by reference to specified degrees of dependency, specified means or circumstances of dependent persons or such other matters as the Minister considers appropriate.</P>
    <P>This is discretion and as far as I am concerned it weakens this aspect of the Bill. In many ways it leaves the responsibility to the Eastern Health Board to decide whether people would be entitled to this care.  That in itself is not going to improve <Col N="1140" /> the situation generally.  The Bill provides that the health board shall be responsible for the care and maintenance of the elderly.  I ask the Minister in respect of those two sections to look again at that provision.  If we are trying to meet the needs of the community at large and the senior citizens, we must be stronger and not leave a discretionary right with the Eastern Health Board or any other board to deal with it in that manner.  Going through the Bill section by section in that regard we have to classify that the people out there are professionals, and that is not coming across in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill places a statutory duty on health boards to license nursing homes and maintain a register of licensed nursing homes.  Nobody could disagree with that and I am delighted that at long last we are going to have some sort of care, responsibility and control.</P>
    <P>I had intended to refer to the next section of the Bill but I use the opportunity this evening to bring the points I have made to the Minister's attention. On behalf of the Labour Party I welcome the Bill and I hope that when we come to the next Stage the Minister can look at all aspects of contributions from all sides of the House and that he will take cognisance of what we are saying.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to make a contribution on this necessary Bill.  Care of the elderly has become very important in our society.  As I see it the most efficient and caring way to go about this task is a joint approach by the Department of Health, the health boards and the people involved in the health care business.  I would like to see this Bill provide the right opportunities whereby those involved in health care can give to the elderly a service of a high standard and an individual nature.  Those involved in this business at the same time must be given the right motivation and assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to see building grants made available from the Department of Health to people who are prepared to provide the service and accommodation for the care of the elderly.  If a private party <Col N="1141" /> satisfies a health board about the necessary standards to provide much needed and modern accommodation for the care of the elderly, then in such case some assistance should be available in the provision of accommodation, namely, a building grant.  This can only improve the quality and standard of accommodation in efficiency, comfort, safety, etc.  This is what the elderly deserve.</P>
    <P>One aspect of care of the elderly that is sometimes forgotten is that at present in both urban and rural Ireland many old people live in constant fear.  Unfortunate people who live on their own have been subjected to attacks when thugs have broken into their houses and robbed them of their possessions.  In some cases if suitable accommodation was available nearby for those elderly people I am sure they would avail of it.  It is, therefore, a most urgent matter that the Department of Health and the health boards give the lead and assistance in every way to the people who are giving the necessary service and those who are prepared to do so.  One of the saddest sights and one which is most annoying is that of an elderly person shaking with fear as a result of attack from thugs.  While the Garda have done their utmost to deal with this scandal, the surest way for the State to care for the elderly is to see that accommodation of the highest quality is provided and the highest standard of care exists.  I know there are elderly people who prefer to live in their own homes, but for those who prefer otherwise accommodation should be available.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill and I impress on the Minister the need to consult with and listen to the views of people involved in the care of the elderly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon) Rory O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the support for the Bill on all sides of the House and I thank the Deputies who contributed to what has been a very constructive debate.  There has been an indication of the concern and the caring approach and sensitivity which we as Members of this House have for the elderly in our society.  Most of the Deputies have spoken about the good balance <Col N="1142" /> achieved in the Bill to improve safeguards for the public and to provide a fair system for the owners of the nursing homes.</P>
      <P>In the time available to me I would like to deal with some of the points made in the earlier stages of the debate and this afternoon.  Deputy Yates asked if we had a policy towards the elderly.  As he is aware, <i>The Years Ahead &mdash; A Policy for the Elderly</i> sets out a comprehensive framework for the development of services for the elderly into the next century. The Government have accepted that report and we are in the process of implementing it.  Health boards have been asked to prepare detailed plans to implement the recommendations of the report.  These plans will be examined by my Department and priorities identified. My Department will work closely with the health boards to implement these plans in the coming years.</P>
      <P>It is a very important principle of our policy towards the elderly that as far as possible they should be supported at home and be able to remain in their own community.  When ill, elderly people should have the same access to acute medical services as younger people.  If an elderly person becomes so dependent that he or she can no longer be cared for at home or in the community, that person should be able to avail of a high standard of nursing care in a health board institution or in a private or voluntary nursing home.</P>
      <P>Deputy Howlin suggested that health boards might use nursing homes on economic grounds only.  This is not my intention. The need for nursing homes was endorsed in the report of the working party, <i>The Years Ahead &mdash; A Policy for the Elderly.</i>  Nursing homes provide patients with a choice of care setting. They give health boards greater flexibility in meeting the needs of dependent people.  They will continue to provide an indispensable level of services for the elderly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of Deputies asked why certain categories of institutions were excluded from the Bill, for example, maternity homes and mental hospitals. They are both subject to registration and <Col N="1143" /> inspection under separate legislation. Institutions managed by, or on behalf of, a Minister or a health board are not included because they are already subject to a statutory and publicly accountable system of management.  Of course, health boards in their homes and hospitals for the elderly will be expected to provide a standard of care that would at least equal those to be set out in the new regulations for nursing homes.  The Bill also excludes care by a family member of another family member such as a child caring for a parent or a spouse.  In the same way a religious community caring for its members is excluded; the community is really the family of the members of the religious order and it would not be appropriate, in my view, for this Bill to include them.  Children's homes have been included because the Children Bill will establish a statutory framework for the registration of these homes.  Voluntary homes for the mentally handicapped, which are in receipt of grants from the Department or a health board, have not been included because it is considered that the existing supervision of the homes is adequate.  Profit making homes for the mentally handicapped will be included under this Bill.  Acute hospitals are excluded; in other words hospitals where patients are receiving acute medical care under the supervision of a registered medical practitioner, not a general practitioner, as suggested by Deputy Yates.  This provision is designed to exclude acute hospitals from the scope of the Bill under section 2 (1) (vi).</P>
    <P>Acute hospitals and nursing homes serve different purposes.  The purpose of an acute hospital is intensive medical investigation and treatment for patients who generally stay for a short period.  A nursing home provides nursing care for dependent people, usually for a considerable period.  This Bill is concerned to ensure high standards of care in such homes.  I believe there are already adequate safeguards in acute hospitals to ensure high standards of nursing care.  It was suggested that facilities provided for alcoholic and drug addicts might be <Col N="1144" /> included but the primary purpose of these centres is not to provide a nursing service; the emphasis is on counselling, self awareness and self help and not on nursing care.  For this reason they have not been included.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies also suggested that the Department of Health, rather than the health boards, should be responsible for the administration of the provisions of the Bill.  A view was expressed about the ability of health boards to apply the agreed standards equitably and consistently across the country.  I believe it would be inappropriate for my Department to take on the responsibilities suggested by a number of Deputies, including Deputy Yates.  The Department is primarily concerned with policy formation, financing and reviewing the performance of those agencies which deliver the services.  The health boards are statutorily responsible for the provision of health and personal social services in their areas.  We are recognising both the statutory position and the practical working arrangements in proposing that health boards will act as a regulatory and monitoring authority in relation to private nursing homes.</P>
    <P>The staff of health boards have the expertise, the local knowledge and the integrity to discharge these functions and it would not, in my view, be either efficient or helpful to involve the Department in this work.  I am, of course, concerned to ensure that agreed standards of assessment, provision and care are applied equally right across the country. My Department are already involved with officers of all the health boards in a working group who have been monitoring the implementation of the 1985 regulations and who are now examining the implications of the proposed legislation for the boards as the licensing authority. This group will be consulted on the content of the new regulations, the preparation on a code of good practice for nursing home care and in drafting guidelines on the implementation of the new regulations.  Other interested parties will also be consulted fully about the regulations and the code of good practice and, <Col N="1145" /> indeed, the matter of regulations was raised a number of times here this evening.  I would like to tell the Deputies that on Committee Stage we will discuss the outline of the regulations we have in mind.</P>
    <P>I will consider whether we should not maintain a standing committee who would help co-ordinate the way in which all health boards discharge their responsibility to the elderly requiring nursing care.  I will also consider the role the National Council for the Aged can usefully play in this area.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sherlock suggested that the requirement on health boards to carry out assessments of dependency and means of a person could cause unnecessary delay. The Bill emphasises the importance of assessment in the new system of subvention. However, it should not result in undue delay.  The kind of assessment envisaged will be modelled on the examples given by Deputy Yates, the involvement of those most directly concerned with the elderly person, for example, the general practitioner and the public health nurse.  I referred in my speech last week to the modern methods of assessing dependency.  A working group are at present drafting an assessment form which will be used in all areas to establish the dependency of a person. This will ensure that people with similar needs will be assessed in the same way whether they live in Tralee, Letterkenny or Cork.  Geriatric physicians will continue to have an important role in monitoring assessment procedures but they may not need to be involved to the same extent in individual assessment.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies raised the question of the qualification of health board staff involved in monitoring standards in nursing homes.  I can assure Deputies that health board inspectors are highly qualified professional staff, mainly nurses assisted by environmental health officers and area medical officers where necessary.</P>
    <P>Concern was also expresed about access by health board officials to nursing home records.  Indeed, Deputy McDaid expressed concern on this issue.  Under <Col N="1146" /> the present regulations nursing homes are obliged to keep records about patients, staff, fire procedures and equipment.  The only person who would have access to the medical part of the records would be a salaried medical officer of the health board or the registered general practitioner with whom the patient was registered. Some concern was expressed that under the Bill health boards will not be in a position to monitor nursing homes effectively.  Health boards are already doing this on a regular basis and I am satisfied that they will be able to carry out the work efficiently.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fennell suggested that the health boards do not have the power to inspect nursing homes at present.  They do have the power as Deputies are aware from some of the decisions and, indeed, there was a court action brought by the health board where a nursing home was in breach of the 1985 regulations.  The existing regulations governing the standards of care in nursing homes have been in place since 1985.  Most private homes meet their requirements in the main.  This Bill provides that these regulations will continue to have effect until new regulations are prepared.  The new regulations will take account of developments, or the standards of care and of the new measures included in the Bill.  I do not think that any nursing home which meets the existing requirements need worry about this Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Byrne sought a further provision on the regulations under the Bill but, as I said, while I will not be in a position to circulate the draft of the regulations for consultation prior to the enactment of the Bill, it is my intention on Committee Stage, to give the House a very clear picture of the general range of the regulations.  Prior to the making of the regulations and after the Bill is enacted, the widest possible consultation will be held with all the various interests.</P>
    <P>I do not have time to deal with all the individual issues that were raised by Deputies.  I would like to thank them for their contributions and I want to assure them that we have taken note of all the matters that were raised by each Deputy <Col N="1147" /> who contributed to the Bill.  I can assure them we will be studying the various contributions carefully.  When we come to Committee Stage we will go through the Bill section by section.  As has been suggested by a number of Deputies, including Deputy Durkan, we will take on board any amendment that is reasonable. We want to provide, as I am sure Deputies from all sides of the House would want, the best possible legislation to ensure that we have the highest standard available for our elderly people in nursing homes throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to pay a tribute to the officials in my own Department who worked so hard in the preparation of this legislation after it was decided on and agreed by Government.  I look forward to continuing constructive debate on Committee Stage.  Deputies will find the Government amenable to any worthwhile amendments.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1148" /> The Bill that I am introducing this evening, and for which I am seeking the support of the House, is a simple one.  It sets out to do two small but vital jobs, and in the process, to demonstrate that we are capable of learning the lessons of bitter experience.</P>
    <P>There are times in the life of every legislator when we have to face up to our own imperfections and inadequacies.  In my case, this is such a time.  I have been aware for some years of the gaps in our criminal justice system that are addressed by this Bill, and I have to say that it is a matter of regret to me that I have not addressed them before now.  We all of us go from day to day, pursuing our busy lives, attending to the problems that are creating the most pressure, and often ignoring issues that are nagging away at the backs of our minds.  The issues addressed by this Bill have been around for many years, but it has taken the experience of the Guildford Four to wake many of us up to those issues.  This Bill springs directly from that experience, and I hope that we are capable of learning the lessons that the case of the Guildford Four has taught us.</P>
    <P>It has been said before, and is worth saying again, that the release of the Guildford Four touched a chord in every Irish heart.  The conviction had been slow to take hold here, and yet had been growing for several years, that these people were innocent, that the confessions which had been wrung out of them under conditions of extreme duress and brutality were worthless.  It has emerged in the course of the dramatic events that have unfolded since their release that they were more than innocent.  These were not people convicted on the basis of confessions that were wrongfully procured &mdash; they were actually framed.</P>
    <P>Confessions and statements were altered to suit the perception of the police and the prosecuting authorities as to what was most incriminating; details were added to increase the damage; the statements of witnesses who could have helped to clear the Four were suppressed; their defence lawyers were hindered at <Col N="1149" /> every turn.  There was a considerable conspiracy to secure the convictions of the Guildford Four, and the result was that they emerged, fifteen years later, as the victims of the grossest act of misfeasance in British legal history.  There was misfeasance in law enforcement and in the administration of the law, on a scale that surpasses anything that has yet been discovered.</P>
    <P>Now the Guildford Four have to learn to live in the free world again.  They will be financially compensated for what has been done to them, of course, and hopefully there will be no cheeseparing in the allocation of that compensation.  But nothing can ever compensate them for the loss of a whole lifetime of growth and experience.</P>
    <P>The night the Birmingham bombs went off, I was travelling on a train from Holyhead to London.  The atmosphere when I arrived in London the following morning was indescribable, and unforgettable.  It was to some extent at least that sort of atmosphere that led to the imperative need, as the police saw it, for early convictions in the Birmingham and Guildford cases.  Convictions at any cost &mdash; even at the cost of fifteen years of life for four innocent people, and Six more who were convicted of the Birmingham bombs.</P>
    <P>My generation was young then, and the world was a good place to live in.  In the years since then, while the Guildford Four were in jail, almost in a state of suspended development, most of us got married and became parents; we watched our children grow and learn to walk and talk and go to school; we developed jobs and careers, and took a more active interest in the world around us.  All of us here went through a similar pattern of experience and development in that period.  We also experienced many of the humdrum and routine things that have made the quality of life more enjoyable and fulfilling.  We went to the movies or the theatre, we followed our favourite football teams &mdash; some of us have memories of great Kerry teams, others of our Triple Crown victories, still others of great athletic performances.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1150" /> All of these things, the things that add up to a body of enriching and maturing experience, were denied to the Guildford Four.  They must adjust now to a world that went about its business while they were left to vegetate in jail.  The fact that they did not vegetate, that they remain as articulate now as when they were first incarcerated, is a tribute to them and to the families and friends who supported them throughout their ordeal.  It is no tribute, however, to the British system of justice.</P>
    <P>Justice emerges from the aftermath of the Guildford Four battered, with faith in its impartiality weakened, perhaps fatally, and the rule of law undermined.  It will take many years, and a great deal of effort, on the part of the authorities and the police to restore the rule of law in Britain to its rightful place.  And there are many other implications of the case as well &mdash; implications for extradition from Ireland, for the administration of justice in the North of Ireland, for the cases of other individuals and groups, for our relations generally with the United Kingdom.  I propose to deal with all of those implications in the debate which will take place later this week, and I will not go into them here.</P>
    <P>Instead, I want to say this.  It would be arrogant, and indeed ignorant, for us to look at the case of the Guildford Four from this side of the Irish Sea, and profess great concern at the implications of the case for British justice alone.  There are implications for us too, lessons that must be learned, ways that we must put our own house in order.</P>
    <P>The Irish courts have, by and large, interpreted our Constitution to strengthen the rights of the accused but we are still a jurisdiction governed largely by the common law.  The defects in English law that made the convictions of the Guildford Four possible are equally evident in our own legal system.  We are debating tonight a Bill to remedy some of those defects.  Let all those Members of this House who have expressed legitimate worries about the implications of the Guildford Four case for the legal system across the water bear those worries in <Col N="1151" /> mind as this legislative provision is discussed and debated in this House.</P>
    <P>Let it not be forgotten that this entire matter emphasises that there are several respects in which English law is superior to our own in these regards.  For instance, we still maintain, in the Criminal Justice Act, 1964, the death penalty for certain crimes.  This provision must be repealed as a matter of urgency.  Many of us were gratified to hear the Minister for Justice undertake recently to bring a Bill forward to deal with this matter soon and it is my fervent wish and intention that this Dáil will see the end of the death penalty.  We will give any encouragement we can to the Minister.</P>
    <P>However, more to the immediate point, the English criminal justice system has what has now proven to be a crucial facility which does not exist in our law. There is in Ireland absolutely no mechanism, after the normal appeal process has run its course, for a criminal conviction to be reopened before a court for the purposes of re-examining the full factual basis for that conviction.  If we learn one lesson from this entire tragic episode, let it be the necessity for the immediate introduction of such a procedure. To this end section 3 of our Bill empowers the Minister for Justice to refer to the Court of Criminal Appeal any conviction on indictment, whether at the petition of the accused or on the Minister's own initiative, for the purpose of a full rehearing &mdash; both on fact and on law &mdash; of the basis of the conviction.</P>
    <P>After the statements that have been made, by members of all parties, in the House and outside it, regarding the Guildford Four case, I can conceive of no possible objection to this provision.  I believe the case for taking such a step is both unanswerable and long overdue.</P>
    <P>Our Bill also seeks to address an equally grave problem highlighted by the Guildford Four case.  This is the fact that in both England and Ireland accused persons may be convicted and sentenced upon the basis of no more than an alleged inculpatory statement or confession, made in police custody and witnessed by <Col N="1152" /> no one but police officers.  The voluntariness of such confessions may frequently be attested to only by the police; the very circumstances in which such confessions were made may be determined only by the evidence of police officers.</P>
    <P>The Guildford Four case provides urgent contemporary proof of the dangers inherent in a system which enables a person to be convicted on such a basis, without any other evidence linking the accused with the crime.  Yet every person who has been exposed for any length of time to the administration of justice in our criminal courts knows how often confessions allegedly made by an accused are introduced as evidence.</P>
    <P>Everyone familiar with our criminal courts knows how often the accused will deny the crime and reject his confession and everyone familiar with our system knows how often such confessions constitute the entirety of the State's case against accused persons.</P>
    <P>One English judge, delivering an opinion as long ago as 1893, expressed the matter well, when he said:</P>
    <P>It is remarkable that it is of very rare occurrence for evidence of a confession to be given when proof of the prisoner's guilt is otherwise clear and satisfactory; but, when it is not clear and satisfactory, the prisoner is not unfrequently alleged to have been seized with the desire born of penitence and remorse to supplement it with a confession &mdash; a desire which vanishes as soon as he appears in a court of justice.</P>
    <P>From the above statement, made not far short of one hundred years ago, it will be seen that the issue of the propriety of relying exclusively on confessions as evidence is not a new one.</P>
    <P>In seeking to establish a statutory provision requiring confessions made in police custody to be corroborated by independent evidence, I am not seeking to cast any aspersions whatever on the Garda as a force.  Far from it.  Indeed I am very conscious of the struggle that the Garda have had to wage against crime and terrorism in recent years, and of the difficulties they confront in bringing <Col N="1153" /> criminals of all kinds to justice.  I am conscious, too, of the debt we owe to the Garda Síochána, as a police force which have been successful in our service in the detection of crime and the conviction of criminals but I believe the measures I am proposing here are every bit as much in the interests of the Garda, and the perception of the Garda, as they are in the interests of the general public and accused persons.</P>
    <P>Leaving to one side the rare occasions when British and Irish police have been suspected of subjecting those in their custody to actual violence, the fact remains that many suspects find the very fact of being detained in police custody so intimidating and overwhelming that statements made in such conditions of confusion and disorientation are often unreliable.  This is of particular concern in the case of the young, the less privileged, the least educated members of society and those least integrated into it.</P>
    <P>In this connection, since this Bill was published, a colleague of mine has described to me an experience he had when he was considerably younger.  As a result of mistaken identity, he was taken into police custody and detained for six hours in a Garda station.  There he was questioned continuously by four gardaí in succession, in a bare, cold room, in the small hours of the morning.  He was well treated, in the sense that he was at no time threatened with, or subjected to violence, but it was made very clear to him that he was not believed, and he was continuously urged to come clean, to tell the truth about the matter under investigation. He has told me that the experience was unforgettable, that he was at times frightened, at times angry, and that, as the night wore on, he became more and more desperate to get out of the station, even to the extent that had the experience lasted much longer, he would have confessed to anything rather than remain there.</P>
    <P>Happily, the mistake that had been made at midnight was discovered by one of the gardaí as dawn was breaking.  My colleague was told that he was free to go, that there would be no charge brought <Col N="1154" /> against him and he was free to leave the police station.  Twenty years later he still vividly remembers that experience as being one of the most frightening of his life.  As I said at the outset, he was not ill treated in any way by any member of the Garda.</P>
    <P>Many lawyers could recount similar experiences &mdash; some with less fortunate and less happy endings than that.  These experiences are compounded for many who suffer them, as I said earlier, by the fact that they are young, or not well-educated, or are in some way on the margin of our society.  Yet the current law on arrest and detention for questioning is one which operates most unfairly against those who need its protection most.  For instance, while the courts have asserted that a person in detention has a right of reasonable access to a lawyer, there is absolutely no obligation on the Garda to inform him of this right.  This contrasts starkly with the position in the United States.  Similarly, while a person in police custody is generally under no obligation to incriminate himself, the police are under no constitutional obligation to inform him of this fact.  Again, this is in stark contrast to the position in the United States.</P>
    <P>The law here confers rights, but it operates most unfairly against those who do not know what are their rights.  One of the ironies of this is that hardened criminals are much more used to coping with police custody than innocent, young or poor people &mdash; and they are much less likely to make self-incriminating statements while in a Garda station than somebody young and disoriented.  For that reason alone, I would find it difficult to accept the argument that change along the lines we advocate would act to impede law enforcement.</P>
    <P>The point has also been made that this Bill would act against rigorous and fair enforcement of the law where somebody surrendered himself to the Garda and confessed to a crime.  There is no reason it should.  The Bill is aimed at outlawing uncorroborated confessions made by persons under the duress of police custody. We will be open to secure agreement <Col N="1155" /> to any and all amendments that would improve the legislation on Committee Stage and urge other parties in the House to work with us in that way.</P>
    <P>The major point about which we must satisfy ourselves is this: could a Guildford Four case ever occur in this jurisdiction? My answer to that question &mdash; and I believe this firmly &mdash; is yes, it could.  One does not have to look as far as England to see what can and has happened in similar circumstances, nor are all the examples to do with terrorists or political offences.  I should like to give the House two examples of what I mean.  I will begin by reading these couple of sentences:</P>
    <P>Ned, Mike, and I left our house at 3.50 a.m.... we drove through Tralee, on through Dingle town for about six miles and we stopped at a place where the road runs beside the sea, and Ned who was driving got out and opened the boot of the car and took out the bag containing the baby and threw it into the sea.  It was about 5.30 a.m. when Ned threw the bag into the sea. You could see the water from the road where we were parked and when the bag was thrown in, it sank and resurfaced and floated on the water.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Deputy would please give the reference to this quotation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to do that, a Cheann Comhairle.  It is to be found in Appendix K of the Tribunal of Inquiry into the Kerry Babies case.  It is what I consider to be a very dramatic passage taken from a statement made to the Garda by Kathleen Hayes, the sister of Joanne Hayes.  As can be seen, it is a colourful account of a dramatic and tragic journey, full of the detail of authenticity. It is Kathleen Hayes' own description of that journey.  Yet it is a description of a journey she never made, and a series of events that never took place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We will never know why that statement was made, or how it came to look as it did.  We know from the findings of the <Col N="1156" /> tribunal that Kathleen Hayes was in voluntary custody, in the eyes of the law, when she made that statement, and that she was not subjected to any assault or physical abuse by the Garda.  But there was at one stage a real possibility that that statement, obviously untrue, could have been used to incriminate her as an accessory in the murder of her sister's child.  That is just one example.</P>
    <P>The other example relates to a case that is not as well known as the Kerry Babies case, at least outside legal circles. The case in question is known as People (DPP) v. Lynch, and was heard on appeal by the Supreme Court, whose judgment was delivered in February 1981.  The accused in that case &mdash; one Christopher Lynch &mdash; was convicted of murder on the basis of his own confession.  That confession was extracted from him following 22 hours in police custody in circumstances that were both oppressive and intimidating.  There was no other evidence against him.  In that case, the Supreme Court found that the confession made by Lynch could not possibly have been true.  He confessed to strangling his victim with a piece of wire, when in fact she was strangled with a scarf.  He confessed to killing her at a time when she was seen alive and well.  There was no motive for the crime and no history of violence on the part of the accused.  Yet he had been convicted, on the basis of a confession which was obviously untrue and extracted in oppressive circumstances, and he spent several years in jail before the Supreme Court freed him.</P>
    <P>Therefore, we cannot fool ourselves into thinking that these things could never happen here.  The detention and questioning of suspects, in properly supervised conditions, must now be accepted as an integral part of our procedure in the investigation of serious crime.  That is why the Labour Party supported the Criminal Justice Act, 1984. The evidence produced as a result of such questioning is often an essential component of the State's case.  Yet, in many areas of the law, there is a requirement that equally essential items of evidence <Col N="1157" /> be corroborated.  For example, the law requires that juries be warned as to the extreme danger of convicting on the uncorroborated evidence of accomplices, or on uncorroborated evidence based solely on visual identification.</P>
    <P>The law does so in these circumstances because it recognises that such evidence may be unreliable and open to abuse. The Lynch and Hayes cases I quoted earlier show that confession evidence may be very unreliable.  The Guildford and Birmingham cases show that it can be open to abuse.  It is evidence which should not, without corroboration, furnish the basis for any criminal conviction, in a case where the accused subsequently rejects the truth of his confession and contests the charge he has to answer.</P>
    <P>In recent weeks many people have revelled in the image which has been out there of the English legal system being totally discredited.  I would prefer to do something practical, engage in something more than just self-congratulatory rhetoric, to forestall the likelihood of the tragic events of the last few weeks happening in this country.</P>
    <P>This Bill offers an opportunity to enable the Minister for Justice to refer cases to the Court of Criminal Appeal for re-examination in the circumstances I have outlined.  Had this facility existed in England the injustice suffered by the Guildford Four might have been discovered. We offer the opportunity to prevent the conviction of an accused on the basis of a contested and uncorroborated confession.  If this rule existed in England, as it does at present in Scotland, more than likely these injustices would never have occurred.  I would like to think that this House will take the opportunities being presented to it to ensure that, in the Irish jurisdiction, convictions which stood for 15 years &mdash; which now as we all know should never have been obtained in the first place &mdash; can never be obtained in our society.</P>
    <P>The English, Northern Irish and Irish legal systems have a common origin and share many common principles.  We have all struggled at various times in our process of law reform to strike a balance <Col N="1158" /> between upholding the rights of individuals before the courts and in our police stations, and on the other side, empowering the police to investigate serious crime effectively and efficiently.  It would be fair to say that in each of the legal systems there have been <i>causes célèbres</i> and it has been seen that all of the legal systems produce serious miscarriages of justice. The Bill which we are presenting to the House goes some way to establishing additional safeguards to protect innocent people.  While we are doing this perhaps it would be reasonable to suggest that the whole area of criminal investigation, procedure and evidence, requires urgent and thorough consideration in each of our jurisdictions.  Needless to say we can only do something about that which persists in our jurisdiction.  In the last number of months &mdash; not to mention over the years &mdash; we have not been slow, given the difficulties we have seen across the water, to stand up and criticise that system which pertains in the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>It will be of enormous importance to the Members of this House and the Irish legal system if we take steps and make an effort, collectively and in our best collective wisdom, to bring about the changes which I am suggesting and which we have suggested in relation to the Guildford Four case.  As I have said we have not been slow to point the finger across the water and tell our counterparts over there to put their house in order.  I believe very firmly that it would be of interest and immense importance to us, to the Irish Government and the various Ministers negotiating and dealing with our counterparts across the water, to be able to point out that, because of the fears which have arisen here in relation to our criminal legal system and the rules of evidence, we have done something concrete to ensure that there is no miscarriage of justice here &mdash; that is a very light expression considering that people have been jailed wrongly for 15 years.  If the Government support and accept this Bill I suggest to the Minister that it would be of benefit to the Irish negotiators and the Irish Government in seeking and <Col N="1159" /> pressing &mdash; which all of us on this side of the House have been doing &mdash; for changes in the administration of justice in Northern Ireland and changes in relation to the trials which have taken place in the United Kingdom over the last number of years.</P>
    <P>That is why in addition to introducing the Criminal Justice Bill, 1989, I also call on the Taoiseach to propose the establishment of a joint law reform commission to report on these matters under the auspices of the Anglo-Irish Conference. Such a joint commission was established in the past pursuant to the Sunningdale agreement.  In fact the enactment of the commission's recommendations was the only successful outcome of that agreement.  We on both islands have lessons to learn from the revelations of the past few weeks.  It is essential for the continuation of security co-operation between Britain and Ireland that we have confidence in each other's procedures and laws.  The principles underlying our laws should be jointly investigated and proposals for reform should be jointly established and enacted.</P>
    <P>I commend this Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>I fully agree with Deputy Spring that we must not be complacent about our criminal justice system.  No system is perfect and I accept that.  There is always a need for an ongoing review of procedures.  The Guildford Four case has indeed shown that the English system of justice which is intended, like our own, to have the necessary checks and balances to prevent a miscarriage of justice such as has now been shown to have happened in that case can be found sadly wanting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1160" /> I also agree that there is sufficient similarity between our criminal justice system and that in England to justify our looking at our own procedures in the light of the lessons to be learned from the Guildford Four case to see whether we need to make changes or improvements.  Indeed, I would like to make it clear that this is something I already viewed as necessary even before the Deputy introduced his Bill.</P>
    <P>I have no argument with Deputy Spring in this regard.  However, where I do differ with him is in how we should proceed with this review.  The Deputy's approach is to introduce this Bill as a hurried reaction to what he perceives to be defects without taking time to examine and consider the complex issues that first need to be addressed.</P>
    <P>Certainly, he identifies issues which should be looked at and considered and I am quite agreeable to doing that.  Where the Deputy has gone wrong, I believe, is in firstly concluding without sufficient examination that the issues raised in his Bill do, in fact, constitute serious flaws in our system and then, on that assumption, in suggesting that the solution is to copy English and Scottish law.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Guildford case, Deputy Spring says that &ldquo;if a similar injustice were to occur in Ireland, there would be no way in which the case could be reopened by a court&rdquo;.  While that statement may be correct so far as it goes, if it is intended to imply that there is no way in which a similar injustice here could be remedied, then it is clearly wrong.  If a Guildford-type case were to occur here, and by this I mean a case in which it became clear that the investigating authority had given false evidence and suppressed alibi evidence so that the original conviction was clearly unsafe, it would be open to the Government to advise the President to grant a pardon under Article 13 of the Constitution.  We should not overlook that important safeguard.</P>
    <P>Nonetheless, I can accept that our law is probably deficient in not providing a method by which a case can be referred back to the Court of Criminal Appeal or <Col N="1161" /> be otherwise reviewed in certain circumstances, for example, where significant new evidence has come to light, and I would be favourably disposed towards some such change when I have had an opportunity of considering exactly what should be done.  The question is whether such a change would, of itself, solve the sort of case we are talking about.</P>
    <P>What the Deputy proposes is that we simply copy section 17 of the English Criminal Appeal Act, 1968, which empowers the British Home Secretary to refer a case back to the Court of Appeal at any time if he thinks fit.  Yet this very power existed in English law all the time that the Guildford Four, the Birmingham Six and the Maguires have been in prison. Certainly, the Guildford Four were eventually released by the Court of Appeal on a reference by the Home Secretary under that provision.  However, given the evidence that had been turned up in the investigation by the Avon and Somerset police the Four would surely have had to be released whether the power in section 17 existed or not.</P>
    <P>Contrast this to the case of the Birmingham Six.  The Home Secretary used the power given to him in section 17 to refer their case back to the Court of Appeal but that did not result in the outcome which we would all like to have seen.  It seems to me that if we contrast these two cases what emerges as being of most significance in determining their different outcomes was the thorough reinvestigation of the police evidence which was undertaken in the case of the Guildford Four.  Let me say here I greatly hope that the ambit of the investigation which is currently being conducted into the operations of the West-Midlands serious crime squad will be extended to include the period when the Birmingham Six were arrested and questioned.</P>
    <P>What seems clear to me from these cases is that a power similar to that contained in section 17 of the British Criminal Appeal Act might not of itself necessarily provide a guaranteed remedy in a case where a miscarriage of justice <Col N="1162" /> is alleged and this needs some further thought.</P>
    <P>This is a point which seems to be recognised in Britain.  As I understand it, there is now, in the context of the Guildford Four and other cases, a considerable body of opinion among eminent persons in Britain that section 17 of their 1968 Criminal Appeal Act is inadequate and that it needs to be replaced by something better.  It has been reported that the judicial inquiry into the conviction of the Guildford Four being undertaken by Sir John May will, <i>inter alia,</i> examine this issue.  For us now to simply adopt an English provision which many there feel has been found lacking in regard to the type of case we are now talking about and which is under scrutiny with a view to possible change is not, in my opinion, the proper way to proceed.</P>
    <P>Rather than simply copy the English legislation, I believe what we need to do is to take time to examine this matter carefully in the context of the conditions which apply in our own jurisdiction.  If we decide that there is a need to have a procedure whereby cases which have exhausted all the normal appeals procedures can be reopened, then we should look at the various alternative ways in which we might provide for this and choose a procedure best suited to our needs.  For example, our Constitution is very precise in damarcating the powers which are appropriate to the Executive and those which are appropriate to the Judiciary and it could be that a procedure which would see the Minister for Justice reviewing evidence in a case with a view to deciding whether it should or should not be put before a court would create problems.</P>
    <P>The nature of criminal justice inevitably involves a dilemma as to how errors should be corrected.  Granted that a proper system of trials and appeals has been arrived at, the question as to how to provide for what should be the exceptional case where the system has perhaps failed to work properly in the sense that an innocent person may be in prison.</P>
    <P>It seems indisputable that the Executive must be involved in such a case and <Col N="1163" /> that it must always have a reserve power to relieve the innocent person of the result of the failure of the judicial system. Beyond this the question arises of how best to look into the matter of a possible injustice.  Should the whole case be investigated by, say, an authoritative person such as a judge or distinguished public servant, in either case in office or retired, who would look at all the papers, take statements and so on, and not be bound by the rules of evidence and so on?  Or should the appellate court be asked to rehear the appeal, being bound, or not bound, by the rules of evidence?  On one view an exhaustive and lengthy inquiry by an outside authority might seem the ideal way of securing the right.  On the other hand, this process might go on for ever and it could be inconsistent with the principle of the judicial function to have an Executive inquiry into the convictions judicially imposed.  These are the kind of problems that have to be faced, in considering the issue raised in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Certainly ancillary or related questions would also have to be considered.  These include the question whether the present provisions as to the powers of the Court of Criminal Appeal in deciding whether to allow or dismiss an appeal are satisfactory or should be altered; whether the existing rule that a person who appeals from the Central Criminal Court to the Court of Criminal Appeal thereby loses his right of appeal directly to the Supreme Court should be altered, and questions as to the applicability of any new provisions to appeals to the Courts-Martial Appeal Court and appeals from the Special Criminal Court to the Court of Criminal Appeal.</P>
    <P>With regard to the section as it is drafted, it would be very much open to challenge because it gives the Minister power to refer a case to the Court of Criminal Appeal, to be treated as if it was an appeal by the convicted person, even where the trial judge had refused the accused person a certificate that the case was a fit case for appeal and/or where the Court of Criminal Appeal itself had refused leave to appeal.  If the Minister <Col N="1164" /> was given the power as proposed in the Bill, without any criteria and at any time, it would be a power to overrule the decision of the trial judge and the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal, pursuant to section 31 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1924, refusing leave to appeal.  Under section 32 of that Act leave to appeal must be granted where the court is of the opinion that a question of law is involved, or where the trial appears to the court to have been unsatisfactory, or there appears to the court to be any other sufficient ground of appeal.  A decision by the Court of Criminal Appeal to refuse leave to appeal necessarily involves a negative ruling of the court on all these matters.  An unfettered power of reference by the Minister &ldquo;at any time&rdquo; would mean that the Minister could overrule such a judgment and this would probably be found unconstitutional.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, if the Minister for Justice were to be involved in referring cases to the Court of Criminal Appeal there would be a need to consider very carefully whether there should be some consultative process to assist the Minister in performing a function which would involve consideration of complex legal issues in many cases.</P>
    <P>I turn now to section 2 of the Deputy's Bill which proposes to introduce into our law a rule of evidence which operates in Scotland, that a person cannot be found guilty of a criminal offence solely on the basis of a confession of guilt made by him to the police.  While cases may arise from time to time the circumstances of which may give rise to legitimate concern about specific convictions on uncorroborated confessions, I think it will be generally accepted that there are undoubtedly cases in which convictions can properly be based on such evidence.  I would be opposed, therefore, to a statutory provision that would totally exclude the possibility of such convictions which is, in effect what is proposed in Deputy Spring's Bill.</P>
    <P>As I will point out later, there is a better way of dealing with this problem, which is to strengthen the safeguards <Col N="1165" /> against the possibility of improper confessions being obtained.  To prohibit by law the possibility of any confession, no matter that there may be no ground whatever to doubt its veracity and that it was given voluntarily, from being used to secure a conviction would be wrong. Think of the position of a victim of a crime where the perpetrator has confessed but no prosecution can be taken.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the Deputy is making his proposal from a genuine concern to minimise the risk of persons being convicted of a criminal offence on the basis of confessions which may not have been made by them on a free and voluntary basis.  I can hardly argue with this as our objective.  However, the problem is again, as with what is proposed in section 3 of the Bill, that the Deputy has adopted what appears to be a solution to a problem he perceives without sufficiently investigating the matter.</P>
    <P>He asks us to accept a rule of Scottish law as a precedent.  My understanding is that the rule about corroboration in Scottish law is interpreted very liberally by the courts there and that in practice they accept very slight evidence in corroboration of a confession made to the police.</P>
    <P>Indeed, the Scottish system is not without its critics even in Scotland.  In the case of <i>Sinclair v. Clarke</i> Lord Justice Clerk Thompson described the rule requiring corroboration of admissions to the police as &ldquo;somewhat archaic&rdquo; and he also stated that the merit of the rule in modern conditions is &ldquo;not always obvious&rdquo;.  In addition, the view was expressed recently in a report published by the British section of the International Commission of Jurists that the degree of corroboration required under Scottish law is so slight as not to constitute the safeguard to be expected.</P>
    <P>I think it is clear that if the Scottish rule had existed in England it would not have prevented the conviction of the Guildford Four.  The convictions in that case sprang from the fact that the police were prepared to give false evidence relating to the confessions and to suppress alibi evidence.  It is not unrealistic <Col N="1166" /> to suggest that if those police were faced with the Scottish rule, it would have been within their capacity to produce false evidence sufficient to supply the corroboration required by that rule.</P>
    <P>Inculpatory admissions including confessions of guilt are very significant in terms of securing convictions.  Any change therefore in terms of their admissibility or evidential value in criminal trials could have a very serious impact on the proportion of offences for which successful prosecutions could be taken. We need to be very careful therefore before contemplating a change as radical as that proposed in the Deputy's Bill.</P>
    <P>I accept that there are, of course, dangers with confession evidence and this has long been recognised.  As I already indicated I believe that the proper approach is to provide the conditions in which the possibility of confessions being improperly obtained or falsified by the Garda is very remote.  The Judges' Rules, which impose strict conditions within which police questioning can take place, were long ago formulated for this purpose. Furthermore our courts, in addition to ensuring that the requirements of the Judges' Rules are complied with, exercise a power to exclude evidence, including confessions, where the court is satisfied that the admission of such evidence would not satisfy the right of an accused to a fair trial which is enshrined in our Constitution.  This power has been in issue in a number of important cases and was discussed by Chief Justice O'Higgins in <i>DPP v. Lynch (1981).</i></P>
    <P>Indeed, Deputy Spring quoted earlier from the same case in support of his argument, which I will now use in reverse:</P>
    <P>Where there exists a written constitution which guarantees rights to citizens, prohibits acts and conduct then quiet different considerations must apply.  In countries governed by a written consititution one may expect that judges by their Oath and Office to be bound to uphold the constitution and it's provisions and to do so on all occcasions in courts in which they preside.</P>
    <P>The Rules of Evidence in Irish <Col N="1167" /> Courts are mainly exclusionary in nature, thus items which are or may be relevant to the issue being tried can be excluded under special rules.  The trial judge always retains the power to exclude evidence including statements which would be legally admissible, if such exclusion has as its object the securing of a fair trial for the accused.</P>
    <P>The &ldquo;Treatment Regulations&rdquo; made under the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, represent further very exacting standards as to how persons detained in custody in Garda stations are to be treated and as to the manner in which they can be questioned. These regulations incorporate the recommendations which were made by the O'Briain committee which was established in 1977 in response to concerns which were expressed at the time about the treatment of suspects in Garda custody. Deputy Spring was incorrect when he said that the Garda do not have to inform a suspect that he is entitled to consult a solicitor.  Regulation 8 (1) (b) of the Criminal Justice (Treatment of Persons in Custody of Garda Stations) Regulations, 1987, provide that the Garda must so inform him.</P>
    <P>There is, therefore, already in place a considerable number of safeguards to ensure that confessions made in Garda custody are both voluntary and authentic. As I have pointed out, the courts are extremely vigilant when dealing with the question of admitting evidence of confessions. Such evidence is inadmissible in law unless the judge is satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the confession was made voluntarily.</P>
    <P>In contemplation of providing a further safeguard provision was made in the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, empowering the Minister for Justice to make regulations for the audio and/or visual tape recording of Garda questioning of suspects. Subsequently, a small expert committee was established to examine the way in which tape recording could be introduced.  Much preliminary work has <Col N="1168" /> been done and the question of establishing pilot schemes for practical testing is under consideration.</P>
    <P>A further suggestion which has been made to provide an additional safeguard for an accused is that there should be a legal requirement for a judge to warn a jury of the danger of convicting an accused solely on the basis of an uncorroborated confession.  Such a warning would be similar to the one which is given and which was referred to by Deputy Spring where the prosecution is asking a jury to convict a person on the uncorroborated evidence of the victim of a sexual offence or where identification evidence is involved.</P>
    <P>On the face of it, Deputy Spring's proposal seems attractive.  However, I would like to have it further examined as it may well be open to question whether making such a change in our law is needed at all in view of the meticulous way in which evidence is considered by a trial judge before it is admitted and given that juries will in any event be more than conscious of the significance of confession evidence where it is disputed.</P>
    <P>To summarise the position then, what is wrong with Deputy Spring's Bill is that it is precipitate.  It seeks to address what are complex issues by adapting provisions from other jurisdictions which, as events now show, may be less than adequate or appropriate.</P>
    <P>As I said at the beginning of my remarks, if there are lessons we can learn from the Guildford Four case, I am as anxious that they be learned as the Deputy.  However, I am equally concerned that any changes we might make would be sensible and workable.</P>
    <P>With this in mind I have, on behalf of the Government, invited His Honour, Judge Frank Martin, to chair a committee of experts which I intend to establish immediately to carry out an examination, as a matter of urgency, of the issues raised by the Guildford Four case and referred to in the Deputy's Bill in the context of our criminal procedure as a whole.</P>
    <P>Judge Martin, who has willingly accepted the Government's invitation to chair this committee, sits in the Dublin <Col N="1169" /> Circuit Criminal Court and has long and wide experience of dealing with criminal trials.  This experience will undoubtedly be invaluable in considering the issues which will be before the committee.</P>
    <P>The amendment put forward by Fine Gael proposes to refer this matter to the Law Reform Commission.  In fact their amendment indicates that Fine Gael share my concern that these matters would be thoroughly examined before any action is taken.  However, the Law Reform Commission have a very full programme of urgent work on hand and a more speedy examination can be arrived at by adopting my proposal to refer the case to an expert committee.  I believe this is an urgent matter which needs very special attention.  When Judge Martin's examination is complete, I will take whatever measures, legislative or procedural, which are considered necessary.  In the meantime, I would ask Deputy Spring to withdraw his Bill for the reasons I have put forward.  If the Deputy is unwilling to do this, I must formally oppose the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I can well appreciate Deputy Spring's concern about this matter.  Unquestionably, the Guildford Four case, which has rocked the British criminal justice system to its very foundations, has lessons for every judicial system in the civilised world.  There are lessons not only for the system of justice in Great Britain but in Ireland and throughout the civilised world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder if Deputy Spring, when comparing cases such as the Guildford Four with criminal law in the Republic of Ireland, is comparing like with like?  It has to be remembered that in many of the cases &mdash; I have no doubt that there was injustices in British courts not just in recent years but in recent decades &mdash; a certain hysteria was evident which was built up either by the media or otherwise. This, of course, had an overpowering influence on the outcome of many of the <Col N="1170" /> cases to which Deputy Spring referred. That is not to say that our system of justice should not at all times be subject to review by all right thinking people and that we should not do everything possible to ensure that such a calamity would not occur in an Irish courtroom.  Of course, such a calamity in certain exceptional circumstances could occur in this country because in an imperfect world no system of justice can guarantee justice in every case.  There are exceptions to every rule and the objective must be to minimise the possibility of these exceptions occurring and an injustice being done.</P>
    <P>In general terms the criminal law as it applies in this country has served the country relatively well.  It is fair to say that the judges' rules relating to voluntary confessions, the trial within a trial, are safeguards which have assisted greatly in ensuring that in general justice was not only done but was seen to be done. However, it is true that the most dangerous evidence, if uncorroborated, before a court is without question a voluntary confession which is contested by the accused.  A voluntary confession contested by the accused means that the State is saying the confession was voluntary and the individual is stating that the confession was involuntary.  One then has to establish that the confession was involuntary.</P>
    <P>Deputy Spring has given the example from the Kerry Babies case where unquestionably, undoubtedly and irrefutably the confession, whatever about the situation surrounding it, was patently untrue and was subsequently proven to be so.  That raises certain questions in relation to the system at large.  However, there is irrefutable evidence to suggest that in the vast majority of confessions given by suspects in criminal cases in Ireland they can be taken at their face value.  That is not to say that there have not been confessions which unquestionably have been involuntary and have been proven in Irish criminal courts to be so.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1171" /> I suppose the truth of the matter is that if people want to tell lies about a suspect it is difficult to prevent them from doing so.  Nobody knows why anybody would do such a thing but the truth is that in a minimal number of cases it does happen. I for one do not believe that corroboration based on the Scottish model would solve that problem because tragically corroboration too can be falsified and utilised in the same way as an involuntary confession which is presented to a court as a voluntary confession.  In short, it is true that the most dangerous evidence upon which a jury can convict is a voluntary confession where the accused subsequently states that the confession was involuntary.  Therefore, I welcome the statement by the Minister this evening that he is to set up a committee of experts to examine this entire position. In this regard I am delighted that Deputy Spring raised the matter because it is certainly an area that is well worth looking at in the minimal number of exceptional cases where an injustice does occur.</P>
    <P>If we were to copy section 17 of the English Criminal Appeal Act, 1968, it is possible we would not be doing the right thing at this time.  It has to be remembered that the power of referral for the English Home Secretary was also in existence while the Guildford Four, the Birmingham Six and the Maguires were, and indeed in the latter case are, in prison.  It must be remembered also that in one of these cases the power of referral failed to release men who, in my view, are clearly innocent.  The Minister has pinpointed the difference between these two cases in a very graphic way.  He has pointed out that a thorough reinvestigation of the police evidence was undertaken in the case of the Guildford Four.  Such an investigation was not carried out in the case of the Birmingham Six.  I welcome the Minister's extremely important call here tonight to have included in the investigation of the West Midlands <Col N="1172" /> serious crime squad the case of the Birmingham Six.  Such an investigation would reveal beyond doubt that these men are innocent.  Section 17 of the Criminal Appeal Act, 1968, is, to a large extent, inadequate.  Its adoption by this House would ultimately lead to the Minister for Justice of this country being accused of political interference.  That would be the worst possible thing that could happen to the judicial system &mdash; if there was a feeling that the Executive was interfering with the judicial arm of the State.</P>
    <P>The right way forward is to re-examine the position, as the Minister has proposed, very closely to ensure that what occurred in the Guildford Four case, and indeed in other cases in Great Britain, would never occur here and that, if such a thing did happen, the power would be there for justice to be done and to be seen to be done.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann declines to give the Bill a Second Reading until a report on&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the necessity for corroborative evidence,</P>
      <P>(b)  the proposed power of the Minister for Justice to refer cases to the Court of Criminal Appeal, and</P>
      <P>(c)  other related issues,</P>
      <P>shall have been made by the Law Reform Commission and its recommendations considered by Dáil Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I deal with these issues I would say that the Minister's response to my amendment by way of appointment of a committee of experts under Judge Martin to examine the issues is reasonable, considering that the work load of the Law Reform Commission is so heavy that we cannot get a report as a matter of priority, which I believe is needed in this case.  I <Col N="1173" /> have the highest regard for Judge Martin and, as my amendment indicates, what I am really anxious to see is that these complex issues would be researched and examined as a matter of priority.  Perhaps I should mention one small matter that concerns me in relation to the Minister's response to my amendment.  He said that when Judge Martin's examination is complete he will take whatever measures, legislative or procedural, are considered necessary.  Any such conclusions should be debated in this House.  I hope the Minister will confirm that this will be the case.  In my amendment circulated earlier I propose that Dáil Éireann should decline to give the Bill a Second Reading until such time as a report is available with recommendations and these recommendations have been considered by the House.  In fact, there is a slight alteration to my reasoned amendment but it would provide a procedural route for such an examination.  I mention this at this stage so that the mover of the Bill, Deputy Spring, and other Members of the House would have time to consider it.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party Bill raises issues which are of deep public concern.  The trial of the Guildford Four has cast a pall over the credibility and integrity of sections of the British police and criminal justice system.  Deputy Spring very movingly explained the background and indicated very fully his concern about what happened to the Guildford Four.  The best I can say on that score is that his concern is shared by myself and by most, if not all, Members of this House.</P>
    <P>The investigation into the West Midlands police force, which was referred to by the Minister, raises further important questions both for the present and future of the system of justice in Britain but in dealing with these issues and their application to the Irish criminal justice system we must be careful not to create unsatisfactory Irish solutions to English legal problems.  What is at stake in relation to the main proposal in the Bill requiring corroboration of statements <Col N="1174" /> made in the custody of a member of the Garda Síochána is our belief in the integrity and honesty of the Garda Síochána, nothing more or less.</P>
    <P>The implication which arises, which must be faced, is that this proposal is designed to deal with an alleged or perceived failure of integrity.  If this is so, the proposals as they stand do not afford the type of protection that Deputy Spring suggests.  To put it simply, and if I recall correctly the Minister touched on this, if the Labour Party believe there is a possibility that members of the Garda Síochána might invent or manufacture an inculpatory statement, then it is a very short step from that to inventing or manufacturing corroborative evidence, whether trivial or substantive.  The proposals do not even begin to deal with this perceived problem, if it exists.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I believe very strongly that it is proper that we examine the system here so that the necessary changes can be made and so that as far as possible they provide a proper basis under the rule of law leading to the conviction of the guilty and the acquittal of the innocent.  The points raised by Deputy Spring are very appropriate.  He touched on the need for an examination of the system in the UK, following the appalling miscarriage of justice which occurred in the Guildford Four case.  Certainly we, who quite rightly raise our voices on the need for such a review and necessary changes in the UK, obviously have to look at our own system here, if only for the reason that our system and the UK system are very largely rooted in the same common law system of jurisprudence. Therefore, it is proper to examine our system here.</P>
    <P>The issues, including satisfactory safeguards in relation to the making of statements, must be looked at in a much broader context, not just in the context of the proposal contained in section 2 of Deputy Spring's Bill.  It has been mentioned on radio and television discussions and here in this House that a requirement <Col N="1175" /> of corroboration for confessions or inculpatory statements exists in Scotland. However, we should be aware that this has not of itself been sufficient to prevent allegations of miscarriages of justice in that jurisdiction being made.</P>
    <P>I am indebted to the <i>Irish Independent</i> for carrying out some research in this regard.  Recently they quoted a number of cases in an article which appeared in the edition of 16 November under the headline &ldquo;Crimes Against the Innocent&rdquo;. This investigation turned up four cases in the UK but what is significant in the context of the suggestion that we should willy-nilly follow the Scottish system is that two of those four cases were Scottish. Patrick Meehan was charged with murder in Ayr and jailed for life in October 1969. Subsequently, he was released and granted a Royal Pardon in 1976.  Ernest Barrie was charged in connection with an armed raid at Blantyre.  He was convicted in 1986 and sentenced to 18 years in jail. In March of this year he won his appeal, having earlier been released on bail prior to the appeal.  That followed an investigation documented in the &ldquo;Rough Justice&rdquo; television programme on the BBC.</P>
    <P>I mention these cases merely to illustrate that the necessity for corroboration will not of itself prevent miscarriages of justice.  Of course I accept that the Scottish system and those being operated in other countries which have like Ireland a common law system of jurisprudence should be researched and examined.  It was for that reason that I circulated the amendment on behalf of Fine Gael proposing that the issues raised in the Labour Party Bill and related issues be researched and examined by the Law Reform Commission and its recommendations be considered before we reach a definitive conclusion on Deputy Spring's proposals.</P>
    <P>In making my proposal I was mindful of the following: first, in both the Guildford and Birmingham cases serious questions <Col N="1176" /> arose as to the manner in which statements were taken and confessions made. Should the emphasis, therefore, not be on ensuring that any such statements or confessions be entirely voluntary rather than having an absolute requirement of corroboration?  Second, in April 1978 the Ó Briain report which recommended certain safeguards for persons in custody and protection for members of the Garda Síochána against unjustified allegations of ill-treatment, was presented to the Government.  Certain of its recommendations were provided for in the Criminal Justice Act, 1984.  Is it now appropriate in this context to have a review of these provisions and the 1987 regulations made thereunder and to have a fresh look at those recommendations which have not so far been implemented? Third, sections 18 and 19 of the 1984 Act provided for inferences to be drawn from the failure of the accused to account for certain matters.  How is this worked?  My understanding is that the sections in question have not been relied on at all in criminal law cases.  Why is this so?  If things work why change them but if they are not working at least we should examine why they are not working with a view to changing them.</P>
    <P>Section 27 of the same Act provides for electronic recording of questioning. In the UK a pilot project is under way providing for recording and video taping of interviews and interrogations.  As long ago as 1978 the Ó Briain Committee suggested that a feasibility study be instituted to establish whether video taping of interrogations in the investigation of serious crime was a viable proposition. In hindsight I would say that was a very far seeing proposal.  In addition, the report suggested that tape recording should be tried on as wide a basis as possible.  Is this the route we should follow?  I will not raise any query with regard to Minister Burke's committee of experts.  I have too much respect for Judge Martin to do that, but the Minister <Col N="1177" /> said that an expert committee was established to examine the ways in which tape recording could be introduced.  I inquired in the Oireachtas Library for a copy of the regulations which were to be made under section 27 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984 in relation to the electronic recording of interviews and was advised that they had not yet been made.  Five years later I raise the issue as to whether priority should not be given to these.</P>
    <P>There are various commissions and reports in other countries having a similar common law jurisprudence which have dealt with these issues.  It was Judge Barra Ó Briain himself who referred to the Committee on Criminal Procedure in Scotland and to the Commonwealth Law Reform Commission in Australia.  Should not these and other systems be studied with a view to learning and taking advantage of experience in these countries? It is interesting that one of our leading criminal lawyers, Paddy McEntee, in proposals published by him focused on the desirability of video taping of interviews in respect of serious crimes rather than on the need for corroboration.  He also raised other matters which should be considered in the review I proposed.</P>
    <P>If the requirement of corroboration is considered to be the desired route to prevent miscarriages of justice a number of other issues arise.  The Labour Party Bill proposes that inculpatory statements be &ldquo;corroborated by some other material evidence&rdquo;.  In Scotland any shred of evidence is sufficient.  In fact, the Scottish system has been described, by one whose opinion I greatly respect, as a bit of a fraud.  Obviously the question of the weight of the corroboration required is a material factor in the approach proposed if the Bill is adopted.</P>
    <P>The question of the Judges' Rules under which the questioning of suspected persons is conducted may also need to be reviewed.  The first set of rules was drawn up in 1912.  They were revised in 1918 and have applied here since.  After a spell of 70 years is an up-to-date review not <Col N="1178" /> indicated in the context of the issues raised by the Labour Party?</P>
    <P>Another issue for examination in this context concerns a judge's charge to a jury.  In sexual cases the judge is required to say that it is dangerous to convict without corroboration.  This also arises in the question of accomplices and of visual evidence but what we must consider is that perhaps the right approach is that there should be an extension of this procedure to other cases.  I raise this as a question.</P>
    <P>In passing I should mention that in the context of having a certain degree of uniformity in our approach to reform of the criminal legal code, the Criminal Law (Rape) (Amendment) Bill presently before the House actually proposes that such a warning should not be mandatory but should be left to the discretion of the judge trying the case.</P>
    <P>We should also consider the statement in the Ó Briain report that 80 per cent of serious crime in respect of which convictions are obtained are solved by confessions. This indicates a high degree of reliance on self-incrimination and according to that report an &ldquo;inability of reluctance to secure evidence by scientific methods of criminal investigation and by persevering police inquiries&rdquo;.  Members of the Garda Síochána had told me that apart altogether from the statutory requirement, good policing requires an effort to find corroboration.  However, accept that difficulties can arise in many cases in securing such corroboration.  The point therefore has to be squarely faced that we may have in cases of serious crime no charges brought even where there are complete confessions of guilt.  That would be the inevitable result if we take the proposal as it stands.</P>
    <P>It should also be mentioned that there is little point in changing our systems and putting procedural safeguards in place unless they are allowed to operate properly. I have to mention in this regard the related subject of the Garda Síochána Complaints Board which cannot operate effectively now in relation to current <Col N="1179" /> complaints because they have not been provided with proper staffing.  What we are talking about is a few senior people with supervisory skills.  The problem does not relate to money.  I am told that out of the allocation this year at least 25 per cent will be refunded to the Exchequer. The Estimates for 1990 provide for an even bigger allocation but that is no use whatever unless they are in a position to spend that money in a way in which they need to by taking on the two or three supervisory staff that are required.</P>
    <P>In relation to the other change proposed by Deputy Spring that the Minister for Justice should have power to refer cases if he thinks fit at any time to the Court of Criminal Appeal, I favour in principle the giving of such power. However, there are a number of factors to be taken into account before giving legislative effect to such provision.  Our political culture is such that any such power would need to be, and be seen to be, exercised totally free of allegations of political pressure.  This gives rise to the question of whether there should be a commission or body to sift any evidence suggesting a miscarriage of justice and then making a recommendation to the Minister.</P>
    <P>If we had, for instance, a Gubu type Minister for Justice, would there be a danger that cases would be referred on the basis of other than substantive allegations of miscarriage of justice?  There is no need for me to develop that point any further.</P>
    <P>In this regard also I should mention the McEntee proposal on an advisory body to deal with appeals for clemency.  Perhaps this proposal should also be considered in this context.</P>
    <P>Another issue that arises on this score, and indeed a very serious one, is whether there should be a compensation provision in the event of a miscarriage of justice being proved.  It seems to me to be obvious that there should be such a provision <Col N="1180" /> in the event of a proven case of miscarriage of justice resulting in the deprivation of a person's liberty.  That leads me on to the question of looking at the systems for such compensation that apply in other jurisdictions.  We are all aware that there is such a system in the UK.  I am not sure about the systems that would apply elsewhere but we should certainly look at such systems to see the best basis for establishing such an arrangement here.  The Bill is fundamentally flawed in regard to miscarriages of justice unless we provide for compensation, and that is an issue which has to be teased out fully; it has to be examined and researched and precedents available in the UK and elsewhere looked at so that we can move in that direction and establish a system which is appropriate to our situation and our surroundings.</P>

      <P>Deputy Austin Deasy gave me notice of his intention to raise on the Adjournment the subject matter of the legalisation of monofilament nets for salmon.  Deputy Deasy has ten minutes to present his case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>The use of monofilament nets by fishermen has been a contentious issue over the past ten or 15 years.  It is illegal to use monofilament nets for salmon fishing but quite legal to use them for other types of fishing, such as gill netting.  I want to see the use of this type of net legalised to allow it to be used by salmon fishermen whether they are drift net fishermen or snap net fishermen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We often hear about the social problems in city areas such as Dublin, in the inner city, the suburbs or other major urban areas in the country.  We also hear about the social problems of rural dwellers, particularly small farmers in the west, but very seldom, if ever, do we <Col N="1181" /> hear about the plight of the in-shore fisherman, the fisherman using a small boat.  There are thousands of fishermen in this country who depend primarily on catching salmon during the season which lasts approximately from March to late July or early August.</P>
    <P>Over the past 20 years drift netting for salmon at sea has become very big business and, by and large, it is illegal. The legal length of net is 800 yards with a depth of 30 meshes but trawlers and large boats using as much as two, three or four miles of nets have been fishing consistently off the west coast and, in doing so, they have taken massive catches of salmon and have done tremendous damage not just around our coast but in the North Atlantic generally.  They have been aided and abetted in that by fishermen in Greenland and probably around the Faroe Islands also who have been doing it for a long number of years.  The big boats are taking a tremendous amount of salmon and the small in-shore fisherman is getting a very meagre living.</P>
    <P>To compound that difficulty which the in-shore fisherman has been having, he is not allowed to use a net which could enable him to catch a reasonable amount of fish.  It is not possible in this day and age to make a living using the legal length 800 yards of nylon net.  I am advocating here this evening that a certain amount of monofilament net be allowed to be used.  The 800 yards that I spoke about as being the legal maximum length of net need not all be monofilament.  If a compromise could be reached whereby, say, 200 yards of monofilament net and 600 yards of nylon net were allowed, then the small fisherman could make a living and there would not be conflict on the high seas between these in-shore fishermen and the fishery protection officers, or bailiffs as we know them.  That is what happens at present, particularly in the months of May, June and July, and even running into August there is constant conflict along the coast.</P>
    <P>In my own constituency a number of <Col N="1182" /> fishermen have gone to prison in recent years.  This might be highlighted in local papers and possibly in the <i>Cork Examiner</i> but it seldom reaches the corridors of power in Dublin and the media in the capital.  People are going to prison for trying to eke out a living for themselves and their families.</P>
    <P>There are two alternatives if they cannot fish, the dole or emigration. Despite cutbacks the fishery boards have improved their equipment and now they are capable of pursuing and apprehending the people who might be fishing with this monofilament net, although it may be a very small amount of monofilament net.  This has made life impossible for these salmon fishermen.  People have gone to prison and others have had to give up fishing because they cannot make a living.  In small communities like Ardmore, villages around Youghal Bay, such as Clashmore, Knockadoon and Monatrea, Helvick, Boatstrand, Dunmore East, Passage East, Cheekpoint, etc. people have had to stop fishing because they cannot make a living.  It is a dreadful state of affairs that we cannot accommodate people who work hard under dreadful conditions &mdash; and it is no joke being out in an open boat in a storm in the months of May and June.  These people have to work in terrible conditions and we should help them to make a reasonable living.  I am not asking that all the net used be monofilament, but that a limited amount of it be allowed.  In doing that, there should be some give and take.</P>
    <P>The fishing week might actually be reduced in return for allowing fishermen to use this net.  At present they can fish for five days.  If they were catching a reasonable amount of fish I do not think they would object to having the fishing week reduced to four days.  That in turn would be a tremendous boost for the tourist industry, specifically for anglers fishing for salmon with rod and line.  The essence of the angling industry for salmon is that the fish get up the river.  By having three days of the week closed to fishing, <Col N="1183" /> the fish will get up the river; the anglers and the tourist interests will, generally, be happy, the fishermen at the estuary and at sea will be able to make a decent living with the use of a certain amount of monofilament net and we will not have this constant conflict &mdash; which is not doing the country any good, is putting people into prison, is putting people out of a livelihood and causing a great deal of human misery.  The salmon stocks can stand up to a limited amount of fishing with monofilament net.  It is being done, as I said, with miles of this illegal net, and if the salmon here survived so far why can they not survive a limited amount of fishing with a limited amount of monofilament net?</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy Deasy that we have had a great deal of hassle in the southern part of the country with the inshore fishermen and his monofilament net problem over the last number of years.  Monofilament netting should be allowed but it should be reduced in length and depth.  I would like the Minister to take into account also the use of a tagging system with regard to <Col N="1184" /> salmon.  I believe that with a tagging system and monofilament net control we could give these people a chance of making a decent livelihood.  I ask the Minister to take that into account.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick West):</i> The use of monofilament netting for salmon fishing has been prohibited by by-law since 1965 in the interest of conservation of salmon stocks.  It is only one of a large range of conservation measures operated in order to ensure the survival of salmon as an exploitable resource.  Salmon, as we all know, is both a sea and a freshwater fish and sufficient numbers of the species must be allowed access to our rivers on their return from their feeding grounds at sea in order to spawn and reproduce.  The overall aim of the conservation arrangements in place is to limit the catch of salmon in tidal waters and ensure that adequate stocks are allowed to get into the rivers to spawn.</P>
      <P>Some years ago there was a very big increase in drift netting for salmon at sea which intercepts the shoals of salmon on their journey back to their river of origin. This in itself constituted a threat to salmon stocks, but only when it was combined with the use of netting made from the newly developed monofilament material was it considered to be anti-conservation. The monofilament netting is invisible to salmon in the water and can be used by day and by night.  It is extremely effective in netting more fish than could reasonably be allowed from a conservation point of view.  It also causes internal damage to any fish which manages to struggle through the meshes.</P>
      <P>This then is the background to the present ban which has been maintained since 1965 on the advice of scientific officers of my Department, the only change being made in 1984 to permit the use of monofilament materials in nets that was specifically designed and rigged for catching sea fish on the sea floor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1185" /> The Salmon Review Group considered the question of the use of monofilament netting in fishing for salmon as one of a number of related issues in the context of the salmon conservation regime as a whole.  The group recommended that the ban should remain at least until agreement could be secured on a range of alternative conservation measures which would in themselves severely restrict the areas and times when drift netting could be carried on.</P>
    <P>To summarise the arguments, therefore, the case made against any legislation of monofilament netting for use in salmon fishing is extremely strong.  It is so efficient as a catching mechanism that its use could ultimately jeopardise the very survival of the salmon species.  Even if legalised on a very restricted basis it would make proper monitoring and enforcement extremely difficult, if not impossible.  The use of monofilament can pose a major hazard to navigation, which is also one of my concerns in the Department. Indeed, it can also cause serious damage to wildlife, so much so that there is talk about it being banned for all fishing purposes internationally.  Any legislation is strongly opposed by salmon rod fishermen and by environmentalists, and there is pressure from other governments and international organisations against any modification of the existing law. Therefore, in the circumstances, any decision to legalise the use of monofilament for sea fishing should not be lightly taken and can be taken only if and when a whole range of exacting conditions are satisfied.</P>
    <P>While I have considerable sympathy with the position of licensed salmon netsmen as outlined by Deputy Deasy and Deputy Ahern &mdash; I have taken the ponts on board as outlined by them &mdash; it would be very misleading for me at this stage to imply that the legislation of monofilament is on the immediate agenda.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Killarney Employment Exchange.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihanKerry" hpid="Mr. Moynihan Mr. Moynihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moynihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish on this Adjournment debate to draw the Minister's attention to the employment exchange facilities in Killarney.  Killarney urban area has approximately 8,000 residents and the catchment area surrounding it from the rural areas which is also accommodated by the local employment exchange has a further 3,000 to 4,000 people.  Over a long number of years local bodies, the urban district council, the trade unions and organisations representing community groups have been pressing the Department of Social Welfare for the provision of a proper modern premises in the town.  There was a very logical, legitimate reason that the Department could not move and this was frequently expressed by successive Ministers, that because of the legal situation governing the appointment of a contractor for the promotion of services there was not legislation which could remove such a contractor and that any change in the facilities in the premises in Killarney would have to await the retirement of any such appointee.  From the end of November this contractor will have retired.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In making this request for the improved facilities I have to compliment the staff who have operated in very limited accommodation and with very limited facilities.  They have done their work in a friendly, courteous and efficient way. Killarney, currently with many other areas, has a high level of unemployment, making heavy demands on the staff in the available accommodation.  In any case, Killarney because of its pre-eminence in the tourist industry, will have at all times a fairly considerable volume of seasonal employment and seasonal resources to the employment exchange.  The absence <Col N="1187" /> of adequate accommodation is such that the unemployed have to stand in a long queue in all kinds of weather along the side street footpath.  This is demeaning to those signing there.  They are the object of viewing by everybody passing and they feel this very much.  Furthermore, in the office itself there is little or no provision for privacy in the submission of cases, for discussions with the staff and the taking of confidential details.  The general feeling among the unemployed in Killarney is that compared with Tralee, Listowel and Cahirciveen they are being treated as second-class citizens.</P>
    <P>I hear from Killarney about giving expression to the general feeling of all bodies there that the Minister and his Department should avail of the current opportunity, once the retirement has taken place, to make the Killarney premises suitable so that for the future both the image of the Department of Social Welfare and the facilities available to the unemployed in Killarney, will be on a par with those provided elsewhere.</P>
    <P>In addition to catering for the unemployed, the offices in the other Kerry towns have facilities for taking up medical certificates on behalf of the disability benefit recipients.  Currently, in Killarney each one has to address his own medical certificate which causes some annoyance and frequently delays.  I appeal to the Minister on behalf of the people of Killarney who have been very patient and disciplined in their demands on his Department and on his predecessors for an upgrading of the employment exchange.  The Minister has the power that can reflect this change.  Not to do so at this point would possibly commit the unemployed in the Killarney urban and rural areas to a further long period of accepting the very limited accommodation. I trust that he will have regard to the inconvenience that has been borne for so long and which is still being borne by those recipients.  In doing that he will <Col N="1188" /> acknowledge that the time has come to give to both the Department of Social Welfare, to the Killarney community and to the unemployed the structure, the facilities and the privacy to which they, as citizens, are entitled.</P>
    <P>The views expressed by me here tonight could be expressed to the Minister by each and every public body in Killarney and by the overwhelming majority of the people there.  What they are seeking is something that has long since been accepted in other Kerry towns and they too feel that Killarney should have an upgraded employment exchange.  I trust the Minister will so decide.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the points made by the Deputy.  I would point out that there are approximately 600 signing per week in Killarney.  The Deputy tabled a Written Question in relation to the question of the setting up of an employment exchange in Killarney and in my reply on 24 October 1989 I explained that the manager of the employment office in Killarney had notified the Department of her intention to retire from her post with effect from the end of November 1989.  I also said that I was at the time reviewing the situation in relation to future services for the area and I indicated that I would notify the Deputy of the outcome of the review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position in relation to the current service in Killarney is that it is run by a branch manager who has been employed by my Department on a contract basis since December 1953.  There are at present 79 branch offices in the country and 51 employment exchanges.  The branch offices tend to be centred in districts of lower population and they perform a very useful function for the Department in the areas concerned.  The branch managers carry out their functions under the directions and control of the manager of the relevant parent employment exchange.  Deciding officers <Col N="1189" /> who make the statutory decisions on claims for unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance are based in the employment exchanges.  Each employment exchange which has branch offices has staff designated to deal with the claims from those offices and generally speaking these cases are dealt with every bit as speedily as the claims which are dealt with at the relevant parent employment exchange.</P>
    <P>It is the normal practice to review the service in an area when a branch manager notifies the Department that he or she intends to resign.  All aspects of the matter including the claim potential in the area are examined.  A major consideration is, as always, the quality of service for unemployed persons but the cost involved and the availability of resources for capital expenditure, are important factors which must also be taken into account.</P>
    <P>In my review of the situation in Killarney I have had to take a number of factors into account.  In the first instance I am conscious that a desire has been expressed that a Civil Service staffed employment exchange be set up in the area and that this aspiration has been a long standing one though, of course, this might not suit the existing staff referred to by the Deputy.  It is understood that this desire to have an employment exchange in Killarney arises not from any dissatisfaction with the actual day-to-day service given by the branch manager and her staff but rather with the premises at which unemployed applicants were required to attend.  Deputies are no doubt aware that the standard of employment exchange accommodation has greatly improved over recent years and I am determined that the quality of my Department's public offices be improved where necessary and maintained at a high standard.  The improvements that have occurred have of course cost a considerable amount of money.  Money for the provision of a new employment exchange in Killarney is not available at <Col N="1190" /> present and in this context I should tell you that moneys for capital expenditure next year have already been committed to existing projects which are of long standing and of critical importance.</P>
    <P>While it is not possible to do so at present it is hoped that it will be possible to set up an employment exchange in Killarney in the future.  In fact the Office of Public Works are holding a site near the town for a new exchange.  Taking all the factors into account I am seeking to establish an interim solution which would allow for the setting up of an exchange when the situation as regards the availability of the necessary resources is more favourable.</P>
    <P>Under an arrangement which has been agreed at Conciliation Council with the association representing branch managers a retiring branch manager can nominate his or her deputy to succeed him or her.  The procedure is that the association would make representations on behalf of the person in question and that I would consider the matter.  The association did make representations on behalf of the current deputy manager in Killarney.  The deputy manager, as the Deputy will be aware, is a former civil servant.</P>
    <P>Having fully considered the matter, I have arranged that a proposal in relation to a short-term contract be put to the deputy manager.  This would allow for an interim solution.  While I must preserve confidentiality in relation to the negotiations about the proposed short-term contract I can say that I am imposing a stipulation that alternative suitable accommodation must be provided within a specified period.  It would not be appropriate for me to comment further on this aspect other than to say that a contract has been forwarded to the deputy manager for her acceptance and signature.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the arrangements which are being worked out at present are the best that can be achieved in the present circumstances and that they will result in an early improvement in the <Col N="1191" /> accommodation which, I understand, is the principal concern of the Deputy at present.</P>

      <P>In so far as Bus Éireann are concerned section 3 of the Transport (No. 2) Act, 1974 imposes on the board of Córas Iompair Éireann a duty to conduct their undertaking so that, after taking into account payments made to the board by the Minister for Tourism and Transport out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas, their operating expenditure, including all charges properly chargeable to revenue, shall not be greater taking one year with another than the revenue of the board.  Subject to that duty and general levels of increases in CIE fares approved by the Government from time to time, the determination of individual fares is a matter for the company.</P>
      <P>It is Bus Éireann policy to keep fares at the lowest possible levels within the financial resources available to them.  The use of promotional fares is a matter for the Company, which provides a range of Expressway services on a profitable basis.</P>

      <P>Strategy for achieving these targets involves: increased public and private sector investment in the development of a more extensive and attractive tourism product range through the use of EC Structural Funds and other incentives such as the Business Expansion Scheme; improve competitiveness of the tourism product in terms of quality and price; increased market penetration by Bord Fáilte, with the assistance of the industry, including entry to new markets and greater niche marketing; improve packaging and distribution of the tourism product in the marketplace, including the bringing on-stream of a major new com-puterised tourism information and reservation system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>While my Department have not carried out comprehensive research in the area of quantifying the relative environmental, energy and safety advantages of rail and road transport, studies have been undertaken by various interests in Ireland into such areas as the contribution of transport to environmental pollution, the relative fuel efficiency of rail and bus <i>vis-á-vis</i> motor cars and the question of energy conservation by motor vehicles.  In addition research has been carried out in other countries and within international organisations, such as the European Conference of Ministers of Transport, in relation to the impact of various aspects of transport on environmental, energy and safety issues.</P>
      <P>From the information available to me it is not possible to be precise about the overall relative values of bus and rail in environmental, energy and safety contexts. Nonetheless research indicates generally that buses are more efficient users of energy than private cars while rail is more efficient than private cars and road freight vehicles.  In these cases occupancy rates and load factors are important criteria.  As regards environmental considerations, these two forms of transport also emerge as being less harmful as far as air pollution is concerned. On the safety issue, public transport generally enjoys an excellent safety record, but the risks for road transport seem higher because of the more complex traffic environment in which it operates.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>I recently approved a proposal by Iarnród Éireann to adapt berth No. 3 at Rosslare Harbour to cater for a larger vessel to be used on the cross-channel route next year.  This is one element of a business plan which is being prepared by Iarnród Éireann.  Major development works are being incorporated in the plan with the objective of <i>inter alia</i> facilitating larger vessels with deeper draughts and allowing for a faster turn-around time for vessels.  The portal developments are estimated to cost £13 million and are included in the <i>National Development Plan</i> for EC assistance.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Central Statistics Office (CSO) prepare estimates on a regular basis of the number of visits made and the expenditure by visitors to Ireland and by Irish visitors abroad.  The results are issued in the annual CSO release &ldquo;Tourism and Travel&rdquo;.  The basis of the estimates is as follows:</P>
      <P>Two sample surveys of passengers, the Country of Residence Survey and the Passenger Card Inquiry are carried out by the CSO.  These are used in conjunction with total passenger movement figures supplied by the transport companies, to provide the estimates for overseas tourism and travel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Country of Residence Survey is a year round sample survey of passengers, both inward and outward at all major air and sea ports to provide an estimated distribution of passengers by country of residence.  This distribution is applied to the total passenger movement figures to provide overall estimates of the numbers of visits abroad by Irish residents and of visits to Ireland by non-residents.  This latter estimate is further broken down into the area of residence distinguished in the results.  The sample size in the 1988 <Col N="998" /> Country of Residence survey was 136,000 passengers &mdash; 69,000 inward and 67,000 outward.</P>
    <P>The Passenger Card Inquiry is also a year round sample survey of incoming and departing passengers at major air and sea ports.  Information is collected on the reason for journey, area of residence, length of stay, expenditure and fare costs. The results are combined with the overall visitor estimates from the Country of Residence Survey to provide the overseas tourism and travel estimates.</P>
    <P>In the Passenger Card Inquiry respondents are asked to indicate by means of ticking an appropriate box on the inquiry card which of the descriptions business, tourist, visit to relatives or other is their reason for journey.  The replies to this question are the basis for the reason for journey analyses used in presenting the results.  The sample size in the 1988 Passenger Card Inquiry at air and sea ports was 227,000 passengers, 84,000 inward and 143,000 outward.</P>
    <P>The estimates for cross-Border visitors on rail and scheduled bus services are derived from the Passenger Card Inquiry on these services and from passenger movement statistics.  In this case the Passenger Card Inquiry results are used to estimate the country of residence distribution in addition to the reason for journey distribution and the average length of stay, expenditure and fare costs. The sample size in the Passenger Card Inquiry on rail and scheduled bus services in 1988 was 14,000 passengers, 7,000 inward and 7,000 outward.</P>
    <P>The estimates of expenditure by cross-Border visitors using private cars (or unscheduled bus services) are based on very limited information and must be regarded as subject to wide margins of error.  It has not been possible to introduce a satisfactory survey of persons crossing the border from which reliable estimates of expenditure and length of stay could be made.</P>
    <P>For the overall estimate of earnings from visitors from abroad data on passenger fare receipts from visitors to Ireland is provided by the Irish air and sea carriers.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 58 and 62 together.</P>
      <P>The criteria in international law applicable to recognition of States are that the State possess (i) A defined territory, (ii) A permanent population, (iii) A sovereign government exercising effective control; and (iv) a capacity to enter into international relations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The State which was proclaimed by the Palestine National Council on 15 November 1988 clearly does not fulfil these conditions. Israel continues to function in the territories it has occupied since 1967 as <Col N="1001" /> an occupying power.  Thus the applicable criteria for the granting of formal legal recognition are not met in this case. Consequently, the Government do not intend to recognise the Palestinian State at this stage.</P>
    <P>The Government consider, however, that in the context of a negotiated settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict, the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination includes their right to an independent State.  The Government, therefore, hope that the independent Palestinian State, proclaimed unilaterally on 15 November 1988, will become a reality as a result of an international peace conference under UN auspices with the participation of all the parties concerned, including the PLO, whose role in representing the Palestinian people we have recognised.</P>

      <P>The question of East Timor is currently on the agenda of the United Nations and the Secretary-General of the United Nations is providing his good offices in order to assist in resolving this problem.  Ireland takes the view that the issue of East Timor is best resolved by negotiations between the countries directly concerned under the auspices of the Secretary-General.  As recently as 26 September 1989, Ireland and our partners in the Twelve expressed support at the United Nations General Assembly for the contacts between Portugal and Indonesia under the auspices of the Secretary-General.  The Government hopes that early progress will lead to a just and comprehensive settlement, accepted internationally, with full respect for the interests of the population of East Timor.  Government policy on East Timor has been expressed directly to the Indonesian authorities on a number of occasions.</P>

      <P>The Government are concerned at the numerous reports of violations of the human rights of members of the ethnic Turkish community in Bulgaria and the discrimination they have suffered for seeking to preserve their culture and traditions.  Since we do not have diplomatic relations of any kind with Bulgaria, we consider that the most appropriate way to make this concern known to the Bulgarian authorities is through the framework of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE).  At the Paris meeting of the Conference on the Human Dimension of the CSCE (30 May to 29 June 1989) and at the Sofia Meeting on the Environment (16 October to 3 November 1989), we voiced our concern at the treatment of this community and pressed the Bulgarian authorities for assurances that steps would be taken to ensure that all Bulgarians can enjoy their full human rights and fundamental freedoms.

      <P>Sections 23 and 24 of the Finance Act, 1981, introduced a tax relief which allowed the cost of providing certain rented accommodation to be set off against a person's total rental income. The scope of that relief was restricted by sections 29 and 30 of the Finance Act, 1983, in relation to construction expenditure incurred between 31 March 1984 and 31 March 1987, in that the relief could only be offset against the rental <Col N="1004" /> income arising from the actual premises qualifying under section 23.  Section 27 of the Finance Act, 1988, reintroduced the relief granted under sections 23 and 24 with effect from 27 January 1988.  The relief under the 1988 Act can be set against all rental income and is due to expire on 31 March 1991.</P>
      <P>The latest relevant statistics available are in respect of the tax relief allowed under the original sections 23 and 24 during the course of the income tax year 1987-88.  In that year claims for relief were allowed in 571 cases at an estimated cost to the Exchequer of £2.9 million.

      <P>Sales of colour film by VAT-registered traders are liable to VAT at the standard 25 per cent rate.  However, VAT does not apply to gifts of goods the cost of which to the donor does not exceed £15.  Films supplied free as part of a processing offer are treated under this gifts provision.</P>
      <P>In regard to importations, a general scheme laid down in Community law provides that tax should be waived where, in relation to any individual consignment, it amounts to less than £2. Most importations of processed films, with or without a free unexposed roll, would benefit from this provision which is aimed at reducing administrative costs were insignificant revenue is involved.</P>

      <P>There are no proposals at EC level under which deposit interest retention tax will be unable to operate after 1992.  As I have recently pointed out, however, the liberalisation of capital movements may cause some difficulties: a relatively high rate of retention tax could provide an incentive for people to open deposit accounts abroad after 1992 when exchange controls have been fully removed.  The implications of capital liberalisation for taxation of savings are still under consideration at Community level. I would draw the Deputy's attention also to the fact that the Government are committed to further reducing the standard rate of income tax, to 25 per cent by 1993, and that the deposit interest retention tax rate will be reduced in line with that reduction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Food if the practice of the spreading of waste from meat factories including blood and rumen contents on pasture lands accords with hygiene standards; the extent to which it constitutes a risk to the health of animals grazing on these and other adjoining <Col N="1013" /> lands; the extent to which the practice constitutes a risk to human health; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The spreading of blood and rumen contents from meat factories on land is restricted by law where such action gives rise to the discharge of polluting matter into water or constitutes a statutory nuisance under the Public Health (Ireland) Act, 1878 as amended.  The practice would not constitute a risk to animal health where such spreading is confined to arable land.  However the spreading of this material on pasture is not advisable and is actively discouraged by my Department.  I am not aware of the threat to human health provided suitable precautions are taken.  The EC Commission has recently submitted a draft proposal to the Agriculture Council to regulate the disposal and processing of animal waste.  I expect that any risk involved in the use of this material will be addressed in the consideration of this proposal by the Council.</P>

      <P>In line with the priority given to the agri-food industry in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> a five year strategy 1988-1992 for the food and drink sector was drawn up by the IDA and my Department.  Companies coming forward with viable proposals will receive every assistance possible from the State and State agencies.</P>
      <P>The requirements of the food industry in regard to buildings, services and environmental aspects are extremely important.  In this connection the provision of a specialist park, with serviced sites geared primarily for the food processing industry in the greater Dublin area, is under consideration at present by the IDA.  Measures to encourage new food ventures are also being examined.</P>

    <P>Delays in payment of grants have occurred recently through a combination of factors such as staff shortages and the disruption of work occasioned by the <Col N="1015" /> recent transfer of the Department's accounts branch to Cavan.  Additional staff have now been allocated to these duties.  Work on the clearance of the backlog which has built up has commenced.

The vast majority of the claimants in these areas are at present paid in cash at centre city offices.  In accordance with normal practice, services at the new office will become operational on a phased basis.  When the new office is fully operational, they will be paid in cash there.</P>

      <P>The person concerned has been in receipt of disablement benefit since 23 December 1988.  He was assessed at 50 per cent disablement from 23 December 1988 to 9 November 1989 subject to a further review.  He was examined on 25 September 1989 by a medical referee and his disablement was re-assessed at 40 per cent.  The medical referee did not consider him permanently incapable of work and referred him for further examination in August 1990.  He was then awarded continuing disablement benefit from 10 November to 16 August 1990 at £27.50, <Col N="1025" /> which is the rate appropriate to 40 per cent disablement.</P>
      <P>The person concerned served notice of intention to appeal against the decision and an appeal form was issued to him for completion.  The matter will be dealt with by an appeals officer on receipt of the completed appeal form.</P>
      <P>An application to transfer from disability benefit to invalidity pension was received from the person concerned on 2 November 1989.  Due to the fact that a medical referee found the person concerned not to be permanently incapable of work a deciding officer decided that he was not entitled to invalidity pension. Disability benefit is continuing to be paid at the appropriate rate.</P>

      <P>In accordance with section 35 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981, a person may be disqualified from receiving unemployment benefit for up to six weeks for refusing an offer of suitable employment.</P>
      <P>There is no corresponding provision in the legislation governing the unemployment assistance scheme.  However, it is a statutory condition of the unemployment assistance and unemployment benefit schemes, that claimants must be available for and genuinely seeking work and a claimant who refuses an offer of suitable employment may, where the circumstances of his or her case warrant it, be found not to satisfy this condition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where FÁS notifies this Department that a claimant has refused an offer of a suitable place on the social employment scheme, the case is referred to a deciding <Col N="1026" /> officer for review of entitlement to payment. In reviewing entitlement, the deciding officer has regard to all of the circumstances of the case, including in particular the reason why the claimant refused the offer.  Before a decision is made, claimants are afforded every opportunity to put their side of the case to the deciding officer.  If the claimant can show that he or she had good cause for not taking up the offer of a place on the social employment scheme, payment is continued.</P>
    <P>Where, following full consideration of all of the facts, the deciding officer concludes that disallowance of the claim is appropriate, the claimant is notified in writing of the reason for the disallowance and of his or her right to appeal against the decision to an appeals officer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if it is his intention to amend the Family Home Protection Act, 1976, having regard to the fact that the Act provided no protection to a spouse in a situation where a creditor applied for the sale of a family home on foot of a judgment mortgage against the family home, for the amount of a debt obtained against the other spouse on the basis that the Family Home Protection Act only applies to conveyance by one or other of the spouses and not by a third party and that <Col N="1029" /> consequently a judgment mortgage is not a conveyance within the meaning of the Act, but an operation of law, resulting in a situation whereby a spouse can freely obtain an unsecured loan, which if not repaid can be registered against the family home and ultimately lead to the sale of the family home, in spite of the absence of consent by the other spouse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke) Raphael P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no proposals to amend the Family Home Protection Act, 1976, so as to apply it to judgment mortgages obtained by third parties.  When the Act was initiated the then Minister for Justice made clear in the House that the legislation was not intended to apply to judgment mortgages &mdash; though there is provision whereby a spouse may apply to the court for protection if the other spouse is behaving improvidently with the intention of putting the continued ownership of the family home in jeopardy. In addition if the Act were to give protection to spouses against sales by judgment mortgages no doubt it could operate to the disadvantage of spouses who seek in the ordinary way to arrange credit.</P>
      <P>Recent case law in any event suggests that a spouse who is in actual occupation of a family home and who has acquired a beneficial interest in that home has rights of occupation as co-owner of the home which would be binding on a judgment mortgagee seeking a sale. Moreover, the effect of the legislation which is being prepared in my Department to give each spouse equal rights in the ownership of the family home and contents will be to strengthen the position of the non-owning spouse.  A recent High Court decision which is under appeal to the Supreme Court could also have implications for this area.</P>

In this case I will confine my remarks to the following.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities have informed me that during the early hours of 14 November 1989 a burglary occurred at the detective unit office which is situated in an annexe attached to Fitzgibbon Street Garda Station.

      <P>Care is needed in use of the term &ldquo;radiation&rdquo; in the context of radio communications systems of any description. It should not be confused with ionising radiation such as that associated with nuclear reaction.</P>
      <P>All radio waves (or radio frequency radiation) are forms of non-ionising radiation by which energy in the form of electromagnetic waves, in the radio frequency spectrum, emanates from a transmitter and without which communication could not occur.

MMDS transmitters will likewise produce a discernable radio frequency radiation at the frequencies on which it will operate.  In the context of all of the electromagnetic energy being generated in the atmosphere at any point in time from both natural and man-made sources and the low power output of the MMDS transmitters themselves this could not conceivably be categorised as a &ldquo;significant increase in radiation&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment the total sum of money notified as being allocated by his Department in respect of rate support grant to each local authority for (a) 1989 and (b) 1990; and whether any local authority has received an allocation for 1990 which is for a sum in excess of 4.5 per cent of the rate support grant allocated for 1989.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment the amount of rate support grant allocated to each of the 27 county councils in Ireland for 1990; and the percentage increase for each county council over their 1989 rate support grant.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 125 and 142 together.</P>
      <P>Straight comparisons of rate support grant allocations from one year to another are not valid because of adjustments made in respect of, for example, the Local Loans Fund (Amendment) Act, 1987, removal of local authorities financial responsibility for supplementary welfare allowances, ACOT, OPW arterial drainage maintenance etc., ESB rates and, for 1990, the effect of the 1988 Tenant Purchase Scheme.  Up to date information on the rate support grant allocation for 1990 is set out in a tabular statement which I propose to circulate in the Official Report.  Details of the allocations for 1989 are contained in Question No. 201 of 14 November 1989.</P>

      <P>The IIRS publication: S.R.6:1975, Recommendations for Septic Tank Drainage Systems Suitable for Single Houses, refers to the test procedures for setting up a suitable site for installing a septic tank and subsurface percolation system.  It is the practice among local authorities, on the advice of my Department, to use these recommendations in the assessment of planning applications which include septic tank <Col N="1039" /> drainage arrangements.  The effluent from septic tanks is a potential water pollutant and localised problems may arise where tanks are not adequately maintained or are sited too close to wells.</P>
      <P>Drinking water from both ground and surface water sources must meet stringent chemical and microbiological quality standards, and in devising monitoring regimes for purposes of implementing the drinking water regulations, sanitary authorities have been asked to consider all possible influencing factors on the quality of water.</P>

      <P>I presume that the Deputy is referring to the European Communities (Quality of Water Intended for Human Consumption) Regulations, 1988.  These regulations gave full effect in Irish law to all of the requirements of the EC Drinking Water Directive (80/778/EEC).  It is a matter for the sanitary authorities to ensure that the quality standards set out in the regulations are complied with.  For monitoring purposes, patterns of standard analyses and minimum sampling frequencies are prescribed and a handbook on implementation of the regulations has been circulated by my Department to the sanitary authorities.  Any failure by a sanitary authority to carry out its duties under the regulations would be dealt with under the general local government code rather than by prosecution in the courts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>This project was put forward by Dublin Corporation for an amenity grant in November 1985.  The cost of constructing the community centre was then estimated by the corporation at £100,000, subsequently increased to £150,000.  I understand that this was calculated on the basis of provision of the basic facility, involving partial fitting out, only.  The construction work was to be undertaken through the services of FÁS and the intention of the corporation was that completion of the building should be undertaken at a later stage when money became available through local fund raising. The following amenity grants were paid to Dublin Corporation in respect of the community centre: 1986 scheme, £5,000; 1987 scheme, £75,000; 1988 scheme, £40,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following strong representations from <Col N="1041" /> the corporation, I notified them on 6 October 1989 that I was prepared to allocate a further £25,000 towards the completion of the project from savings under the amenity grants scheme.  This allocation was made on condition that (i) completion of the community centre would be achieved by the corporation for a total expenditure of £50,000, the sum which the corporation had indicated to my Department as the amount required for the purpose, and (ii) that the corporation would meet the balance of £25,000 from their own resources.</P>
    <P>The corporation notified my Department on 10 November 1989 that, because of vandalism problems, they consider that the building must now be fully completed and brought into use without further delay and that the remaining work should be put out to contract.  They have sought a further grant under the amenity grants scheme to cover the additional costs, including fitting out, which they now estimate at £160,000.</P>
    <P>I should point out that there was no cut-off of funds in this case by my Department and that the amenity grants scheme has always operated on a devolved basis, with supervision of projects delegated fully to the local authorities.  Nevertheless, I am extremely concerned in this case at the apparent losses through vandalism, the delay in completing the centre and the escalation in the costings put forward by the corporation.  My Department are taking up these matters with the corporation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Connolly)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter for individual local authorities, in the first instance, to ensure that discharges from land based sources of trade and sewage effluents to estuarine and coastal waters do not cause pollution. Trade effluent discharges may be made only under and in accordance with a licence issued under the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act, 1977. Where licences are granted, local authorities may attach conditions relating to the nature, composition, temperature, volume, rate, method of treatment and location of the discharge, the periods during which the discharge may or may not be made, and its effects on the receiving waters.  Licences may be reviewed to ensure that the conditions set are adequate to protect waters.  The Local Government (Water Pollution) (Amendment) Bill, 1989, includes provisions extending the circumstances in which licences may be reviewed so that all beneficial uses of waters can be protected <Col N="1049" /> and that any new data on the effects of pollutants can be taken into account.</P>
      <P>As regards possible effects by sewage discharges, local authorities have been asked to examine their existing sewage disposal systems to ensure that they are operating effectively and are meeting their design standards for effluent discharges. The authorities have also been asked to identify areas affected by such discharges and to develop appropriate proposals to eliminate any pollution problems.  Work is in progress at present to improve sewage disposal arrangements for Dún Laoghaire, Bray and Wicklow while proposals for a number of other coastal towns are at an advanced stage of planning.  It is intended that investment in the provision of new and improved sewage treatment and disposal systems will be maintained at a high level.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the quality of our estuarine and coastal waters is generally of a high standard and conditions are favourable for the passage of salmon and for the survival of resident fish populations. The report on the &ldquo;Status of Current Knowledge on Anthropogenic Influences in the Irish Sea&rdquo; published by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea found that there are no clear indications of adverse impacts in the coastal waters on this side of the Irish Sea due to non-radioactive contaminants apart from localised cases of excessive organic contamination.</P>
      <P>Dumping of wastes at sea and controls on discharges from vessels are the responsibility of the Minister for the Marine.</P>

    <P>I am advised by the South-Eastern Health Board that a consultant anaesthetist will take up appointment in the Orthopaedic Hospital at Kilcreene, Kilkenny, with effect from January 1990. An additional consultant anaesthetist post in Kilcreene Hospital is also about to be advertised which will increase the anaesthetist staff complement to four.  As the Deputy will appreciate, there have been problems in attracting candidates to apply for consultant anaesthetists vacancies throughout the country.  In the event of delays being met in appointing a person to the advertised post, the South-Eastern Health Board have arrangements in place to provide locum cover for the post with effect from January 1990.  I am also pleased to report that concurrent with the improvement in consultant <Col N="1052" /> anaesthetist numbers employed in Kilcreene Hospital, funding has been approved to extend theatre facilities in the hospital with the building of a new theatre in 1990.</P>

He received immediate attention which controlled the bleeding and he was sent for X-ray examination.  He then received antibiotic and analgesic treatment and was admitted to a ward at 1.10 a.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The clinical decision was that the fingers could not be replanted and that they consequently required amputation.  As <Col N="1058" /> the case did not require immediate operative treatment it was put on the Trauma list for later that day.  However, as ten urgent Trauma cases needed surgery later that day this case had to be deferred to the afternoon of the following day. The patient was retained in the hospital, the operation was carried out successfully and he was discharged on antibiotic treatment on Thursday, 9 November.</P>
    <P>He attended a dressing clinic on 15 November and he was considered to have made an excellent recovery.  He expressed his appreciation of the care and the treatment which he had been given. He has a further appointment for the dressing clinic on 22 November.</P>
    <P>In normal circumstances I would consider it inappropriate for me to comment in public on the clinical details of an individual patient.  However as this case had already received some publicity, I considered it important to set the record straight.</P>

      <P>The staffing of national schools is determined by the enrolment in the school on 30 September of the previous school year.  This is in accordance with the agreement reached between the Government and the INTO under the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i>  The combined enrolment of Loreto Girls' national school and De La Salle Boys' national school on 30 September 1988 was 258 pupils which, following their amalgamation warrants a staff of Principal plus seven assistants in The Good Shepherd national school for the 1989-90 school year.

    <P>* Data in respect of 1988-89 represent provisional enrolment figures based on the statistical returns completed by the various schools and colleges throughout the country in respect of that particular academic year.  As the statistical return for the current academic year is only in the process of collection and preliminary analysis by my Department at the moment, it is not possible at this stage to give actual enrolment figures for 1989-90.  It should be noted that data in respect of the 1989-90&mdash;1999-00 academic years (inclusive) represent projected enrolments prepared by my Department.  The projections take published official demographic projections into account as well as trends within the education system itself. They are kept under regular review and are subject to change as relevant new data require.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is understood to be referring to an irregular practice which had developed some years ago whereby post-primary pupils for the Creggs area of County Galway seeking school transport to Roscommon town had been picked up by the school transport service in the Ballygar catchment area.  The practice is in course of being phased out, and it is not open to my Department to restore service.  I allowed transport from within the Ballygar catchment area to continue to the end of the summer school term 1989 for all children from the Creggs and Four Roads area attending schools in Roscommon.  It was emphasised that this agreement would not continue beyond the end of June 1989.</P>
      <P>Creggs is situated in the Ballygar catchment area and under the terms of the post-primary transport scheme pupils from that catchment area wishing to attend school in Roscommon town must make their own way to the Roscommon town catchment area boundary in order to avail of the transport to that centre.  I should add that their accommodation is subject to availability of seating and the proviso that no extra cost to the State will arise.</P>

      <P>The activities of Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann come within the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture and Food.  He has advised that under the relevant EC Regulations contracts between Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann and growers for the purchase of sugar beet must include a clause that the company will share the transport costs for beet delivered free of charge at sugar factories.  The amounts payable are agreed by both parties prior to the commencement of each campaign.  However, the conclusion of arrangements for the delivery of beet is a matter for each beet grower.  In circumstances where a haulier is used, the grower may conclude a freight agreement with a haulier, <Col N="1072" /> whereby the company are authorised to deduct freight costs from the grower's account and pay it to the haulier.  While the company provide this facility they are not otherwise a party to freight agreements between growers and hauliers.</P>
      <P>Under the Road Transport Acts, 1933-86, a person hiring a freight haulier is responsible for ensuring that the haulier concerned complies with the necessary licensing regulations.  The enforcement of the Transport Acts is the responsibility of transport officers from my Department and the Garda Síochána.  Any breaches detected, including haulage by unlicensed operators, are processed through the courts and appropriate penalties imposed.</P>

The conditions of contract between a passenger and an airline, which are shown on airline tickets and are standard to all airlines, include the following:</P>
      <P>Carrier undertakes to use its best efforts to carry the passengers and baggage with reasonable dispatch.  Times shown in timetables or elsewhere are not guaranteed and form no part of this contract.  Carrier may, without notice, substitute alternate carriers or aircraft, and may alter or omit stopping places shown on the ticket in case of necessity. Schedules are subject to change without notice.  Carrier assumes no responsibility for making connections.</P>
      <P>As regards delays caused by over-booking of passengers, most airlines operate a scheme to compensate passengers on scheduled flights who cannot be accommodated on a flight for which they have a reservation.  Furthermore, the EC Commission is at present formulating proposals for a scheme of compensation in the event of an airline overbooking passengers on scheduled flights.  In addition, the EC Council is at present considering a draft Directive on Package Travel which contains measures to give protection to the consumer in the event of non-performance or poor performance of contract by a tour operator, including overbooking.</P>

      <P>No subsidies have been paid to Aer Lingus over the past 30 years.  However, as part of a comprehensive financial restructuring package designed to restore the group to profitability, the Government in 1983 approved the provision of cost alleviation payments to Aerlínte Éireann in recognition of their role in meeting national needs through the provision of a transatlantic service.  In the period 1983 to 1986 inclusive, cost alleviation payments totalling £13 million were paid to the airline.</P>
      <P>Dividends amounting to £3,209,000 have been paid to the Government by Aer Lingus.  The company have also announced a dividend of £3.5 million for the financial year ended 31 March 1989. The dividend figures quoted are inclusive of advance corporation tax.</P>
      <P>The total share capital in the Aer Lingus group, all of which is held by the Minister for Finance, is £73.61 million, comprising £36.393 million in Aer Lingus and £47.217 million in Aerlínte.</P>

      <P>It would not be open <Col N="1076" /> to me to refuse an application by a non-Irish airline to operate a service on any of the three routes in question viz.  DublinStansted, Dublin-Liverpool and Dublin-Munich. Rights to operate on these routes are available to UK and German airlines respectively under the relevant bilateral air services agreements and under EC legislation.  I have not, however, received any application from a non-Irish airline to operate on any of the routes concerned.</P>
      <P>I should say that the object of the Government's policy is not to protect Irish airlines from competition but to enable the two Irish airlines to meet increasing foreign competition from positions of strength and to take maximum advantage of liberalisation in the Community in the run-up to 1992.</P>

      <P>It is difficult to quantify the level of contribution which the Swansea-Cork ferry service has made to tourism in the south-west region.  I firmly believe, however, that only a commercially viable service can be of lasting benefit to that region.  In that regard, the Government's commitment of financial assistance for the ferry service in 1990 is in recognition of the contribution to the region which a viable service could make and the strong convictions expressed by <Col N="1079" /> local interests in the Cork and Kerry areas that such a service could become viable.</P>
