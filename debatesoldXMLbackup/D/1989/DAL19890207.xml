    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the National Library may have to close in the evenings and on Saturdays in view of staff shortages; and if, in view of the implications that such a move would have for those engaged in research, especially students and those carrying out research in their spare time, he intends to take any steps to provide additional staffing for the library to ensure that it is able to continue with its existing opening hours.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach the reason the National Library is to close in the evenings; if his attention has been drawn to the fact many students can only use the facilities there in the evenings; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, a Cheann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 1 and 47 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The National Library is open from 10 a.m. to 5.15 p.m. every weekday, until 9 <Col N="1414" /> p.m. on two evenings per week and on Saturday from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m.  Recently some doubt arose about evening and Saturday opening due to withdrawal of overtime by some staff but this restriction was, in the event, averted by the staff agreeing to continue overtime working. The library, as with other State services, has suffered staff losses but through the co-operation of staff and overtime working its services have been substantially maintained.</P>
    <P>A management survey has been carried out in the library and the recommendations of this survey will be available shortly.  A new director has been appointed and will take up office in the coming weeks.  In addition, an extra assistant is being appointed through the Civil Service Commission and that appointee should be available shortly.</P>
    <P>I will review the situation when these developments have taken place to see what their effect is on the efficient functioning of the library.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want initially to welcome the appointment of the new director to the National Library: I think it is the first time that a woman has been appointed as director and the Government have to be congratulated on that. Nonetheless I want to ask the Taoiseach if he would not agree that while the problems in the library of staff and manning have been averted for the time being it is really only for the time being and unless serious steps are taken to redress the severe shortages there, the problem is likely to recur.  I should like the Taoiseach to comment on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said by way of reply, there is a survey under way at the moment and when that survey is available and the new director has taken up her appointment we will review the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach advise the House by whom the management survey is being carried out and will he indicate in a general way the terms <Col N="1415" /> of reference of the survey, having particular regard to the problems indicated in the question asked?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The survey is being carried out by experts in the Department of Finance at the request of my Department. It is generally to consider the whole situation as regards staffing, facilities and so on and report to us.  As I said, at least one new assistant will be appointed and when the report is available we will review the position.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. G. FitzGerald Dr. G. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. G. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to remind the Taoiseach that 45 years ago when he and I were students and the country's GNP per head in real terms was one-third of what it is now, the National Library was open every evening until 10 p.m. Would the Taoiseach agree that it would be desirable to get back to that position so that the library would be available for students until that hour, which even in those impoverished days we were able to afford?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy.  It was a very pleasant ambience and fruitful place in which to work and the hallmarks of it can be seen on both himself and myself today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I hate to intrude on the reminiscences of two very honourable Members of the House but may I ask the Taoiseach to ensure, whatever else will happen, that at least the hours during which the library is open in the evenings, and particularly on Saturdays, will remain because of its importance to people who are working and for those who cannot otherwise&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he will take urgent steps at European level for the phasing out of both the production and the consumption of chlorofluorocarbons within the next five years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment the action, if any, the Government propose to take to deal with the problem of chlorofluorocarbons being used in projects in general use in Ireland; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn) Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose taking Questions Nos. 2 and 37 together.</P>
      <P>The control of the production and consumption of chlorofluorocarbons in the interests of protecting the ozone layer can best be carried out by multilateral rather than unilateral action.  In recognition of this, Ireland in common with its EC partners is a party to the Montreal Protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer which came into force on 1 January 1989.  The Protocol introduces control measures for the eight substances regarded as having the greatest ozone depleting potential.  These substances comprise five chlorofluorocarbons and three halons.  As regards chlorofluorocarbons, the controls require the stabilisation of consumption at 1986 levels from 1 July 1989, a reduction of 20 per cent from 1 July 1993 and a reduction of 50 per cent from 1 July 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Montreal Protocol is being implemented throughout the European Communities by means of Council Regulation (EEC) No. 3322/88 of 14 October <Col N="1417" /> 1988.  The regulation restricts the production of CFCs within the Community and the importation of CFCs from third countries.  In response to these controls, major advances have already been made in the development of substitute substances.</P>
    <P>The first review of the Montreal Protocol is scheduled to take place in the spring of 1990 and the preparatory scientific, environmental and economic work is now commencing.  I believe that the current measures in the Montreal Protocol are but the first step towards protecting the ozone layer.  Greater and faster reductions in the use of CFCs are called for.  Ireland will, therefore, be supporting proposals at EC level and at meetings of the Montreal Protocol for more stringent controls on the use of CFCs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister if he is aware that the Bureau of European Consumers' Unions and the European Environmental Bureau have called for the total phasing out of both the production and consumption of CFCs within the next five years?  Would the Minister agree that the time scale laid down in the Montreal Convention, having regard to the now increased understanding of the impact of CFCs on the ozone layer is too long and there is a need for an urgent reassessment of the provisions in that Convention?  Would the Minister indicate whether he intends to take any action urgently at European Community level, prior to the summer of 1990 to bring forward the review process?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I would agree with the Deputy that there is some need to speed up the process of reduction in the use of CFCs.  There is only one company in Ireland involved in the filling of aerosols using CFCs, with a very small usage.  I understand that the vast majority of these substances are imported into Ireland.  I also understand that the United Kingdom states that by the end of 1989 only about 10 per cent of aerosols will contain CFCs. On a wider European level, the Commission of the European Communities <Col N="1418" /> expects to conclude shortly an agreement with the European aerosol industry for a common label for CFC-free products. The Commission entered into these negotiations following my request, which was supported by all other member states, at the Environmental Council held last June.  There is an understanding that we should speed up the process and I support the notion put forward by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>A final supplementary question.  Would the Minister agree with the assessment made by a Dr. Tolba at the two-day United Nations Environmental Programme Conference at The Hague recently, that the world faces a catastrophe in the next 40 years if CFCs continue to be used?  Would the Minister consider, to strengthen the moral position of this country at European level pressing for more immediate and urgent action by introducing an overall ban on the use of CFCs and the importation into this country of any product in which they are used, within the course of this year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say that that will happen within the course of the year but I support the general thrust of the Deputy's remark that we should reach a situation as soon as possible where we will be importing as few as possible of these products.  It might be as well to say here that the particular firm that I mentioned use about one tonne in a year.  This is for a very specialist product to do with health care.  As of this time, there is no suitable alternative propellant available here or elsewhere for the product.  It is a very important product for health care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>In the United States these products have been banned altogether since 1970.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that there are still some special products for which an alternative propellant cannot be found. However, I accept what the Deputy says. I do not know if the crisis is as great as he says, but certainly we should be heading as quickly as possible towards total non-usage of CFCs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if hís attention has been drawn to the fact that a major sewer renewal reconstruction programme is required in the city of Dublin; that substantial sections of the city's sewers are in danger of collapse; that if major reconstruction works are not undertaken a serious public health hazard could result; and the action he intends to take to enable Dublin Corporation to undertake the necessary reconstruction works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no specific proposals before any Department in respect of such works.  I am advised that Dublin Corporation have, over the years, carried out such works from their own resources and I would be concerned if further action of this kind were not taken by the corporation where public health hazards may arise.  I will carefully consider any specific proposals that may be submitted by the corporation but, taking account of the financial arrangements made in previous years for such works and the absence of specific proposals, I cannot give any commitment to the funding of such works.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of a report dated 11 January 1989 from Mr. Seán Haughey, Assistant City Manager, in which he states that there is an on-going process of deterioration in the sewerage system of the City of Dublin and that the corporation lack the financial capacity to tackle the problem?

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I would prefer if the Deputy desisted from quoting.  I am concerned about a precedent in this <Col N="1421" /> matter.  My predecessors have always ruled accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of this report, or of the danger of disease, or of the danger of a collapse of the sewerage system?  Is he aware of the statement by officials of Dublin Corporation that the corporation would require in the region of £7 million per year over a period of 25 years just to tackle this problem?  Is there any action that the Minister proposes to take with regard to this matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that some of the sewers serving Dublin city were constructed in the last century and these would have been constructed with brick and earthenware pipes.  Due to age and chemical erosion and the very weight of traffic, obviously some will be put under greater pressure than others.  An ongoing programme of sewer replacement has been in place since 1974.  I believe that about £10.6 million has been spent on that programme to date.  I am aware that this is an inadequate resource with which to deal with the problem; that has been communicated to me.  There are no detailed proposals before me from the corporation for my consideration at this time concerning this matter.  When those detailed proposals come before me, they will certainly get my full consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>In the light of the urgent nature of this problem, of the possibility of the sewerage system collapsing around the city of Dublin and of the report stating that there is a danger of infestation entering the public water system, would the Minister call in officials from Dublin Corporation as a matter of urgency and get from them a very detailed breakdown of the nature of the problem?  Could the Minister indicate to the House, in the context of EC structural funding, whether it is intended to look for any funding to enable the city of Dublin to tackle this problem and obtain the necessary finances for this to be done?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>All the matters referred to <Col N="1422" /> by the Deputy are possible, but it would be unusual, to say the least, for the corporation not first to make their submissions to me in so far as what they regard as adequate or desirable for the restoration of the system is concerned. Following the submission of such a report, I shall be happy to talk further to the officials about the whole matter.  It might just be possible to have access to funding other than own resources to deal with the problem.  I do not know.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very brief final supplementary question.  As far as the Minister is concerned, there is no danger posed to the general public in Dublin at present due to the state of the sewers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I cannot say that, because some of the sewers, as I say, are very old and some have collapsed and have been restored and replaced after collapse.  I told the Deputy that £10.6 million has already been spent on this work.  Obviously, there is some more money to be spent, but I will not know the extent of that until such time as I get technical advice in the form of decent proposals or plans as to how the corporation proposes dealing with the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not normal practice for the Department to telephone around to local authorities asking them to do their own work.  Usually we are inundated with demands, or proposals, or submissions for funding.  I think this should be tackled the other way round.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment the present position regarding the community centre and sports hall in Aughrim Street, Dublin 7 <Col N="1423" /> on which Dublin Corporation have spent £400,000 which was never used as the corporation have no funds to run it; if he has any plans to remedy this situation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>This sports hall was provided by Dublin Corporation with the aid of generous grants from my Department. It is a matter for the corporation to make arrangements for the running of the hall, including all necessary financial provisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister confirm that the capital funding for this hall was provided by the previous Government? Would he confirm that, having spent £400,000 of Government money on this hall, there is now a major facility lying idle, in the centre of Dublin, which is now being vandalised?  Would the Minister indicate to the House why his Department have not considered making any funding available, through lottery funding or otherwise, to enable this hall, which was built at public expense, to be utilised by the local community?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>It might be regarded as a joint venture.  It cost £540,000, of which £150,000 was provided in 1986.  I provided £300,000 in 1987.  Irrespective of how it was funded, the estimated running cost is £20,000 per annum.  Dublin Corporation have not as yet made the funds available.  The Minister for the Environment is hardly responsible for the running of sports halls.  That is a matter for the local authority.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that Dublin Corporation have not made funds available for the running of this sports hall due to the cutback on the rate support grant?  Would the Minister not accept that it is a national scandal that the Government should spend nearly £500,000 on the provision of a sports hall and should then deprive the local authority of the relatively small sum of £20,000 necessary to make it available to <Col N="1424" /> this deprived community?  Can the Minister guarantee that in 12 months' time this sports and community hall will not lie derelict due to vandalism?  It would cost more to provide security for the building than to run it.</P>

      <P>It would be inappropriate for the Department.  Approval was obtained from FÁS for the employment of 12 people there but it had to be withdrawn because finance was not available from the local authority to meet the running costs.  I hardly think that £20,000 would make a big hole in the £200 million gross expenditure by that local authority in a year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that the Minister should ascertain from the Fianna Fáil members of Dublin Corporation who form the majority, why they have not made the necessary £20,000 available. Presumably he would have some influence in the context of the Dublin Corporation estimates.  I would ask the Minister to take urgent action during the next few weeks to ensure that the hall is fully maintained and protected and opened for usage.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5, 11, 24 and 111 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The number of applications received by each local authority is set out in the tabular statement which I propose to incorporate in the Official Report.  There <Col N="1426" /> were 40,655 applications by tenants to buy their houses: this represents some 45 per cent of eligible tenants.  In addition, 1,752 tenants applied to purchase flats and maisonettes.  I am very pleased at the exceptional response to the scheme which compares with an average of some 5,000 applications in recent years.  As I made clear since I introduced the scheme, applications had to be received by 31 December 1988 and I do not intend to extend that date.  I am at present considering purchase arrangements, including those for flats, for this year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that while the national average for applications is 45 per cent, it is as low as 33 per cent in some areas due to the backlog of repairs needed to local authority houses?  In some cases these are major structural repairs and local authority tenants have been reluctant to enter into arrangements for the purchase of such houses.  Has the Minister any plans to introduce some form of appeal mechanism on the lines of that contained in the 1976 local authority tenant purchase scheme introduced by the then Minister, Mr. Jimmy Tully?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a very good response to this scheme, amounting to 40,655 out of a total of 91,000 tenants. Applications ranged from 100 per cent in one local authority area to 24 per cent in another.  There was a wide variation.  I recognise that some people may have been reluctant to purchase if they felt that their homes were not up to standard. It was intended that the local authority would estimate the market value of a particular house in its present condition. That allowed for the variations in prices being sought by the various authorities. If a person applied to buy a house on which repairs needed to be done, the price was reduced in lieu.  Had it been part of the scheme that the house would have had to be repaired to a certain standard before the purchase scheme could operate, the scheme would have been a nonsense and would not have worked. Many people have applied because of the terms of the scheme as it exists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that a sizeable proportion of applicants are in receipt of social welfare benefit and that many such tenants are unsure whether they will be deprived of formal sanction by the local authority under the scheme?  Has the Minister any plans to allow people in receipt of social welfare benefits to proceed with purchase?  Are there any restrictions in that regard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no restrictions.  I called together the housing officers from <Col N="1429" /> all the local authorities to set down precisely what was intended.  The fact that a person is in receipt of any kind of social welfare assistance does not deprive him or her of the opportunity to own a home. I would welcome them.  That is the reason there is such a big response.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask two questions. Is there to be a 1989 tenant purchase scheme?  Arising out of the response of various tenants to the 1988 scheme and the method of market valuation, is the Minister aware that anomalies have arisen whereby people who contracted under the 1986 scheme or earlier schemes find themselves buying houses at a rate far in excess of that being paid by their neighbours?  Is the Minister aware of those problems and of the discord being caused between neighbours? If so, has he any proposals to reduce the anomalies between this scheme and the older schemes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the Deputy's question is no.  Regarding his second question, I am aware that anomalies exist.  That was always a feature I did not like about the scheme but it was a once-off scheme and people were left under no illusions as to what it meant. This was a 1988 scheme and those who had agreed to purchase their homes under previous schemes could not transfer to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>At one level this matter is critical for local authorities but everyone in the House must be concerned about equity.  In my constituency people living literally next door to one another will be paying a difference of between £20 and £30 per week to local authorities.  In such cases will the Minister consider amending the housing scheme or recommending to the local authorities that at the end of the mortgage period five years will be taken up to provide some degree of equity?  In other words will he agree that while it is necessary to maintain cash flow at current levels for local authorities, equity could <Col N="1430" /> be achieved between new scheme purchasers and old scheme purchasers by means of a reduction in years?  Will he give consideration to that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>A whole variety of anomalies have been brought to my attention concerning this matter.  People who moved into their homes on 1 February want me to extend the scheme to that date.  People have also written to me saying they are deprived of the right to buy their homes because they did not move in until the middle of the year and so on.  Unfortunately, the scheme was a once off which terminated on 31 December last and I cannot alter it.  I note the Deputy's remarks about some of the difficulties involved but I cannot give any undertaking in relation to them.  People should not have an expectation that there will be any variation in regard to this matter because that is not the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The tenant purchase scheme was introduced in 1966 or thereabouts. Will the Minister accept that none of the previous tenant purchase schemes caused as much tension in terms of anomalies between previous and existing terms of purchase?  Having regard to the fact that the Minister introduced this market value based system and, therefore, must take some responsibility for some of the anomalies, will he give the House an indication that he will seriously look at various means which would have as their objective the equalisation of the purchase cost to different tenants&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>This is repetition; the Deputy has made his point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>This has been the most successful scheme since the first tenant purchase scheme was introduced years ago.  The indication is that many people want to avail of it, indeed it involved 45 per cent of the total stock.  It is well to remember that there is a huge imbalance between the question of management and maintenance costs.  In the last year for which we have figures &mdash; 1986 &mdash; the total cost was £71 million but the total <Col N="1431" /> rental income that year was just £39 million, a deficit of £32 million.  This scheme was designed to help local authorities in relation to their cash flow.  I am aware of the anomalies but I cannot do anything in so far as that scheme is concerned. However, the Deputy made a good point and I am listening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister expand a little on his statement that he is currently considering a scheme regarding flats?  Am I correct in thinking that it relates to the conditions under which existing applications should be dealt with?  The whole concept of the sale of flats was raised very late in 1988 and, in view of this, has the Minister any intention of extending the time to enable flat dwellers to purchase?  Will he agree that some facility should be extended in that regard in view of the fact that the conditions under which the sale might take place are still being considered by his Department?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>They only had nine weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I had representations concerning that matter and I accept that the scheme was introduced too late in the year.  A working party comprised of officials of the Department and local authorities was set up and when I have their report at the end of March I will see what I can do.  At present I am favourably considering having a special scheme that might cater for that situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>For flats?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  It is reasonable to say that I am favourably disposed to the scheme but I should like to get the report of the working party before I finally decide.  Perhaps the Deputy will pursue the matter at the end of March.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought I had allowed reasonable latitude in regard to these questions.  I will hear a brief supplementary from Deputy Sherlock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1432" />
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that managers of local authorities are at present in the process of asking people on social welfare or low incomes to discuss their repayments &mdash; in some instances people have not got decisions &mdash; is the Minister saying that, irrespective of a person's capacity to pay, their application to purchase should be agreed by the local authorities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>As long as the local authority concerned received the application before the end of December, then it is proper, valid and live and it is a matter then between the local authority and the applicant to work out what is best in the interests of both of them.  There is nothing barring someone on social welfare from participating in this scheme. Indeed I am encouraging it and I made that quite clear to the local authorities involved.  I should like everyone to have the opportunity of owning their own homes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I must call another question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>If people cannot&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously if the local authority are satisfied that people cannot make their repayments it is hardly in the interests of the individual to pursue an application.  However, circumstances can change and, if an application has been received, it does not have to be dealt with before 1 May.  It will take quite some time to deal with the 40,000 applications received.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment the reason former staff members of An Foras Forbartha, who are now working with the environmental research unit of his Department, have been asked to sign pledges under the Official Secrets Act; if this is normal practice; the total number of staff in his Department who have been asked to sign <Col N="1433" /> these pledges; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment the reason former employees of An Foras Forbartha who were transferred to the environmental research unit of his Department have been required to sign pledges of secrecy under the Official Secrets Act, when no such requirement was imposed upon them when employed by An Foras Forbartha.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to reply to Questions Nos. 6 and 45 together.</P>
      <P>Neither the staff of the environmental research unit nor the staff of my Department were required to sign pledges of secrecy under the Official Secrets Act, 1963.</P>
      <P>The Official Secrets Act, of course, applies to all persons and the staff of the unit were requested, on appointment, to acknowledge that they were aware that its provisions apply to them.  In common with civil servants generally, all staff of my Department, on appointment, have been asked to indicate that they have read and noted the relevant circular letter setting out the obligations on civil servants in relation to official secrecy and integrity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister saying that all members of his Department are required to sign a written acknowledgment confirming they are aware of the terms of the Act and indicating that they are subject to its provisions?  Will the Minister not agree that the staff of the new Environmental Research Unit were previously employed by An Foras Forbartha and were not subjected to such a requirement when they took up employment in that organisation?  This is a new departure and represents an effort by the Minister to curtail the amount of information available to the public on matters of obviously grave public importance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not true.  The staff of the Environmental Research Unit were not required to sign pledges of <Col N="1434" /> secrecy under the Act.  They were requested to acknowledge that the provisions of the Act applied to them in general.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the same thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>This is in line with the practice under which civil servants are made aware of their obligations in this regard.  I have a copy of the document here and the relevant sentence is: &ldquo;I am also aware that the provisions of the Official Secrets Act, 1963, will apply to me.&rdquo;  The Act applied in the very same way to those employed in An Foras Forbartha. There is absolutely no change in so far as that matter is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister clarify the situation in relation to a person now working for the ERU who is not an established civil servant?  Will he agree that previously members of the public had direct access to An Foras Forbartha in respect of environmental information?  Is he now saying that the same rights of access which the public enjoyed in relation to environmental information obtained through An Foras Forbartha now obtain in relation to access of information currently contained in the Environmental Research Unit?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The rights in relation to environmental information will be the same.  They will be entitled to published information.  In fact in the very near future I will be making an announcement which will please the Deputy very much on the availability to the public of information in the ERU.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore the position will remain the same.  Why then did the Minister bother&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the extreme urgency attaching to this matter?  Residents in the first smoke-free zone are now installing various appliances.  These residents must have work completed by 31 May if they are not to be subject to fines of £1,000. Therefore, it is very important that they know if the full burning fire is effective. I am sure the Minister would agree that it would be of little use for them to know that it is not effective after they have installed it.  Could the Minister say specifically when the results will be published? Could he also let us know what brief he gave to Eolas on the testing of this fire?  Did he make any reference in that brief to the ignition period of the full burning fire and the need to test it adequately?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that there is some urgency attaching to this matter.  We have been pressing that the Eolas work programme be concluded as soon as possible, as long as it is done efficiently and properly.  We expect it in early March and I think the Deputy will agree that will give us sufficient time to deal with the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were three objectives in so far as the test programme was concerned. One was to carry out smoke emissions testing of appropriate fuels and appliances for use in domestic heating in the Dublin area and to identify the maximum smoke emission that can be allowed from burning solid fuels in the Dublin area if acceptable air standards are to be met, and to make recommendations on the criteria which authorised applicances and fuels must comply with if the required reductions in smoke levels are to be achieved.  Also there is <Col N="1442" /> under way in the UK some testing of the applicance the Deputy mentioned and it is being tested in all its various modes of operation.  The important thing is that any appliance would not only be under rigorous testing but that would apply to all the modes of burning attached to it so that we can get first class and proper results that we can apply to the other areas.  I accept there is an urgency attached to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for impressing the urgency on Eolas. Does he expect in the results he will get from Eolas that smoke levels for the first hour could be exceptionally high and then very low for the remainder of the period? Is the smoke emission to be evaluated over a 24 hour period or over an hour by hour period?  Does the Minister understand what I mean?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy understands exactly what the testing is about to achieve and we are going to deal with all the modes of burning from the very start up when obviously it will be much smokier than when at full burning capacity.  All the various modes are going to be tested under the new arrangement and we will have the results of the lot, which should be satisfactory from the Deputy's point of view and from ours.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Last October, the Government decided that the blueprint for road development prepared by my Department should be used as the basis for the case for EC aid for roads.  The relevant EC regulations were adopted on 19 December 1988 and my Department are now preparing an operational plan for national roads, based on the blueprint, which I intend to submit to the EC before the end of March.  This will tie in with the Government's national plan.  As the <Col N="1443" /> Taoiseach indicated to the House last week, I intend to publish the blueprint by next June, taking into account the views of the EC Commission in the meantime.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister acknowledge that the National Roads Authority were requested to make urgent submissions to him on the draft blueprint in the summer and that such submissions were made in September?  Could he indicate the reason for not publishing the blueprint in October, even as a draft blueprint, so that there could be some public discussion and some debate in this House on the priorities identified in the blueprint prior to any submission being made to Brussels for Structural Funds?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The National Roads Authority certainly made their submission last year and it dealt with the question of the blueprint and all the matters related to roads in some detail.  Discussions continued then with the Department and we had a satisfactory conclusion to the discussions between the National Roads Authority and the Department.</P>
      <P>It is not right to publish the blueprint until the operational plan is in place for the possible drawing down of the intervention rates against the road plan.  Once we submit that to Brussels before the end of March as part of the national plan, we will have the indication from Brussels as to the approval and the money terms involved.  It will be proper then to put it into a proper plan so that it will be published as soon as that information is totally correlated.</P>

Why should this blueprint remain a national official secret pending the plan going to Brussels and the officials in Brussels considering the validity of the plan put to them?

      <P>Would the Minister not recognise that his failure to publish a draft plan is having serious implications for investment decisions around the country by various people with respect to their own plans and that, notwithstanding any decision Brussels may take in relation to the availability of Structural Funds, he has an obligation to publish what is a long-term plan which in the nature of things is going to be subject to variations? Could he not indicate to the House that he is prepared, on principle, notwithstanding what comes out of Brussels, to publish the plan to facilitate not just debate in this House but a series of related investment decisions up and down the country?</P>

      <P>In November last, I provided a sanitary services grant of £100,000 to Cork Corporation for the urgent repair of a culvert at South Mall/Pembroke Street.  This scheme was included in the corporation's report on the flooding.  Further flood relief schemes for Cork will be considered for approval when planning of the schemes is completed and incorporated into the sanitary services capital programme as appropriate.  I understand that the only effective long term solution to flooding in the catchment areas of the Lee and Blackwater would be arterial drainage schemes.

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13, 15, 25 and 38 together.</P>
      <P>The estimated total volume of waste coming within the EC definition of toxic and dangerous waste which was produced in this country in 1985, the latest year for which such information is available in my Department, is 52,000 tonnes.  Of this total, 66 per cent was disposed of by the producers at their own sites or treatment facilities, a further 6 per cent was disposed of by landfill and the remainder was exported for disposal overseas.  Most of the exports go to the United Kingdom but small quantities are shipped to France and Finland.</P>
      <P>As regards the various categories of waste, I would refer the Deputies to a report on Waste Disposal in Ireland which was published by An Foras Forbartha and copies of which are in the Library.</P>
      <P>To assist in considering the development of facilities for the disposal of toxic waste, I commissioned Byrne O Cleirigh Engineering to undertake a feasibility study into the need for and commercial viability of contract incineration facilities here.  The study has now been completed and the findings have been considered by the Government.  The cost of the study was £30,000, plus VAT and approved vouched expenses.</P>
      <P>The study concludes that there is no immediate threat to overseas incineration outlets for Irish hazardous wastes but that they could be at risk in the medium to longer term due to a variety of factors.  The study finds that demand on a central incineration facility would be unlikely to go higher than 5,000 tonnes per annum in the medium term and estimates that the capital costs of such a facility would be in the £6 million to £8 million range.  In addition, the consultants made recommendations about possible legal and organisational arrangements, including the role of the Government and public authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am anxious that this country should <Col N="1451" /> achieve the maximum degree of self- sufficiency in hazardous waste disposal as soon as possible.  However, the provision of a satisfactory national incineration capability is dependant on effective inter-locking of a range of factors and circumstances, serveral of which need to be examined further.  This process is under-way. I intend also that copies of the consultants' report will be made available to interests concerned and I will be inviting them to develop proposals for the provision of suitable incineration facilities.  I should make it clear, however that the Government do not intend to become involved in the provision of such facilities, either directly or on a joint venture basis.</P>
    <P>I have arranged for copies of the consultants report to be placed in the Library.  A shorter version of the report, outlining the main conclusions and recommendations, is being made available for general information.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that EC regulations will within a relatively short period prohibit the transhipment of toxic waste and that that will render even more urgent the need for such a facility here?  Will the Minister accept that there is considerable environmental concern about the dumping of dangerous toxic wastes off our coast and that that is another reason why it is necessary to have a domestic facility here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>There is always concern about the matters raised by the Deputy, and I share them.  From the information available to me there is no danger in the immediate future that we will be denied facilities for incineration of certain types of wastes abroad.  That does not seem to be on at the moment but from my experience at environmental council meetings over the last year or two I can see that there is an indication that countries will be asked to dispose of their own waste.  It was for that reason that I took the initiative to find out how much waste we have, the type of waste and where it is going to.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that there is a number of inter-related problems here?  One problem is that we do not know precisely where this waste is going?  Would he agree that perhaps a solution would be that every local authority be given increased monitoring powers within their areas as to who is producing such waste and what happens it?  Furthermore, would he agree that the incinerator constitutes the perfect answer but that, in the meantime, what we want to ensure is a Government controlled central collecting point for all of this toxic waste with the Government assuming responsibility as to whether it is exported or disposed of here?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>In all the circumstances, I do not think the last action referred to by the Deputy is necessary.  I agree that some waste here is disposed of in a manner which is not acceptable to me, the Government or the House.  There was an instance of that within the last few days; I accept that.  It was with a view to endeavouring to devise a better arrangement &mdash; which I am pleased to hear Deputy Barry accept as being reasonable &mdash; so that we would be in a position to deal with our own waste in our own time that I commissioned the feasibility study.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I do not accept that. Under the Electoral (Amendment) Act, 1986 we introduced a system of home-voting for disabled electors and also enabled certain civil servants and their spouses, resident abroad for the purpose of their duties, to be registered as electors to vote by post.  I would have to bring the Deputy back to the circumstances of the open-ended postal voting system that applied in local elections in 1974 and again in 1985.  My predecessor did not put a tooth in it, in so far as he was concerned, about the abuses that took place under those two systems.  I am certainly not going to get involved in setting up a voting system within which we could not ensure reasonable security.</P>

      <P>My question deals with the right to vote.  I am very interested in getting a straight answer from the Minister as to whether he accepts that Ireland is out of step with the thinking within the Community in not accepting the right of emigrants to vote. That right is facilitated, for example, by Italy, Spain and a number of other countries. Why are we holding to this position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>We are holding to the position because it is necessary to protect the secrecy of the ballot.  I might refer the Deputy to the circumstances of the Draper case which were pronounced upon by the Supreme Court.  Indeed I might quote from that decision as follows:</P>
      <P>In making this regulating law and in taking the other necessary steps the State must act reasonably and, having regard to the requirements of secrecy in the ballot and the dangers of intimidation and other electoral abuses, might strike a balance which will serve the common good.</P>

    <Title>Building Societies Bill, 1988: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn) Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That building societies are always newsworthy is no surprise considering the important role they have come to play in modern life.  Building societies impinge on the lives of hundreds of thousands of people through the savings and lending services they provide.  In the past ten years more than six out of every ten persons who financed the purchase of their own houses have done so by means of a loan from a building society.  Membership of societies is now about 1.25 million while the total assets of societies are in excess of £3.5 billion.  They hold almost 20 per cent of the total accumulated savings of the community.</P>
      <P>Building societies &mdash; a concept imported from England in the 19th century &mdash; had in the earlier years only a limited role in providing housing for various vocational groups.  In 1922 there were 23 societies in the State with total assets of little more than £500,000: by 1941 their assets were at £1.5 million. Since then there has been a constant acceleration in growth.  By 1961 their assets had increased to £19 million and had nearly doubled again by 1965 to £36 million.  At the time of the last comprehensive piece of legislation in 1976 total assets amounted to £350 million, scarcely one-tenth of what they are today.  While total assets were growing the number of societies has declined &mdash; from 17 in 1960 to ten now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Clearly, building societies have grown in tandem with the rapid increase in the rate of home ownership and I think that the existence of a thriving building society <Col N="1530" /> movement has been one of the major factors that have contributed to the fact that we have one of the highest owner-occupation rates in Europe.  The present scale of operation of societies is a measure of the confidence which the investing public and house purchasers have come to place in them.</P>
    <P>That is the success story of societies in historical terms.  However, when I came into the Department of the Environment in the spring of 1987 I found the building societies in a state of considerable uncertainty. The dismal position of the national economy had driven up the mortgage rate by 3 percentage points at the end of 1986. Other countries where building societies are to be found had been modernising their legislation.  At that time societies were feeling the effects of the termination of the beneficial composite tax rate on investments on the introduction of the DIRT tax.  Finally, the banks were for the first time offering aggressive competition in a contracting mortgage market.  In the circumstances the anxiety felt by societies was understandable. Since then other challenges have loomed much larger &mdash; the continuing and rapid changes in the financial services sector, new technology, the imminence of competition from abroad under the EC internal market.</P>
    <P>One of my first decisions as Minister was to set up a working party in which the Government with the Central Bank and the Registrar of Building Societies would review, in consultation with the societies, the shape of the new legislation which was so obviously necessary.  This Bill is the culmination of that process and I am pleased I have been able to bring it before the House in what is, by the standards of large Bills, a relatively short time.  There is, in my view, a need to remove the present anachronistic legal restrictions on societies by having this Bill passed into law within the shortest time possible.</P>
    <P>The fact that societies in the past thrived in a segmented financial system that is now undergoing radical change is no guarantee that they would survive in the new milieu.  Indeed, it is difficult to see <Col N="1531" /> how any participant in the very competitive financial arena could fight successfully in the straitjacket now worn by societies.  It is to the credit of the societies that they are already responding so positively but they must be allowed to compete more effectively and that is what this Bill is all about.  They must contribute to the changing structure of our financial system, and indeed be part of that change.  The extra dimension which the societies will bring to competition in financial and property services will have benefits all round &mdash; in terms of quality of service, price and efficiency.  Societies have considerable financial and human resources and they should, I believe, be given the opportunity to utilise these resources effectively not alone for the good of the societies themselves but also for the benefit of the country generally. There is, I believe, scope for societies to become involved in a broader and more direct way in the housing market and in the provision of services associated with it.  I have in mind here the provision of rental housing and involvement with the voluntary housing movement, for example.</P>
    <P>Developments abroad, particularly in the EC make it imperative that all sectors of the Irish financial services industry be in a position not alone to defend their home markets but also to avail of opportunities that will arise with the inter-nationalisation of financial services.  A basic prerequisite for the development of societies to deal with these changes is a modern legislative code.</P>
    <P>Therefore, this legislation is of necessity liberal in nature.  It sets very few boundaries to the future role and scope of societies.  The main constraint will be their own capacity to broaden and intensify their business without prejudicing the funds of their investors.  A Bill which imposed absolute statutory limits on the pace or scope of future diversification could become outdated very quickly because of the unpredictable nature of future developments.  The legal framework set up by the Bill will, I hope, be <Col N="1532" /> broad and flexible enough to last for some considerable time.</P>
    <P>Before outlining the main features of the Bill it might be helpful if I indicated the broad objectives I set myself in preparing the Bill. They were, first, to allow societies to compete and develop in the context of the internal market by offering new services and broadening the scope of their business.  Secondly, to establish a modern and effective supervisory regime for societies.  Thirdly, to improve the statutory provisions governing the running of societies, their accounts and audit.  Fourthly, to put societies on the same footing as banks in regard to savings protection.  Fifthly, to encourage societies to broaden the extent of their involvement in housing and, sixthly, to provide a satisfactory mechanism for conversion to company status.</P>
    <P>Given the reasons why the new legislation is necessary and the objectives I had before me in preparing it, it will be clear that another Bill amending an outdated code was not the approach to adopt.  Accordingly, the Bill now before you is large and comprehensive.  It is a thorough modernisation of the law relating to building societies and takes into account current proposals in company and banking legislation.</P>
    <P>As the explanatory memorandum circulated with the Bill is comprehensive I do not propose to give a blow-by-blow account of the contents of the Bill.  I will, instead, try to give a general overview of the main provisions of each of the 13 parts with particular reference to those areas that are of major importance or where noteworthy changes are proposed.</P>
    <P>Part I contains the usual general provisions. Having regard to the need for consistency in the legislation governing companies, banks, and building societies, section 5 will allow for the extension to societies by ministerial regulation of relevant changes which the Oireachtas makes in company and banking legislation in the future.  Section 6, which repeals existing building society legislation, makes particular provision continuing in force, for existing and future <Col N="1533" /> housing loans, those parts of the Building Societies Regulations, 1987, relating to property insurance, valuation reports, legal fees, mortgage protection and redemption fees.  Borrowers, therefore, will continue to have the freedom to choose their own insurance company, obtain a copy of the valuation report and so on.  Redemption fees will not be chargeable on variable interest rate loans but I do not propose to ban redemption fees in respect of fixed interest rate loans as such a ban militates strongly against the making of such loans.  The other parts of the 1987 regulations relating to unsecured lending and the appointment of directors are superseded by other provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Part II deals with the definition and constitution of a building society, its formation, registration and authorisation to raise funds from the public.  In addition to a set of rules, a society will also be required to have a memorandum setting out its objects and powers in much the same way as a company.  Section 9 states that the objects must be within the scope of the activities permitted under the Bill but expressly requires that every society must have as an object the making of housing loans.  Details of the matters to be covered by the memorandum and the rules are contained in the Second Schedule which may be amended by the Central Bank by regulation should this become necessary in the future.</P>
    <P>The concept of authorisation is new in so far as societies are concerned.  At present a society cannot advertise for funds without a specific approval from the registrar.  Under the new arrangements a society will be required to obtain an authorisation from the Central Bank before it can raise or solicit funds other than its founding capital.  The Central Bank will be able to impose whatever conditions it considers necessary on an authorisation which will, in fact, correspond to a banking licence.  The approach proposed brings the procedure for authorising societies to raise funds into line with the requirements of the first EC Banking Directive.  Existing societies that have permission to advertise for <Col N="1534" /> funds will be deemed to have an authorisation and whatever restrictions or conditions the registrar has imposed on a society in relation to the permission will become conditions on its authorisation. The Central Bank will have power to impose conditions on an existing authorisation and these conditions may be of an extensive nature including, if necessary, the removal of a director or other officer.</P>
    <P>Part III sets out the powers of building societies.  As well as restating existing powers, it contains extensive and important new powers which, I believe, will enable societies to compete much more effectively in the marketplace, to offer a better service to their members, to the house purchaser and to the general public.  These new powers, prudently undertaken, will enable societies to develop and thrive in the rapidly changing financial services sector and thus to continue to be a major source of funds for housing by providing mortgage loans and by direct investment in residential development.</P>
    <P>Prudence by societies in responding to the opportunities created by the Bill is paramount.  This means that diversification must be within the context of properly structured strategic plans, that costing and other implications have been fully considered and they have the human and financial resources to do it successfully. The new powers which societies will have can be considered under five broad headings.</P>
    <P>First, secured and unsecured lending. The lending powers of societies are set out in sections 22 and 23.  In addition to the traditional lending secured by mortgage of land, societies will be able to offer loans on second mortgage, bridging loans, loans for payment of a deposit for the purchase of property, loans backed by other securities or guarantees as may be approved by the Central Bank, unsecured loans to individuals for house improvement, unsecured loans and overdrafts for general purposes.  However, the amounts of individual unsecured loans will be subject to specific Central Bank limits.  These provisions will also <Col N="1535" /> allow societies to offer more flexible types of house purchase mortgages such as low start, index linked and equity type mortgages.</P>
    <P>Secondly, development of land and property.  The direct involvement of societies in the development of land for residential and other commercial purposes is a logical extension of the traditional business of societies, namely, the provision of loan finance for such development.  The new power to own and develop land will, I hope, be the basis for a new departure on the part of building societies in the housing sector.  They will be able to invest directly in the provision of housing for sale or rent and I would hope to see them make a contribution to the urban renewal programme by becoming involved in mixed developments.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, equity investment in subsidiary and other associated bodies. Section 28 will enable building societies to set up subsidiary companies or to take a stake in the equity of another company. It will probably transpire that the best way to provide some of the new services or to undertake some of the new activities that will be available to societies will be by the establishment of subsidiaries or involvement in joint ventures.  The option to establish subsidiaries also offers the prospect of a means of raising some of the capital necessary to get involved in new activities.  It should be noted, however, that the power to invest in companies is generally limited to companies whose objects do not allow them to engage in activities outside the powers of the society itself or to control further subsidiaries but the Central Bank may permit exceptions to this.</P>
    <P>The setting up of subsidiaries cannot be regarded as a way of sidestepping prudential requirements or limitations upon the powers of societies themselves.  The provisions of sections 118 and 119 of the Companies (No. 2) Bill, 1987, regarding the power of the court to require a holding company to contribute to the debts of a subsidiary will also of course apply, when enacted, to building societies. Section 28 will also permit societies to <Col N="1536" /> link up with and assist voluntary housing bodies.</P>
    <P>Fourthly, financial services.  Under section 29 societies will be able to offer a wide range of financial services to members and other persons.  Financial services have of necessity been defined broadly and flexibly in view of the continually changing nature of these services. However, the provision of any of the services listed in section 29 will be subject to the terms of the Central Bank approval and any other legislation that governs the activity in question.  Lending services are excluded from section 29 since these are covered by the other provisions referred to earlier.</P>
    <P>Fifthly, services relating to land.  Part III also contains a number of provisions which will allow societies to provide a range of services relating to the acquisition, development and disposal of land. Again, this is a natural progression from the existing powers of societies based on their long experience in the housing sector.  Section 31 will enable them to provide conveyancing services subject to regulations to be made by the Minister for Justice.  Section 32 will enable them to provide auctioneering and other services relating to property such as valuation, surveying and management.  Societies will thus be able to offer a package of services to the house buyer.  The resulting increase in competition holds out the prospect of greater choice and lower prices for the consumer.  However, I also recognise the potential for conflicts of interest in these areas and the need to prevent societies from taking undue advantage of their position in the housing market.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains a number of provisions aimed at avoiding these problems. In the case of conveyancing services, the provision of such services to both the vendor and purchaser of the same property is prohibited, thus removing the greatest potential source of conflict of interest.  The regulations which have to be made before societies can offer conveyancing services will be able to make further provision in relation to conflicts of interest, compensation for negligence, <Col N="1537" /> qualifications of persons providing the services and so forth.  Similar regulations can be made in relation to other property-related services if this is shown to be necessary.  In addition, I have included provisions to ensure that societies do not engage in anti-competitive pricing, in the provision of conveyancing and auctioneering services.  A society is also prohibited from requiring anyone getting a housing loan from it to use other services provided by the society or its subsidiaries.</P>
    <P>Provision is also made in Part III for a number of other important matters.  The requirements on societies in relation to the valuation and assessment of freehold and leasehold estate or interest as a security have been strengthened and will contribute to ensuring that conflicts of interest do not arise in cases where a society also provides auctioneering or valuation services.</P>
    <P>Section 18 contains a very wide power for societies to raise funds in Irish or in foreign currencies.  In addition to the traditional retail funding in which, incidentally, societies have been finding it increasingly difficult to maintain their share of the savings market, I expect that they will in the future also be looking to the wholesale market where they will be able to use their mortgages as collateral or even sell them off.  However, there is a power for the Minister to regulate the securitisation of mortgages because of the consumer protection issues involved. For reasons relating to their mutual status and to the supply and cost of mortgages, societies will be required to maintain at least half of their total funding liabilities in the form of shares issued to members.</P>
    <P>Provision is also made to allow societies to operate abroad.  Even with this power a building society incorporated and authorised in Ireland could not at present operate in, for example, the UK on the same basis as a UK society nor could it set up a subsidiary to take deposits in the UK without authorisation from the Bank of England.  However, with the implementation of the proposed EC Second Banking and Mortgage Credit Directives all this will change and an Irish building society will be able to <Col N="1538" /> operate throughout the Community under the supervision of its home supervisor, namely, the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>In referring to the range of new powers that will be available to societies, I would draw special attention to section 36 which imposes important disciplines in relation to the exercise of these powers.  Basically, all powers other than secured lending must be adopted by special resolution and must have Central Bank approval. We must bear in mind that the diversification by societies into these new activities will involve new and different kinds of risks and raise prudential issues. Accordingly, the Central Bank will have wide powers to control the involvement of societies in the provision of new services and to impose whatever conditions and requirements it considers appropriate. Also, provision is made to allow the Central Bank to restrict exercise of certain powers to specified categories of societies.</P>
    <P>While on Part III, I would like to refer in particular to section 24, since the question of tiered interest rates has been the subject of some comment &mdash; not to say misunderstanding &mdash; since the Bill was published.  The 1986 Act banned both the introduction of tiered rates on existing loans and the charging of tiered rates on future loans.  Although designed to stop the charging of a higher rate on larger loans, in effect it means that building societies must charge the same interest rate on all loans of the same type.  What is the point of that when the interest rate as such is not controlled and a society can simply overcome it by putting up their rates across the board?  It certainly could not have been designed to help the small borrower or the first time purchaser. Whatever justification there may have been for it in 1986 there is none for continuing the ban on future loans having regard to the substantial changes in the market conditions since then and to the whole thrust of this Bill which is to allow societies to compete on an equal basis.</P>
    <P>The fact that householders are now enjoying the lowest mortgage rate in 20 years has nothing whatsoever to do with the ban on tiered rates.  It is due to market <Col N="1539" /> forces operating in the context of the Government's macro-economic policies. In our system interest rates will always be determined by market forces and artificial interventions of this type ultimately act to the detriment of a good mortgage market that serves to meet the need of the various types of borrower. Indeed, as if to prove this, competition over the past year or more has enabled many borrowers who had been legally liable for tiered rates pre-dating the 1986 Act to renegotiate lower rates on their mortgages.  That said, section 24 contains important safeguards to ensure that existing loans are not affected by the removal of the ban and that future borrowers are not misled in any way.  The mortgage rate on existing or future loans cannot be tired retrospectively.</P>
    <P>Part IV contains the general provisions relating to the control and prudential supervision of building societies by the Central Bank.  The statement of the Bank's general duty in regard to societies contained in section 37 makes it clear that the guiding purpose of the Bank in operating the supervisory system set up under the Bill is the maintenance of the good financial health of societies.  Of course, this in no sense detracts from the inescapable responsibility of the directors to ensure that the affairs of each society are conducted in a manner calculated to maintain its financial stability and the protection of funds entrusted to it.  The powers which the Bank will have are similar to those it already has or will have under the Central Bank Bill in relation to banks.  In summary, the Central Bank will be able to</P>
    <P>(a)  require societies to maintain specified prudential rates;</P>
    <P>(b)  impose requirements relating to the structure and composition of liabilities and assets &mdash; for example liquidity requirements;</P>
    <P>(c)  revoke a society's authorisation in certain serious circumstances; and</P>
    <P>(d)  to give a direction to a society <Col N="1540" /> to suspend for a specified period raising funds or making payments.</P>
    <P>The powers which the Central Bank will have in relation to a society's authorisation, that is, the power to impose conditions, to give a direction to a society to cease raising funds and to revoke an authorisation are central to the enforcement of the Bank's supervisory functions. Section 40 lays down in considerable detail the circumstances in which the Central Bank may either revoke an authorisation or suspend operations.  The Central Bank will also have wide powers to carry out inspection of a society's books and records, to obtain information relating to the activities of the society, to control the form and content of advertising by societies, and to call a special meeting to mount a formal investigation of a society's affairs.  The Bank will also have the power, should it consider it necessary to use it, to seek a High Court Order to secure compliance with certain requirements.  On the other hand, the Bill contains important safeguards by way of procedural requirements and ultimately appeal to the courts in regard to the exercise by the Bank of its powers.</P>
    <P>It will be obvious, therefore, that the powers available to the Central Bank will be more extensive and flexible than those currently available to the registrar.  This strengthening of supervisory powers is a necessary aspect of modernisation of the legislation, is a necessary concomitant of the broadening of the scope of societies and will bring about a substantial degree of uniformity in supervisory systems.  All in all, I am confident that the Bill will provide the basis for an effective system of supervision that will be sympathetic to the developments needed by the societies.</P>
    <P>Here I would like to place on record my appreciation of the valuable work done by the present and previous registrars of building societies.  They have discharged their statutory duties fairly and efficiently and the ultimate tribute to them is to say that no investor lost money in an ordinary building society since the foundation of the State.  It is no reflection <Col N="1541" /> on the registrar's office that responsibility for the control and supervision of societies is being transferred to the Central Bank.  As I have indicated, the transfer is being made for positive reasons and the registrar, I am sure, will be glad of the opportunity to redirect resources to the supervision of the many other varied organisations for which his office has responsibility.</P>
    <P>Section 38 is a new provision which recognises the special importance of ensuring an adequate supply of mortgage finance for house purchase and improvement. It would be my intention under this section to regularly monitor the supply of and demand for mortgage finance in consultation with the Minister for Finance and to communicate the position to the Central Bank so that any impending shortage of funds would be anticipated and appropriate preventative action considered. It should be noted that we are talking here about the supply of mortgage finance from all sources, not just building societies.</P>
    <P>Turning to the question of the running of societies generally, I have tried to strike the right balance between the role and responsibilities of directors and of the members.  Boards of directors are responsible for the overall direction of the society and supervision of its day-to-day management and, as such, have a legitimate interest in the composition of the board so as to ensure that it will be capable of shouldering its responsibilities in a united fashion but in the final analysis it is the members who elect the directors and to whom the directors must account for their stewardship.  Members therefore must be kept fully informed of major developments affecting the society, and members who have a commitment to the society must have a fair chance of putting forward a candidate for election as a director.  Basically it is vital that societies should be seen to be run in the interests of their members.</P>
    <P>Part V deals with the way societies are directed and managed.  It requires every society to have a broad of directors elected by the members, a chief executive and secretary.  It contains a number of <Col N="1542" /> changes in existing legislative provisions and substantial new provisions relating to the election and conduct of directors.  The provisions as drafted will, together with those in Part VI, enhance the confidence of members in the manner in which directors are elected and subsequently conduct themselves as directors.</P>
    <P>Sections 50 and 51 contain extensive provisions in relation to the appointment of directors.  In fact, building society law contained no particular provisions regarding the election of directors until regulations were made under the 1986 Act prescribing certain requirements in relation to the eligibility and nomination of candidates, the circulation of an election address and retirement of directors. By and large, these provisions have been retained in the present Bill but with certain changes.  The effect of these changes is that a society may (a) increase the maximum shareholding that may be required to nominate or join in nominating a candidate for election as a director from £10 to £250; and (b) increase the maximum number of qualified members that may be required to nominate a candidate for election as a director from ten to 20.</P>
    <P>The new limits will allow societies to require candidates to demonstrate a reasonable level of support and those nominating them to have a reasonable commitment to the society.  The special provisions regarding directors or candidates over 70 years of age are dropped because they appear to me to be discriminatory as they have no parallel in any other corporate legislation.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, there are important new provisions designed to enhance public confidence in the electoral process. Firstly, a poll must be held on a contested election.  Secondly, societies will in future have to appoint an independent person to supervise the conduct of elections and to report to the Central Bank on the conduct of the election stating whether in his opinion the election was conducted in accordance with statutory requirements and otherwise with fairness and integrity.  Thirdly, canvassing by employees at their place of employment <Col N="1543" /> or at a meeting of the society will be prohibited.  The Central Bank will also be able, if they consider necessary on the basis of the report from the person who supervised an election, to apply to the High Court for an order setting aside an election.</P>
    <P>Sections 52 to 59 contain provisions on dealings between a society and its directors and correspond, with appropriate modifications, to those in Part III of the Companies (No. 2) Bill, 1987, as they apply to banks.  They are designed to ensure that an unscrupulous director does not divert societies' assets for his own personal gain.  The approach adopted is (a) to prohibit certain dealings between the society and a director or a person connected with him; (b) to require disclosure of all significant dealings between the society and a director or a person connected with him; and (c) to provide for civil liability and penalties in respect of dealings that contravene the requirements of the Bill.</P>
    <P>In addition section 60 requires societies to maintain and make available for inspection a record of the amount of business being given by the society to any company or firm which has as a director or partner a director of the society. Although there is no corresponding provision in the Companies Bill, in my view such a provision is appropriate in the case of building societies.</P>
    <P>Apart from the fact that these types of provisions should be the same in general terms as those which apply to companies, they are also particularly necessary in the case of large mutual organisations like building societies, where the accountability of directors to members is in practice much more diffuse than in the case of companies.</P>
    <P>Section 64 deals with the disqualification of persons to be directors, officers or auditors of societies and generally parallels and complements the disqualification provisions in the Companies Bill.</P>
    <P>Part VI pertains to meetings, resolutions and voting.  Section 69 increases <Col N="1544" /> from £10 to £100 the maximum shareholding that can be required of a member to vote on a resolution or an election. The £10 requirement has become quite meaningless in terms of today's money values.  Although the societies would like to see a higher figure, I think the figure of £100 proposed represents a minimum level of commitment to a society which merits enfranchisement.  The section also makes it clear that in a special resolution or a resolution for the conversion of a society into a company each qualified member has one vote.  This is in line with the court's interpretation of existing legislation.  A special resolution may only be proposed in relation to certain major decisions such as changes in the memorandum or rules, the adoption of new powers and mergers.</P>
    <P>Section 72 contains some new provisions to enhance public confidence in the voting procedures of societies.  A society is required to issue one proxy form with the notice of a meeting but is prohibited from issuing further forms except at the written request of a member, and also to retain such forms and requests for a year to facilitate discovery by a court.</P>
    <P>Section 74 gives any 25 voting members of a society the right to put forward a resolution on any aspect of the affairs of a society, except a conversion resolution. Subsection (9) of that section accommodates the unique position of the ICS Building Society which was recognised in the 1976 Act and reflects the agreement of August 1984 with the previous Government.  In fact, under this Bill the ICS will be brought more into line with the generality of societies than heretofore.</P>
    <P>Section 75 is, in my view, a desirable new provision which will ensure that societies have the option of deciding issues by postal ballot rather than by voting at meetings.</P>
    <P>It is important that the law protects the rights of the ordinary members of building societies as mutual bodies and gives them a democratic say in the running of affairs.  At the same time societies, as major financial institutions <Col N="1545" /> depending for their survival on public confidence, must not be made prey to irresponsible elements who have no real stake in the society.  The difficult task facing us was to strike a balance between these two interests.  I think that balance has been struck in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Part VII contains provisions relating to the accounts and audit of societies and substantially updates existing provisions in these areas.  It is very important that societies observe the best modern practice in keeping accounting records and publishing annual accounts.  The provisions on these matters and relating to auditors in building society legislation have traditionally been based on similar provision in companies legislation and accordingly the provisions on accounting records, the appointment and removal of auditors, the rights of auditors and the auditors' report are based on similar provisions in the Companies (No. 2) Bill, 1987.</P>
    <P>There are, however, additional provisions in this Bill: (a) it requires societies to have a proper system of control of their business and to have an internal reporting system to the board of directors; (b) it requires the preparation of a layman's summary financial statement for issue to members; (c) it gives the Central Bank power to veto the appointment of an auditor as is also proposed in the Central Bank Bill for banks; (d) it imposes special duties on auditors to report certain serious matters or to supply specified information to the Central Bank over the head of the society, as is proposed for auditors of insurance companies and banks; and (e) it requires that auditors be reappointed at every annual general meeting and does not provide for automatic reappointment.</P>
    <P>I would make no apology for insisting that societies have proper systems of internal control and that auditors alert or assist the supervisor if something goes wrong.  After all, no reasonable measure designed to protect the security of the public's savings should be omitted.</P>
    <P>Part VIII contains a re-enactment of the existing provisions in relation to the settlement of disputes between the <Col N="1546" /> society and a member under the rules.  It also provides that the Minister for the Environment may make regulations requiring societies to set up, either individually or jointly, a scheme for the investigation and determination of complaints by customers in relation to the services provided by societies.  This type of &ldquo;ombudsman&rdquo; arrangement would apply to consumer complaints in relation to services provided by societies and not to disputes between a society and its members under the rules.  However, such disputes if covered by the terms of the complaints scheme, could, with the agreement of the parties concerned, be dealt with under the complaints scheme. It is my hope that societies will come together to set up a voluntary arrangement for dealing with complaints.  While I am not aware of any existing similar schemes in the financial services area in this country I think it would be another feather in the collective cap of societies if they took the initiative in this area.  If the societies succeed in setting up their own scheme and if I am satisfied that it constitutes a satisfactory arrangement I will be quite happy to forego the regulation-making power in favour of the voluntary arrangements.</P>
    <P>Part IX provides for the extension to savings held in building societies &mdash; whether as shares or deposits &mdash; of the scheme proposed in the Central Bank Bill for the protection of deposits with banks.  The trend internationally is towards the establishment of some form of protection for smaller deposits taken by financial institutions &mdash; and the EC has already issued a non-binding recommendation in this regard.  While societies have a very good track record in so far as the safety of funds entrusted to them is concerned, I think the arrangement now proposed is an opportunity to further enhance the confidence of small savers in our financial institutions and to put societies and banks on the same footing in this important area.  The contribution of societies to the protection account in the Central Bank is set at 0.2 per cent of Irish pound shares and deposits, which will mean that societies collectively will <Col N="1547" /> have to maintain a deposit of something in the region of £7 million with the Central Bank as their contribution to the fund.  This compares with £4.5 million currently maintained by societies under the 1976 Act.  It should be noted that this is a once off deposit which will earn interest for the societies.  Societies will only have to make further contributions in line with the growth in their shares and deposits or in the event of a payout from the fund.</P>
    <P>Part X is essentially a re-enactment of similar provisions in the 1976 Act relating to the amalgamation of societies and the transfer of engagements between societies. The opportunity has been taken to clarify the process by which societies can amalgamate or transfer engagements.  It is important that societies have a clear and well defined mechanism for effecting amalgamations and transfers particularly at a time when future developments in the financial area may give rise to some rationalisation of our existing building society configuration.  By permitting the Central Bank to consent in certain circumstances to an amalgamation or transfer without having to go through the procedure of a general meeting, the Bill facilitates a quick rescue should such ever be necessary.  Any proposed payment of compensation to directors or bonuses to members on foot of an amalgamation or transfer must be disclosed to the members or, as the case may be, must be acceptable to the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>Part XI, which will enable building societies to change their corporate status and convert themselves into public limited companies, is a provision totally new to Irish building society legislation, but one that is now recognised in recent legislation in other countries where building societies are to be found &mdash; the UK, Australia and New Zealand.  One could adduce arguments for and against conversion but in view of the changing nature of the financial industry and the impossibility of predicting its future shape, I think it would be inadvisable to exclude the conversion option from major new forward looking legislation like this. <Col N="1548" /> However, as demutualisation would be a quite fundamental change in the nature of a society, it is important that the law should lay down certain safeguards to ensure that the decision is taken after due consideration of all the implications by all those concerned.  Accordingly, the conversion process laid down in the Bill is as follows: first, the society must consult with the Central Bank; secondly, the board of directors must draw up a conversion scheme as the actual instrument of conversion; thirdly, the society must pass a &ldquo;conversion resolution&rdquo;; fourthly, it must obtain the confirmation of the Central Bank and, finally, it must register as a public limited company.  Section 101 requires the conversion scheme to cover 11 specific aspects of the conversion including the rights of members of the society in relation to the equity of the successor company or any distribution of the society's reserves.  No conversion scheme may be circulated unless the Central Bank is satisfied that it complies with the requirements of the Bill.  In order to prevent disruptive movement of funds in the expectation of quick windfall gains, any priority rights that may be given to members generally will not apply to members of less than two years standing.</P>
    <P>A &ldquo;conversion resolution&rdquo; is a form of special resolution in which the borrowers vote along with the shareholders on the basis of one man, one vote to adopt the conversion scheme.  Before members vote on a conversion scheme they must be supplied with a detailed statement indicating, <i>inter alia</i>, the reasons for the proposal and the future policy of the company in relation to housing loans and mortgage interest rates.  I think it is only equitable that borrowers should be given an equal say with shareholders in the decision to convert, since it is a matter that could have potential consequences for them.  Also, it will ensure that any converting society do not ignore the legitimate interests of mortgage holders.</P>
    <P>After adoption by the society a conversion cannot become effective until it is confirmed by the Central Bank.  Essentially, section 104 states that the bank must confirm a conversion unless it would <Col N="1549" /> be contrary to the public interest or unless it is unlikely that the successor would be granted a banking licence.  The public interest safeguard is an important one since it would allow the bank to block a conversion if in the prevailing circumstances it considered, for example, that a conversion would be damaging to the overall financial system.</P>
    <P>Section 105 contains an important safeguard, in the form of recourse to the High Court, for individual members who may consider that the terms of conversion do not respect their rights.</P>
    <P>After conversion a society will become a bank regulated under company and banking legislation.  However, in order to ensure that societies make their own decision on conversion without undue external influence and that they do not become subject to predatory attentions section 105 guarantees the continued independence of the successor company for at least five years.  For the same reason the Bill makes no provision for the transfer by a society of their business to an existing company.</P>
    <P>The net effect of all the provisions will I think ensure that conversion will be properly considered and carried through with due regard to the interests of all categories of members, that societies do not come under pressure to convert with a view to being taken over and that flows of funds will not be distorted by expectations of windfall gains.</P>
    <P>Part XII is concerned with the winding up and cancellation of registration of a society and is mainly a re-enactment with modifications of existing provisions.  The Central Bank is being given full standing in relation to a winding up, including the right to attend any meeting of creditors or to be a member of any committee of inspection.  There is a new safeguard for mortgage holders in that a liquidator cannot sell off mortgage assets except on terms that the High Court considers just and equitable.  Sections 111 and 112 are derived from the Companies (No. 2) Bill, 1987, and make provision in relation to the criminal and civil liability of any officer whose failure to keep proper accounts contributed to an insolvency.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1550" /> Part XIII contains a number of miscellaneous provisions.  Included in this part is the requirement on the Central Bank to keep a public file relating to each society containing specified documents provided by the society.  Members of the public will be entitled to inspect these files just as they can inspect files relating to companies in the Companies Registration Office.  Provision is also made for necessary amendments to the Banker's Books Evidence Acts and Bills of Exchange Act so that societies will be able to provide banking type services. Section 127 is designed to give building societies the same status as banks as depositories of money, for example, to hold client funds and to accept payment of wages.</P>
    <P>Deputies will have noted that some of the new provisions are similar to relevant provisions in the Companies (No. 2) Bill and in the Central Bank Bill.  I was conscious when drafting the Bill that it should, where relevant and appropriate, correspond in so far as possible and reasonable with those two other Bills.</P>
    <P>I hope the House has found my explanation of the thinking behind the Bill and of its major provisions useful and helpful. Due to its length, I regret that I was unable to go into more detail but I will try to respond to any points or queries raised by Deputies in my reply to the debate.  I am also prepared to consider any well-founded suggestions by Deputies for improving the Bill.</P>
    <P>I believe that this Bill is comprehensive, coherent and well balanced. It will allow the building societies to build on their past success.  I think it achieves a good balance between supervision and commercial freedom, between the boards of societies and members, between the rights of investors and borrowers, between societies and their customers. It will also give a better deal to the house purchaser, to the building society investor, to the consumer of financial services.  It can bring benefits to the housing area and the construction industry and, I hope, stimulate urban renewal.  As I have said already, I believe that it is a progressive charter for the <Col N="1551" /> development of the building society movement.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Fine Gael Party, I welcome this Bill.  A modern restructuring of the statutory provisions applicable to building societies is long overdue.  In a modern world and in the Europe of the nineties when financial barriers come down, Irish building societies, if they are to compete, must be able to provide a diversity of financial services and should not be constrained by legislation enacted for a different time.  Even without the prospect of 1992, reforming legislation is required to enable building societies to play a more comprehensive role in the financial services sector.</P>
      <P>The general objectives of the Bill are supported by Fine Gael.  I would have to say, however, that we do have serious reservations about some of its substantive provisions.  I will come to deal with these in some detail shortly.  First, I welcome the transfer of responsibility for the regulation and supervision of building societies from the Registrar of Friendly Societies to the Central Bank.  Supervisory powers of the Central Bank will be stronger and should be more effective than those of the registrar and I believe are more relevant in the context of the extensive financial services that building societies will now be able to offer.  The Central Bank's role will provide a more effective protection for depositors and will ensure that in the future we do not have a repetition of the debacle that we had with the PMPS.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a very extensive and lengthy measure, as the Minister quite correctly states.  Throughout the Bill, there is a variety of enabling provisions and of protections. I want first to deal with the provisions contained in Part I.  Part I, as the Minister correctly said, contains the usual definitions that one finds in such a measure, but there is also something a good deal more important in it than the definition sections.  It confers on the Minister for the Environment, the Minister <Col N="1552" /> for Finance, the Minister for Justice and the Central Bank a diversity of regulatory powers which appear to enable each Minister, and, indeed, the Central Bank, to make regulations for the general purposes or for any particular purpose laid down in the Bill.  Fine Gael have particular reservations about the failure to spell out fully in the Bill the demarcation lines between intervention in some areas by the Central Bank and by Government Ministers.  They are clearly laid out in some parts of the Bill; in other parts there is confusion.  I shall come to deal with that in detail as we go through the Bill.</P>
    <P>In the context of the regulatory powers, I want to refer to sections 4 and 5.  These sections are what can be described as omnibus legislative provisions. This type of clause is normally devised by Government and all Governments in the past have sought to devise omnibus clauses of some nature in Bills as lengthy as this.  This is to enable a legislative hole to be plugged if, following the passage of the Bill, it is discovered that something was omitted which should have been addressed, or something contained in the Bill was not quite working in the way intended.</P>
    <P>There is a considerable difficulty with sections 4 and 5 because they go further than simply empowering a Minister to make regulations under the Bill.  What these sections empower the Minister for the Environment to do is to modify any provisions of the Act as may be necessary or expedient for carrying such provision into effect.  They also confer a direct power on the Minister, by way of regulations, to make consequential amendments or repeals of various provisions of the Act.  It is not appropriate particularly in legislation as important as this, that a Minister by regulation and after such regulation has been lodged in this House for 21 days, should be able to bring legislation automatically into effect unless a motion to nullify it is successfully tabled. The Minister would, by use of this mechanism, be able, in effect, to amend the Act passed by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The Minister should have power to make regulations for the purposes of the <Col N="1553" /> Act but not for the purpose of amending the Act itself.  That gives rise to general concern about the possibility of a Minister at some future date amending some of the safeguards for the consumer contained in the Act; possibly a Minister might do this under pressure from building societies that discover that some safeguards are inconvenient for their general day-to-day operations.  Further, I do not believe that a Minister should be able, by way of regulation to amend a provision in an Act passed by the Oireachtas.  The conferring of such a power in legislation is probably unconstitutional.  The powers to enact legislation and to pass amending Acts are conferred on the Oireachtas by the Constitution.  There is substantive case law on this area.  I would have considerable constitutional reservations about the all-embracing powers conferred under sections 4 and 5 of this Bill which would, in effect, enable the Minister, by regulation, to amend the Bill when it becomes law.  I urge the Minister to have another look at that.</P>
    <P>If following the passage of this legislation it appears in the short or long term that some provisions need to be amended, that should require an amending Bill.  The powers the Minister can exercise under section 4 to act as a Member of the Oireachtas or as a substitute for the Oireachtas are only applicable for a period of three years following the enactment of the Bill.  That is an indicator of doubt that may have existed in the Office of the Attorney General or in the Minister's Department as to the appropriateness of these powers.  Section 5 has no such time limitation.  I have no doubt that these were put in as enabling provisions, but the Minister should be aware that there are grave reservations both about the appropriateness of these provisions and about their constitutionality.</P>
    <P>Section 6 deals with the question of redemption fees.  The Minister has said that this Bill is designed to give a better deal to the House purchaser and the consumer. The case is made that it is appropriate in the context of fixed interest loans for building societies to be able to charge <Col N="1554" /> redemption fees to the borrower who wishes to redeem his loan at an early date.  The 1986 Building Societies Act prohibited the general charging of redemption fees by building societies. That Act was effective in curtailing building societies from exploiting their then dominant position in the domestic house market by penalising borrowers who sought to repay their loan at an early date.</P>
    <P>There is an argument that there should be a different approach to loans based on a fixed interest rate as opposed to other loans, but I am not totally convinced that it is necessary under this Bill to reintroduce redemption fees which were abolished by the 1986 Act.  I seriously question whether it is necessary to do so. I certainly question whether it should be possible for building societies to seek redemption fees in the context of loans which may have preceded 1986.  I think the Minister intends to talk about future fixed interest loans.  Perhaps he will clarify his intentions exactly.  He did not give any detailed explanation as to why redemption fees are appropriate in this instance and why they should be brought back.  The Minister should further explain this point.  Fine Gael for the time being reserve their position on this matter.</P>
    <P>Part II deals with a variety of matters relating to the formation of building societies and various authorisations building societies can be given.  Much in this Part is welcome and we will tease out the details on Committee Stage.  There are, however, a number of other issues which primarily arise under Part III.  This Part confers a variety of new powers on building societies and deals with a number of issues which will become a matter of some public controversy when the minds of the general public are directed to the detail of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister raised the issue of tiered interest rates.  It is worth nothing that some building societies, in what I would describe as an abuse of their then dominant position in the market, sought to impose tiered interest rates retrospectively prior to the enactment of the 1986 Building Societies Act.  One of the <Col N="1555" /> most important reforms introduced by that Act was the prevention of the imposition of tiered interest rates on unsuspecting borrowers, who were given no indication by the building society at the time they took up the loan that if they borrowed at a particular rate they might at some future date be penalised by the society by being required to pay higher interest rates than others who had borrowed different sums of money.  The 1986 Act prohibited tiered interest rates in the context of previous and future borrowers.</P>
    <P>The Minister talks about this legislation as assisting the consumer and he is making provision for the re-introduction of tiered interest rates under section 24. When the Bill was published the Minister issued an accompanying statement which justified the reintroduction of tiered interest rates on the basis that it would enable building societies who provide for large loans to impose higher interest rates on those who borrow large sums of money than they might impose on those who borrow small sums.</P>
    <P>The Minister talked today about an evening out of the possible interest rates. There is a suggestion that those who borrow small sums in the range of £20,000 to £30,000 might at present by paying a bit more interest than they would otherwise be paying, due to the fact that somebody who borrows £50,000 or £60,000 from the society pays the same level of interest as those who borrow less.  I am not totally convinced by this argument and I am concerned that the imposition of tiered interest rates might be another device used by building societies to get additional interest from borrowers which cannot be justified.  I am more concerned about it in the context of additional functions and powers which this Part confers on building societies.</P>
    <P>Under Part III building societies will be able to develop their own housing estates.  I wonder how the tiered interest rate provision will apply in that context. Will building societies decide to provide a concession interest rate for those who <Col N="1556" /> purchase houses which have been constructed in a building society development? Will they try to create a situation whereby they exercise such a dominant interest in the domestic house market that people who wish to purchase houses will know that if they purchase from somebody other than the building society as a developer they will pay a higher interest rate on their mortgage?</P>
    <P>The whole issue of tiered interest rates is now moving beyond the question of whether building societies should be able in the context of the market to charge different interest rates for different levels of borrowing.  There is the possibility that the building societies could use their position in the market to compete unfairly against other house developers by offering concession rate loans to those who purchase a house in a building society development.  I would ask the Minister to consider that point and to look at the distortions in the construction industry which could be created by the building societies being empowered to exercise such an approach.</P>
    <P>Let us leave aside for the moment the proposition that the building societies may abause their position in the context of their becoming developers of domestic housing estates.  Let us put that on one side for the moment and assume the position will be that the building societies will simply apply tiered interest rates of different natures to different levels of borrowings regardless of whether they are the developers of the house for which the loan is being provided.</P>
    <P>In the banking world very often the case is that the person to whom you provide the lower loan, because he might not have as good a credit standing, may be required to pay higher interest rates than the person to whom you provide the larger loan.  The Minister's argument and assumption is that tiered interest rates will apply in the context of those who borrow large sums paying a higher interest rate than those who borrow lower sums of money.  It could very well be that tiered interest rates will have the reserve effect, that the first time house purchaser, <Col N="1557" /> because he does not have a record of mortgage repayments as he may be borrowing for the purchase of a house the value of which is unlikely to increase in the market at as great a rate as a more expensive house, will end up paying higher interest rates.</P>
    <P>The person who borrows £20,000 or £30,000 will end up paying a higher interest rate than the person who borrows £50,000 or £60,000.  The person borrowing £50,000 or £60,000 may have an AAA credit rating and will get a concession interest rate from the building society.  Perhaps tiered interest rates will apply in a different way, perhaps building societies will provide lower domestic interest rates for the purchase of a house to those people to whom they provide loan finance in the commercial sector for major commercial developments because, under this Bill, the building societies will rightly be allowed to exercise many of the normal ordinary banking functions that our banks currently operate.</P>
    <P>Who is to say that concession interest rates will not be provided for commercial borrowers in the context of the commecial borrower taking out a domestic loan for the purchase of a House?  If the Minister wants to ensure that the person who borrows between £15,000 and £30,000 which, nowadays, is a fairly modest level of borrowing for a new house, is not penalised under the application of a system of tiered interest rates, far more elaborate provisions will require to be included in section 24 to deal with this issue.</P>
    <P>I am not sure that tiered interest rates in the context of the housing market are justified or necessary.  At the end of the day the building societies will check the security of the house for which the loan is to be provided.  The building society's concern is to provide a loan, ensure that mortgage repayments are made, get a reasonable return on the loan provided and, in the event of the mortgage repayments not being paid, ensure that the security of the house is available to recoup the moneys lent.</P>
    <P>I have not heard a convincing argument <Col N="1558" /> from the Minister as to why the 1986 Act should be repealed.  In the context of the current environment, in which the banks have become far more greatly involved in the domestic house market, I can see that the workings of the market itself and the competition may dissuade building societies from abusing their position. However, it is only in the last two or three years that the banks have become involved, to any major degree in recent decades, in providing borrowings for the purchase of new houses.</P>
    <P>It was only in 1987 that they finally shook up the building societies and of course the banks did very well because until the Bank of Ireland took over the ICS and broke up the cartel, for a number of years the building societies not only exercised the dominant position in the market but abused their dominance by failing to provide a real service to their customers.  The reason the banks did well in 1986-87 was because they were seen to be consumer friendly and to respond to the needs of their customers which was something the building societies did not do.  The take-over of ICS and the large scale move of the banking sector into the domestic house market has shaken the building societies out of their complacency and indeed their attitude, to a certain degree.</P>
    <P>I am not convinced that tiered interest rates are necessary and if the Minister's argument is that the market will take care of it, I still believe that the provision for tiered interest rates could result in building societies, if they take up the possibility of developing housing estates, exercising an influence on the house construction market which would create major difficulties.  This provison could place at risk first time house borrowers who wish to purchase a house and who go to a building society to find they are required to pay a higher interest rate than might otherwise have been imposed.  I would like to see fundamental changes in section 24 to confront some of those issues.</P>
    <P>There are matters in Part III of the Bill which give rise to concern.  Section 18 allows building societies to raise funds <Col N="1559" /> and borrow moneys abroad, which is something that was not available to them previously.  I am a little confused about this provision because at the start I welcomed the regulatory powers of the Central Bank and one would expect in the context of the Central Bank exercising regulatory powers that, in this area, the issue would be left to the Central Bank. Yet, in the context of this section, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for the Environment are enabled, to some extent, to interfere with the operation of the Central Bank.  We may tease this out in more detail on Committee Stage.  I ask the Minister for an explanation as to the reason for the specific powers conferred on him in this section.</P>
    <P>Section 21 deals with building societies holding and developing land for residential, commercial and other purposes. We should go very carefully in the context of this section.  Indeed, the building societies should also go carefully in the context of this section.  A general query must arise as to the desirability of allowing building societies to diversify into some of the areas into which it is envisaged they will diversify under the provisions of the Bill.  I do not know what expertise building societies have in the building and development of housing estates or in involving themselves in commercial development.</P>
    <P>Building societies have been in a position where their expertise lies in providing loans for domestic houses and in ensuring that the necessary assessments are carried out to make sure, by way of survey, that there is a house which will provide adequate security for the loan being offered and, through solicitors, ensuring that the title is correct and that they have adequate security and correct title for the loan being made.  In the United States, there was a rather unhappy experience when the American Savings and Loan Corporation collapsed due to getting involved in areas in which they had no expertise.  I am concerned as to the powers conferred under section 21 and the extent to which the Central Bank will in practice be able to monitor the <Col N="1560" /> exercise of powers that the building societies may exercise under that section.</P>
    <P>I emphasise the point that expertise in lending money does not automatically mean that you have expertise in commercial and domestic house development. I know there are provisions in the Bill dealing with this.  Some concerns could arise about building societies getting involved in these areas and the reduction of the finance available for the domestic house market.  The Bill envisages controls and curtailment in this regard but I ask the Minister to further address that issue.</P>
    <P>The Bill goes on to outline what other powers would be conferred on building societies.  Section 29 contains a very curious provision.  In effect the section prescribes the variety of different banking type services that building societies would be authorised to provide.  Subsection (2) (n) would confer on building societies the right to give advice in the making of wills. I do not understand how it falls within their expertise to give advice to customers in the making of wills and to deal with all of the intricate legal issues which have to be dealt with in that respect.  This section appears to be a direct copy of a section contained in the Building Societies Act, 1986 enacted in England.  I do not know why this provision has been included.  I know of no public demand for building societies to be given the right to give advice in the making of wills.  In fairness to the building societies, I am not sure they would want to have the right to give advice in the making of wills.</P>
    <P>I fail to understand what the advantage to the consumer would be in allowing building societies, who lack the necessary legal expertise, to give advice in the making of wills.  On occasion this may require the giving of very comprehensive and detailed advice well outside property law on such matters as family law, company law, trusteeships and other complex areas which do not fall within the general expertise of building societies and which do not relate happily to any of the other functions that would be conferred on building societies under this Bill.  The Minister made no reference to this matter <Col N="1561" /> in his speech.  I do not know why building societies, in addition to solicitors who have to go through a number of years of legal training, would be given the right to give advice in the making of wills.  It is a very curious provision indeed.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that some degree of controversy will will be generated in the coming weeks in regard to the powers that would be conferred on the building societies to engage in conveyancing.  We are all aware that it is a popular past time to engage in solicitor bashing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister in dealing with this issue was extraordinarily brief. He recited the fact that conveyancing powers would be conferred on the building societies and mentioned protections by way of regulation.  We should look at what the position was until 1986 and what it might be once this Bill is enacted.  Prior to 1986 one of the abuses building societies engaged in was to insist that borrowers, when purchasing a house, pay the conveyancing fees incurred by the <Col N="1562" /> building society in checking title.  A solicitor would act for the purchaser of a house while the building society also employed a solicitor to check the title. It was the poor purchaser the building society sought to stick with the legal fees incurred by the society.</P>
      <P>Many lawyers and Members of this House who are not lawyers as well as people outside of this House not connected with the legal profession questioned the need for building societies to employ their own lawyers to check the titles of property, thereby duplicating the work of the solicitor acting on behalf of the purchaser.  The building societies protested that they were not duplicating this work and, in their submission to the Restrictive Practices Commission, who subsequently published a report on their inquiry into the effects of competition of the restrictions on conveyancing in 1982, insisted that they be allowed to continue to employ their own lawyers.  That report recommended that where a purchase was financed by a lending institution; the work of the lender's solicitor largely overlapped with that of the purchaser's solicitor but that the interests of the purchaser and lender could diverge and that the lending institutions maintained it was necessary for them to employ their own solicitors.  In 1982, therefore, the building societies recognised that there was a conflict of interests between them and the borrowers and they insisted that they be allowed employ their own solicitors.</P>
      <P>No one had ever any objection to building societies employing their own solicitors. What people objected to was that the borrower had to pay the fees of the building society's solicitors.  The Act of 1986 prohibited building societies from requiring a person borrowing finance for the purchase of a domestic dwelling to pay the legal fees incurred by the building society.  What did the building societies do then?  Since they could no longer charge legal fees they decided to make the lender pay the administrative costs involved.  Consequently we had a new situation &mdash; legal fees went out the window and administrative costs were imposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1563" /> The banks then came into the picture and were willing to accept certificates from solicitors acting on behalf of purchasers. The Building Societies Act, 1986 required that building societies also accept these.  The need to charge administrative fees also seemed to go, even though some building societies are still charging them.</P>
    <P>Having admitted that there was a conflict of interests and having insisted that they be allowed to employ their own lawyers the building societies are now saying, seeing as how they cannot get the purchaser to pay their legal fees, that they will take over the purchase and obtain the legal fees in that way.  It is recognised in Section 31 of this Bill that a serious conflict of interests can arise between the purchaser of a house and the building society.  Conflicts can arise in a variety of ways.  Currently someone buying a house consults with his solicitor who may give him independent advice as to which building society or bank may provide the better deal.  He may advise them to take out the traditional type of loan or some-type of endowment policy.  Because of the insurance kickback building societies may get it may be of advantage to building societies in some instances to sell endowment policies but it may not always be in the interests of the purchaser to take out an endowment policy in his particular set of circumstances.  Currently a purchaser will get independent advice on the options open to him from a lawyer.  This independent advice would not be available if building societies were to act for borrowers in the area of conveyancing.</P>
    <P>The banks may be as much to blame for this as the building societies, but building societies and banks in relation to the mortgage document may seek to impose obligations on borrowers that go beyond what is necessary to secure the position of the building society or bank.</P>
    <P>Currently when a loan is obtained from a bank, they may not only have the title deeds to the property as security for the loan but may have rights to extract money in a variety of other ways in the event of <Col N="1564" /> a problem arising with mortgage repayments. A solicitor acting independently for a purchaser can advise the purchaser of the extent of the obligations and guarantees he need give to the lending finance agency when he is taking up his loan.  A solicitor employed by a building society will be acting for the building society.  He is going to ask the purchaser to sign up on the most onerous commitments to the building society that that building society may wish to seek.  It may not always be in the interests of a purchaser to agree to such commitments.  No independent legal advice will be available for that in these circumstances.  If legal errors are made in completing the conveyance, who is going to deal with them? Who is going to represent the position of the borrower, the purchaser?  Will the building society make the legal documentation available if a legal error is discovered or will the borrower to left to bring proceedings against the building society?</P>
    <P>How will the building societies deal with proceedings under the Family Home Protection Act, 1976 if a loan is being provided to a domestic house purchaser? If the husband is taking out the mortgage, will the wife be advised to get independent legal advice or will she be told by the building society's solicitor simply to sign her consent on he dotted line?  If building societies &ldquo;top up&rdquo; the domestic house loan so that some additional funds are provided to a house purchaser for commercial purposes and the person whose loan is being &ldquo;topped up&rdquo; is the husband, will the wife be asked to give a further consent, or will the mortgage document when first signed basically leave it open to the building society to provide a &ldquo;topping up&rdquo; additional commercial loan for which the family home will be regarded as being held as security at the time the original domestic loan is provided?  A whole series of issues can arise in respect of which there may be clear conflicts of interest.</P>
    <P>This is an even more curious provision for another reason.  If the argument is for bringing conveyancing costs down &mdash; and there is a very good argument that the <Col N="1565" /> cost of purchasing a house should not be as great as it currently is &mdash; it is very difficult to see how this provision will in any way bring costs down.  Building societies will have to provide a cost effective service if this provision laid down in the Bill works.  They will have to keep separate accounts showing what moneys they have earned through conveyancing and that they are not using conveyancing as a loss leader.  Therefore, presumably they will bring into being charges similar to existing charges.</P>
    <P>Building societies apart from the fact that they want to find some new way to retrieve the legal costs they incur, having been prevented from doing so properly by the 1976 Act, may want to use conveyancing as a means to bring to the individual building societies the domestic house purchaser, and now they want to outflank the banks in this area.  I believe the banks involving themselves in the house loan market brought a breath of fresh air and a reasonable degree of competition into an area that had been sadly lacking in competition and had been run by a cartel for many years.  I have still something of an open mind on this despite all the reservations I have expressed because some of those reservations can be dealt with in detailed revisions and regulations about conflict of interest.  If it is in the public interest to allow financial institutions to provide domestic house loans, to engage in conveyancing, why is it in the public interest to allow only building societies to engage in conveyancing?  Why should banks and other financial institutions who provide domestic house loans not also engage in conveyancing?  We have a Central Bank Bill currently before the House; that says absolutely nothing about extending the powers to engage in conveyancing to the banks.  Why should it be possible for building societies only to have this new function conferred on them, be it desirable or not?  Either in principle it is desirable or in principle it is not.  If it is desirable I do not see where the principle is in conferring these powers on building societies but not on banks.  It would seem <Col N="1566" /> the conferring of these powers on building societies taken together with the conferring of the powers on building societies to act as auctioneers, is in effect designed to restore to building societies the dominance they exercised in the market prior to 1986.  I do not believe that is in the interests of the consumer or that it can be dressed up as a consumer protection measure.  I do not believe it can be dressed up as a measure that will in any way be in the long term interests of those who seek finance for the purchase of their domestic houses.  Therefore, I want an explanation from the Minister as to the principle in extending conveyancing powers to building societies.  If the principle is to bring down the cost of conveyancing I want him to spell out how it will have that effect.  I want him to spell out the principle in extending these powers to building societies but not to banks.  Maybe there is a simple explanation, that the Department of the Environment deal with building societies and the Department of Finance deal with banks and it never occurred to anyone to produce a coherent policy on this issue. Maybe that is the simplistic explanation, but it does not bear examination.</P>
    <P>I do not think anyone can deny that in practical terms there is going to be a serious conflict of interest between the purchaser of a house and a building society and that conflict may arise in a variety of circumstances when building societies engage in conveyancing.  The Minister in section 31 (4) provides that regulations may be made under the section.  This time these regulations will be made by the Minister for Justice to deal with the issue of conflict of interest. I tell the Minister these regulations under the provisions contained in the Bill will be made by the Minister for Justice and laid before this House and, unless a motion is put before the House to nullify these regulations, they will automatically come into force with no detailed discussion of any nature of their contents.</P>
    <P>If the intention is to extend conveyancing to building societies and if there is a recognition that there is a <Col N="1567" /> serious problem in some instances of conflicts of interest, I suggest this provision in section 31 be amended, and there be a specific provision whereby this section will not come into force until, first, the regulations are published and printed. Secondly, until the regulations have been approved by this House following debate on their provisions and, thirdly, that there be enabling provision in this section whereby this House can amend such aspects of those regulations by the tabling of amendments to them at the time they are brought before this House for debate. It would seem there is a very serious public interest issue here, an issue too serious to be dealt with simply by the laying of a regulation that would come automatically into force unless it were nullified.  There should be an express approval, and there is a precedent for this in a provision contained in the Criminal Justice Act, 1984 that a variety of powers in that Act did not come into force without publication by the then Minister for Justice of the rules and regulations to apply to the Garda.  Such rules and regulations had to be debated in this House and formally approved by this House before certain sections in the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, came into operation. The Minister should look at that section in the 1984 Act and see how it can be used to deal with the problems.</P>
    <P>In the context of section 31 there is a great need for other reasons, to spell out the intention of the regulations.  Section 31 (4) (d) states that the regulations can specify the class or classes of persons to whom conveyancing services may be provided.  I have no idea what that means. Are there classes in society to whom conveyancing services are to be provided? Will this mean that conveyancing services will only be provided to those who borrow from societies?  Are the societies to generally provide conveyancing services whether a person borrows from them or not?  I presume that is the intention but it is difficult to understand what the Minister intends under that subsection. Subsection (e) refers to the restriction of the power to provide the <Col N="1568" /> conveyancing services to property of a prescribed description.  What does that mean?  Does it mean that building societies can convey bungalows but not double or multi-storey properties, that they can convey domestic dwellings only or commercial buildings only?  It is not good enough that those matters should remain a mystery and are not spelled out in the context of the worries I have expressed in regard to them.</P>
    <P>The same argument applies to building societies exercising auctioneering services. In so far as a power is conferred on them to do so by the Bill I believe that before it is exercised the detail of the regulations that may be made by the Minister for Justice and the Minister for the Environment should be spelled out. The detail of those should be approved by the House.  In the context of sections 31 and 32 which deal with conveyancing and auctioneering powers, the Minister should explain the role the Central Bank are supposed to play in regard to them. At the outset I said that the Central Bank, the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Justice, and the Minister for the Environment all seem to have regulatory powers of a different nature and a different description.  It seems that it would be possible on occasions for them to be separately issuing contradictory regulations. One assumes that will not happen but in the context of the failure to coordinate the extension of conveyancing services, and by depriving the banks of that facility and confining it to building societies, one wonders where the co-ordination will lie.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister tell the House in what way the Central Bank, as suggested in section 31, can make any particular input or give any consideration under the normal functions exercised by the Central Bank, as to whether building societies should be involved in conveyancing?  I do not see how that falls within the Central Bank's regulatory or supervisory functions. I can understand the Central Bank wanting to or attempting to exercise some sort of function as to the limits of capital investment building societies might put into the development of housing estates <Col N="1569" /> or commercial developments but I fail to understand what supervisory function the Central Bank can exercise in determining the nature of the conveyancing services building societies are to exercise.</P>
    <P>I have considerable reservations about that provision.  In the context of conveyancing, of building societies acting as estate agents and in developing housing estates and commercial projects I repeat that the Minister is conferring powers on building societies to generally engage in economic activity of a nature which is foreign to them.  They may have some acquaintance with that business; they maybe indirectly associated with it but they have had no involvement or expertise in that business at present.  I should like to sound a warning about the inherent dangers in building societies involving themselves in those areas as opposed to the other general areas of banking, leaving aside the making of wills, which are properly addressed in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I have another concern.  The Bill goes further than simply putting the building societies in a position where they will be competing equally with the banks in a variety of areas, which is what the building societies have been seeking.  By allowing building societies to build estates, provide loans, engage in conveyancing and act as estate agents, the Bill in a sense seeks to restore building societies to a position of dominance in the market. That may not be in the interests of the consumer.  Section 35 is designed to ensure that there will be some degree of protection against building societies forcing borrowers to utilise the societies' own conveyancing services.  It seeks to ensure that those who wish to obtain independent legal advice when raising a house loan &mdash; very often the purchase of a house and the raising of a loan is the major financial transaction the majority of us make during our lifetime &mdash; will not be forced by the building societies to use their own conveyancing services.  I am not satisfied that, in practice, section 35 will work that way.</P>
    <P>It appears from what the Minister has said that the provision is intended to <Col N="1570" /> introduce competition in the area of conveyancing. I am concerned that in the context of house purchase it will not merely put building societies in a dominant position <i>vis-à-vis</i> banks but that it may put them in a dominant position <i>vis-à-vis</i> solicitors.  In effect, it may remove competition from the market.  The Bill states that building societies will not be able to require the use of their own conveyancing services but there is a very thin demarcation line between a building society urging its customers to use its conveyancing services and making it clear that if one gets a loan from them and uses an independent lawyer it will take a lot longer to process the application with the result that the applicant may end up being on bridging finance at higher interest rates a good deal longer than is necessary. The society may point out that if an applicant uses its inhouse conveyancing service through qualified lawyers or law clerks the loan will be processed that bit quicker.  I am not sure that section 35 provides the necessary protection for the consumer in that area.  The Minister should have another look at that section.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is truly interested in making conveyancing a great deal less expensive, and the overwhelming majority of people will take the view that it should be possible to make conveyancing and the purchase of houses less expensive, a far more fundamental change is required.  I do not believe that extending that power to building societies will have any major impact on the cost of conveyancing.  It will simply give building societies an additional function and, no doubt, create difficulties for some solicitors whose practices primarily rely on conveyancing.  If the Minister truly wants to reduce the cost of conveyancing he should realise that what we need is a radical reform of conveyancing laws.  Our conveyancing laws have never been overhauled. In some instances we are still operating under laws from the 15th, 16th and 17th centuries.  We are operating under old pre-1922 laws that were inherited from the British and many of them have long since been reformed by the British.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1571" /> Conveyancing is complex because we have antiquated laws and an antiquated legal structure for dealing with house purchase and house sales.  We have a concept of &ldquo;let the buyer beware&rdquo;, a concept whereby instead of a purchaser being guaranteed that he is getting a proper title to a property he is acquiring from the vendor, he is put at risk and has to check out that he has the proper title. Instead of a purchaser being guaranteed by a vendor that there is a proper planning permission in existence he has to check it out.  The whole area of conveyancing is made unnecessarily complex and the Land Registry is collapsing under the weight of work.</P>
    <P>We have a 25 per cent VAT rate imposed on legal fees which presumably the building societies will have to apply in the purchase of a domestic dwelling. Young first-time buyers have to pay 25 per cent VAT on their conveyancing fees and they cannot recoup it from anyone but, a company &mdash; the Smurfits of this world &mdash; who want to purchase a major industrial complex which might cost more than £1 million, who pay VAT on conveyancing fees can recoup the VAT and set it off their accounts.  If the Minister really wishes to reduce the cost of conveyancing he should have a radical modernisation of our property laws, our land laws and our conveyancing laws.  We should look at the imposition of VAT in particular on first-time house buyers and we should look at the stamp duties imposed by the State.  The State takes far more from the average house purchaser by way of stamp duties than the purchaser ever has to pay by way of legal fees.</P>
    <P>What we are doing here, under the guise of making conveyancing cheaper, is extending to building societies a function without a clear vision as to why we are doing it.  If we want to provide one-stop shops and if this Bill goes ahead in its present framework, we require other major reforms as well.  If conveyancing is a function that building societies should exercise, and in that context the other financial institutions as well, there is a very strong argument for a total <Col N="1572" /> overhaul, for example, of the solicitors Acts but, of course, that falls within the ambit of the Minister for Justice.  That is the problem.  There is no co-ordination, vision, or policy.  There is no particular reason if it is desirable that building societies operate as one-stop shops why lawyers should not do so.  Why should not legal practices be mixed practices of estate agents, accountants and lawyers who provide a mix of services?  It would be equally relevant to providing a comprehensive package to the house purchaser. Of course, we deal with these things through tunnel vision in a piecemeal way and we play around with systems without actually radically overhauling them.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that the new powers conferred on building societies will allow them to play such a dominant role that they will abuse their position.  The record of building societies up to 1986 does not give one any degree of confidence that building societies will not seek to abuse their position.  It is interesting that the banks have not yet responded to this issue and have not wondered why these additional powers are being given to building societies.  Of course, the Bank of Ireland do not mind as they have taken over the ICS and they will operate them through the ICS.  There is an artificiality, a lack of vision and an absence of any clear view about what is being done.  If this Bill proceeds as drafted, the rules and regulations proposed to provide protection should come into force only if they are brought before this House and are formally approved by the House.</P>
    <P>Another matter of concern is to ensure that adequate mortgage finance is made available.  Section 38 of the Bill deals with the supply of mortgage finance and provides that the Minister for the Environment may from time to time review the adequacy of the supply of mortgage finance for the provision or improvement of housing and communicate to the Central Bank his assessment of the need.  It goes on to say that the Central Bank can communicate its views to the Minister and that every building society can submit to the Minister such information and <Col N="1573" /> returns that the Minister may require. There could be another difficulty here. There is a possibility, as I have already said, that this Bill is designed to give building societies such a dominant position in the market as to, in effect, foreclose on competition.  Another possibility is that the power conferred on building societies to get into the commercial sector could so reduce the moneys available for the domestic house market as to force up the interest rates on domestic mortgages. Building societies may regard it as being more remunerative to involve themselves in the commercial sector and to involve themselves in the construction of properties. I am not sure that section 38 necessarily provides a protection that will guarantee, in conjunction with other sections, that adequate finance is kept available in the domestic housing market.</P>
    <P>If mortgage rates go up they create another problem.  This Government have engaged in an assault on mortgage interest allowances.  In the 1987 budget they reduced the allowance to 90 per cent and in the 1989 budget they reduced it to 80 per cent.  The mix of providing for tiered interest rates and the reduction in the mortgage interest allowance in the income tax legislation could sow the seeds for major difficulties on the part of house purchasers in the future.  The Minister for the Environment steered clear of that issue in the context of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Other issues that arise will be teased out on Committee Stage but in the context of section 60 of the Bill there is provision about the register to be kept by building societies.  This register will record business involvements of an officer or a director of the building society as there is a requirement in relation to making a report.  What is the building society supposed to do with this register? Will it be genuinely available for public consultation?  Why is it only a statement that has to be made available and sent on demand to any member of the society? Why should not a member of the society be allowed to view the register?  The Minister should respond to that question.</P>
    <P>I have a number of queries in the context of later provisions of the Bill.  Part <Col N="1574" /> XI of the Bill deals with the possible conversion by building societies to plcs. The principle of mutuality which was at the heart of the building society movement when it was founded is currently more in name than in reality.  This Bill clearly predicts that building societies or amalgamations of building societies will convert to plcs.  This Bill is unclear as to who will benefit from the conversion of a building society to a plc.  The Bill envisages that a presentation will be made by the management of the building society of a scheme to members of the society for its conversion into a plc by the passage of special resolution.  Indeed, the Bill provides that such special resolution should by reference to the shareholding of persons or classes of persons in the society state their entitlement to shares in the proposed company and their rights, if any, to subscribe towards shares in the proposed company.</P>
    <P>There has been a lot of criticism of building societies in the past as regards the democratic nature of the meetings they hold and of the voting pattern of members.  Of course building society members can be not only people who are outside building societies but who are employees of a building society.  A building society employee may, and will, often have moneys held on deposit with a building society, indeed may be encouraged by the management to hold moneys on deposit.  If one holds moneys in a share account that renders an employee/depositor a voter at an annual general meeting, He or she can also be a voter at any other special meeting.  There is a degree of public suspicion that managements of building societies &mdash; some of whom seem to be self-perpetuating &mdash; have guaranteed their position by ensuring, by and large, that when there is an electoral contest for the position of director of a building society the employees, who also happen to have votes, know whom to vote for and vote the right way.  That is an issue of some public concern.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Bill are intended to provide protections for the shareholders in the context of a conversion to <Col N="1575" /> a plc.  It is anticipated that if a building society held a meeting at which a special resolution was passed to consider its conversion to a plc, the majority of its members &mdash; they being the shareholding depositors &mdash; would not vote for the conversion unless to use the simile of the private limited company that converts to a public company, there would be some gain to them by virtue of their shareholding in the building society.  Of course when companies go to convert to plcs often they provide special benefits for their employees as well.</P>
    <P>I want to know what protection there would be under the provisions of the Bill, for example, for the ordinary depositor/shareholder to prevent the management of a building society presenting a special resolution, the terms of which would provide that management would get 50 per cent of the shareholding in the plc following conversion which could be supported by the employees of the building society on the vote due to the fact that, as employees, they were sharing in some greater benefit than the ordinary depositor/shareholder.  I want to know what protection there is against that eventuality.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Bill appear to carry the rational assumption that, unless it is in the interests of the general class of depositor/shareholders, there would not be a majority in favour of conversion and assumes that the shareholders will benefit in some way from the conversion other than simply having their deposits guaranteed when the building society moves from being a friendly society to being a plc.  I am not sure that that is an assumption that can be drawn.  I think it would be possible for a form of special resolution to be passed &mdash; following the conversion to plc &mdash; which would provide an unjustified gain to the management and directors of the building society, which would exclude the ordinary shareholder who is not an employee of a building society, from joining in any gain that would normally come the way of someone who truly is a shareholder in a private limited company.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1576" /> If the principle of mutuality still means anything it must mean that the members of the society are the people who control the society.  We all know that that is somewhat illusory at present, but it is too serious, in the context of this Bill, simply to be left as unclear as I believe it to be. Section 101 (3) (f) (ii) talks about the rights, if any, to subscribe for shares in the proposed company.  It would seem to me that the very essence of being a shareholder/depositor in a building society that converts to a plc would be to ensure in the presentation of a special resolution for conversion, that there would be some rights given to depositors/shareholders to obtain shares in the company on it going to the market, that there would be some deal done for their benefit as members of the company. I am not satisfied that that eventuality is adequately provided for.</P>
    <P>Of course there is provision, in section 105 (1), for a petition to be brought to the High Court by not less than 100 members of a society to oppose the conversion plan.  The court is required, under the provisions of subsection (6) of the same section, in making its decision to have regard only to the rights and interests of the members of the society, or any class of them.  I suppose this is somewhat like a provision contained in the Companies Act to ensure there is not an impression of a minority in the context of a proposal coming before a private limited company.  It is to be assumed that the possibility of such a petition is designed to provide protection against management excesses.  It is my belief that more specific provisions could be incorporated in the Bill which would avoid the necessity of bringing such petitions to the High Court.  I would ask the Minister to examine that matter further.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to look at something else: on the assumption that a building society converts to a plc there is specific provision in the Bill to prevent a larger &mdash; and to use a term of the stock market &mdash; predator company coming in, within five years, to try and take over the building society.  There is a certain rationale behind that.  Of course, there <Col N="1577" /> could be a rationale behind a building society being taken over following it becoming a plc.  It may very well be that, having converted to a plc, after a year or two, a building society could get into some difficulties.  For example, it could take commercial decisions which get it somewhat out of its depth.  It may look on a major bank operating here, or indeed on a foreign bank, as a sort of friendly white knight it would be pleased to be taken over by to get its house in order and preserve the position of its depositors and its functioning as a major financial institution within this State.  The suggestion could arise that there should be exceptions to the five year protection rule which should be spelled out specifically in the provisions of this Bill.  I would ask the Minister to have another look at that aspect also.</P>
    <P>This is a very lengthy Bill.  In my contribution I have dwelt on areas of concern. I have not referred to areas about which there are no major concerns.  In general, I have already made the point that, as a matter of principle, we must have a modern legal framework and that building societies must have a degree of financial muscle.  I believe they have a contribution to make within our community in other areas of finance than merely that of domestic house borrowing. I believe that an adventurous building society, properly managed from a secure base, could have a much wider role to play within the European market than they are allowed to play at present under existing legislation.</P>
    <P>I am concerned to ensure that we preserve a true degree of competition within the market in the area of domestic house loans.  I am anxious to ensure that building societies are not given a dominant position over banks, are not allowed to reassert the dominance they held previously. I am also anxious to ensure that, in the context of any new powers the building societies are given, there is a guarantee that there will be the necessary level of finance still made available within this market to enable house purchasers, <Col N="1578" /> at reasonable interest rates, to have finance made available to them for the purchase of houses.</P>
    <P>I am also anxious to ensure that, within the domestic market, a house purchaser does not find &mdash; through the use of tiered interest rates, or the reduction in the mortgage interest allowance &mdash; that, over a period of time, the interaction of the two results in far higher levels of interest being paid on domestic house loans than is desirable without even benefiting from what would have been there in the past, the full tax relief on interest payable.</P>
    <P>This State has an interest in ensuring that its people can raise funds to house themselves within the private sector.  We know we have a major financial difficulty. We talk about our budget deficits, our levels of borrowings.  We know that this Minister has drastically reduced the level of finance available for the building of local authority houses.  There will be fewer than 1,000 new houses built by local authorities this year in this State.  If we make it even more difficult for people to borrow moneys for the purchase of their own houses while at the same time diminishing and virtually abolishing the local authority house building programmes we will end up increasing the level of homelessness.  We will end up driving people out of this country into other states in the EC.</P>
    <P>There are all sorts of policy considerations relevant here and we have to get the balance right.  In the context of some of the issues I have addressed, I am not sure the balance is right and I am not sure the policy has been fully thought out. There are a great deal of other specific provisions relating to individual sections on which comment could be made but I will refrain from making those comments until we come to what I hope will be a very detailed Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by saying I welcome the Minister's invitation to consider any constructive amendments that may be tabled to this Bill.  I appreciate it is a lengthy Bill.  I would hope that when we come to Committee Stage we will be able to take that constructive approach on <Col N="1579" /> board and that the Government will look with an open mind on any amendments that may be tabled on this side of the House by my own party and other parties with a view to teasing out the statutory provisions contained in this Bill to ensure that we truly do, at the end of the day, have a measure that enables the building societies to play a far more enhanced role in the financial markets while fully and properly protecting the consumer and guaranteeing the necessary loan finance is available to the domestic house market.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>On any Bill of almost 130 sections one could say a great deal and obviously that is what Deputy Shatter has done.  I intend to be a great deal more succinct because I believe much of the previous contribution is more appropriate on a Committee Stage debate. While I would share some of the concerns expressed by the previous speaker I want to say that the Bill, in broad terms, is welcomed by my party and I think it is the obligation of the party spokespersons to be unequivocal about that general aspect of things, subject to certain qualifications.</P>
      <P>Subject to approximately three reservations, we will support the Bill as facilitating a greater degree of developmental potential by building societies resulting, hopefully, in both a broader range of services to consumers and a financial benefit in terms of stabilised mortgage rates or reduced mortgage rates where that is possible arising from the increased capacity for such building societies to be able to operate in the market place, economically speaking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The areas I would be anxious about relate to the proposal in the Bill to allow building societies to operate conveyancing in respect of clients to whom they themselves extend loans.  Second, a general concern I would have would be about ensuring that there was a level playing pitch for all those involved in affording house loans and mortgage loans generally so that we do not get some of the competitors with their hands tied <Col N="1580" /> behind their backs and that we do get true competition.  Third, I would like to see more attention given to an insistence that improved competitiveness and improved profitability would be to the benefit of the consumer because that, ultimately, is the principal yardstick by which we would judge the success of this Bill.  Those three areas are the ones I would be concerned about.</P>
    <P>I believe this Bill will help building societies to compete more effectively, to move into Europe, into Northern Ireland, more effectively and more rapidly and will allow them to do that in anticipation of the reciprocal movement by building societies in Great Britain and elsewhere into Ireland.  Hopefully the Bill in that respect is timely if not a little late in affording such access to the general market place by Irish building societies.</P>
    <P>I am a little surprised by Fine Gael's implied criticism of the record of building societies because my belief is that building societies, by and large, have a very good record of public service and have been lauded, in some quarters at least, for taking on a social role in affording the opportunity for many thousands of people to have their own homes when nobody else was offering that facility. Certainly with respect to some aspects of the operation of some building societies there were concerns expressed and those concerns were reflected in a series of papers and documents.  I do not intend to go into those in detail but, in passing, one could point to the interdepartmental committee report published in April 1986 and entitled <i>Discussion Document on Legislative and Regulatory Arrangements in Relation to Building Societies</i> or, indeed, to the Restrictive Practices Commission report of 1975 which dealt with the question of the tied insurance arrangements which many building societies operate or to the concerns outlined in successive reports of the Registrar of Building Societies.  They were all areas of legitimate comment and ones on which action was needed.  The Bill deals with some of those but not with them all. That said, there are very few institutions that are above reproach of some kind.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1581" /> On balance the building societies' contribution in affording people the chance to own their own homes has been singular and outstanding and deserves credit and approval.</P>
    <P>The Bill itself will afford that opportunity for increased competitiveness. One of my main concerns is to ensure that does not result merely in additional benefit to those involved in the company but will be allowed to percolate through to the public, to the consumer and those who have mortgages in the various societies. It is fair to say as well in that context that I would urge some of the smaller societies to look at the possibility of amalgamating; that would be in their own interests in view of the increasingly competitive environment in which they will be operating, regardless of whether they like it, over the next number of years.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the move to facilitate building societies becoming public limited liability companies.  This will simply give them the opportunity to compete, with the gloves off, in the market place. That is in tune with the philosophy of my party and that is the point I was interested in when listening to the previous spokesperson. I could not get the synchronicity, if that is the right word, because I have no problem whatever with saying that wherever possible, and subject to certain minimal restraints, it is our view that the less government the better.  If one is therefore affording building societies or other financial institutions an opportunity to compete, to be effective, to be efficient, to reward their workers, to reward good management, to go far and near in search of funds or in search of economic advantage, that is a good thing because it is my belief that that will ultimately percolate through to the benefit of the economy in general and of the taxpayer and home owner specifically. From our point of view it is very much in line with the kind of thinking we have. That is not to say there should not be some safeguards and some restraints.  I would personally be concerned if a significant burden of the activities and funds of building societies in future was to move away from the somewhat longer term <Col N="1582" /> underpinning of home ownership as it now does in favour perhaps of shorter term returns which would be an attractive feature of certain speculative areas of investment and risk taking and which of course other financial institutional areas are involved in, presumably to the benefit of their own shareholders and members, and who can blame them for that?  In general terms the building societies have had to operate in a very difficult climate and over the last number of years have seen some of their advances eroded.  The Bill is designed to ensure that there is a level playing pitch for the financial institutions.</P>
    <P>Building societies are, after all, unique in the Irish financial services environment. This uniqueness derives from the fact that they have a special legal status being mutual societies, and from the fact that they are governed by separate legislation, the 1976 Building Societies Act.  So, they are at a disadvantage at present.  In an environment of strong demand for mortgages and little direct competition until recently, though there are moves in that respect, the building societies were in a strong position to expand; but in the current environment, previous to this legislation, their position is somewhat less secure and restrictions imposed on their activities by the present legislation have severely hampered their competitive ability.  I am in favour of competition and of allowing societies to operate to the highest possible standards of excellence and achievements and reaping the benefits both for their shareholders and their directors and hopefully for those who have mortgages with them.</P>
    <P>A major disadvantage faced by those societies has been their inability, due to these legislative restraints, to market a full range of services to the customers. These customers now demand such services. It is simply unreal and out of tune with the mood of the times to artificially restrict societies or any other financial institution, from offering that range of services so that ultimately the consumer can have freedom of choice.  That is what this boils down to, the capacity to choose <Col N="1583" /> freely in the marketplace from a multifaceted range of services provided by financial institutions.  If this Bill facilitates that &mdash; and I believe that is part of what it is designed to do &mdash; I welcome it.</P>
    <P>There is a severe restraint at present on building society activity, particularly in a retail financial services market which is characterised by frequent and varied transactions.  The societies are also placed at a severe disadvantage relative to their main competitors, the banks, whose broader product range gives them access to more lucrative lending opportunities, such as personal loans, as well as access to very low cost funds such as current accounts.  The future competitive ability, therefore, of the societies is also hampered by legal restrictions regarding their capital base which, again, needs to be addressed if they are to be flexible and innovative in terms of organising finances.</P>
    <P>The societies are mutual organisations and they can only add to their permanent capital base through retained earnings. Thus the pace at which the societies can expand their range of activities is governed by the profitability of existing activities. I do not believe therefore that the concerns of Deputy Shatter relating to the building societies obtaining dominance in this field is justified.  The reality is that they are at present falling behind a little in this respect and the purpose of the Bill is, I trust, to bring them on line with the banks in this regard.  In that context one should also say that there are certain restrictions and impositions in the banking area which need to be considered.</P>
    <P>One point which has not been mentioned, and I want to ask specifically, what will happen if this Bill is passed through the House and if two other Bills, the Companies Bill and the Central Bank Bill, are modified in such a way that they would not be in line with the provisions in this Bill?  It seems those three Bills, taken simultaneously, seem to be essential in terms of ensuring that the level playing pitch that I speak about is retained. I wonder what will happen in that <Col N="1584" /> regard.  I suppose the Minister has no magic answer but I assume there is a desire to ensure that the elements that are common in the three Bills are approved in law as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>At present the clearing banks, by comparison, can expand their permanent capital base using both retained earnings and additional equity as well as having greater opportunity for engaging in off-balance sheet financing.  It seems that at present it is pretty much game, set and match to the banks if they want to play it that way.  Their advertising campaigns in recent times show they are seriously beginning to take on the house finance market and I think they will be successful in that area.  I wish them success because ultimately competition is probably good for the consumer provided the Government keep an eye on the general environment of consumer protection in this respect.  As competition in the mortgage market has intensified, it became clear that if these societies were to be given an opportunity to maintain that competitive position, innovations, legislatively speaking, similar to what is contained in this Bill would have to be introduced.</P>
    <P>In the area of conveyancing, there is a proposal in this Bill which I am not in favour of, and I want the Minister to consider it again.  Without going into the proposal in great detail &mdash; we do not need to go into the nuts and bolts at this stage &mdash; the essence of what is proposed allows building societies to conveyance in relation to the legal work of householders to whom they are giving loans.  Obviously in such circumstances the only time it is really of any significance is when there might be a conflict of interest or a conflict of any kind later downstream.  I have no doubt that in these circumstances those who are doing the legal work and operating both for the building society and the mortgage purchaser are put in an impossible position.  Presumably they will be employed directly by the building societies and paid directly by them, although indirectly in due course by the client, but if there is to be a decision in favour of opting for one set of interests as opposed to another, I have no doubt <Col N="1585" /> but it will be the building societies' interests that will be taken care of prior to those of the consumer or prospective house owner.  Therefore, I am unhappy about that proposal.</P>
    <P>There have been a number of reports dealing with aspects of this matter and it was dealt with in the inter-departmental committee report in April 1986.  It was implied that clearing the title could be addressed by a common solicitor but that other aspects of looking after the purchaser's interests should be a matter for a separate solicitor.  I believe that ultimately it is a question of a <i>caveat emptor</i>, the buyer having to ensure that he or she is protected.  It would be wrong for us to lull the would-be mortgage purchaser into a false sense of security in the belief that the interests of the building society are always synonymous with the interests of the person who is taking out the mortgage. There will be instances where that will not be the case.  I am unhappy with that section of the Bill and I suggest it should be changed.</P>
    <P>I have not had the kind of extensive discussions that the Minister's officials have had in this respect but I do not believe this measure is sought by the building societies.  I could be wrong in that respect but I do not believe they would shed too many tears if it was removed.  In terms of consumer protection, it is better for the buyer to have his own or her own legal advice.  When we talk about the cost and scale of the transaction, we are talking about relatively small amounts of money.  The saving in the short-term to any couple taking out a mortgage is ostensibly attractive, but in the long term it may be penny wise and pound foolish, and it is simply not ideal.  That is a provision my party are unhappy with and one we will be seeking to amend on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Our second area of reserve is to ensure that there are a common set of rules governing societies involved in providing mortgage finance.  At present, for example, a levy is imposed on the banks. There is no rational criteria for the size of that levy.  I have no objection to a tax relative to banking profits, but that levy <Col N="1586" /> does not exist in the area of building societies.  They have their own inhibitions and qualifications.  One of their fears might very well be that the Central Bank, which will become the regulatory authority in relation to the activities of societies under this Bill, might be over-bureaucratic or too slow in dealing with the various aspects of the paperwork which they will have to deal with when this Bill becomes law.  If the Bill is to be effective, all the players must have a level pitch on which to play.  Otherwise, we will either reverse the position that exists at present or end up with a result that is not in accord with what this Bill is designed to do.</P>
    <P>Our third area of concern is to ensure that the benefits of increased competition, increased access to funds and increased capacity to play the market, will be passed on to the consumer.  This is an area in which we feel that intervention by Government is desirable and necessary.  We will have a chance to consider some of those suggestions on Committee Stage.  This is a very lengthy Bill with 127 sections, and I will not go into it in detail now except to say that that is ultimately a very important area from the point of view of my party.  Personally I am not convinced that some kind of general reliance on goodwill in the area of building societies is going to work in this respect.  Their capacity to be responsible and to contribute to the national well-being is at least as good as that of any other financial institution.</P>
    <P>Despite what was implied by the previous spokesperson, I recall no problem ever arising from the actions, inaction or omissions of a building society since the State was founded.  That cannot be said of all financial institutions as people in this House over the last number of years will recall when we had to deal with some of the problems which arose in other areas.  The building societies, by and large, have a reasonable record.  In general terms this Bill will afford them somewhat wider powers to become involved in the provision of financial services generally which will include banking-type services, money transmission, credit <Col N="1587" /> cards, foreign exchange, insurance broking, investment services, financial advisory services and so on.  I do not think they will all rush into the whole range of services immediately but it is a good thing to have these strings to their bow.  I have no doubt it will mean that they can be much more efficient in the manner in which they pursue their activities.  These increased powers are likely to improve the overall efficiency of the retail financial markets and should generate increased competition in all aspects of the supply of personal sector financial services and, as such, they will result in a benefit to the consumer.</P>
    <P>For the first time building societies will be permitted to lend unsecured and that flexibility will help them, though there may very well be some adverse consequences which may result from such circumstances. That is something we will have to expect.  If we are to allow people to get into the competitive market there will be occasions when the results may not be in accord with their expectations. The question of protecting the consumer and of alerting, informing and educating the consumer to understand that there is a downside to risk-taking, to getting involved in competition, is something we will have to address.  In other words, the cocoon which to some extent surrounded building societies up to now and which imposed on them certain disadvantages but which also gave house owners a certain degree of protection may not be quite as intact in the future, particularly in the face of European competition, as it has been up to now.</P>
    <P>I also think that the proposal for building societies to own property for residential development is part of the array of financially flexible innovations which will allow them to become more efficient. When you look at how things have developed in the UK you will see that has been the case there.  Mention of the UK reminds me that the Minister should look at some reports which have been published in the United Kingdom in relation to conveyancing which show that there has been some eminent legal concern in <Col N="1588" /> that part of the world regarding conveyancing by building societies in relation to their own clients.  The report of the Lord Chancellor to the Welsh Law Society made particular reference to this matter, part of which &mdash; published in the Law Society's Gazette No. 25 Wednesday, 29 June 1986 &mdash; reads as follows:</P>
    <P>...there is an overriding need for adequate protection of the public from conflicts of interest.  He saw no difficulty in principle in building societies and other financial institutions providing conveyancing services to persons to whom they are not offering a loan.  The Government had not, up until then, been satisfied that lending institutions can always be safely permitted to offer both conveyancing and a loan in the same transaction.  `We have therefore been considering prohibiting institutions from providing conveyancing to those who are also borrowing from them, if that conveyancing would be provided directly or through a subsidiary company in which they hold a majority stake.'</P>
    <P>That is a matter of concern.  I have no objection whatever to building societies, banks or anybody else offering conveyancing services; in fact, I would welcome it.  I would not be happy with anything that is indicative of a cartel or any form of closed shop arrangement. The principle here is that the conveyancing should not be done for people in respect of whom you have a vested interest; in other words, people to whom you have given a loan.</P>
    <P>There is a great deal I could say about this Bill but I do not intend to spend too long more on it.  Those points are the principal concerns I would have.  The range of issues that need to be addressed involve consumer protection.  That is clearly implicit in the report of the Restrictive Practices Commission which dealt with the issue of insurance.  That is an area that while relevant to the Bill is not dealt with to any significant degree but it is one to which we could refer on Committee Stage.  It seems to me that <Col N="1589" /> this is a reasonable time for the building societies to redress any operational deficiencies or systems which they might have had in place which would not find public favour.  One of those areas was the question of insurance, as is evident from the report of the Restrictive Practices Commission, 1985, but I will not quote from it at this point.  I would ask the Minister to look at the report of the Registrar of Building Societies, 1984, page 15, where he outlines a range of matters which are relevant to the operations of building societies, some of which are not specified in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill also deals with elections to building societies.  I am pleased to see that because over the past year to two there have been some unedifying instances of what looked like, from a distance, a certain degree of closed shop. I do not know whether it was but it looked that way.  Anything that leads to greater democracy, more openness, more transparency of accounting procedures, more access by the public and shareholders is good for the societies.  It will make them more efficient, more profitable and, therefore, will benefit the consumer.</P>
    <P>Those reservations aside, the Bill is to be welcomed.  I will dwell on those three fundamental problems in detail on Committee Stage.  What everybody in this House is concerned about is ensuring that the people we represent &mdash; and they are not building societies, solicitors or banks but citizens &mdash; will have the maximum range of choice which, even in a small economy, will give them the benefit of competition.  The Government should underpin and protect their interests where that is necessary at least to minimal standards.  If Government can withdraw to some extent and free building societies and banks to compete, then as far as I am concerned that is good for the economy and probably good for the consumer though Government, at all times, will have to keep a watchful eye in that respect.</P>
    <P>I look forward to a detailed, and I hope not too tedious, Committee Stage.  This Bill could keep us going for six months. I look forward to informal discussions <Col N="1590" /> with the Minister so that we can try to cover ground as quickly as possible on Committee Stage and sort out any problems there may be so that we may be able to put this Bill through quickly.  Otherwise we will have a long and tedious discussion here and I suspect a declining public and political interest in the matter. I am pleased to see the Bill here and I look forward to discussing it in detail.  I submit those few comments on it with respect to the Minister and to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the publication and the moving of this Bill on Second Stage.  I do not intend to speak extensively at this point because, quite frankly, the Bill is worthy of informed comment on what will be an extensive Committee Stage because of the sheer size and the diversity of elements set out in the Bill. My comments will be of a broad nature and, I hope, concise.  The essential purpose of this Bill as stated in the Minister's opening speech and as set out very clearly in the explanatory memorandum is as follows:</P>
      <P>...to provide a framework within which building societies can compete effectively in the wider financial services marketplace and continue to be a major source of funding for housing by providing mortgage loans and by investing directly in residential development.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage we will discuss in great detail how these things will be done and how they will be regulated.  In so far as it is appropriate to talk about building societies' philosophy and what this House would want from them, my concern as Labour Party spokesperson for the Environment is that they would not try to become banks, notwithstanding the fact that they will be liberalised so that they can effectively compete in a much more competitive marketplace but that they would remain essentially building societies, with the emphasis on building.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I detect a strong temptation in the utterances of some of the building society representatives and commentators that they want to get into the new buzz market <Col N="1591" /> of financial services.  I am not so sure that that market, which attracts a great deal of attention at present, is one for the long duration in a manner that some people think it is.  In so far as there is an ideological choice or a philosophical orientation of a strategic kind, I would like the Minister for the Environment to ensure, in the consultations he will have with his colleagues in the Department of Finance and the Central Bank, that in the implementation of this Bill the primary historical role of the building societies would be retained and that its emphasis would remain.</P>
    <P>We have to understand that we are witnessing the transfer of power from the Department of the Environment, albeit exercised by the Registrar of the Building Societies, to the Department of Finance. The Department of Finance are not my favourite Department, and I have some reservations about their ability to tell the building societies how to run their affairs. However, we will tease this matter out when we get to the relevant sections on Committee Stage.  I worry that the sanctions that require authorisation by the Minister for Finance will produce a hoard of informed experts from the Department of Finance who know how to tell everybody else how to run their business. I would like to put on record that that expertise has always been in the Department of the Environment &mdash; that expertise was evident when the Bank of Ireland moved on the Irish Civil Service Building Society &mdash; and that expertise and that concern for the historical role of building societies should continue.  The Minister might indicate in his reply to Second Stage what role he envisages for the Department of the Environment and for successive Ministers for the Environment relating to building societies.  That is the first point I want to make.</P>
    <P>Second, on the question of broadening the services, which are legally possible by virtue of this Bill whether in conveyancing, auctioneering or in other areas, I would want to be satisfied &mdash; I think this is addressed adequately in the Bill but we will have to look at it in detail <Col N="1592" />&mdash; that the primary function and role of building societies, that is, the taking of deposits, paying secure interest on deposits and giving loans and mortgages, would not be put at risk by these ancillary services.  Just because there is money to be made in auctioneering, conveyancing or any of the other activities, does not necessarily mean that the building societies would be best equipped to do so.  I do not think they should be allowed put at risk the deposits of investors so that they can climb up a learning curve in these areas.  We would want to be very careful of that.  However, as I said on Committee Stage we will be able to tease out exactly the extent to which depositors are protected, but that would be a broad concern. As Deputy Keating has said earlier not every building society will become involved in these activities.  What we are talking about is framework legislation that will empower and enable those societies which wish to undertake these activities to do so legally.  That does not automatically imply that all building societies will get involved in these activities.</P>
    <P>Third, against the background of the Single European Act and the completion of the internal market, the size of building societies sector in our economy is relatively small in contrast to the United Kingdom or some of the other continental equivalents of building societies or mortgage companies.  I would like to see the Minister taking a very active role in attempting to encourage mergers and amalgamations.  I know this is a somewhat tricky area and that there have been a few failed marriages already, or the line has been broken off may be a better way of describing it, because I do not think there is irretrievable breakdown &mdash; I suppose we can get Deputy Shatter to intervene on that basis, when he stops being so concerned about conveyancing solicitors and building societies&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not sufficient to have this new legislation in place, I hope the <Col N="1593" /> Minister will be able to tell us what the mood of the building societies is from an official point of view, because they were actively involved in preparing this document, and I would like to know what they see for themselves in terms of the future.</P>
      <P>The building societies enjoy considerable privileges, status and legal entitlements from this House and from the Oireachtas.  It is reasonable for us to want to know their overall strategy in the short-term and in the post-1992 environment. It is right that the State should be so concerned.  It is right that the State should intervene directly and direct them if amalgamation and rationalisation are not taking place with the speed or effectiveness that is perceived by many people to be necessary.  Again we can look at this area in some detail later.</P>
      <P>I would like to see the secondary source of housing finance, the traditional role of building societies, strengthened and enlarged as a consequence of this legislation. I want to see the Department of the Environment, which has the primary role in this area, declare a set of policy objectives, in consultation with the building societies, so that we can move together and have some input about the way building societies undertake their business.  It should be understood that the taxpayer is forfeiting £167 million in mortgage interest relief as a result of the various concessions.  Indirectly, we have a big stake in the mortgage business by way of the tax system, and that gives us both an entitlement and an obligation to look at this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to deal with the legal probability and possibility of building societies developing into the area of direct construction, and development and redevelopment. I have long held the view that the building societies have probably far more expertise in building and the financing of building than they have in banking.  However, for a number of reasons they have been reluctant to expand it.  In order to maintain their share of mortgages and the housing mortgage market I would hope that they would start to stimulate some new forms of supply, both in terms of residential units <Col N="1594" /> and different kind of mortgage to attract effectively into the home ownership market categories of people which are effectively excluded at present.</P>
    <P>For instance, if you are not on a local authority housing list, of if you are single &mdash; and particularly if you are single and female &mdash; or on a modest income, it is very difficult to get yourself adequately housed in the type of accommodation that meets your requirements.  Many people end up spending the middle years of their life, possibly the best years of their life, acquiring an asset at a very expensive rate and foregoing other pleasures, and the asset in turn is left to their nieces and nephews.  If such a person had a choice of acquiring smaller accommodation, or sharing the mortgage 50-50 with the building society so that they would have an asset and security, they would meet their requirements in a much more effective way.  They can only do that if the building societies broaden the range of facilities and housing supply in a manner which they are not doing at present.</P>
    <P>This is a framework document, it is not for the Minister to set out here exactly how that might be done, but it is properly a matter for housing supply and for housing policy.  In a different context, but within the same framework, it would be appropriate for the Minister, having regard to the substantial change in the demographic profile of the country and the implications of headship rates and household formation, to outline just how housing policy should change and what role the building societies would have in attempting to meet and match future housing demand.</P>
    <P>This Bill will enable us on Committee Stage to discuss in some detail the kind of things building societies will be legally empowered to do post the enactment of this legislation, which they currently cannot do.  In the absence of hearing from the building societies or from the Minister proposals as to what the Government would like to see happen, I suggest that these proposals be considered by the Minister and at the appropriate stage, either during the Committee Stage or <Col N="1595" /> soon after, that we would get some response from the Department with responsibility for housing.</P>
    <P>A number of things which were of considerable concern four or five years ago have disappeared and are no longer topical, but at the time they were very pressing and we could do little or nothing about them, for example, the scandal which then existed when people were forced onto bridging loans for six months at a time.  This all but appeared to be an act of collusion between the building societies on the one hand and banks on the other when, in fact, building societies were not legally empowered to give unsecured loans which this Bill will enable them to do.  If the horrendous problems experienced by people on bridging loans, which never seemed to end because of difficulties with regard to closing, etc., should begin to arise again they can be avoided so that the nightmare of extended bridging loans should, in theory, not raise its ugly head again.  The fact that there is a surfeit of mortgage funds at present has clouded one's memory of the difficulties people had in trying to get loans and the problems they had with building societies.  In so far as those problems existed in the past &mdash; and there is nothing to say that they cannot in theory arise again &mdash; I believe this Bill will considerably remove the obstacles which prevented either the Government of the day or the building societies from resolving those problems.</P>
    <P>I want to make some comments of a general nature &mdash; we can go into these in considerable detail on Committee Stage &mdash; on the management, operation and running of building societies.  Deputy Keating referred to this also.  I do not want to be repetitious but the inordinate energy the boards of directors of different societies appeared to devote to ensuring that individuals would not get elected to the boards of building societies gave rise for concern among members of the public.  It was not so much that they felt there was something wrong with building societies &mdash; I think the public in general are satisfied with building societies and <Col N="1596" /> have much to be thankful to them for &mdash; but it seemed extraordinary that so much effort generated such a response and I believe the new method of election and transparency of voting will be welcomed.</P>
    <P>The last point I want to make is in relation to the building societies themselves. According to information I have there were 165,000 mortgages at the end of 1987.  I do not think people understand &mdash; and as a public representative I have come across this &mdash; the extraordinary compassion building societies have exercised on numerous occasions with regard to families or mortgagees who have run into trouble on economic, personal or health grounds and the extraordinary lengths the building societies have gone to in rescheduling loans and accommodating people who have got into difficulties, some of which were self-imposed. There is a lot of compassion in the building society movement and they have provided cover and shelter for many people who would not have got the same compassion from banking concerns. Many business people would love to have had their mortgages with building societies rather than with banks.</P>
    <P>That is why I hope that the way building societies traditionally dealt with their customers, which grew out of an old co-operative movement which expressed social solidarity, will not be lost as a result of this new process.  That is not to say that every building society is a saint and every building society manager is beyond reproach.  That is not the case but in contrast to other financial institutions, primarily the banks, building societies have shown a degree of compassion in accommodating people in difficulties and I think every Deputy in this House could testify in part to that experience.  This compassion should not be lost in the process of broadening the legal framework within which building societies can operate if they become public limited companies. We would all be the poorer if that were to happen and the Department of the Environment who are the dominant source of funding for house building should ensure, by whatever means open to them, that that tradition is retained.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1597" /> There are over 100 sections in this Bill. It covers a wide range of areas and any additional comment on the Bill would be more appropriate to discussion on Committee Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister for introducing this Bill even though I do not agree with all of the preamble on page 2 of his speech about the disarray in which he found building societies when he took over as Minister.  The Minister said: &ldquo;However, when I came into the Department of the Environment in the spring of 1987, I found the building societies in a state of considerable uncertainty. The dismal position of the national economy had driven up the mortgage rate by three percentage points at the end of 1986&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I want to take issue with the Minister in that regard and to point out that the building societies must have been in considerable disarray in 1981 and 1982 because interest rates were slightly more doubtful at that time than when he came into office.  I am sorry the Minister did not give some recognition to the fact that his predecessors had under very difficult circumstances, during a four year period, taken decisions which were necessary to stabilise the flow of finances towards the house building and house purchase industry.  They also took decisions to supplement the building societies when interest rates were high &mdash; and I am talking about interest rates which were running towards the late teens or early twenties&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>As the Minister permitted himself a certain amount of nostalgia I thought I should take a little time off to make reference to that matter also. That four-year period was one of the most difficult in the history of the State in relation to the availability of finance for house purchase and house building and a great deal of effort and monitoring had to be done.  There were a number of times during that era when the building societies were not that pleased with the attitude of the Government but Governments have to take overall responsibility and an overview, and regardless of what financial institutions have to say about issues from time to time, the Government, the Minister and this House must take responsibility and have regard to the common good as opposed to taking a sectoral viewpoint.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to developments by the building societies during the past 12 months, I want to refer to the agreement between the Minister, the building societies and the banks in relation to the local authority loan system, how it operates and how the building societies and banks have to a certain extent taken over.  I agree that this system has been somewhat successful but the criteria applicable in meeting housing loan needs, as defined in the Housing Act, 1966, would not be as much to the fore if one applied for a loan to a building society or a bank in preference to a local authority.  I mention that simply because those of us who are members of local authorities have adequate experience and constant reminders of the way in which the system works.  There is a great availability of funds at present, whether from building societies or banks, for virtually anything in comparison to what was the case some five or six years ago.  This does not relate entirely to changes in administration or anything of that sort.  It is related to changing circumstances brought about over a long period of time and by very great effort and sacrifice on the part of many.  The Minister said that at that time the building societies were feeling the effects of the termination of the beneficial composite tax rate on investments on the <Col N="1599" /> introduction of the DIRT tax.  That tax still remains.  It has not gone away but nobody seems to worry about it any more.  The fact remains that whatever ill-effects it was having at that time, it is still having and will have in the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>Building societies in this country, in the range and scope of services they have to offer their clients, are very much restricted by comparison with those operating in the United Kingdom.  People with experience of house purchase in the United Kingdom will readily tell you that it is far easier to go through the process of obtaining a loan in respect of either a house which they intend to purchase or one which they intend to build.  The manner in which they proceed towards making savings and making their credit rating good is somewhat different.  The system in relation to the type of cover they must have in terms of insurance thereafter is somewhat different.  The various procedures in relation to conveyancing that have to be gone through are also somewhat different.  In the end, the Irish borrower, the person who wishes to buy or build a house, has to go through a system which has in it many more obstacles than does his or her counterpart across the water.  In the open economy we have at present, this is undesirable.  I shall come back to that subject later.</P>
    <P>Another development which has been taking place recently is that house property generally is firming up in terms of price.  That is regarded as being a useful development.  However, it is happening for a rather peculiar reason.  It is simply because quite a number of the purchases are being made by people living and working outside this State.  The effect of that in the long or the short term will be that if the money is coming from areas or the people are working in areas where property values have inflated sharply in the last couple of years, it is likely that that inflation will be transmitted through the financial system to this country.  In London, where private house property will cost anything up to £300,000 and <Col N="1600" /> £400,000, people working in that environment seeing the offer of a relatively reasonably priced house on the Irish market cannot but be impressed by its attractiveness.  They will put their money into that market and buy.  The effect on the downstream market in this country must be to inflate the cost of the house in question.  The purchase price at that stage bears no relation whatever to the cost of the house in terms of building it and hence its value as shelter.  Its price relates solely and wholly to the availability of money at the particular time.</P>
    <P>If we are not very careful we will find ourselves going down the road of galloping inflation as in the late seventies and into the eighties.  This time we will import all the inflation whereas on previous occasions we produced our own inflation.  As a result, property will increase to such an extent that it will bear no relation to the value or productive capacity of that property at a later stage. It will simply be related to the availability of finances.  That stage would offer a good opportunity to the Minister to consider the effects of such a development on the economy for any kind of prolonged period.  He might also consider what measures he might be prepared to take to alleviate the situation.  Some of my friends in the auctioneering business might not necessarily agree with all I have to say and a house vendor might not agree.  However, a house purchaser might very well have good reason to recognise the dangers in that kind of development.</P>
    <P>In the mid-to late seventies a standard family home cost somewhere in the region of £10,000 to £15,000.  In the space of two to three years, we saw such a property almost doubling in value. Everybody thought that a great idea, that it was a positive development, beneficial to the community.  It was not, simply because it pushed house prices that much further out of the reach of ordinary people and made it necessary for the banks, building societies and various other lending institutions to come up with more money, to lend more money into <Col N="1601" /> an inflated market, in order to buy property at an inflated price.  This spiral continued to such an extent that after a few years the availability of money slowed down because people were having extreme difficulty in trying to extricate themselves and meet their requirements. Then the bubble burst and the property market plummeted.  This was essentially as a result of the flow of money available being controlled, causing a problem that was not of the ordinary person's making. It was caused by people sitting behind desks who were in a position to decide whether more money would be made available at a particular time.  I am not criticising any one financial institution &mdash; they were all responsible and I suppose those going to lending institutions seeking financial accommodation probably were responsible also.  The unfortunate borrower is the person who must accept the liability afterwards.</P>
    <P>People will say it was a bad decision, that perhaps too much money was lent, that perhaps the interest rates were too high, that perhaps it should have been foreseen earlier that it would not be possible by any stretch of the imagination for the unfortunate borrower to meet those requirements.  That was all said afterwards. There is a very thin line of distinction between bad borrowing and bad lending.  The two very often are interlinked and merge with each other.  We can learn the lesson and not repeat past mistakes.  Those past mistakes were unregulated or uncontrolled lending by various institutions, all for the very best of reasons and all attempting to meet accommodation requirements but to such an extent that the entire property market was inflated out of all proportion.  I hope we will not have a recurrence of these problems.  I trust that the lesson will be well and truly learned, that we will have the courage to take the necessary action when the danger signals appear and put matters right.</P>
    <P>I now refer to the period between 1982 and 1985 or 1986 when the availability of funds from the building societies and most other quarters was very scant and <Col N="1602" /> the local authorities and the Housing Finance Agency had to fill the void by providing accommodation for a large and needy sector of the market.  That accommodation had to be provided by the State and I hope we will not see a repetition in the future.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Enterprise (Competition and Consumer Protection) Bill, 1989: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am obviously delighted to move the Second Reading of this Bill on behalf of the Progressive Democrats.  We have for some time been giving this whole area serious consideration and we realise that there is a great need for a wide range of new legislation.  We have taken the first step in introducing the Enterprise (Competition and Consumer Protection) Bill, 1989, because of the urgent need to outlaw anti-competitive practices.  As long ago as 1975 the Restrictive Practices Commission first called for this type of legislation, yet 14 years later no such legislation has been passed.  If we want our economy to develop at a rate comparable with that of our partners in Europe, we cannot simply rely on the business community to make all the progress. The Oireachtas failed over many years to keep legislation up to date and this has hindered may areas of business from developing.  This is not a desirable state of affairs, particularly when one considers that the Irish economy is one of the most open in the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am convinced that the lack of proper legislative planning has hindered job creation by not creating the necessary environment for a competitive economy to grow and prosper.  Our legislation tends to protect restrictive practices and anti-competitive conduct in many sectors of industry, trade and professional services. This Bill will for the first time introduce <Col N="1603" /> into our law a general prohibition on anti-competitive practices in all sectors of the economy.  The lack of competitive forces operating in many sectors has caused areas of industry and business to be run very inefficiently.  This has been the case simply because businesses have not had to compete at the same level as many companies in other countries.  This factor has caused many job losses and has led to lack of growth in areas of job creating potential.</P>
    <P>This Bill will also have major benefits for the Irish consumer, who for many years in a whole range of areas has not had freedom of choice in the purchase of goods and services because of restrictive practices and anti-competitive forces. The consumer is entitled to a much better deal and it is up to us in the Oireachtas to put right the wrongs that we allowed to happen by not keeping up to date with an imaginative legislative programme. The operation, for instance, of scale fees across the whole range of professional services is extremely restrictive and does not give a fair range of choice of service or price to the consumer.</P>
    <P>The provision of goods from suppliers to purchasers can operate in a very restrictive way.  There are many instances of purchasers being able to get exclusivity in relation to certain goods coming into the marketplace.  This is often done to the exclusion of all others.  This in many cases puts the purchaser in a very powerful position with regard to the supplier and he is eventually able to dictate terms and price, which many suppliers have to accept if they are not to be forced out of business.  This is a very serious abuse and such practices must be outlawed.  Unfortunately the Restrictive Practices Acts of 1972 and 1987 contain no general prohibition on anti-competitive practices. The Minister can from time to time, under section 8 of the 1972 Act, make a restrictive practices order relating to particular areas of the economy.  While, for example, the Restrictive Practices (Grocery) Order of 1987 prohibits price fixing in the retail grocery sector, there is no general ban on such anti-competitive <Col N="1604" /> behaviour.  Under our domestic law price fixing and price collusion, which is especially prevalent in the professional services sector, is not unlawful.  I am not trying to point the finger exclusively at one area because the professional services sector in general are operating quite rightly within the terms of our domestic law as it stands.  Because of this there is no onus on them to change their ways. This Bill should have a major impact in this area and should encourage a much more competitive environment which would benefit everybody.</P>
    <P>The Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade, who is an autonomous official, is charged with enforcing the present statutory provisions.  While one can make a complaint to the director and he can take certain action on behalf of the complainant, including seeking injunctive relief in the High Court, the director is not a judicial personage and therefore he is not in a position to award damages to a trader or an individual who has been seriously injured by the anti-competitive practices of another.  The major principle established by this Bill is the provision that the courts may award damages to a person aggrieved by anti-competitive practices.  The power of the courts to award damages in such cases will without doubt be the most effective way of ensuring that the competition laws are fully adhered to.</P>
    <P>It has already been seen in the European Court of Justice, under articles 85 and 86, and also in the United States under the Sherman anti-trust legislation, that the powers to award damages are the most effective way of ensuring that these laws are adhered to.  We have given lengthy consideration to this aspect of the Bill and we are convinced that without the ability of the courts to award damages in such cases it would be much more difficult for this legislation to be effective. Companies or individuals who seek to ignore this legislation will have a very strong deterrent because of the possibility of an injured party receiving damages if the courts rule that anti-competitive <Col N="1605" /> practices are in operation.  This legislation is strengthened greatly by this provision, which will have a direct bearing on its successful application.</P>
    <P>We have deliberately modelled this Bill on the provisions of articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty of Rome, which are framed in general terms.  Their objective is to render illegal all anti-competitive behaviour. Irish companies which trade internationally are subject to the provisions of the Treaty of Rome under articles 85 and 86.  We have seen an example during the recent take-over bid for Irish Distillers, when the European Commission intervened. This was only possible because this company traded on the international market.  These provisions do not apply to companies which trade on the domestic market but do not engage in inter-state trade.  This is a very serious flaw in our legislation.  The companies who are trading abroad on the international market probably represent the most dynamic aspect of our economy, the area which is showing most growth and the greatest potential for job creation.  This is occurring because they are subject to the full rigours of competition.  Competition in a legal framework is only the means to allow competitive forces to operate.  The business community and the industrial world will take up the opportunities given to them if they can be more competitive. That means companies competing with one another and a much more efficient sector operating in the economy.  The companies operating in the competitive area are also up to date and their forward planning and streamlining of their operations are much better.  This is all brought about simply because they must keep ahead of the posse.  They know if they do not maintain their position in the marketplace inevitably they will fall by the wayside.</P>
    <P>Why is this not in operation in our own domestic economy?  It is in this area we are seriously falling down.  The European economy is booming yet our economy is not expanding or showing the growth which is occurring in other economies. The reason for this is the operation on the Irish domestic scene of such restrictive <Col N="1606" /> practices and anti-competitive operations as to render many areas of the economy useless because there is no growth.  The reason for this is that they are not subject to full competition or the type of operation in the international sector which has shown this country what that means, where the growth and the expansion are coming from.  This is a serious handicap on the Irish domestic scene and we must face up to it in terms of our legislation.</P>
    <P>We &mdash; particularly the Government &mdash; have been informing Irish business of the advent of the single market which will be created in Europe.  It is wrong to think of this market in terms of the future as we have already seen the benefits to some extent.  We must, in our legislative programme, put measures in train now that will help our companies to face the rigours of competition which will undoubtedly come in the not too distant future. We cannot on the one hand dictate to Irish business about what will happen if on the other hand this House does not implement the kind of legislation necessary to allow them to be open to the type of forces which will be in operation. Because of the failure to put that legislative programme in train we are introducing this Bill.</P>
    <P>Another drawback in relation to the present restrictive practices legislation is that the legality of certain practices is not judged solely by reference to their anti-competitive effect.  For example, professional bodies can still arrange to fix fees and exclude price competition on the grounds that this is not unreasonable because, in their view, such price fixing arrangements are in the public interest and are required by a professional code of practice.  It would not be possible under our proposals to justify a restrictive practice according to such extraneous and subjective criteria.  In this country the full weight of these kind of practices should be outlawed by bringing in the necessary legislation.  The competition provisions of the Treaty of Rome are in operation in most of the economies throughout Europe but they are not fully operational in this country.</P>
    <P>Under this Bill all sectors of the Irish <Col N="1607" /> economy will be subject to broadly the same competition irrespective of whether there is an international dimension to that trade.  That is a fundamental point because, as I said, it is wrong that certain sectors of the Irish domestic business community should be subject to one set of rules while others are subject to a different set.  This country is too small to operate on such a basis.  The economy is not that well spread &mdash; the same applies to the business community &mdash; in respect of such a huge, wide and diverse range of activities.  It is wrong, therefore, that there should be such different areas operating under different legislation.</P>
    <P>For many years the public sector has been in a privileged position and their monopoly has not allowed them to grow efficiently, to prosper and ultimately to provide the best possible service for the consumer.  A very good example of this was the deregulation in relation to air transport.  The position of Aer Lingus was very seriously questioned and it was pointed out quite forcefully that if any changes occurred the company would be in serious jeopardy.  However, the result was the full weight of competitive forces and the irony is that it has greatly benefited the State company involved.  They have increased their capacity and prices to the consumer have dropped substantially. There are many new companies &mdash; mainly Ryanair &mdash; in operation who have also grown, providing employment for people who would otherwise have emigrated.  That is one example of the type of forces that should be brought to bear on companies.</P>
    <P>We have also introduced a saver in the Bill for the statutory position of State monopolies but it does not cover the whole area.  There are many State monopolies, Dublin Bus, Bus Éireann, the ESB and many others who operate under licence and it is in the Minister's area of responsibility to take this legislation into consideration.  It is not in the consumer's interests to allow State monopolies. When there is competition there is a demand for the consumer for the services. It is our contention that the full <Col N="1608" /> weight of competition should be allowed to operate in these areas because otherwise there will not be an efficient State sector or an efficient service in other areas because they are not subject to competition.  For that reason, they do not feel the weight of change in the marketplace or do not necessarily have to react to it because their position is protected.  Is that a desirable state of affairs?</P>
    <P>I accept that changes are occurring at present in the area of broadcasting, for instance&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>That should not be the end of it, it should just be the beginning.  Why do we have to wait so long to make these changes when we have witnessed at first hand the great opportunities that have been created?  The reaction in the State sector has not been detrimental; there has been active growth and an improvement in the services provided.  The introduction of this legislation will allow for competition.  The Government should have done this long ago because the Restrictive Practices Commission asked for this type of legislation as long ago as 1975.  We do not have to wait continually until such time as some Department or Minister sees fit to suddenly decide to go down this road.  This should be an ongoing legislative programme from the Minister for Industry and Commerce and indeed from many other Departments.  It should not be once-off legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our intention in introducing the Bill is to make it known that we have other areas of legislation which we want to introduce which will be in keeping with this development, with trying to get our economy on an equal footing, not just in the European context but on a world scale.  The Irish economy is very open and this legislation is probably most beneficial to it in that it will allow us to compete with companies who will come to this country and who will compete on an equal footing with our companies in the not too distant future.  However, we are <Col N="1609" /> not putting in train the necessary legislation to allow this to happen.  We urgently need to do this and I sincerely hope that the Government and the Opposition parties will support this Bill because we have drawn it up in a very specific way.  We have not ranged over a huge area of domestic law as we thought it would be better to be specific and deal with a specific area.  That is the issue of restrictive practices and anti-competitive forces which operate here.</P>
    <P>I am happy to have the opportunity to introduce this Bill and, with the permission of the House, I will share my time with Deputy Michael McDowell.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I wish to congratulate Deputy Cullen for introducing a Bill of this kind for debate in this House, and I thank the House for giving me the opportunity to speak at this stage.  As Deputy Cullen said, the 1972 and 1987 restrictive practices code is of its nature limited in its operation.  It is limited by virtue of the fact that the initiative in relation to its operation has to come from an official source &mdash; such as the Examiner or Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade.  It has to go through the cumbersome process of inquiry; it has to go through the process of making orders, some of which may have to be ratified by this House.  In a <Col N="1610" /> sense, it is a code which brings about in particular areas to remedy anti-competitive problems, individualised measures which arise from a complex, legal and legislative process.  In my view, that process is cumbersome and gives rise to undue delay.  To a person who has been adversely affected by an anti competitive practice, it offers no hope of individual relief.</P>
      <P>The Irish economy is small; it is not the same as the American or European Community economies and in that sense different considerations come into play. I do not believe for one minute that the introduction of legislation of this kind would give rise to multi-million pound suits along the lines of anti-trust law in America or that we will see the volume of litigation as occurs within the European Economic Community, or that our courts will be flooded with complaints of a malicious or a tactical kind from persons who merely wish to use the law as an adjunct to their competitive market strategies in order to get at their competition.</P>
      <P>What is commendable about this Bill is that it introduces into Irish law a new area of economic civil liability.  At present we have a system of law in which certain rights are protected &mdash; goodwill and the like through passing off law and through trade mark law, property rights and inventions through the patent law. Curiously we have inherited from the 19th century a Manchester school based economic theory in our law which states that anything which is competitive, as long as that is described in terms of cutting price, is necessarily good, but there is no legal liability on anyone who builds a monopoly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As against that we have the restrictive practices code.  The Minister also has powers under the mergers and monopolies code to prevent the emergence of over-sized or over dominant companies, or an aggregation of businesses.  What is lacking is day to day legal liability for anti-competitive practice designed in the long run to damage the free market. Because of the way the economic aspects of our civil law has developed, the courts do not have any philosophy or guidance <Col N="1611" /> from this Legislature in recent times as to how they should interpret the needs of a complex society and the long-term needs as opposed to the short-term needs of competition.</P>
    <P>The anti trust legislation in the USA is designed to prevent the over domination of any market by any combination of companies or individual company.  They have very wide powers, including the power to break up concerns which have grown too large or become too dominant. This legislation, introduced by Deputy Cullen, is not concerned with the same thing, but with something different.  It is concerned primarily, and I think practically, with the remedy that is available to someone who is adversely affected by anti-competitive practices.  Deputy Cullen referred to the professions and the introduction of scaled fees.  As he pointed out, it is open to a profession to defend their scale fees as reasonable under present law and to speak in terms of the interests of the profession in relation to such scaled fees but what is not there is a view that those who are adversely affected by the maintenance of the scaled fees structure have a remedy against a profession which is doing them damage.</P>
    <P>This does not only apply to the professions. We should also take a look at the variety of circumstances to which this particular code, if enacted, will apply.  It applies just as much to newspapers in so far as they tend to control the outlets through which their product can be purchased and restricts them to a small number of newsagents in any given town or any given suburb.  I know of people who want to run shops and sell newspapers but who cannot do so because they run into a restrictive practice of this kind.  That in my view is in many cases unjustified but it is very easy to demonstrate occasions when there are justifiable restrictions of that kind.  For instance, the price fixing arrangements which apply to the sale of books through bookshops are justifiable because the purpose is to prevent the best seller of the week being sold through the local supermarket and the elimination of <Col N="1612" /> specialist book stores.  There are circumstances where the public good can be shown to justify what on the face of it appears to be price fixing or an anti-competitive measure.  This Bill has the advantage that there is a presumption that an anti-competitive practice is void, that it is not in the public interest, and that those who engage in price fixing or restrictive trade cartel agreements are indulging in anti-competitive activity which they must justify.  The obligation to register price fixing agreements and agreements of an anti-competitive kind would place a duty on these people to justify their particular measures as being compatible with competition and designed in the last analysis to bring about an improvement in the economic well being of the State.</P>
    <P>The powers given to the director of Consumer Affairs under this legislation are designed to dovetail with his existing powers under the Restrictive Practices Act.  The purpose is not to create another quango of another body involving another layer of bureaucracy in Irish industry and commerce, but on the contrary, to give to an individual who has already some responsibility under the restrictive practices code and who has experience of the consumer interest as opposed to the trade interest a general role to police the price fixing and anti-competitive practices in trade and industry.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cullen is absolutely right when he says the best means of enforcement is to provide a remedy which is available to anyone who is affected adversely and to provide that person with a legal remedy, that is a remedy in damages.  As he says, the greatest possible deterrent to somebody who is contemplating a collusive arrangement, a price-fixing arrangement or an abusive dominant position is to realise that if he pushes someone to the wall, forces somebody into liquidation, or by the steps he has taken pushes somebody into insolvency to the detriment of the common good, the consequence will rebound against him; it will cost him money out of his own pocket.  Therefore, <Col N="1613" /> people who engage in these anti-competive practices within the context of free enterprise know they take on themselves and carry with their activities certain risks and effectively have to police themselves in relation to the ethics of the marketplace.</P>
    <P>There are thousands of different ways in which this legislation will have effect if enacted.  The thing about it that impresses me most is that it gives to the courts general principles which they are to apply.  It spells out where necessary instances of what amount to anti-competitive practices and in general terms it leaves, for instance, the jurisprudence of the EC in relation to abuse of dominant position available to the Irish courts to interpret and use as they like.  Clearly, &ldquo;dominant position&rdquo; means one thing in Europe and a different thing on the Irish market, but there are all sorts of ways in which dominant positions manifest themselves as potential opportunities for abuse of the market.</P>
    <P>One only has to instance the power of wholesales in, say, the liquor trade tied house agreements which are much less prevalent here than in say, Britain, because of the action of the trade itself in resisting the efforts of breweries some ten or 20 years ago to indulge in vertical expansion into the retail trade.  Those kinds of agreements may or may not be in the best interests of the consumer. There is a strong argument for the proposition that in many cases they are designed to resist competition to nibble away at competitive forces and price competition in public houses.  The structure of benefits to publicans which the breweries and distilleries have at their disposal as a means of attempting to dominate that trade, while at the moment have not had gross effects, have had a considerable effect in undermining the Minister's commendable efforts to bring down prices for the tourist trade.  It is a factor we must take into account.</P>
    <P>We live in a rapidly changing world.  In 1992 why should British breweries not decide that what is available to them in <Col N="1614" /> terms of tied houses on the British mainland would be a very suitable arrangement in terms of the Irish market?  We live in a world where money talks and one only has to look at the betting trade to see where money really talked in terms of the way in which the Irish market was substantially invaded by British interests. That may well be in the interest of the punter in terms of the betting market and I am not suggesting it is wrong, but if we allow huge resources to become available and to play on the Irish market we must have in place some better protection than is available under the Restrictive Practices Acts.  We must have some better protection against abuse of a dominant position.</P>
    <P>Any British brewer could buy and sell the Irish market.  They could buy and sell the entire publican trade in this country if they put their minds to it and could buy substantial slices of that trade if they were willing to pour money into the Irish market.  I am not saying that is wrong and it may be inevitable to some extent unless there is some mechanism whereby those who are adversely affected by it, those who feel tied houses are contrary to the public interest, can take effective action not simply on a direction from the Minister but operating on the basis of a clearly understood law which prohibits anti-competitive law or the abuse of dominant positions.</P>
    <P>There are many other ways in which this Bill, if enacted, could have a substantially improving effect on the quality of services available.  For instance, where an Irish semi-State company is at the moment in competition with licensed competitors, as happens as Deputy Cullen said in the road transport area, there is huge potential for competition to bring down prices and push up the quality of service.  However, if we allow our semi-State sector to be virtually immune from adherence to a fair competitive code, then we always face the difficulty, and it is not a novelty, that private enterprise in competition with the State sector will claim that where prices are brought down, when the State sector begins to act commercially and aggressively in the <Col N="1615" /> market, the taxpayers' money is being used to compete unfairly.</P>
    <P>One very interesting thing in Deputy Cullen's Bill is the proposal that State enterprise of a commercial kind, identified as I understand it by reference to worker participation as a code in order to identify what are and what are not commercial State enterprises, should in their dealings with their licensed competitors be subject to the same code of ethics and the same law relating to what is and is not fair competition.  This measure as proposed by Deputy Cullen is one which this House should consider.  Maybe people feel the wide-ranging nature of sections 1 and 2 of the Bill is such as to create problems, but the principle is undoubtedly right.  If there are problems, small print qualifications or hesitations on the part of some parties in this House in regard to the legislation as introduced, the remedy surely is to consider this on Committee Stage.  It would do enormous good if the Dáil were to signal to Irish business that the era of the unnecessary middleman, the unnecessary commercial flab, is ending, not simply because of competitive forces coming in 1992 but because it is harmful to the Irish consumer as well.  If we were to signal unequivocally that those who want to compete fairly and to take on the existing structure of Irish industry and commerce will get a charter of fair trading which is enforceable, that would be an immense benefit.</P>
    <P>I do not want the Minister, his Department or his officials to take the view that this is an attack on the restrictive practices code; it is not.  It is an effort to transform it into something much more dynamic within the economy.  It is an effort to change the whole emphasis of competition legislation in Ireland to one which is automatic, which invades every sector of Irish life, which does not depend on executive interference to activate it, which works automatically to sustain competition.  Perhaps a national failing is that so often we feel there must be an agency to do this or that, that the Government or the totally shapeless &ldquo;they&rdquo;<Col N="1616" /> should do something about this or that. That spirit is so often embodied in legislation which has come from this House. The Bill seeks to change our basic economic civil law and introduce a new principle of competition as a matter of law. It seeks to put into the business of market transactions an ethic which is not anti-business but pro-competition.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cullen is to be commended on introducing the Bill.  Would the Minister address himself to the whole issue of embedding in every aspect of Irish law the spirit of competition?  He should agree with Deputy Cullen that the time has come for a legislative mechanism which works by itself, which is effective in its own right and which has the effect of breaking down restrictive practices whether they are in the professions, in the retail trade, in industry, importing or in the economic realms of middlemen. Wherever there is inhibition to low price and to real value there should be some automatic element in our law working and fighting in the other direction. Deputy Cullen's Bill marks the first occasion that the House has been invited to give serious consideration to how that revolution for competition and enterprise can be brought about.  The Minister should support it on Second Stage and send it to a committee of the House.  He should not give us the stock answer that he has some ideas for reform in the area. He should send the Bill to a committee which will, as happened in relation to Deputy Shatter's Bill, produce quicker than we could otherwise expect a worthwhile reform in our law.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Cullen's proposed Bill involves a very fundamental proposal which would, if accepted, change the basis of Irish competition legislation from the control of abuse system which we currently have to a &ldquo;prohibition&rdquo; system modelled on the provisions of Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty of Rome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the outset I think it would be helpful if I were to outline to the House the approach of Articles 85 and 86 and then <Col N="1617" /> to compare with these the present Irish competition legislation.  Article 85 generally prohibits all agreements or concerted practices which are likely to distort competition in trade between member states and which have as their object or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition within the Common Market.  Generally the prohibitions under Article 85 do not apply to agreements which contribute to improving the production or distribution of goods or to promoting technical or economic progress, while allowing consumers a fair share of the resulting benefit, and which do not have an appreciable effect on trade between member states or on competition.</P>
    <P>A number of block exemption regulations have, however, been made by the EC Commission covering several areas such as exclusive dealing agreements, special vehicle distribution agreements, patent licensing agreements, motor vehicle distribution and servicing and research and development.  Each block exemption regulation has a fixed period of validity, but it can be extended in its original or amended form.  If an agreement satisfies a particular block exemption, that is, it contains what is allowed and does not contain clauses which are prohibited, then the agreement benefits from exemptions under Article 85 without the need for notification.</P>
    <P>Under Article 86 any abuse by one or more undertakings of a dominant position within the Common Market or in a substantial part of it where it may affect trade between member states is prohibited as incompatible with the Common Market.  The mere possession of a dominant position, however, is not prohibited.  The Article outlines a list which is not exhaustive, of ways in which a dominant position may be abused.  They are: imposing, directly or indirectly, unfair prices or other trading conditions; limiting production, markets or technical development to the detriment of consumers; placing other trading parties at a competitive disadvantage by applying dissimilar conditions to equivalent transactions; and making other trading parties <Col N="1618" /> accept supplementary conditions which, by their nature or commercial usage, have no connection with the subject of the main contract.  There are no provisions or possibilities for exemptions from the prohibitions under Article 86.</P>
    <P>Control of trade practices in Ireland is covered by the Restrictive Practices Act, 1972, as amended by the Restrictive Practices (Amendment) Act, 1987.  In the mergers and take-overs area the relevant legislation is the Mergers, Take-overs and Monopolies (Control) Act, 1978, which was also amended by the Restrictive Practices (Amendment) Act, 1987. Irish legislation permits the investigation by the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade and the Fair Trade Commission of trading practices to determine whether they are unfair.  If it is considered that the practices examined operate against the common good, the practices may be prohibited by ministerial orders, which come into effect on confirmation by Acts of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The Schedule to the Restrictive Practices Act, 1972, contains a list of unfair practices to which the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade and the Fair Trade Commission must have regard when they are carrying out investigations into practices to determine whether they are unfair.  Both of these Acts were amended by the Restrictive Practices (Amendment) Act, 1987, which came into effect on 25 January 1988.  The effect of this Act was to streamline operations in the institutional arrangements in the areas of competition and consumer protection by merging the functions of the Examiner of Restrictive Practices with the Director of Consumer Affairs.  The Act by assigning the Examiner's functions under the Restrictive Practices Act, 1972, to the director was intended to result in greater efficiency and a reduction in the number of State bodies and has helped towards the more coherent and integrated administration of related policy resources.</P>
    <P>In addition to the above-mentioned basic Acts there are Ministerial Orders in respect of the following trades: grocery, carpets, motor spirits, jewellers, motor <Col N="1619" /> cars, radios, cookers and ranges, electrical goods, building materials, hand knits, intoxicating liquors and non-alcoholic drinks.  The Restrictive Practices Act, 1972, and the Mergers, Take-overs and Monopolies (Control) Act, 1978, as amended by the Restrictive Practices (Amendment) Act, 1987, together with the 11 Ministerial Orders which I have mentioned represent collectively the body of Irish statute law on competition.</P>
    <P>The suggestion that Irish competition should be changed from a control of abuse system to a prohibition system was among other things considered by the Restrictive Practices Commission, which is now called the Fair Trade Commission, in a 1977 study of legislation on competition policy in Ireland.  More recently during the passage of the Restrictive Practices (Amendment) Bill, 1987, which dealt with some of the aspects of that report the same suggestion was made. My predecessor at the Department of Industry and Commerce, Deputy Albert Reynolds, accepted the suggestion at that time to exercise his powers under section 12 of the Restrictive Practices Act, 1972, to have the Restrictive Practices Commission carry out an investigation of the case for and against the introduction of the prohibition type of legislation similar to that in Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty of Rome.  Accordingly on 20 January 1988 the Commission were requested to carry out such an investigation.  This investigation is currently in hands and I expect their report to be available to me within the next few months.  The Commission in fact invited submissions from interested parties, representative bodies or undertakings in relation to the proposed study in March 1988, but due to the increased work load faced by the Commission in carrying out their new functions under the Mergers, Take-overs and Monopolies (Control) Act, 1978, as amended, it has not been possible for them to complete the study earlier. In addition it has been necessary to obtain legal opinions on certain aspects of the study.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1620" /> Before providing my own views in this regard I would point out, however, that the Government, by virtue of promoting the Restrictive Practices (Amendment) Act, 1987, successfully through Dáil Éireann have already undertaken extensive amendment of our national competition legislation, the effect of which, as I have pointed out, was to streamline operations in the institutional arrangements in the areas of competition and consumer protection.  I would like to take this opportunity to remind the House of the change brought about by the 1987 Act.</P>
    <P>The Act provided for a Fair Trade Commission to replace the present Restrictive Practices Commission.  The new commission was given greater powers to inquire into anti-competitive and unfair trading practices.  In addition it was given the function of investigating any proposed merger or take-over referred to it by the Minister under the Mergers, Take-overs and Monopolies (Control) Act, 1978.  Previous to this such investigations were carried out by the Examiner of Restrictive Practices whose office was abolished.  The remit of the Director of Consumer Affairs was widened to include fair trade and additional functions in the area of consumer protection, including the enforcement of prices and other consumer-related legislation. The title of the Office of Director was accordingly changed to the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade.  The director took over the role of the Examiner of Restrictive Practices under the Restrictive Practices Act, 1972.  The director was also given new powers to take civil legal proceedings in relation to the Sale of Goods Act, 1893 and the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act, 1980.  Finally, the scope of competition legislation is being extended to include banks, communications and electricity services which had been previously excluded.</P>
    <P>In considering the need for new measures in the regulation of competition, it is important to bear in mind the purpose of competition legislation and, indeed, <Col N="1621" /> the function which competition itself fulfils in the economy.  When operating fairly, competition is a healthy element in the market.  It should not be viewed as an aim in itself but rather as an essential means towards the improvement of production so as to encourage an efficient economy and to benefit the consumer. Restrictive practices reduce the choice open to the consumer and can lead to higher prices than might otherwise prevail in an unrestricted market.  Also, an informed consumer is a valuable stimulus to industry, requiring producers to remain efficient and in touch with consumers' requirements.</P>
    <P>I will turn now to a comparison of the various advantages and disadvantages of the &ldquo;prohibition&rdquo; and &ldquo;control of abuse&rdquo; systems.  While the &ldquo;prohibition&rdquo; system may be more desirable than the &ldquo;control of abuse&rdquo; system contained in our existing legislation, the &ldquo;prohibition&rdquo; system has many disadvantages attached to it in practice.  Under the &ldquo;prohibition&rdquo; system, in theory it gives greater legality security to EC companies as they are obliged under the EC system to seek legal clearance in advance for any general agreement or undertakings which they may enter into with others because of the blanket ban on all restrictive practices.</P>
    <P>In practice, however, it has in the past given rise to huge volumes of agreements notified to the Commission with resulting long delays in dealing with individual cases and has resulted in temporary &ldquo;negative clearances&rdquo; being granted along with letters of comfort which have no legal standing, to the companies involved.  Were this system to be introduced here the same problems may be anticipated.  In response to this, the EC Commission have, in recent years, embarked on a course of exempting whole sectors from the scope of the general prohibition by means of special regulations which have been adopted in respect of, <i>inter alia</i>, exclusive purchasing agreements, exclusive distribution agreements, specialisation agreements and motor dealerships, and the afore-mentioned &ldquo;comfort&rdquo; letters on individual cases giving provisional sanction to <Col N="1622" /> agreements although, as has been pointed out by UNICE, these letters have no legal basis and are, therefore, of little practical use to the company concerned.</P>
    <P>The process of notifying agreements to the European Commission, then exempting certain agreements, or issuing comfort letters in other cases, has resulted in great delays in establishing whether or not agreements are in breach of Articles 85 or 86.  Experience has shown that the inflexibility inherent in a prohibition system can be a major disadvantage in economic terms whereas a control of abuse system can be used in a more satisfactory fashion using existing resources and having regard to particular priority areas at any given point in time.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I do not wish to rule out the possibility of accepting the EC's &ldquo;prohibition&rdquo; system for the regulation of competition in the longer term.  The FTC is currently undertaking a detailed study of the respective merits and disadvantages of the prohibition and control of abuse systems.  This investigation, among other things, is addressing the constitutional question of whether it would be possible to grant the FTC for example the kind of judicial powers similar to those already vested in the EC Commission.  Other questions which are being addressed are: which of the EC Commission's existing powers could be exercised by the FTC; which of the powers which could not be exercised by the FTC could be exercised by the Minister for Industry and Commerce and subject to what conditions for example subject to approval by the Oireachtas and if neither the FTC nor the Minister could exercise any of the EC's present powers what body could exercise them?</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the EC's prohibition system would be likely to be extremely costly in terms of its operation and enforcement and would be likely to entail a significant burden on scarce resources if the system was to be properly policed. In countries which operate such a system, particularly where there is no procedure for block exemption, a large staff is required to ensure that agreements can be examined and decisions given.  The <Col N="1623" /> absence of an efficient and adequately staffed authority would result in an extremely onerous and expensive burden of litigation being placed on business.  At a time of constrained resources I cannot guarantee that a large body of staff could be made available and I do not intend to impose a new cost burden on business.</P>
    <P>There are other issues which are raised in the Bill.  Statutory control of restrictive practices in Ireland is committed to three authorities; the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade; the Fair Trade Commission and the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  While the Bill currently before the House has addressed the future role of the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade it gives absolutely no indication of the future role it envisages for the Fair Trade Commission. As the legislation currently stands, the Fair Trade Commission is empowered to carry out a number of important functions.  I would like to go through these now and ask Deputy Cullen which, if any, of these functions he intends the Fair Trade Commission to carry out in the future.</P>
    <P>Under section 5 of the Restrictive Practices Act, 1972, as amended, the Fair Trade Commission can cause inquiries to be held into the conditions which obtain in regard to the supply and distribution of goods and the provision of services and into the operation of an order under section 8.  Does Deputy Cullen envisage that the Fair Trade Commission will no longer have to carry out this function under his proposed prohibition system? If this is the case he should have provided for the repeal of this section in the Bill currently before the House.</P>
    <P>If we look at section 7 of the 1972 Act, we find that reports of inquiries by the commission under section 5 of the 1972 Act shall, among other things, state whether the Commission are of the opinion that the Minister should make an order under section 8 of the Act.  Section 9 (1) of Deputy Cullen's Bill provides for the repeal of section 8 of the 1972 Act thereby taking away from the Minister the power to make restrictive practice <Col N="1624" /> orders.  It does not make any sense to have a section in the 1972 Act providing for the Commission to give an opinion on whether an order should be made when under one of the provisions of the draft Bill being discussed the Minister would no longer have the power to make orders.</P>
    <P>Another example of poor drafting in the Bill is found if one looks at the provisions of section 8 of the Restrictive Practices (Amendment) Act, 1987.  This section provides that notwithstanding anything in the 1972 Act the Minister for Industry and Commerce whenever he considers it expedient and after consultation with the Fair Trade Commission, the Director or any other Minister of the Government concerned may make restrictive practice orders.  If it is the intention of Deputy Cullen's Bill to remove order-making powers from the Minister, then it would be necessary to provide for the repeal of section 8 of the 1987 Act in addition to section 8 of the 1972 Act.</P>
    <P>Does Deputy Cullen intend that the Fair Trade Commission will continue to cause inquiries to be held into the refusal/alleged refusal by employers and/or employees to use particular materials or particular methods for manufacturing or construction purposes? Under existing legislation the Fair Trade Commission may hold special reviews of the operation of a section 8 order and submit reports to the Minister on their findings.  If they are of the opinion that the Minister should amend the order they should recommend accordingly and indicate the form of amending order they recommend.  If the Commission are of the opinion that the Minister should revoke the order they shall recommend accordingly in their report.  As you will know by now, section 9 (1) of Deputy Cullen's Bill removes order amending and order revoking powers from the Minister so where does that leave the above provisions?</P>
    <P>Section 12 of the 1972 Act provides for the commission to study and analyse the effect on the common good of methods of competition, types of restrictive practice, monopolies, the structure of any market, <Col N="1625" /> amalgamation of or acquisition of control of bodies corporate, the operation of multinational enterprises and relevant legislation.  Will the Fair Trade Commission cease to have this function under Deputy Cullen's Bill and if this is the case why has no provision been made for the repeal of this section?</P>
    <P>One of the self-professed highlights of the Bill currently being discussed is the provision relating to jurisdiction to award damages and other reliefs.  Is this in addition to the provisions in sections 19 and 23 of the existing legislation or did Deputy Cullen intend that this provision should no longer be applicable?  I could give you numerous further examples along the lines of the above but I do not wish to labour this point any further.  I think I have said enough to highlight the very poor drafting of the Bill.  The Bill fails to address the question of where the present legislation fits into the Deputy's proposed new scheme of things.  A glaring failure is the omission of any reference to the role of the Fair Trade Commission in his proposed legislation.  I would be very interested to know exactly what role the Deputy envisages for this statutory body.  There are other deficiencies in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 1, according to the explanatory memorandum, is the equivalent of Article 85 of the Treaty. However, it departs from it in respects that I find puzzling. First, in subsection 2 (d) it outlaws agreements that provide for equitable treatment among trading parties.  This is quite contrary to the corresponding provision in the Treaty and I would appreciate an explanation for this.  More puzzling still, when it comes to the question of exemptions, there is no guarantee in the section of any benefit to the consumer. The Treaty of Rome, in Article 85 (3), allows for exemption from the general prohibition on anti-competitive agreements but, it is essential to any such exemption that consumers are allowed a fair share of results of any improvement in production or distribution or promotion of technical and economic progress. No such guarantee exists in this <Col N="1626" /> Bill.  Difficulties similar to the first I mentioned arise in section 2.</P>
    <P>Sections 4 to 6 provide for the notification to the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade of agreements and his making decisions on them.  Whether the director is the appropriate authority is open to question.  This I say not to cast any reflection on any holder of the post but rather to raise the issue of whether such significant decisions should be taken by an individual.  It is worth considering whether a collegiate authority would be more appropriate.  The Fair Trade Commission is clearly one possibility.  The commission have the experience of assessing the economic impact of arrangements.  The director's office is more geared for investigation with a view to prosecution.  There is a difference in the roles of the two bodies and they should not be blurred.</P>
    <P>The deficiencies in the Bill that I have referred to arise from a rapid assessment of its contents.  Further study may well lead to other points.  This all underlines the need to deal with this issue thoroughly.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will appreciate, therefore, there are many fundamental questions which need to be considered very closely in the context of adopting a possible prohibition system of the type envisaged in this Bill.  Needless to say while these issues are still the subject of investigation I would consider it totally premature at this stage to indicate a positive reaction to this measure.  I think the wisest course to follow is to await the outcome of the Fair Trade Commission's deliberations, to have serious debate and consideration of their proposals and then decide what should be done.  This must include consideration of the constitutional issue to which I referred earlier.</P>
    <P>I fully agree that the issues raised in the Bill are important.  The question of choosing between a system of prohibition and the existing one remains open.  It would be best to await the Fair Trade Commission's report.  I would therefore ask Deputy Cullen and the sponsors of the Bill to await that and withdraw the Bill in the meantime.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1627" /> I want to inform the House that, if the Bill is proceeded with, this party and the Government will oppose it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I should like to draw the attention of the House to the fact that this Bill is very similar to amendments I introduced on behalf of the Fine Gael Party to the Restrictive Practices Bill going through the Dáil in December 1987.  At that time I made a case for a legal prohibition on anti-competitive practices.  At that time, as a result of the amendment I put forward, I am glad to say the Minister agreed that the Restrictive Practices Commission would be asked, under the provisions of section 12, to conduct an inquiry into the practicality of adopting this approach.  I am glad that that inquiry has got under way.  I am glad also that the Progressive Democrats, in introducing this Bill, have chosen to endorse the Fine Gael proposal.  In addition to making that proposal in the Dáil in December 1987, the Fine Gael Party also &mdash; in their document on 1992, published six months later in June 1988 &mdash; repeated their commitment to the proposal that Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty of Rome, which ban anti-competitive practices should <i>ab initio</i>, be part of Irish anti-competition law.  At the time I made those proposals in the Dáil they were supported not only by my party but by the Progressive Democrats spokesman in that debate.</P>
      <P>I am glad that we are discussing the matter at this point.  It is fair to say that the Minister's detailed response to the Bill proposed by Deputy Cullen and the acuity of some of his criticisms of the Bill are evidence of the work under way in his Department and in the Fair Trade Commission as a result of the inquiry initiated in this House in December 1987. It is clear from the Minister's reply that he has given quite an amount of thought to the practicalities of introducing a prohibition system and that we have made progress as a result of the initial raising of this subject in December 1987.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This discussion, resulting from the Bill brought forward by Deputy Cullen, takes <Col N="1628" /> that process a step further.  I shall be coming to the points made by the Minister in a moment but it is fair to say that his contribution was one-sided in that although he gave a very thorough critique of Deputy Cullen's proposal, he did not criticise the general principle nor did he criticise the deficiencies of the existing law, which is probably more to the point. Some of the criticisms he made of Deputy Cullen's proposal, far from being inconsiderable or invalid were, generally speaking reasonable, criticisms one would expect to be made on any Bill produced by an Opposition party who do not have the resources available to them that a Government have.  The purpose of Committee and Report Stages is to remove the cause of such criticisms.  It would have been a more balanced presentation had the Minister also said something about the problems of existing law.</P>
    <P>I believe that the existing law in regard to competition &mdash; in regard to dealing with anti-competitive practices, price fixing, market sharing, price cutting in order to eliminate competition, monopolies, rings and rigging of the market and so on &mdash; has four main defects which my proposal of December 1987 and the Fine Gael Party document of June 1988 were designed to eliminate.  Indeed there would be a similar motivation in Deputy Cullen's Bill.  They are, first, that no action can be taken on a particular practice unless there is a complaint lodged and that that complaint does not lead to action to eliminate the practice; rather that it would lead to an investigation, that investigation being conducted in a court-like fashion by the Restrictive Practices Commission or the Director of Fair Trade.</P>
    <P>A very lengthy investigation procedure is conducted in respect of the complaint in regard to the relevant area of trade.  A report is then prepared recommending action and is presented to the Minister. The Minister does not have the power to do anything about it at that stage.  He must then go to the parliamentary draftsman to draft an order to give effect to the recommendation of the Restrictive Practices Commission.  When that order <Col N="1629" /> is drafted it has to be presented to the Dáil and Seanad and time must be found to provide for passage of that order.  The length of time between the initial complaint being made and the approval of an order by the Dáil and Seanad banning a particular practice can be two or three years.  In the meantime the practice continues unabated.  Therefore, my first criticism is that the present law is extremely slow in dealing with problems of this kind.</P>
    <P>The second complaint is that even when the order is finally made it is extremely narrow in its focus.  It only deals with the practice complained of in the particular trade in respect of which the complaint was made.  Even if in the course of the investigation it becomes obvious that this practice exists in other trades, it is not unusual for a general order to be made prohibiting that type of practice across the entire community but only in respect of the particular area where the complaint is made.  There is a lot of work preparing an order and it only deals with a very narrow area.</P>
    <P>Another defect is that frequently it is discovered that the practice complained of does not come within the remit of the Minister for Industry and Commerce at all who is then powerless to do anything about it.  There is a very glaring example which reflects no credit on the Governments involved &mdash; and certainly reflects no credit on me as Minister during some of the time involved &mdash; which I would like to produce to the House to illustrate the difficulty of the present law.</P>
    <P>In April 1982 the Restrictive Practices Commission recommended the removal of the restriction on conveyancing and advertising by solicitors.  The opinion of the Minister of the day was that the Minister should be able to act to remove the restrictions on conveyancing and advertising under the Restrictive Practices Act. However, the advice of the Attorney General was that this would be <i>ultra vires</i> the powers of the Minister for Industry and Commerce under the fair trade legislation and that the only way this recommendation could be acted upon would be by an amendment to the Solicitors Act <Col N="1630" /> which could only be promoted by the Minister for Justice.  We are still waiting for this amendment to implement this relatively simple and minor recommendation made seven long years ago and we will probably be waiting for another two or three years before it becomes law.  Therefore, we will have a gap of ten years because it was discovered that even the cumbersome procedures of the Restrictive Practices Act, which would take two or three years, could not be used but that there would have to be an amendment to principal legislation which was the responsibility of another Minister and as a result, it is taking ten or 15 years for anything to be done.</P>
    <P>A code that is supposed to be a competitive code but allows delays of that kind for essential technical reasons plainly is not working.  I only wish that the Minister for Industry and Commerce had applied some of his undoubted forensic skill &mdash; which he used to shaft Deputy Cullen's proposal in some respects which I will deal with later &mdash; to a similar acute examination of the defects of the existing law.  If he had done that he might have taken the view that it would be better to take Deputy Cullen's Bill, warts and all, and amend it on Committee Stage with a view to dealing with the undoubted defects that are there.</P>
    <P>There is another area of the present law that is unreasonable in my view, that is, in regard to the criterion which is used to determine what may be banned as unfair.  The criterion is not one that is set out in detail giving specific examples as was the case in my amendment where we listed different categories of agreement to control production, shared markets, directly or indirectly fixed purchase prices etc: a whole guide is given in my original amendment and in Deputy Cullen's Bill to businessmen as to what practices are out so that they know if they carry out any of the practices that are listed they are breaking the law.  This way people know where they stand now and in five years time.</P>
    <P>I am afraid the situation under our existing law is quite different.  All that our existing law says is that the Minister <Col N="1631" /> may use this cumbersome procedure to ban a practice that is &ldquo;unfair&rdquo;.  As we all know, unfair is essentially a political concept because what is unfair in the minds of Deputy McDowell or Deputy Cullen may be perfectly fair in the mind of Deputy Brennan.  Because they are different people with different perspectives they may regard some things to be fair where others would regard them as unfair.  The decision as to whether a particular practice should be banned will depend on who the Minister is, what his political outlook is, who happens to be the members of the Restrictive Practices Commission at a given time and their philosophical outlook.  One does not know in advance whether a particular practice will be banned or not and there is no barrister, no lawyer, no expert to whom one can go for advice because there is no jurisprudence, no case law, determining what will be banned and what will not be banned.  It will all be decided on the basis of individual examinations of individual sectors and no decision in regard to a particular sector need necessarily follow an earlier decision made in regard to another sector.</P>
    <P>There is no basis in the present law upon which any businessman wanting to know whether to start doing a particular thing can discern whether he will at some time find himself in conflict with the law. It all depends on whether somebody complains, what the Director of Fair Trade thinks of the complaint when he gets it, what the Fair Trade Commission think is unfair when they get his report, what the Minister thinks is unfair when he gets their report, whether he agrees with it and, ultimately what the Dáil thinks is unfair.  It is all entirely uncertain, entirely political and entirely subjective.</P>
    <P>In my view one of the most important things that law makers in this House should try to do for business or for anyone trying to make a living is to create a situation that people know where they stand, where they know if they do one thing it is illegal but that if they do something else it is clear and they can go <Col N="1632" /> on with it, so that they can make their investment decisions on the basis of certainty. Yet, we have a code of law here which has institutionalised uncertainty and that is undesirable.  It is fair to say that the proposals Fine Gael made in December 1987 for an amendment to the law incorporating the Treaty of Rome were designed, as is Deputy Cullen's Bill which we are considering here this evening, to remove that uncertainty.</P>
    <P>There is a further advantage to proceeding along the lines suggested in this Bill which, as I have said, Fine Gael suggested long since, that is, that we will make the law that applies to trade practices within Ireland compatible with the law that applies to trade practices between Ireland and other countries. Trade practices between Ireland and other European countries are already subject to the provisions of Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty of Rome.  If an inter-State transaction occurs which is contrary to those articles it can be dealt with by the competition directorate of the European Commission under those criteria.  If we introduce similar provisions into domestic law people will know that the same law will apply to them if they are selling something to County Monaghan as would apply if they were selling it further up the road to County Armagh.  Both transactions, one a domestic and the other an export transaction, would be subject to the same basic legal provisions of Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty of Rome.  Again, we would be saving on legal costs because people would know that the same law applies to them in either case and they would be able to consult, as would lawyers, the jurisprudence that has been acquired in interpreting that law in other European jurisdictions to inform the likely decisions that will be made in this jurisdiction.  That saves money and time, creates certainty in the law and means business people can easily make transactions across boundaries.</P>
    <P>I would further say to the Minister if he were here that it would be desirable to take account of the fact that prohibitions of anti-competitive practices <Col N="1633" /> incorporating the rules contained in Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty of Rome are also being introduced in other countries. The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry in Britain in the last year has published in Green Paper on competition law in that country which proposes in essence to do what the Fine Gael amendment and this Bill propose to do in domestic Irish law.  The same has been done in Greece and similar proposals have been made in Portugal and France, with a view to incorporating in domestic law the provisions of Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty of Rome, for the very sensible reason that those countries want the same rules to apply to their domestic trade as apply to their international trade within Europe.</P>
    <P>If we persist in not pursuing that course we will put our people at a disadvantage. The longer we stay behind with our present law and do not follow the example of other European countries the greater will be our disadvantage.  If we are first in the race in harmonising our law in that area with Community law we will be giving Irish traders a marginal advantage over traders from other countries where a dual system of law applies. In this House we should try, given the competition people will face in Europe, to assist business people as much as possible by making the law certain within our State and compatible across boundaries with the law in other States.</P>
    <P>The Minister has raised a number of very worthwhile questions about some of the points made by Deputy Cullen.  He was somewhat unfair in describing Deputy Cullen's Bill as poorly drafted. That comment had a slightly supercilious air to it and ought not to have been made, given that sometime in the future perhaps Deputy Burke will be on the Opposition benches, will be producing a Bill and might not feel that this type of patronising criticism is appropriate.  That criticism was made but perhaps the Minister did not intend to say it.  Maybe it was put into <Col N="1634" /> his speech and it was too late for him to take it out.</P>
    <P>However, the Minister also made very valid criticisms of Deputy Cullen's Bill. It is fair to say there should be a clear role for the Fair Trade Commission in the implementation of Articles 85 and 86 if they are incorporated in domestic Irish law.  The Fair Trade Commission should be the body to decide on issues like the granting of block exemptions to particular practices.  On the other hand, the role of prosecution of individual breaches should be a matter for the Director of Fair Trade.  It would be useful, in the initial period of application of Articles 85 and 86 to Irish law, to give the Director of Fair Trade a role in reviewing how the matter is working in practice.  He should be charged, for the first two or three years, with presenting annual reports on how this new and radical change in Irish competition law is working, reviewing the court decisions that have been taken and drawing appropriate policy conclusions from those decisions so that the legislation could be refined in the light of his reports and any difficulties that have been identified in it eliminated.</P>
    <P>The Minister also made the point &mdash; again this is something the House cannot ignore &mdash; that at a time of constrained resources he cannot guarantee that a large body of staff could be made available to deal with the issues of exempting particular sectors from the application of this very broad-ranging legislation.  I would like to have that aspect teased out in greater detail.  I know the answer will be that the Minister cannot grant block exemptions, that if that is done it gets rid of the need for the scrutiny of individual agreements.  It is the scrutiny of individual agreements that is the most staff-intensive element but obviously the Minister is unconvinced that block exemptions would cover this issue.  He still feels that a substantial number of staff would be involved.  If this were a Committee Stage debate I would press the Minister to give reasons for that conclusion.  I say that, <Col N="1635" /> not disputing his conclusion but simply looking for elucidation.</P>
    <P>The Minister should retain his discretion to make orders under the legislation. The Fair Trade Commission should continue to have the power to direct that inquiries be held, as applies under existing law, certainly for a transitional period until we see how the new legislation is working out.  Most of the existing law should remain for a period. Perhaps the position could be reviewed after five or six years to see if the new legislation is satisfactory.  In that light I would be in favour of continuing to allow the Minister to have the order-making powers that he has under section 8 of the 1987 Act.  I also think the Minister should continue to retain his powers under section 12 of the 1972 Act which allow him to ask the Commission to conduct general inquiries on methods of competition, types of restrictive practices, monopolies, structures, the market and so on.  This is a very wide and broad-ranging subject matter which is not necessarily encompassed in Deputy Cullen's Bill.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>When I moved the Adjournment I had just begun to refer to a period which I regarded as being very difficult from the point of view of prospective house purchasers, that was the period up to 1986 starting in 1979 or 1980.  At various times, because of ebbs and flows in the marketplace, house purchasers found it very difficult to obtain finance from building societies, finance which they intended to put to the very important use of providing themselves and their families with a home.  During that period there were many changes in <Col N="1636" /> relation to the criterion applicable with regard to having a requirement to have savings with the society for, in some cases, six months, sometimes a year and, in some cases even longer and to such an extent that the unfortunate borrower would find himself or herself in a position whereby their determination and their anxiety reached such a pitch that very often they threw in the towel and decided to look elsewhere.  It was then they decided to go to the local authority and the Housing Finance Agency.</P>
      <P>I know that many of the building societies did not have a high opinion of the Housing Finance Agency and probably had an even lower opinion of the local authorities in their ability to finance house building but were it not for the existence of the Housing Finance Agency in a long period the number of houses bought or built in this country would be dramatically lower than they were up to about 1985-86.  By the same token were it not for the benign attitude of the local authorities in relation to the lower end of the housing market we would have had a situation where a far greater number of people in Ireland would still be living either in rented accommodation or in totally unfit accommodation.</P>
      <P>Those of us who are members of local authorities have countless experiences of dealing with cases where very good compassionate reasons could be trotted out as to why a particular loan applicant should receive favourable consideration and could not possibly meet the usual guidelines laid down regarding savings etc. to obtain a loan from a building society or a bank.  The Minister can say, and rightly so, that in the last couple of years because of his arrangement with the banks and the building societies that has changed somewhat.  It has changed because, as I mentioned earlier, the climate is different but if the climate changes again we will be back to a situation where, as in the past, it may well fall to central Government to offer subvention in relation to interest or whatever the case may be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1637" /> While the Minister may refer us to his speech, we should also give equal recognition to the vital role played by the two agencies in relation to the provision of finance for urgently needed housing for many people in this country over a number of years.  Under this new Bill the opening up to competition is desirable and attractive in many instances.  It has many facets which are helpful, useful and progressive and will, we hope, sharpen everybody in relation to the role, function and efficiency of the operation of financial institutions.  However, I must harp back and repeat that I hope we do not have a similar situation as obtained in the past.</P>
    <P>When I was somewhat younger I remember the banks decided to rationalise or merge.  There were a number of smaller banks throughout the length and breadth of the country offering a variety of services &mdash; they were fairly benign in those days &mdash; and many people were very grateful for them.  Then, rationalisation, computerisation and various other changes took place and in order to become more competitive and effective they decided to form themselves into groups. I am not sure today whether the formation of those particular groups has served the purposes for which they were intended.  If you look at the sequence of events which I have mentioned before the Adjournment and what happened in relation to the availability of money to buy property during the seventies and the eighties where the various lending institutions competed with each other the only determining factor in reaching a value on a property was the ability of the borrower to have sufficient collateral to raise from his or her financial institution, the kind of money they were prepared to bid at an auction or whatever.  I am not sure that the rationalisation was effective in that sense.  Likewise, we are now facing into 1992 and all that goes with it and much stiffer competition from Europe.  I wonder whether we can eliminate the <Col N="1638" /> peaks and valleys that have taken place with this legislation.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Government and public may think we are in a new era and that the financial world began only two years ago.  I would hate to dissuade anybody or to dash their hopes or to suddenly indicate that everything might not be as indicated through rose-tinted glasses but difficult and turbulent times in the financial world will come again.  When they do I hope that the kind of competition for which this Bill is intended to provide safeguards will be beneficial to the institutions themselves and to the small investors and the borrowers.</P>
    <P>The origin of the building societies sprang from the need in the first place to provide a system whereby savings could be made on an ongoing basis and become the basis of an application for a loan which ultimately would be favourably received and granted and, as a consequence, the particular borrowers would meet their own housing needs.  If that does not happen or if there is a movement towards the upper end of the market, into the more lucrative end of the market and into the more expensive house range, then we could have other problems in a couple of years time.</P>
    <P>We in this House &mdash; and I am sure the Minister would be the first to recognise it &mdash; have a responsibility to everybody whether they be at the top or the lower end of the market scale and it is a matter for us to ensure that those at the lower end of the scale, as well as others, are catered for.  I might also say that in recent times as a result of the developments which I mentioned earlier regarding the provision of loans more readily through the building societies and the banks to borrowers at the lower end of the market that is now being taken in certain quarters as an indication that the housing position is catered for because the local authorities are not building houses.  For those in the income bracket between, where they would expect to be housed by the local authority, and those eligible for a <Col N="1639" /> building society or bank loan, there is a certain amount of unease simply because the people in that bracket are finding it harder to qualify for loans.  Anybody who looks at the processing of loans through local authorities will know that the numbers applying for loans and having them approved, in the past 12 months in particular, have dropped dramatically.</P>

      <P>It can be said with a certain amount of justification, that if the 70,000 people who have left the country last year were here, we would have a much more lucrative market and we would be able to generate a certain amount of buoyancy in the market, which is very desirable.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the legislation, as the Minister has said, is to broaden the scope and remit of building societies and to bring them under the guidance of the Central Bank guidelines.  When things are looking good, the sun is shining brightly and everything in the garden is rosy, things may be all right but my worry is what will happen in less favourable conditions.  I hope we do not see the development of a monopoly, where the cosy arrangements that existed in the past between the banks, having regard to their rationalisation, could be extended to the building societies and that they would have their own cosy arrangements where, on the one hand, competition is the order of the day, and on the other, it could be competition to ensure that they compete with each other only to the extent that they can protect their own interests.  I sincerely hope that that does not become a feature of their operations in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to make the following point as an aside.  I know that computerisation has done a great deal for all financial institutions in the past few years, but one of the problems with computerisation and centralisation of control is that the human face, which is very <Col N="1640" /> important, is inclined to disappear.  It has long gone in the banks and the financial institutions, because a little machine taps out a certain message, produces a certain picture and the decision is then taken whether the local management like it or not.</P>
    <P>This will also probably apply in the case of building societies to a greater extent than it has in the past.  I know that individual building societies have had access to new technology and efficiency creating procedures in the past number of years, and rightly so, but I hope we do not see technology taking over.  The person going into their local building society expects to be greeted by a friendly face.  We all know from the advertisements we see on television or hear on the radio about the friendly face.  These advertisements are very attractive and sound delightful to a prospective borrower who is thinking of buying a house. However, if people were very naive, they would believe what they see, but of course things are not that way.  It is essential that the human element prevails, that the relationship between the manager of a building society and the borrower would be such that the manager would have a fairly good idea of the customer's track record over the two or three years he was investing with them.  That would be of tremendous importance and I hope this will not disappear with the application of this legislation.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier, and I know other speakers have referred to the costs imposed on borrowers &mdash; for instance, legal fees, certificates of compliance, valuation reports and so on.  The Minister in his speech referred to this generally and said that provision could be made available through the building societies for deposit loans of a short term nature.  I think this is ideal.</P>
    <P>I have often wondered about building societies and financial institutions which claim that 90 per cent or 95 per cent loans are available.  When you tot up all the charges, you find that only a 75 per cent <Col N="1641" /> loan is available and the unfortunate borrowers have to delve as deeply as they can into their pockets to ensure that, first, they have the deposit, then the money for various legal fees together with the first instalment.  These people could damage their credit rating before the end of the first six months simply because they had not got a chance to prove themselves, they have had to dig too deeply into their pockets to obtain the finance and they then find they have no reserves.  They then go down a different road trying to fend off the evil day which they brought upon themselves because of their requirements in the initial stages being too great. This applies not only to building societies but to banks and local authorities.</P>
    <P>For a long time I have felt that there is absolutely no reason in the wide world a person who is saving with a building society or a bank over an agreed period, cannot be granted loans commensurate with their ability to repay them, taking account of their income, beyond 80 per cent or 90 per cent of the total.  This would solve a great many problems for people, particularly those in the lower income bracket because they could get off to if not a flying start, at least to a reasonable start and get an even break.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned earlier, the increased competition which is envisaged will come about as a result of this Bill, is desirable and progressive.  We all welcome competition, particularly in the context of 1992.  However, I hope that competition will not only make building societies more efficient but that they will be much more efficient in the presentation of services to the customer.  To my mind, the customer, and particularly the small investor, must and should come first. They are the people for whom the building society concept was introduced, and under no circumstances should we see any erosion of their rights, their role and their interests.  Anything that is done in this House, and subsequently by the Minister, which would undermine their rights should be looked at very carefully.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1642" /> I do not want to detain the proceedings of this House for the very good reason that I have the flu which I hope to get rid of in the next few days.  The measures in the legislation are without doubt progressive and bring our legislation into line with what is required in Europe.  The various directives on banking, etc. emanating from Europe at present bring about this requirement in any event.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that sometimes they do not congratulate their predecessors and acknowledge the work they have done.  In this instance the role of the Minister's predecessor was a very difficult one in very hard times.  He had to change a trend which had been sliding in a particular direction for a number of years.  It is unfortunate that the Minister did not give due recognition to the work that had to be undertaken by his predecessor.  We all know that in order to turn a ship which is going at full speed in a particular direction it takes a while before one can slow down the momentum to such an extent that it is safe to turn it.  When the present Minister took over that Department I can honestly say that the momentum had been sufficiently slowed down to make it possible for him to proceed along the lines he is now proceeding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  When we first saw the Bill many people said <Col N="1643" /> that it was more like a manuscript than a Bill, and there is no one better than the Minister at bringing a manuscript into this House.  The building societies will remember that the Minister introduced a manuscript, not a Bill, 122 pages long.</P>
      <P>I can speak with some authority on building societies and how they work because I was an agent for a number of years and had the opportunity of dealing with people seeking loans to buy their own homes.  Certainly things have changed over a period of eight to ten years.  One of the most important provisions in the Bill is the one which allows building societies to compete with the banks.  I do not think any Member of this House would disagree with such a provision so far as the area of bridging finance and the extension of the societies' facilities are concerned but I have one question to ask in this regard.  We are all aware that a number of building society offices throughout the country are run by agents who give a service in rural areas which banks were not prepared to give. When this legislation is passed will the provisions which apply to the building societies apply also to these agents?  In other words, will the agents down the country have the same facilities as the building societies?  If this is not the case it will be a retrograde step because as I have said these agents provide a service to individuals in rural areas who wish to invest their money and to people who wish to save so that they will be eligible to obtain loans to buy their own homes. If this legislation is passed I would like building societies to ensure that the agents down the country are on the same level as their societies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another aspect of the Bill I am concerned about, that is the provision whereby building societies can go into the auctioneering business, build housing estates, get involved in conveyancing and employ solicitors in their offices so that all the work can be carried out in one office.  This brings us back to the situation <Col N="1644" /> which obtained before the 1986 legislation was introduced whereby anybody who took out a mortgage could not get insurance from any society other than from the society with which they had their mortgage.  I wonder if it is right to put all our eggs into one basket, which is what this legislation is doing, and allow building societies to employ solicitors who will do all the work in their offices.  I would be very wary about that provision.</P>
    <P>There is another point I should like to make in this respect.  Many firms of solicitors throughout the country employ a lot of people and a certain amount of their business is involved in the transfer and sale of houses.  If this aspect of their business is taken away completely and the building societies are given a cartel, two or three of the staff in many of these offices will be made redundant because the work will not be there.  We have to be realistic about the effects of this provision.</P>
    <P>Some auctioneering firms act as agents for building societies while others do not. If building societies can sell properties &mdash; I am not saying that this will be the case in every town, but building societies may be very interested in this area &mdash; a percentage of the income of many family firms may be done away with.  I wonder whether we should go down the road of giving a cartel to the building societies in those two areas.  This aspect of the Bill will be teased out during the debate on the remaining Stages.</P>
    <P>We are all aware that with the advent of 1992 there will be competition from building societies in England and from other parts of Europe.  Irish companies will have to develop in a businesslike way and, if necessary, companies will have to amalgamate in order to ensure that Irish companies are not taken over by foreign companies.  I welcome that aspect of the Bill.</P>
    <P>There was the development during the year of getting rid of the provision of loans by local authorities.  Those at the <Col N="1645" /> top end of the scale, 60 per cent, who would have no problem in obtaining loans were hived off to building societies. There is nothing wrong with that arrangement. It saves the State financing and subsidising low interest rate mortgages. The remainder who are looking for local authority loans find them quite difficult to obtain.  My colleague mentioned that for the past year there has not been a large number of applicants.  We are aware that this is so, taking into consideration the large number who have left the country, those who should be living on the housing estates, council or whatever. They are not here in the numbers that we would like to see.  If they were houses would be required, money would be spent in the economy and the building industry would be in a far better position than at present.</P>
    <P>We must take note of the overall effect of putting all our eggs in one basket.  The emphasis is in getting away from the local authority area, or any area with which the Government have anything to do, and into the private area.  We all know that there are many who at present find it very difficult to obtain loans or mortgages. There is no problem with mortgages if the criteria regarding the individual are as near right as makes no difference.  The money is easily available.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not put all the success down to that.  Thank God the situation has changed with regard to an applicant having to have money deposited with the society for a specific time.  That is a very welcome change.  It has changed for the following and no other reason: one of the building societies were taken over by one of the banks a couple of years ago.  That society was number 4 in grading.  The surplus funds of the bank were available and loans were made available on demand through the <Col N="1646" /> society.  Immediately there was competition and the other building societies competed on the same basis, giving out mortgages on demand.  That was the main reason for the change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>Not at all.  The main reason was the success of the Government's economic policies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I happen to know because I was and am involved in this area.  I know of two different cases in two societies.  I am telling exactly where the competition came from.</P>
      <P>It is important that the good parts of this legislation be introduced forthwith to get us organised for the competition that lies ahead.  In 1986 there was a lot of talk about redemption fees causing problems. When people wished to cash in mortgages, they were charged one month's or two months' repayment.  If you pay off a mortgage in any other finance company there is no charge.  Legislation should not be allowed into this House that would reintroduce redemption rates.  One of the largest building societies in this country wish this arrangement to be reintroduced, but I appeal to the Minister to ensure that this is not allowed to happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Also, we should not reintroduce tiered rates for differing amounts of loans.  In the vicinity of Dublin over the last while the price of property has been increasing. Half of the property being sold at present is being bought with money from abroad because property here can be bought much more cheaply than similar property in London or other parts of England. People are selling properties there, coming over here and inflating the price somewhat.  For people who genuinely want houses and have to take out mortgages, there should not be tiered rates. A person will not get a mortgage unless he is eligible for it.  I hope it will not come to the point where the average mortgage will be taken as £20,000 which will be given at the present rate but a £30,000 mortgage would be up 1 per cent and a <Col N="1647" /> £40,000 mortgage would be up 2 per cent. This is discrimination against the individual within the State.  Having got away from the tiered system, it should not be allowed to be reintroduced.</P>
    <P>In this legislation, we are giving the building societies the power to compete with the banks.  On the other hand, we are giving them an opportunity to charge a tiered rate of interest.  That has never been the case with regard to loans for one item, and that item here is a house mortgage.  We would be contradicting ourselves if we were to go down that road.  Quite substantial amounts of extra money can be made.  People thinking of buying property must take account of nearness to their work and if people have to get mortgages of 70 per cent or 75 per cent of the value of the house they find that amounts to a considerable sum on a house valued £50,000 or £60,000.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech mentioned 165,000 mortgages being taken out over the last 12 months.  A substantial number of people in my area have been changing from their existing mortgages and taking out endowment mortgages instead.  This accounts for the large number of mortgages taken out during the past 18 months.  It is a pity this is the case because new mortgages usually mean buoyancy in the building industry and more employment.  The current trend seems likely to continue.</P>
    <P>I compliment the building societies on having helped large numbers of farmers during the past two or three years who found themselves in difficulties due to serious debt problems which arose when interest rates were as high as 20 per cent some years ago.  The building societies provided mortgages on the family home and played no small part in the overall refinancing of people who found themselves in difficulties.  The professional people involved are well aware of the important part played by the building societies.  The current interest rate is at a manageable level, which is a great help <Col N="1648" /> to many of these families.  Were it not so, many more family farms might have to be sold.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about the uncertainty felt by the building societies when he came into office in 1987.  I must take him to task on that issue.  I was not aware of any uncertainty.  During the past ten years all financial institutions have been making large sums of money.  The mortgage rate increased by three percentage points at the end of 1986, but during previous years rates had been slowly going down to an acceptable level.  In a period of four years they went from 16.25 per cent to about 9 per cent and then back to 12 per cent.</P>
    <P>When people ask for advice about taking out a mortgage I always work out the figures based on an interest rate of 12 per cent.  That will not always be the exact rate but it is a fair yardstick and people will not come back complaining two or three years later.  We must have control over the people who are making the decisions.  As a result of that control they are reducing rates to a very acceptable level.  I do not think anyone would deny us credit for the important part we played.</P>
    <P>The Minister also mentioned the effects of the DIRT tax.  Does he not realise that it was not DIRT until it was introduced to the banks?  A retention tax was always applied to the building societies. The rate was increased from 27 per cent to 35 per cent.  People who invested in building societies always paid a retention tax.  There were loud cries from the then Opposition that the DIRT tax was cruel and causing hardship, but there was not a word now about doing away with it, as Fianna Fáil promised when in Opposition.</P>

Everywhere we went we were told that the DIRT tax would be abolished the moment Fianna Fáil came into office.  We still have it, although it has been reduced by 2 per cent.  Some economists said it should not have been reduced but that is the position at present.</P>
      <P>The section relating to the development of land and property is very important. What overall involvement will the societies have in regard to this?  My reading is that they will be in a position to get involved in buying developed land for housing or commercial use.  It is also stated that loan financiers would be in part ownership and I do not disagree with that.  They might as well be involved in it as well as the banks and it would provide more competition.  However, it makes me wonder if we would get to the stage where the societies would be involved to too great a degree and would be short of ready cash for mortgages for the numbers mentioned earlier in the debate.  There will be competition in this area from the banks, building and other societies in 1992.  I should like to ensure that the small investor who saves his money to buy a house would always have money available to him.  I would not like building societies to compete with one another for tracts of land in the main centres of population, developing the property and leaving applicants who badly need it short of finance for housing.  In that case there could well be a lengthy waiting list for loans.  I hope that will not be the case and indeed it should not happen because of extra competition.  However, I had to mention it because of the large amount of money tied up when one develops property on any type of site.  One only has to look at the St. Stephen's Green centre to know what I am talking about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was mentioned that building societies could employ their own solicitors to do all the work connected with buying and selling houses.  If that is the case, <Col N="1650" /> there would not be one penny for anybody else in that line of business.  It is also the case that 90 per cent of the different deals and transfers of property have a problem in regard to maps.  I accept the point about a fee being paid to solicitors for this work but, when legislation of this kind is passed, I should like to ensure that nobody would buy a property which had not been thoroughly checked.  Incorrect maps can cause horrendous problems and we should be very careful in dealing with this section.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, there are many favourable points in the Bill and I have outlined my reservations in regard to others.  Different Members have spoken from experiences and highlighted the fact that the people who drew up the Bill might not be <i>au fait</i> with all the problems involved.  I must tell the House about the night I went into an establishment where many legal people were gathered.  It was around Christmas and they asked me if I had a copy of the Bill.  I told them I could get a copy and one of them remarked that it had serious consequences for the legal profession.  He added that he never thought he would see the day when the rural family business would be under threat from legislation.  I retorted that, knowing the Minister, he would not make a decision to bring in damaging legislation. The person to whom I was speaking made the point that the Minister had good friends in the building societies and that they were the people who influenced the Bill.  He said he did not blame the Minister and I said I would convey his remarks to Minister Flynn.  We now know that many people spent a lot of time drawing up this legislation and it would be remiss of us not to give it the attention it deserves because it will have far reaching effects for everybody in the services that will be provided.</P>
    <P>When the building societies get the go ahead I hope that every town will have the same facilities <i>vis-à-vis</i> agents or society members.  My reservations are that the cartel would take over the area <Col N="1651" /> of the work involved in the auctioneering end and deal with all the work involved in the sale of a house.  Everything will probably go smoothly until someone gets a monopoly.  We only have to look at what has happened today regarding the sale of bread in supermarkets to know what can happen the small trader.  That is one example and I am sure that no Member of this House would like to see a monopoly in this area.  The prices offered by the supermarkets will be of benefit to the consumer until such time as their smaller competitors close down. We will then find out what price we will have to pay.  The same will apply in this case.  What we are doing is putting legislation in place that will take us into the year 2000.  I doubt if another Bill such as this will be presented to this House for a considerable period of time.  Having said that, I hope that we can come to some agreement on the matters on which we disagree and, if so, I believe good legislation will be put in place.</P>

      <P>At the outset I would like to say that this is welcome legislation.  I am glad to have the opportunity of being able to speak after Deputy Farrelly as it gives me the opportunity not just to deal with the specifics of the Bill which he avoided but to dispel the mythology which he sought to propagate.  I apologise for interrupting earlier but I was provoked into doing so.  The point I tried to make was that the present interest rates arise because of confidence in the economy and in the activities of the Government and not from the fact that one building society was taken over by one of the larger banks.  Indeed the Deputy gave the answer to the present problems when he spoke of the time when funds were not available, and I will deal later with the provisions contained in this Bill which will encourage the making available of funds.  Because of the healthy state of the economy funds are being made available, <Col N="1652" /> not because one of the banks sought to pass on surplus funds and it was disingenuous of the Deputy to seek to suggest otherwise.  I am not suggesting he deliberately sought to do this but merely that he misunderstands the way in which the market works.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>The most important objective of this Bill is to expand competition. The Deputy made the point that an extension of competition would be welcome. Building societies in the past operated like independent mediaeval fiefdoms controlled by small cliques and groups of families, and it is important, therefore, that the building societies, which are basically 19th century institutions, be dragged into the 20th century. That is what this Bill aims to do.  The building societies have thrived because we have a segmented financial system but this system is undergoing very radical change.  Therefore, the environment, or the milieu to use the Minister's own word, in which the building societies operate is changing and it is only right that we should introduce radical changes.  While the building societies find themselves in a favoured position the present arrangements, particularly the arrangements in regard to the way in which they utilise their funds, act as a strait-jacket.  It is important, therefore, that the removing of this strait-jacket would lead to the <Col N="1653" /> building societies becoming more progressive in their operations.</P>
      <P>This is important legislation in the sense that it deals with a segment of the financial sector that over the years has been subjected to a good deal of criticism. The Minister indicated that in drawing up this Bill he had a number of broad objectives in mind and I cannot see any foundation for the criticism of the Minister's approach.  First of all, he said he wished to allow the building societies to compete and develop in the context of a growing internal market.  That is the central thesis in the Bill.  Secondly, the Minister said he wished to take a look at the supervisory system as it applies to the building societies.  We are all too familiar from past mistakes with the problems that can arise.  The system of supervision being proposed in the Bill would allow the building societies to operate in a more flexible way while, at the same time, putting the balancing controls in place.  The statutory provisions in relation to the building societies are archaic.  The Minister has aimed to re-examine these provisions so as to put more flexible and more logical provisions in place.  In fairness, I believe the Minister has achieved the right mix.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to savings protection, the Minister wishes to put the building societies on the same footing as the banks, and it is only right and proper that he should do so.  It is also important that we harmonise the relationship between the banks and building societies as savings institutions.  The Minister also wants the building societies to become more actively involved in the housing market and in the development market.  I did not hear Deputy Farrelly refer to this objective of the Bill but I am sure the Deputies on the other side of the House would agree with it.  It would be a welcome fillip for the construction industry and a healthy development if they were to do so.  The Minister also proposes the creation of a proper mechanism whereby building societies would be able to convert to company status.  A great many <Col N="1654" /> sections of the Bill deal specifically with this issue.</P>
    <P>As one would expect, the first part of the Bill is fairly technical but the second part contains some new and important innovations.  In particular I am referring to the concept of authorisation and the proposal to allow building societies advertise for funds.  This is an issue that was touched on by Deputy Farrelly who spoke about the need to create a more competitive environment.  These provisions will help in that regard.  Important safeguards have been included in the Bill. The Minister proposes some controls in regard to the nature and quality of the advertisements.  The Central Bank would be allowed to impose conditions in respect of the authorisation within the building society.  He has promised that these conditions will be extensive and I think we will all welcome the provision which states that the Central Bank may, if necessary, remove a director or another officer of the building society if it felt that any advertisement goes beyond what is acceptable.  That is welcome and worthwhile.</P>
    <P>The heart of the Bill lies in Part III which deals in great depth with the powers of building societies.  Part III aims at achieving what we have been talking about for the building societies for a long time, that is, a truly competitive market which will undoubtedly create on the one hand a better environment for home owners or people who wish to borrow for the purchase of their homes and at the same time a competitive market which will allow Irish financial institutions to gear themselves up for open competition from 1992 onwards.  That is an important side effect of the major elements in Part III.  In particular we can welcome the provisions relating to secured and unsecured lendings which are dealt with in sections 22 and 23.  In addition to the traditional lending secured by mortgages the societies, under these provisions, will be able to offer to their clients second mortgage loans, bridging loans and a variety of other financial packages.  This will <Col N="1655" /> help to tidy up an area of the financial services much used by young people coming into the house market or wishing to change houses.  It is an obvious improvement which is long overdue.</P>
    <P>The direct involvement of the societies in the development of land for residential and commercial purposes is an obvious adjunct to the activities of the building societies.  It is a logical extension, as the Minister has said, to the societies' present activities and will create an additional source of funding for building and construction activities.</P>
    <P>The technical provisions relating to equity and subsidiary and other associated bodies represent a change in the present law which is welcome and worthwhile in that it allows the building societies more flexibility from the point of view of setting up subsidiary bodies.</P>
    <P>The main thrust of sections 28 and 29 will be to allow the building societies to extend their general activities in what we call the financial services area.  In this set of provisions the Minister's proposals complement general Government policies in the financial services area.  These provisions, which the Minister has described as flexible, are worth while in that they provide yet another area of activity for the building societies in which it is generally accepted they should be involved.</P>
    <P>Of particular interest to me is the fact that the Minister will, in Part III, section 31, allow the building societies to provide a conveyancing service.  I am not sure of what was the main thrust of the point made by the previous speaker about this. Conveyancing has been treated as if it was some sort of medieval rite.  For far too long there seems to have been a monopoly in this area.  Conveyancing is a relatively simple procedure, yet solicitors seem to get it wrong with distressing frequency. I welcome the movement of the building societies in this area because it breaks a monopoly that has existed.  In the recent past I have had the distressing <Col N="1656" /> duty of dealing with constituents who have conveyancing problems where solicitors have been derelict in their duties though sometimes more venal than derelict. I expect other Members have had the same type of experience.  I hope the degree of additional competition that will be introduced will help people like the Law Society to take a long, hard look at how they handle conveyancing and at the sort of fees charged for it.</P>
    <P>The requirement of societies in relation to the valuation or assessment of freehold and leasehold estates is important. Section 18 contains a wide range of powers for the societies to raise funds on Irish or foreign markets.  That is an important step forward.  Deputy Farrelly sought to rewrite history and invert the facts.  The facts at the moment are that there is a great deal of confidence in the Irish economy and that all the financial institutions should be allowed to capitalise on that confidence which is helping to keep interest rates down to historically low levels.  Those benefits are passed directly on to the people who buy houses through building societies.  It seems right and proper that the building societies should at this stage in their development be allowed to widen their power to raise funds.  The existing arrangements are restrictive and create peaks and troughs in the mortgage market.  Deputy Farrelly said that some short time back it was a practical impossibility for a young couple wishing to buy their house for the first time to raise the necessary funds from building societies.  The societies themselves introduced very restrictive clauses and arrangements before they made funds available.  They sought to insist that people who would borrow from them had deposits of a certain level lying with the society over a time.  In part the building societies could do that because of their near monopoly operation, but in part they had to do it because of the fluctuations in funds for mortgage purposes. Section 18 allows the building societies wide powers to raise funds and will help <Col N="1657" /> them to so structure their funding that they can avoid those peaks and troughs. The societies will be allowed to look at the wholesale market, use their mortgages perhaps as collateral or even sell them off as a way of raising funds.</P>
    <P>This is important legislation.  It introduces competition into an area where competition has been eschewed.  At the same time the Minister has very wisely put into the legislation well chosen instruments for the control of building societies. He has begun to codify the operations of the societies.  He has put into operation mechanisms which can help us in future to avoid any excesses on the part of the building societies and at the same time refrain from strait-jacketing them as happened under the laws which exist.</P>
    <P>The Minister is noted for his flexibility. No doubt he will be conscious of some of the points that have been made.  This is highly technical legislation which obviously is long overdue so I cannot see why elements of it have been criticised as they have been by previous speakers.  I welcome the legislation and commend the Minister for introducing it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for the Environment is welcome to the House.  When he was on this side he contributed very frequently on all subjects and I can see from his speech that he has put a good deal of interest and thought into this Building Societies Bill.  This is a comprehensive piece of legislation and its introduction in the House affords me an opportunity to make a general comment on the behaviour of building societies in recent years.  It is disturbing to hear of building societies paying substantial sums of money for buildings in prime locations in our main towns and cities.  It is also disturbing to hear of them investing substantial sums of money in office blocks and other related projects.  Building societies were established to provide money for those anxious to build their own homes but in recent years they have moved from that objective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1658" /> The Minister was generous in the course of his speech when referring to the growth of building societies and the extent of their assets.  However, the big societies have accumulated most of those assets to the detriment of the smaller concerns.  The Bill is timely in that we have reached the stage when societies should be turned into real financial institutions. The provisions have been brought about as a result of the behaviour of societies down the years.  The Minister is making an effort to control them but it appears that their main purpose from now on will be financial rather than providing funds for mortgages.</P>
    <P>The four main building societies are family concerns.  I am sure other Members are pleased that interest rates have been kept under control because they will recall the parade in and out of the Member's dining room by the chief executives of the societies prior to announcements of an increase in rates. One got the impression as they paraded around the House that they had some largesse to distribute.  In the last ten years the visits by those executives to the House sparked off speculation about the possibility of a rise.  It must be said that those executives enjoyed their power and played it to the very end.  I am pleased that the Minister is strong enough to take them on.  He is his own man.  In recent days the independence of Mayo and Knock has been well illustrated to the cost of the airport in my constituency.</P>

      <P>I am being generous to both Deputies.  The Minister and others got away with their bullying in regard to the airport in Knock.  The Minister may be nice to the building societies but he will prove to be a hard task master.  In complimenting the Minister I should like to warn building societies that they should not be too pally with him.  Some <Col N="1659" /> building societies have been ruthless in the past in pushing up interest rates when such a move was not necessary.  That caused great hardship to many people. One must comment on how they can put their case across to the media, and how they can make long range forecasts about interest rates on RTE.  That was not their role.  I have no doubt that things will be different when banking institutions take on the building societies.  We have all noticed the change that has taken place since banks went into the mortgage market.</P>
      <P>There are 127 sections in the Bill, an enormous production from the bunker of the Custom House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>In sections 4 and 5 the Minister seeks power to modify provisions contained in the original Act in particular circumstances.  Does the Minister envisage some difficulties arising under a future Minister for the Environment? In my view all regulations should be brought before the House for approval.  Any amendments should be dealt with here rather than in the Custom House.  The Minister is going too far in taking those powers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill deals with the formation, objectives and authorisation of building societies and there is no doubt that they have a crucial role to play in society.  The Minister went out of his way to stress the extent of home ownership here but I wonder if it is necessary for people to have all their money invested in their home.  There is a need for funds to create employment for our young and for that <Col N="1660" /> reason I hold that we are tying too much money up in our homes.  I appreciate that a lot of employment is created when houses are being built but little money is circulated afterwards.  The Minister's views on home ownership are those of a person of the right and I wonder if that represents a change in policy by Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>Section 18 (1) states that a building society may raise funds including, with the approval of the Central Bank, funds in a currency other than the currency of the State, to be used for the objects of the society.  It appears from that that the Minister is attempting to bring us into line with the various EC directives and is preparing us for the harmonisation of VAT rates in 1992.</P>
    <P>I hope the provisions in this Bill will enable us to quickly meet our objectives. Part III of the Bill gives new powers to a building society to hold and develop land, to invest and acquire shares in bodies corporate, to provide general financial services as provided by banks, to provide conveyancing services, to provide auctioneering services, to operate outside the State and to have power to hedge. Some of these provisions are giving rise to consternation amongst the professions. Some solicitors are rather anxious to get into foreign building societies and this will lead to more and more British and other building societies offering their services in this country.  Solicitors here are rather alarmed about this interference in conveyancing.  I want the Minister's assurances that the conveyancing system will be improved.</P>
    <P>The building societies also hire solicitors and the system will not change by itself.  There is no doubt that very slow progress in this area is causing substantial problems.  A problem has arisen for instance in relation to Barrington's Hospital which was closed by the Fianna Fáil Government.  The solicitors for the vendors of that building are not in a position to locate the deed which apparently <Col N="1661" /> is very old.  As Deputy Roche said, all Members of the House have been approached in relation to conveyancing problems.</P>
    <P>I had a case in which there was a three-and-a-half year delay because of a query by a building society solicitor and the amount of land involved was 10 ft. by 5 ft. in the back yard of a house.  Apparently the previous vendor's solicitors overlooked the original estate from which this land was taken and certain searches had to be made.  One search involved getting a family document which had been drawn up in the late sixteen hundreds or the early seventeen hundreds.  The document had to come from the bowels of the Department of Agriculture and Food and that caused some headaches.</P>
    <P>The Minister's Bill as it is drawn up will not expedite conveyancing.  We need a fundamental review of the system.  I very much regret that the Government did away with a group of people who were examining the ownership of land in this country.  What can one do when faced with a problem such as I have outlined in relation to tracing old documents, especially when one gets a letter such as the one I got today from the revesting section of the Department of Agriculture and Food in which the principal officer told me that due to cutbacks and a shortage of labour he was afraid my query could not be answered and would have to wait until another day?  The man involved in that case wanted to build six houses.  The delay has resulted in his losing interest and now he will not invest. Thus, the Exchequer has lost a little spinoff and some conveyancing business and taxes have been lost.</P>
    <P>By introducing this Bill the Minister has shown that he wants reform in this whole area and I give him credit for that. The Minister should tackle the people in the other Departments, in the Department of Justice, the Department of Agriculture and Food and so on and get the whole thing straightened out.  If all these functions could be brought together <Col N="1662" /> surely some progress could be made.  As things are now the system is archaic and preventing progress.</P>
    <P>Some people on the continent experience long delays in conveyancing as well. For instance, a successful German company established in County Clare said that he established in County Clare because all the documents and grants were completed in less than six months. However, in my parish a pharmaceutical company that has given substantial employment had a problem in that establishing the ownership of the land took eight years.  I sold a part of that land and enjoyed the benefit of eight years interest, and that is why I know so much about it.  Is that not a sad commentary on our system?  If that pharmaceutical company wanted to sell to another company they would have been inhibited because we could not transfer the property. I suppose I am digressing from the Bill.</P>

      <P>The Minister has been brave in introducing this Bill and I suppose we should be grateful to him but there is a need for greater consultation between the members of the Law Society, the auctioneers and the building societies about the contents of the Bill.  From the correspondence I have received, I gather there is a lot of dissension and doubt about the Minister's final intention.  In his opening speech the Minister seemed to be saying that everything is in order and that there is no need for these consultations but that perhaps a meeting would be beneficial.  The auctioneers and building societies should notify their <Col N="1663" /> members and branches about the proposals as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>Why does the Minister need power to amend provisions contained in the Bill following its enactment?</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>How does the Minister envisage a conflict of interest arising in the provision of conveyancing and auctioneering services by building societies? He suggests that rules and regulations to provide for protection against conflict of interest would require the express approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas before such services could be provided by building societies.  That would appear to be a reasonable approach.  Would the Minister be worried about the building societies having a dominant position in the market by virtue of the powers being given to them to develop estates, provide loans and undertake conveyancing?  Part IV deals with the control and supervision of building societies by the Central Bank.  The provisions of section 38 appear to envisage ministerial interference with the Central Bank.  How does the Minister envisage that happening?  Surely the Central Bank should have total control in that they deal with substantial matters of importance to our economy?  Is that not what is defined in the Central Bank Act as being what is required of the board?  I note that Part VI deals with meetings, resolutions, voting and so on.  There have been reported abuses of voting at annual general meetings, or claims to that effect.  Apparently some collusion arose because staff members, by putting small deposits in savings accounts, were dominating voting results at meetings.  This begs the question whether such staff members should be allowed vote at such meetings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Part VII deals with provisions relating to the accounts and audit of building societies.  Part VIII, section 92, provides <Col N="1664" /> that the Minister may make regulations requiring societies to set up, individually or jointly, a scheme for the investigation and determination of complaints by customers about the services provided by societies.  That is a welcome provision. Could that provision include the services of the Ombudsman to investigate general complaints about matters over which the Central Bank would not have jurisdiction or supervisory powers?  The staff in the Ombudsman's Office are readily available to deal with complaints and some contacts between that office and the Department of the Environment have been successful in regard to minor matters such as house improvement grants, grants for the development of houses and so on.  Perhaps the Minister would consider that suggestion.</P>
    <P>Part XI deals with the conversion of building societies to public limited companies. It is clear that the Minister envisages building societies converting to public limited companies.  In practice the principle of mutuality has ceased to have a great deal of relevance.  It appears that the provisions of the Bill envisage building societies engaging in banking services.</P>

      <P>There appears to be general <Col N="1665" /> agreement among Members that this Bill is long overdue.  Indeed the Minister is to be complimented on its introduction and, in turn, the parliamentary draftsmen on its efficient preparation.  It is probably one of the lengthiest Bills ever introduced in this House by a Minister for the Environment comprised of approximately 120 sections, rendering its provisions more appropriate to Committee Stage consideration. Indeed the changes proposed will be fundamental to the operations of building societies within this State and, after 1992, within Europe.</P>
      <P>In his wisdom the Minister has decided to open up new areas in which the building societies can play a major role.  Had this Bill not been introduced then building societies here would fold up in 1992 when faced with the competition from their counterparts in the United Kingdom and Europe.  Being unprepared for such competition would have led to their being devastated.  Indeed I believe that, after 1992, there are a number of building societies here in danger of being taken over by some of their larger counterparts outside this State.  The provisions of this Bill will afford building societies an opportunity to put their houses in order, giving them a wide range of additional powers which, in turn, will allow them play effective roles in dealing with land development and the transfer of property and title, which is to be welcomed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While Members on the other side of the House may have expressed fears about the possibility of building societies' solicitors engaging in a one-house operation, I believe that the competition from outside solicitors will not allow them a monopoly.  Many Deputies have expressed reservations about various sections of the Bill but I believe the Minister is bringing the Irish building society legislation up to a standard so that the institutions concerned will be able to compete in 1992.  The fact that the Central Bank will have a regulatory position as far as the building societies are concerned is important because at the <Col N="1666" /> moment they are more or less free agents and the Central Bank is the ideal institution to deal with them.  The fact that they will be allowed to carry out secured and unsecured lending is of importance because those whom they will be competing against after 1992 can do this.  If they wish to expand outside this country to mainland Europe or to Britain they could not do so without this legislation.</P>
    <P>The fact that they are allowed to take equity in investments is also of great importance.  It means they will be able to provide a wider range of services and to be of greater benefit to society and the general public.  They will be in a position to deal with regard to land development and this could be of great benefit because it may bring about a situation where they will be able to help to control the price of the houses built on the lands they have developed.  They will also be able to build at a more competitive rate than builders are doing at the moment.  In many cases, builders have not been in a position to develop land.  They have been in a position to provide the necessary capital but when one takes into account the amounts of money involved in land development and development charges it has often meant that rather than developing a full site at the initial stage it has been put down to stage development which everyone knows is very costly.</P>
    <P>In bringing forward this Bill, the Minister is putting our building societies on a firm footing going into the nineties.  It gives them new opportunities and I have no doubt that the building societies will grasp these new opportunities.  On Committee Stage everyone will have an opportunity to express any reservations they may have.</P>
    <P>Deputy Carey mentioned earlier the question of the rights of individuals to vote at meetings.  The fact that the Minister has increased from £10 to £100 the minimum amount one must have invested in order to vote at an annual general meeting will do away with any <Col N="1667" /> abuses that may have occurred.  Increasing the limit to £100 is a very good move and of importance to people who might have feared that building societies were becoming internally controlled and that the rights of investors were being downgraded.</P>
    <P>I do not want to delay the House any longer.  I believe this Bill will enable the building societies to face the nineties on a firmer footing than they had before. The Minister is to be complimented again on the way the Bill has been presented to the House because when it becomes law it will put into effect a new set of rules and a much wider spectrum of activity on the part of the building societies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to join with Members of all sides of the House in welcoming this legislation.  In terms of magnitude and of the number of provisions it rivals other mammoth pieces of legislation, some of which have gone through the House and a number of which are going through the House, for example, the Companies Bill and the Insurance Bill.</P>
      <P>I welcome the basic thrust of the Bill which is to increase the competitiveness of the building societies to allow them to compete more openly and effectively on the open market and to allow them a wider role than that accorded to them thus far.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On going through the smaller towns of rural Ireland, one realises the extent to which the whole financial services sector has grown in the past number of years. Small towns in provincial Ireland with populations of little more than 2,000 or 3,000 people have not only the main associated banks but also the full range of building societies, the big five.  The visibility of the building societies in these towns is a good thing.  It has taken them out on to the open market, to stand on their own feet, to operate as building societies <i>per se</i>, as financial institutions <i>per se</i>, without necessarily having some <Col N="1668" /> kind of supporting appendage such as other property interests to keep them viable.</P>
    <P>I welcome this measure because it gives the building societies a chance to compete. It removes the shackles and allows the internal dynamic of the building societies to be unleashed to play a full role in the financial services sector.  One of the things that has characterised the buildings societies is that they have managed to present a softer approach in terms of their relationship with the consumer. Banks have been seen to have a more cutting edge than the building societies. With the banks it is very much a case of giving somebody an umbrella on a fine day and taking it away on a wet day. Perhaps it is the limited range of activity of building societies in providing house loans that has enabled them to have a more benevolent approach.</P>
    <P>Building societies themselves should be the last to adjust their haloes because they have not, in fairness, been without blemish.  They have not been slow to push up interest rates when the pressures of the marketplace began to apply and were very often lethargic in passing on the benefit to the consumers by reducing interest rates when there was downward pressure on the market.  In addition, we have seen a marked lack of consistency in the operations of building societies, particularly in regard to the changing conditions for obtaining loans.  At one period the basic requirement was £1,000 over a six month period and at another it was £2,000 over 12 months.  There should be some control and some element of consistency in this aspect of building society operations.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Cork Harbour Incident.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you very much, a <Col N="1669" /> Cheann Comhairle, for giving me permission to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  Thanks also to the junior Minister for making himself available at this late hour and for responding so readily to my request to have a full scale and thorough inquiry into the circumstances that led to this extraordinary incident last Sunday night in Cork Harbour.</P>
      <P>Very briefly what happened was that a 5,000 tonne cargo ship bringing scrap iron from Le Havre to the Irish Steel plant in Haulbowline was entering Cork Harbour at about 9.20 p.m. last Sunday.  At the point of entry to the harbour, when one would have thought that the ship would have been clearly positioned to enter the channel, to place itself between the navigational buoys and set itself on direct course for its destination, the ship veered southwards and ran aground on a sand bank wedged between rocks and the beach between Myrtleville and Fountainstown.</P>
      <P>On the face of it, it would seem as if this was about the most spectacular nautical U-turn that has happened in the history of Cork Harbour.  It is a matter of speculation in Cork as to how a ship that was geared to going in one direction found itself mysteriously in the opposite direction.  I will quote in this context the comment of the local sergeant who was called to the scene of a ship on the rocks. He stated in <i>The Cork Examiner</i> of Monday, 6 February:</P>
      <P>I have never known anything like this in my 25 years here.  It is a mystery to me how the ship got into this position.</P>
      <P>Indeed, it is a mystery to all of us, especially on a night when there was absolutely no fog and it is a mystery we would like to see unravelled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Luckily the ship ran aground at a point where the sand was soft, narrowly missing jutting sharp rocks &mdash; rocks that have been described as razor sharp.  I would remind the Minister that there was a gale <Col N="1670" /> force wind that night and had a gust of wind hit the ship at the point of impact, almost certainly that ship would have been wrecked off those razor sharp rocks, and we would have had in Cork Harbour a disaster almost on the scale of the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i> disaster.  Luckily that did not happen.  It has been said that luck strikes twice, and that was true on this occasion. Luckily the ship subsequently was refloated on a rising tide and was able to complete its course and arrive at its destination.</P>
    <P>The explanation given the following day by the captain of the German-owned ship when queried on how the ship went so radically off course, was that there could have been a problem with the compass. That was his only explanation.  The harbour master in response said that it &mdash; referring to the captain's explanation &mdash; certainly could have explained the problem especially if the ship was on auto-pilot. I have seldom seen so many &ldquo;ifs&rdquo; in any series of statements.  Clearly this explanation is not acceptable to me or to anybody and must not be seen to be the final word on this issue.  If it were to be the final word, there is no doubt that the harbour master and everybody connected with Cork Harbour could be accused of a degree of complacency that would be entirely out of character with the manner in which Cork Harbour has been managed for hundreds of years, and I certainly would not wish that to happen. That is exactly what happened and luckily a major disaster was averted.</P>
    <P>What might have happened had a shipwreck taken place was that in one fell swoop some of the loveliest beaches in Cork Harbour, the beaches of Myrtleville and Fountainstown that are such firm favourites with the people of Cork city, and visitors, would have been ruined with the fuel oil that must have been on that ship &mdash; I refer to the bunker oil lest anybody get uneasy about this.  The ship was not carrying a cargo of oil; it was carrying scrap steel, but nonetheless it must have had a complement of fuel oil <Col N="1671" /> which would have destroyed those beaches.  The consequent result for fishing &mdash; it is a very good fishing area &mdash; and for wild fowl in the area would have been very serious and very severe.  I would remind the Minister that we are talking about the general area of Crosshaven, an area world famous for its yachting and water activities.  An accident of this nature in any location around our coast would be deplored, but doubly so if it had happened in this locality.</P>
    <P>Cork Harbour has been the subject of much scrutiny of late by concerned citizens who are anxious and adamant to ensure that pollution levels are meticulously monitored and that adequate controls and safeguards are put in place.  That is as it ought to be, but can you imagine what a slap in the face it would have been to these people and to all of us if the accident that was so narrowly and miraculously averted on Sunday night had taken place?  The relevant authorities impose their own controls in Cork Harbour. Chemical companies in the harbour are obliged by law to ensure that all supplies of toxic materials are delivered by competent operators and in reliable vessels. That is an obligation that should be extended in law to all companies, and certainly to Irish Steel in regard to that part of the harbour.</P>
    <P>On the south coast we have had in recent years more than our share of wrecks.  On the lovely Coomeenole Beach in Kerry there are still the remains of a ship to haunt us because of our lack of foresight and our lack of legislation. Further eastwards there are the sad relics and remains of the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i>, leaving behind an issue that has not yet been settled by the Irish Government.  Further east again, there are three wrecks despoiling the face of our coastline in Ardmore and Tramore, that is to mention but a few of the wrecks along our lovely coastline.  Any wreck must be viewed with extreme concern by the Minister for the Marine, his Minister of <Col N="1672" /> State and everybody else.  Let me put it simply, we have enough wrecks now, another would be one too many so every step must be taken to ensure that whatever happened on Sunday night will not be repeated.  The word must go forth from our legislators that the kind of carelessness, neglect or whatever it was, that caused the ship to go aground is not being tolerated in our waters.  I would not like it if one of our shipping agents tried a similar conduct in German waters.  I do not think it would be acceptable or tolerated, and rightly so, and it ought not to be tolerated in Cork harbour or in any other harbour in this country, either.  I appeal to the Minister to take the strongest possible line and to view this event, with all the potential hazards it had, with extreme seriousness and to order a full inquiry and to ensure that anything of this nature will not be allowed happen again, either advertently or inadvertently.</P>
    <P>We have a harbour that has an oil refinery.  We were very lucky that a tanker at the refinery did not find itself in similar circumstances.  Can you imagine what the consequences for the whole south coast would have been had that happened?  One way or the other I am asking the Minister to view the incident with extreme seriousness.  Cork harbour and especially the city of Cork has as its motto <i>statio bene side carinis</i> which roughly translated means a good and safe harbour for ships.  That is what we have in Cork, that is the tradition that has always been maintained in Cork.  We have a harbour that has always been well managed and well monitored.  We want to ensure that that standard is maintained, that no complacency of any kind will be allowed to creep in and that while the harbour continues to be safe for ships it will be no place for shipwrecks.</P>

      <P>Tá áthas orm an deis a fháil anseo anocht freagra a thabhairt don Teachta Quill ar an cheist atá ar an Athló.  Deputy Quill referred to <Col N="1673" /> the strongest possible line being taken. None of us welcomes the kind of incident that is the subject of this debate but when we have the opportunity of doing so, we want to put the record straight.  I was very concerned on Sunday night when I got a telephone call from officials of my Department at midnight to say there was a problem in Cork harbour.  Fortunately, because of the way the tide was, the problem was resolved three hours and some minutes afterwards.</P>
      <P>The <i>Brandaris</i> was about a mile outside the mouth of Cork harbour at 22.00 hours on Sunday last.  I was informed some one and a half hours afterwards of this event. The vessel is a 985 tonne cargo vessel, not a large vessel and was en-route from Le Havre to Haulbowline to deliver scrap metal to Irish Steel Limited.  She was manned by a skipper and a crew of five. The harbour master was at the scene of the incident one hour later, at 23.00 hours, and interviewed the skipper.  He also established that there was no threat either to life or to the environment.  The hull had not been breached by the grounding, no water was being taken in and the ship was in a sheltered area.  The ship was successfully refloated at high tide at 01.50 hours on Monday morning and it is at present offloading its cargo.</P>
      <P>A surveyor from the marine survey office of my Department inspected the vessel and interviewed the skipper yesterday. As reported in the media the grounding was caused by a faulty gyrocompass. The vessel's certificates for safety construction, safety equipment, loadline and port state control were all in order.  The vessel is three years old and, according to the report from the surveyor from my Department, exceptionally well founded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>Was the bridge manned at the time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope to take up as much of my time as possible and to give the full facts.  I will not be quoting from <Col N="1674" /> any of the local or national newspapers. The surveyor took statements from the skipper and crew.  The skipper was instructed to arrange for the faulty equipment to be repaired and the inspector will be inspecting the vessel again before it leaves the harbour with a new cargo at the weekend.  If the vessel is not considered to be seaworthy it will not be allowed to leave the port until such time as it is found to be seaworthy whether that takes days, weeks or months.</P>
      <P>I note that Deputy Quill questioned whether the bridge of the <i>Brandaris</i> was manned at the time of the grounding.  I can assure the Deputy that the surveyor from my Department is completely satisfied from his investigations that the bridge was manned at that time.  If he were not so satisfied I would be arranging for my Department to hold an inquiry into the casualty in accordance with section 465 of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894.  I would like to stress that our investigations show clearly that the occurrence was a genuine accident.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the establishment of the Department of the Marine and since we assumed office in March 1987, my Department have taken a special interest in the protection of the marine environment from pollution.  I would refer the Deputy and the House to the Oil Pollution of the Sea (Civil Liability and Compensation) Act, 1988, which was enacted since we took office and also to the Sea Pollution Bill which is at an advanced stage and which I hope will come before this House if not in this session, certainly in the next session.  I would refer also to the existing Acts, the Oil Pollution of the Sea Acts, 1956 to 1977.  We have taken this action and I should point out that less than 12 months ago when a Nigerian vessel arrived here we had it inspected and found that it was not seaworthy.  That vessel was detained by us for six weeks though we were under severe pressure from the fishing industry to release it.  If we find that the position is similar here <Col N="1675" /> we will not allow the vessel to sail until such time as the compass is rectified.</P>
    <P>I share Deputy Quill's concern about the threat of oil pollution to our coastline. I would point out that one cannot compare the <i>Brandaris</i> to the <i>Kowloon Bridge.</i>  We are talking about 35 tonnes of light oil as against hundreds of tonnes of bunker oil on board the <i>Kowloon Bridge.</i>  In referring to the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i> I would refer also to the <i>Yarrawonga.</i> I can assure Deputy Quill and the House that an immediate and co-ordinated response will be initiated in the unfortunate event of any oil pollution incident or threat of such an incident in that case.  The action taken by the Government and by the Minister for the Marine in the <i>Yarrawonga</i> incident last month bears witness to our capability and commitment to respond immediately.</P>
    <P>The action taken by this Government some few weeks ago is in sharp contrast to that taken by the previous Government.  I am not accusing Deputy Quill because her party had not been founded at the time.  The Deputy referred to the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i> disaster, and I believe that that is one incident that could have been averted.  The action taken by this Government in the <i>Yarrawonga</i> incident is in sharp contrast to that taken at the time of the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i> disaster, a marine casualty that resulted in major pollution off the south coast.  As I have said, this could have been averted if the then Administration had acted as <Col N="1676" /> expeditiously as the present Administration did.  Fortunately, the boat lifted with the tide.  However, if there had been a problem, we could have acted very quickly and very responsibly.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the references the Deputy made to Myrtleville, to Fountainstown and to Crosshaven, but all I can say is that we were very pleased that there was no disaster.  However, this is not to say that there will not be future disasters off our coastline, but we are committed to dealing with these as they might occur.</P>
    <P>The Deputy was anxious for an inquiry into this matter.  If I were not in a position to accept the evidence from the marine surveyor with regard to the manning of the bridge, then an inquiry would be necessary.  Having looked at all the circumstances and the facts rather than quotations from the newspapers&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;I believe the right action was taken.  If this were not so, I would have urged on the Minister the necessity for an inquiry.  However, having weighed all the facts and taken all matters into consideration, I believe that a full inquiry is not necessary and that it was a genuine accident.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.55 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 8 February 1989.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn) Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 22 and 115 together.  I am aware of the studies referred to by the Deputies.  The causes of Alzheimer's Disease have been <Col N="1463" /> under investigation for a number of years.  One area of investigation involves a possible association between the disease and aluminium in drinking water. However, the recent studies published in Great Britain and Ireland have not established a casual relationship between the two.</P>
      <P>Aluminium sulphate has been used worldwide for the past 50 years to clarify water and this method of treatment is the most common source of residual aluminium in water.  Aluminium is also one of the commonest metals in the earth's surface and another area of investigation relates to the influence of acid rain in causing the metal to leach from soil into the environment and water.</P>
      <P>In the case of Dublin's drinking water, Dublin Corporation monitor levels of residual aluminium on a daily basis, having regard to the quality standard set in the European Communities (Quality of Water Intended for Human Consumption) Regulations, 1988, which gave legal effect to the mandatory limit set by the EC.  This limit is difficult to maintain where water treatment works are over-loaded or where filters are in poor condition. In Dublin, the Ballymore Eustace water supply cannot always be kept within the statutory limit for these reasons and slight breaches occur frequently, particularly in winter time.</P>
      <P>Last month, however, I approved the acceptance of tenders by Dublin Corporation for major improvement works costing £14 millions at Ballymore Eustace Treatment Works.  In addition to providing an extra 40 million gallons of water a day to the Dublin area, this major investment will ensure that the quality standards in the Drinking Water Regulations are consistently met.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In general, Ireland does not experience significant acid deposition, although elevated levels occur from time to time along the eastern seaboard when winds from the east predominate.  Irish emissions of the principal primary pollutants involved in the creation of acid deposition, i.e. SO 2 and NO x, are relatively small and do not give rise to significant acidification <Col N="1464" /> problems here or elsewhere.  Ireland supports moves at international level to deal with the pollutants in question through active participation in the EC Action Programme on the Environment and as a signatory to the 1979 Geneva Convention on Long Range Transboundary Air Pollution which aims to limit and, as far as possible, gradually reduce and prevent air pollution including long range air pollution. At national level, implementation of the Air Pollution Act, 1987, will contribute to the reduction of the emissions in question.</P>
    <P>There is no evidence to suggest that acidification is effecting a release of aluminium into waters used for abstraction of drinking water in Ireland.  Studies on acidification are being carried out by the Environmental Research Unit, and the issues involved will be kept under close review.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>In accordance with the provisions of the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act, 1977, monitoring or water quality in the Shannon Estuary is primarily a matter for the local authorities in the area of the estuary.  In this case it is a matter for Limerick, Clare and Kerry County Councils and Limerick Corporation to draw up appropriate monitoring arrangements and to have them implemented.  These local authorities have been co-operating in the preparation of a water quality management plan for the estuary and, in this context, a biennial water quality monitoring programme was carried out on a commissioned basis by An Foras Forbartha in 1983, 1985 and 1987.  It is open to the local authorities concerned to make appropriate arrangements with the Environmental Research Unit or otherwise to carry out any further programmes of this kind which may be needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1465" /> The studies carried out to date have shown a high water quality.  The report <i>Water Quality in Ireland &mdash; the Current Position</i> published in 1987 states that water quality was unimpaired in the estuary at the times of sampling, with the exception of some minor deterioration in the vicinity of Limerick.  I am satisfied that water in the estuary is of a high quality and poses no danger to public health.</P>

      <P>The Air Pollution Act, 1987, provides <Col N="1468" /> a comprehensive modern statutory framework for the control by local authorities of atmospheric pollution.  Regulations made under the Act in 1987 prescribe air quality standards for the most widespread air pollutants, i.e. sulphur dioxide and suspended particulates, including smoke, lead and nitrogen dioxide. The regulations also provide for monitoring of these pollutants in accordance with requirements laid down in the relevant EC directives.  Methods of sampling, measuring and analysis were prescribed in a directive which I gave on 29 October 1987 to local authorities, including Cork Corporation, under section 54 of the Air Pollution Act, and the directive also specified the locations in which certain pollutants were to be monitored. General advice in regard to monitoring arrangements has also been given to local authorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>In their statement on 31 December 1988 on the occasion of the ninth anniversary of the invasion of Afghanistan by Soviet forces, Ireland and her partners in the European Community noted that possibilities now exist for finding a political solution to the conflict and that there are numerous indications which seem to justify the hope that henceforth the Afghan people may regain their independence and control of their own destiny.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Along with our partners in the Twelve we found particularly encouraging the decision of the Soviet Government to engage in enlarged consultations, including representatives of the resistance, with a view to preparing for the establishment <Col N="1474" /> of a government which would be representative of, and acceptable to, all sides.</P>
    <P>The statement of 31 December last called upon all sides concerned to implement the Geneva Accords and, in particular, the Soviet Union to respect its undertaking to proceed with a full withdrawal of its forces from Afghan territory before 15 February 1989.</P>
    <P>Ireland, along with the rest of the Twelve, declared on the occasion of the conclusion of the Geneva Accords that, in order to permit the restoration of genuine peace, the withdrawal of Soviet troops and the unimpeded return of refugees must be accompanied by an overall political settlement of the crisis.  In a subsequent Declaration the Twelve stated that the full withdrawal of Soviet forces is essential to give the Afghan people an opportunity to determine their own future.  The key to peace in Afghanistan will be the establishment of a truly representative government by a genuine act of self-determination.  The formation of such a government is the responsibility of the Afghan people.</P>
    <P>Ireland is participating in the UN Good Offices Mission in Afghanistan and Pakistan which was established to support the good-offices role of the Secretary-General in overseeing implementation of the Geneva Accords.  Ireland does not intend to undertake a mission of mediation outside the United Nations framework.  We support the call of the UN Secretary-General for efforts by the Afghan parties themselves to ensure a satisfactory transition.  In his statement of 1 February 1989, he called on all Afghans to rise to this historic occasion and to resolve their differences peaceably, for the sake of Afghanistan and its people, through an intra-Afghan dialogue for the purpose of establishing a broad-based government.  Only a comprehensive political solution, he said, would create the necessary conditions for the millions of suffering refugees to return voluntarily to their homeland, in safety and honour.</P>
    <P>Afghanistan has been devastated by a war lasting nine years.  Ireland and the <Col N="1475" /> other members of the European Community have called on all parties, including the resistance, to exercise moderation and realism in the search for a comprehensive settlement.</P>

Further sums will be payable to State counsel and to Mr. McDonald's lawyers by way of legal aid in respect of various legal proceedings which have been taken by Mr. McDonald in the High Court and the Supreme Court.

      <P>The Offences Against the State Act, 1939, does not draw a distinction between what the Deputy refers to as &ldquo;subversive&rdquo; and &ldquo;non-subversive&rdquo; crimes and the Supreme Court has rejected the proposition that a scheduled offence under that Act must be shown to be a &ldquo;subversive&rdquo; offence as distinct from an &ldquo;ordinary&rdquo; offence before the power of arrest given by section 30 can be exercised in relation to that offence.</P>
      <P>A distinction between &ldquo;subversive&rdquo; and &ldquo;non-subversive&rdquo; crimes cannot always be readily made in practice, either.  The Garda authorities have informed me that it is not always possible to say at the time of an arrest whether a suspected offence may have subversive connections.  They have also informed me that, as and when necessary, instructions have issued to the force to take account of decisions handed down by the courts on the operation of section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939.</P>
      <P>The numbers of persons arrested under section 30 from 1979 to 1988 are as follows: 1979, 1,431; 1980, 1,874; 1981, 2,303; 1982, 2,308; 1983, 2,334; 1984, 2,216; 1985, 1,834; 1986, 2,387; 1987, 2,854; 1988, 1,938.</P>

The copy map was issued to the applicant on 3 February 1989.  The average delay at present in supplying copy maps is just over a month.  The application in question, however, took longer than average mainly because the original Land Registry map to be copied was drawn on a scale no longer used and was also found to be defaced.

The relevant provision in that regulation enables aid to be given for the &ldquo;introduction or the maintenance of farming practices compatible with the requirements of the protection of the environment and of natural resources or with the requirements of the maintenance of the landscape and the countryside&rdquo;.  If and when a decision is made to introduce the scheme here the requirements to be met by the area concerned will be drawn up in greater detail.</P>

      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to livestock grants.  The position is that the closing date for sheep headage and ewe premium applications falls in mid-March and inspections of sheep take place in Kerry and elsewhere between then and the end of June.  The closing dates under the various cattle schemes fall in the second half of June and inspections under those schemes take place in both Kerry and the rest of the country between July and December each year. Most inspections under both sets of schemes, therefore, are completed well inside the six months period referred to by the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Food the number of Irish Mulder judgment cases which were in non-marketing or cessation schemes which ended before 1 October 1983; and the provisions which will be made for them to restore quota.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy) Michael O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of Irish farmers whose non-marketing period expired prior to 1 October 1983 is about 350, of whom 140 had applied for a quota allocation.  Some of these might, in any event, have been excluded under the other criteria laid down by the EC Council of Ministers.</P>
      <P>In the Council negotiations I had sought to ensure that no farmer would be excluded because of the date of expiry of his non-marketing period.  However other member states were adamant that there had to be a cut-off date of 31 December 1983 in order to accord with the terms of the judgment in the European Court of Justice.  In the event, I succeeded in obtaining Council agreement to a date of 30 September 1983 specifically for Ireland because of our particular pattern of milk production.  In the case of the other member states the date of 31 December applies.</P>
      <P>In my view the agreement reached represents a reasonable compromise between the rights of `Mulder case' producers and the protection of existing producers. As the Council decision does not make any provision for quotas for producers whose non-marketing period expired prior to 1 October 1983, the only way in which they could be granted additional quotas is from a national reserve, set up either by Government funding, or by deductions from the quotas of existing producers &mdash; neither of which is a practical possibility.</P>

      <P>Waste paper generated at headquarters offices of my Department falls into two categories, namely, ordinary non-confidential material and confidential waste.  There are special arrangements to deal with waste of a confidential nature which is placed in special coloured plastic bags and sealed before removal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Investigations have revealed that a small number of documents in the form of draft letters relating to unemployment payments appear to have got into the ordinary non-confidential waste disposal system by mistake.  These documents were found with other waste matter in the vicinity of the Department's office in Townsend Street.  The problem would seem to have arisen because Townsend Street is at present closed to vehicular traffic due to resurfacing, and it was necessary to transfer waste by handcart to where the corporation refuse lorry was parked in Luke Street a short distance away.  My Department disposes of around 250 tonnes of confidential waste yearly and a somewhat similar quantity of ordinary waste.  I am, however, concerned to ensure the proper disposal of all confidential material and to this end I am having a full and comprehensive review carried out of the methods of handling confidential waste in the Department to ensure that satisfactory <Col N="1492" /> arrangements are in place which will prevent any repetition of the type of incident referred to by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>The Revenue Commissioners have advised me that the balancing statement for 1987-88 sent to the taxpayer on 19 January 1989 is in accordance with the information available to the inspector for that year.  A cheque for the repayment due was issued to the taxpayer on 27 January 1989.  As the repayment is smaller than the amount anticipated by the taxpayer, the inspector will communicate directly with her with a view to determining whether any further repayment is due.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance the action which is being taken to assess scientifically the loss of habitat of important and endangered species in this country; if he will outline the present situation regarding the possible loss of such habitat and such species; the action he proposes to take in order to ensure the conservation and protection of such species; if his attention has been drawn to a British publication (details supplied) which concluded that 1,800 of Britain's 22,800 insect species are threatened and over 500 are in imminent danger of extinction; and if there are any parallels of such a threat in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department has an inventory of areas of scientific importance which is constantly updated.  Research into the habitat of important and endangered species is ongoing.</P>
      <P>Areas of scientific importance include peatlands, grasslands, fens, bird sites, dune systems, woodlands, coastal heathlands and marine areas.  Such ecosystems are protected under the Wildlife Act, 1976, by creating nature reserves of available sites.  Most are State owned but there are also some protected sites in private ownership.  It is my intention to protect as many sites as possible, if necessary by acquisition of the areas in question and subject to finance being available.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the British publication referred to and, while research in Ireland into the various insect species in this country is ongoing in my Department, much remains to be done.  I am advised that the threat to insect species in this country would be at a level similar to that in the UK.</P>

      <P>The acquisition of <Col N="1499" /> Master Meats may be notifiable to me under the Mergers, Take-overs and Monopolies (Control) Act, 1978, as amended. The Act requires the parties involved in a transaction to notify me in writing of the proposal, where at least two of the enterprises involved exceed the financial thresholds of the Act (turnover &mdash; IR £10 million or gross assets &mdash; IR £5 million). To date no notification under the Act has been made in respect of this transaction.</P>
      <P>While I am entitled to require full disclosure of the control of the enterprises involved in a proposal notified under the 1978 Act, because of commitments pertaining to confidentiality of information submitted with a notifiable transaction, it is not the practice to publicly disclose the identity of any party involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since 1987 the following directives in relation to the control of vehicle emissions have been adopted: 88/76/EEC of 3 December 1987 provides for limits on the emission of gaseous pollutants (carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides) from petrol engines and the requiring of engines to be capable of using unleaded petrol from specified dates.  88/77/EEC of 3 December 1987 provides for limits on the emission of <Col N="1512" /> gaseous pollutants (carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides) from diesel engines of heavy road vehicles. 88/436/EEC of 16 June 1988 provides for limits on the emission of particulates from diesel engines of small passenger and light goods vehicles.</P>
      <P>Implementation of the provisions may be affected under EC or national type approval systems and through the prohibition of entry into service of vehicles not complying with the limits specified.</P>
      <P>I am anxious to improve air quality, particularly in our towns and cities and an important element in this campaign is the reduction of harmful vehicle emissions such as lead, carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides. Implementation of cleaner standards for vehicle emissions in Ireland would also ensure that residual stocks of vehicles below EC standards could not be dumped on the Irish market.  I am, at present, therefore considering ways and means of transposing the directives concerned into Irish law and I intend to consult the relevant trade interests as soon as possible on the mechanics and timing of proposals.</P>

The irradiation of food was approved in 1981 by the World Health Organisation, the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations and the International Atomic Energy Agency for use on certain foods at specified levels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While there is no irradiation of food taking place in Ireland, over 18 countries have reported commercial activities in food irradiation and approximately 30 industrial irradiation facilities are under construction or being planned.  An EC working party has been considering the adoption of a Directive for some time. The EC proposal is that foodstuffs may only be irradiated if there is a food hygiene need, or a demonstrable technological or other advantage or benefit to the consumer and if the foodstuffs are wholesome and in a proper condition. Irradiation should not be used as a substitute for good manufacturing practice. Foodstuffs irradiated may be marketed <Col N="1516" /> only if their packages and containers comply with the Food Labelling Directive (79/112/EEC) and the Commission is considering a proposal to make specific provision in this Directive in relation to indication of irradiation so that the consumer will be fully able to exercise a choice in the matter.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the final draft of the proposed Directive will adequately reflect legitimate concerns in relation to any possible environmental and health effects of food irradiation.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1517" /> However, its use is monitored by the public analysts in the overall context of ensuring that no sweeteners are sold which are harmful to health.  This control is exercised under the general powers contained in the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts.</P>
    <P>The EC Scientific Committee for Food has produced a report for the EC Commission on the use of specific sweeteners including saccharine, and has recommended that the average daily intake of saccharine should not exceed 0.25mg/kg of body weight.  I have informed the public analysts of the health boards and the food industry of the SCF recommendations and I will also be keeping the CEOs of the health boards informed on the matter.</P>
    <P>On the basis of the findings of this Committee, the EC Commission is currently examining sweeteners, including saccharine, against the background of a proposed new Directive on Food Additives, which it is hoped will be finalised over the coming months.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Energy the Government's position regarding the proposal to build a second nuclear power plant at Hinkley Point in Somerset; whether the Irish Government are concerned about the possible environmental effects of such a plant; if the Government are satisfied with the processes and systems for waste disposal; and his views regarding this proposal in so far as it is likely to affect the quality of the Irish environment without reference to the energy implications of such a proposal.</P>

      <P>The Government are opposed to any expansion of the UK nuclear industry because it increases the risk of damage to this country.  This opposition extends to all aspects of the nuclear industry whether existing plant or planned additional plant.  As I have already stated the UK Government have been urged by us to give utmost consideration to the objections to the proposed new plant at Hinkley Point.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Energy the reason a western package electricity grant has not been paid to a person (details supplied) in County Cork; if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the withholding of a grant will jeopardise the viability of the person's business, with consequent serious job losses; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>Regulation No. (EEC) 1030/88, which governs the western package electrification scheme, is very strict with regard to eligibility.  Articles 4 and 18A of the regulation provide that only applicants who are dependent principally on agriculture for their income are eligible for assistance under the scheme.</P>
      <P>The application referred to by the Deputy has not been approved because, on the basis of the information provided in his application, the person concerned does not fulfil these requirements.  Electricity supply, however, can be extended to the premises by the ESB under normal terms, details of which are available at the local ESB office.</P>
