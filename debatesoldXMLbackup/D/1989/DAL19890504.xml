    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>I have never been a great subscriber to the value of putting things on the Official Record of the House, and this is no reflection on your House, A Cheann Comhairle, but the fact is that the Official Report is seldom read other than by people immediately concerned. That is a sad fact.  However, as representative of the area of Sligo-Leitrim I have an obligation to put on record my recognition of the work of that body and some reflections and comments on it.  I should also like to make some suggestions in regard to the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I come to this Bill with mixed feelings. On the one hand I am pleased that effect is being given to the decision of the previous Government to abolish the commission. On the other hand, like many other Deputies, I regret the passing of a part of our history.  The Land Commission have been in existence for over <Col N="1234" /> 100 years and have played no small part in the life of the country.  Indeed, as far as the west is concerned, they played a major part in the land structure of the entire area west of the Shannon.</P>
    <P>It is quite a coincidence that the man mainly responsible for the commission being set up in the first place and in the dissolution should have the same name, Deasy.  The former Deasy, whose work was responsible for setting up the Land Commission &mdash; or brought it on would be a more accurate term &mdash; was Attorney General to the Chief Secretary in the middle of the last century.  He was responsible for the 1860 Act which laid down that the land of Ireland belonged exclusively to the landlords and that the tenants had no rights to it, apart from those granted by the landlords.  When that Act was passed the tenants could be thrown out on a whim without notice or compensation.  The reaction to that was naturally a very vigorous campaign for agrarian reform which led in 1881 to the setting up of the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>The second Deasy involved was my colleague, Deputy Deasy, who presided over the Department of Agriculture &mdash; now the Department of Agriculture and Food &mdash; at the time of the decision to abolish the commission.  Originally, the purpose of the Commission was to ensure that the tenant had certain basic rights such as the fixing of a fair rent.  Later, however, the demand was for the abolition of landlordism, and every schoolchild is aware that it became part of our political history of the late 19th century. The campaign was successful.  The process of buying out the landlords and making tenants the owners of their own farms began towards the end of that century. It was completed by the Land Act, 1923 which was piloted through this House by the distinguished first Minister for Agriculture of the new State, Mr. Paddy Hogan.  By the time the Cumann na nGaedheal Government had left office in 1932 the wheel had turned full circle and after years of confiscation and eviction the land of Ireland was back again in native hands.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1235" /> However, while the abolition of landlordism was a great victory it did little to remove the poverty of the small farmers, many of whom were concentrated in the west.  Indeed, some of them lived in parts of County Tipperary, where the Ceann Comhairle comes from.  They continued to live in very poor conditions and in many cases they merely subsisted.  Many of the farms were small and fragmented. Their owners had no capital to do anything about their holdings and no equipment. Over the last 50 years or so the Land Commission have helped many of those smallholders.  They had wide powers to compulsorily acquire land that was put up for sale or that was badly worked for distribution in turn to smallholders.  The aim was to bring as many of them as possible up to a viable standard.</P>
    <P>At one time the standard was 22 acres and, as we know now, that is too small a holding but at the time it represented a reasonable holding in the opinion of the authorities and of the farmers who worked them.  Later the standard became 45 acres of good land.  Inevitably, there was not enough land to go around and this led to the problem of selection.  Any Member who has served in this House for a long period will be well aware of that problem.  The criteria were, acreage already being farmed by the applicant, family circumstances, number in families, distance from the land being divided and farming ability.  The Land Commission re-arranged holdings which were scattered and fragmented to make compact units.  They built houses, out-offices, roads where necessary and laid on water.</P>
    <P>I have vivid memories of the first such activity I saw in the townland of Cloongoonagh, next to my home townland of Coolrecull near Aclare in south Sligo, being divided up in that fashion.  Excellent houses were provided.  I met the people involved in that activity as I went to school.  About the same time the &ldquo;striping&rdquo;, which was the term used, of a very large field, known as Clarke's field, took place.  My own football club, then known as the Aclare Football Club and <Col N="1236" /> now known as Tourlestrane, got its first football pitch through an extraordinary development.  I do not know the full explanation for it.  Apparently, the field had first to be handed over to the Church and the Church, in turn, were in a position to give it to the football team. The Land Commission, for what reason I do not know, were not entitled to hand it over to the football team.  The field served us very well and was used by many famous footballers.  Two weeks ago a new pitch was opened in that area and we had as guests a famous Kerry team.  I am glad to be able to report that Sligo drew with Kerry on that occasion.  I am not suggesting that Kerry were at their full strength.  Indeed, it was a team that my colleague, Deputy Deenihan, might have figured on had he wished even though he has retired from inter-county football.</P>
    <P>Coming as I do from that background, and from the west, I must make mention of the migration scheme.  I accept that there were very few migrants from County Sligo and that most of them were from Galway and Mayo.  However, migration was very much a feature of the work of the Land Commission.  The scheme began in 1935 and it was a great social experiment under which small western farmers gave up their land at home and moved to new holdings in the east.  The farms they gave up were used to enlarge the holdings of those who stayed behind.  Successful though the scheme was it brought with it great sadness.  No person likes to leave the place where he or she was born, where their parents and grandparents lived and where their friends are.  No one likes to move to a strange place even if it is located within their own country.  It is important to remember that we are talking about a different era, in the thirties and forties. The leaving was accompanied by great sorrow and it was traditional in the west that the night before such departures the neighbours would call to the house for what was similar to an &ldquo;American wake&rdquo;. Although people were moving to the other side of the country it was, in the context of travel at that time and lack of communication, similar to one going into <Col N="1237" /> exile.  I recall a young reporter working with <i>The Irish Press</i> in the mid-fifties &mdash; at that time it was a very good newspaper; although biased it had the best newsroom team in town &mdash; going to Westmeath or Meath to prepare a report on the last of the migrant families from the west settling in on their new holding.</P>
    <P>The biggest migration was to County Meath and those who went were known as colonists.  They got 24 acres of land, a house and a bank of turf.  The Land Commission looked after them very well. Many people from the west are extremely grateful to them for their help.  Contemporary accounts indicate that each migrant received three cows, two heifers, 12 sheep, one sow, two bonhams, 21 fowl, a horse and cart, a donkey and cart, harness, a plough, two harrows, a scuffler, a roller, ploughing tackle, a wheelbarrow, a turf barrow, dairy utensils and a share in a mowing machine and a potato sprayer.  An indication of the change in times is the fact that many young people in County Meath have never seen some of those implements. Indeed, they would not be able to identify them.</P>
    <P>The colonists were a great asset to their new areas and they brought with them a new culture, one that has survived to the enrichment of the areas they settled in. Their children have turned out extremely well and many of them subsequently became public figures.  However, it should be said that the migrants from the west were not universally welcomed in their new homes and I should like to hear some Members from Meath comment on that.</P>
    <P>However, I cannot detain the House too long with reminiscences of what was by any standards a great institution.  At times we may have disagreed with the way they divided land; we had a different view from that of the inspectors.  Deputies and Senators were intimately involved in such divisions and they did not always agree with the Commission.  However, the Land Commission was a great institution and did a tremendous job.  Before <Col N="1238" /> I leave the subject I should like to compliment another group, the Land Commission inspectorate, those who had to be Solomons in their judgment in the division of land.  They had to divide land at a time when there was not sufficient land for all applicants.  The question of selection always turned out to be a difficult one and those who dealt with that were the inspectors.  While we may have had our difficulties with them and criticised them &mdash; on occasions we may have accused them of political bias &mdash; by and large the inspectors did a very good job.</P>
    <P>I must also refer to the achievements of the Commission.  The land settlement programme led to the division of 2.5 million acres among about 150,000 beneficiaries. That is the epitaph so far as the Land Commission are concerned.  Farmers did not, of course, get this land free. The Land Commission paid for it in the first place and were repaid by &ldquo;annuities&rdquo;, a word which needs no explanation to any Irishman.  Indeed anyone of my age, or even considerably younger, who comes from the west of Ireland will remember annunities and demand notes being placed on the dresser to be paid at the appropriate time.  Some of the annuities due on land purchased before 1922 led to the famous economic war with Britain in the thirties.  The Irish Government of the day decided that enough was enough and refused payment of about £5 million per year to Britain for land bought before the Treaty.</P>
    <P>Of course, we are not out of the woods yet.  We still have need for a land policy. There are still a large number of holdings below an economic size and there are still very many people who want to get into farming.  To help those with small farms to get a larger acreage I would support very strongly the views expressed by my colleague, Deputy Connaughton, when he was Minister of State.  His idea was that small farmers wishing to purchase land coming on the market in their areas should be helped by the Minister's officials to come together as a group to purchase it.  Some of these farmers might not have enough money to buy all the <Col N="1239" /> land and some of them &mdash; and it is important to remember this &mdash; might not be in a position to work all the land even if they got it.  In that event they would be looking for a way to buy some of the land and the Minister's officials could act as a catalyst in this regard.</P>
    <P>There is a particular kind of farmer affected by this problem.  Generally speaking, he is a fairly young energetic farmer who has done a farming course of 100 hours or more but who does not have enough land and is not fortunate enough to have inherited a large amount of land or the capital with which to buy land. Those farmers are in a very difficult situation. What they need &mdash; and the Minister of State will have his own ideas about what form this should take &mdash; is some type of honest broker to act on their behalf.  Even if neighbours and friends agree to come together to purchase a piece of land which they will subsequently divide, unfortunately, land generates more difficulties, more problems and more rows than anything else.  We know that, it is part of our history.  Farmers need some sort of outside body who will act as an honest broker and undertake that activity for them.</P>
    <P>I see in this morning's <i>Irish Independent</i> that Dan McCarthy of the ICMSA Family Farm Development Committee has called this Land Bill foul and a fraud.  The reason he advances for this is that there will be no authority to replace the Land Commission.  Dan McCarthy, who operated an organisation of his own for many years, is a man I greatly respect because he is always logical in his approach and he goes straight to the point.  I believe he is right that some sort of authority must be established to take over the functions of the Land Commission when they are dissolved.  He also mentions the fact that two and a half years ago, when the present Taoiseach was Leader of the Opposition Party, he promised the ICMSA that accompanying the Bill to dissolve the Land Commission would be a Bill to establish a new land authority.  That appears to have been a specific promise.  If the Government fail <Col N="1240" /> to do that, it will not be the first promise they have failed to deliver on, but it was a very significant promise.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister of State is very familiar with the problems being experienced by farmers in County Louth, although they do not have the same problems as the farmers in the west.  He knows the problems being experienced by farmers in small holdings in Kilkerley and places like that and I am sure he appreciates very much the need for some sort of honest broker who will do the job for these young, energetic and enthusiastic farmers who are at present caught in a bind.  In my constituency there are people who are anxious to come together but, as the Ceann Comhairle knows very well, it is very difficult to do that.  Many people are very suspicious and if one man reveals his hand the other man will know what he is doing and the result is that what could have been a nice combination of small farmers who would buy out a neighbouring holding and divide it among themselves so that it would fit neatly into a good restructuring plan will not come together because there is no one to do that job.  In addition to the work involved in the purchase of the land and bringing these people together, it would be equally important to have an honest broker involved in the division of the land so that he could decide what each person would get and the actual price each person in the group should pay.  The Government should pay attention to what has been said in those areas.</P>
    <P>Despite the compliments we have paid, we know a lot of work still has to be done in regard to restructuring.  Those who have land on lease on a long term basis must be encouraged to come together to do the kind of thing I have been talking about.  If we leave a vacuum in that area there will be major difficulties.  In many parts of the country there are still holdings which are scattered and fragmented and the Minister must ensure that such holdings are rearranged in the interests of efficiency.  It would be a great pity if, when the Land Commission are gone, we were to ignore matters such as those to which I have referred.  Therefore, it is <Col N="1241" /> important that the Minister give his unremitting attention to them and ensure that a land policy is framed and implemented. I would welcome an indication from the Minister when he is replying of his intentions in this regard.</P>
    <P>The history of the Land Commission is in turn part of the history, tradition and fabric of the west of Ireland and I want to pay a compliment to the men who are there now and their predecessors.  It is only right to say that not only were the Land Commission a national institution but many of the inspectorate at local level would qualify to a certain extent as institutions in themselves.  They did a very difficult job well and it would be a great shame if some body were not put in place to carry on from the Land Commission. We are not talking about acquiring land any more, that is all over, but we are asking for some body to be established so that if land becomes available small farmers can be grouped together to buy that land.</P>
    <P>Something should also be done about the general overall fragmentation in many holdings.  A good job has been done in regard to commonages and this is just as well because, as we know, many commonages were not producing to full capacity and when cattle were grazed on them disease could spread.  With the emphasis finally being put on getting to grips with bovine tuberculosis it is essential that this kind of activity be eliminated altogether because it has no place in the future of Irish farming.  That is the position.</P>
    <P>I am glad that this Bill is going through the House.  However, we need something extra.  I have no doubt that the Minister of State when replying will give us some indication of Government thinking on this very important matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Representing a county such as Kerry, which has benefited considerably from Land Commission activities over the past 100 years, it gives me great pleasure to contribute to this debate.  Throughout the history of this country land and the law pertaining to it have been at the very core of social and <Col N="1242" /> economic life to an extent rarely equalled in important elsewhere.</P>
      <P>The concept of land itself is a complex one, varying in meaning from age to age, from country to country, from one society to another, indeed from one professional group to another.  For example, to agricultural scientists land is the soil, the basic resource for the production of agricultural produce.  To the economist it is a factor of production along with labour, capital and management, while planners and geographers view land as the earth's surface or simply a space.  To the legal profession land is property, and property confers rights, privileges and obligations.  Conservationists see land as part of the natural environment.  From a sociological point of view land is a basis of wealth, social status or class, power, prestige and security.  Taking a wider view, land is a concept loaded with sentiment and symbolism.</P>
      <P>Our history has given the Irish farmer an exceptionally strong attachment to his land, reflected in a tendency to withhold its possession until the last moment rather than pass it on to his successors or retire. Of course, in this country for centuries land has been linked to emotions and aspirations for freedom, independence and social equality.</P>
      <P>As a commodity land has certain special characteristics distinguishing it from any other commodity know to economics.  It is the source of all other forms of material wealth beginning with foodstuffs.  It is God-given, not man made, though it can be modified by the hand and work of man.  It is perennial, not subject to the processes which destroy other resources.  If well treated and rotated it will remain, and has remained, productive throughout time. It is limited in extent and this is as true with regard to any individual country as to the overall surface of the globe.  Since land is an essential commodity to all people its very existence cannot be over-emphasised. Therefore there ought to be wider distribution of land and property rather than having it piled up in the hands of the few.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proper usage of land stems from <Col N="1243" /> its self-evident importance.  Agriculture is this country's basic industry, the main source of foreign exchange being our agricultural exports.  Indeed, the country's economic wellbeing and future growth are allied to our ability to earn money abroad.  Agriculture accounts for about half of our total exports while continuing to have a very low import content. A substantial proportion of the country's working population is employed either on the land or in industries and services allied to agriculture.  Therefore it will be readily seen that the development of the potential of our land is crucial to our economic expansion and wellbeing.  Current emphasis is on efficiency, productivity and profit.  The desire to modernise has emanated from the farmer himself and from the pressures of a competitive market.  This highlights the need to ensure that land is maintained in the hands of those best equipped to use it, thereby ensuring maximum benefit to the economy.</P>
    <P>In Ireland the issues of land ownership and reform are almost synonymous with the Land Commission.  For example, in the 108 years since its inception the Land Commission have reversed the cumulative effects of centuries of strife and violence by restoring to the Irish farmer the land and legal rights filched from him by a succession of penal enactments.</P>
    <P>I had intended to sketch briefly here the role and impact of the various Land Acts comprising the land code.  However, as this matter has been adequately dealt with by the Minister and Deputy Doyle, I shall refrain from doing so.  However, the reform brought about by the Land Acts under the British regime by the Land Commission and the congested district boards was substantial.  For example, over 316,000 holdings covering 11 million acres were purchased by or for tenants for a consideration of £100 million.  In addition, 750,000 acres of untenanted land had been divided among 35,000 allotees, either by way of enlargement of uneconomic holdings or by the creation of new holdings.  Since 1923 almost 110,000 tenants have had their <Col N="1244" /> holdings vested in them by the Land Commission for advances totalling almost £18 million.  In addition, over 2.3 million acres of untenanted land has been distributed.  As has been pointed out by previous speakers, including the Minister, the Land Commission were concerned also with the human problems pertaining to tenants and allotees, whose lot they strove to improve.</P>
    <P>When engaging in research in preparation for this debate I came across the following extract from <i>Business and Finance</i> of a number of years ago which read:</P>
    <P>Finally, it should be remembered that the Irish Land Commission since its earliest days has been dealing with problems which are not only of immense national importance but deeply human.  Statistics on acreages acquired and moneys spent, endless legislation and mounds of paperwork can cloud over the fact that for the farmer battling against insurmountable odds to eke an existence from a few acres of rock in Donegal or Kerry, the Land Commission means a chance to begin a new life.  It means an end to the uneven struggle against nature which has already probably killed his parents and forced his brother and sisters to emigrate, and an opportunity to return again in many cases to the region from which his forefathers were driven at the point of a sword.  But it means a parting of neighbours and friends who have lived together for generations, who have helped each other through the bad times and who feel uneasy about the prospect of moving in among strangers.</P>
    <P>The Land Commission has recognised this human problem also and has tried to ease it by migrating groups of neighbouring smallholders to new farms in the same locality.  This group migration scheme has had the added advantage to do a better job for those who remain behind.  In addition all acquired land is rehabilitated and fertilised before it is handed over to its new owners and holding for migrants <Col N="1245" /> are equipped with new houses and outoffices where necessary.</P>
    <P>In the Land Commission, then, Ireland has a unique institution which has, during its 89 years' existence, reversed many of the wrongs perpetrated throughout seven centuries of turbulent history and inspired a body of agrarian legislation which is very much in line with modern thinking and could well prove to be ahead of its time in an EEC context.  The role of the Commission has developed over the years from that of a rent-fixing tribunal to a major agency for the implementation of agrarian policy.  As this policy develops, as it must under EEC conditions, the Commission is certain to have an increasingly important role to play in ensuring that the land of Ireland is divided equitably amongst our agricultural population and that it is used to produce for them, and for the nation, a wealthy harvest on which the future of this country must, to a very large extent, ultimately depend.</P>
    <P>Indeed, many of the sentiments expressed in that article have been voiced by Deputy Nealon and several other contributors to this debate.</P>
    <P>The Land Commission have been vested with extensive powers to acquire lands required for their statutory purposes. In granting those powers &mdash; now being revoked under the provisions of this Bill &mdash; the Legislature imposed strict limitations on them in order to safeguard owners' rights.  Those limitations are carefully defined by statute and governed by rule.  As a result, the legal process of acquiring land was a lengthy one which frequently tended to follow the line of most rather than least resistance.</P>
    <P>Land acquired compulsorily was often non-residential or neglected and was not serving fully the national economy.  In practice a substantial portion of the lands which came into the hands of the Land Commission was purchased on a voluntary basis.  Full market value was paid to the owners.</P>
    <P>Such a land policy as we have derives from the directive, Principles of Social <Col N="1246" /> Policy, as outlined in the Constitution, Article 45.2.v. which states that:</P>
    <P>The State shall, in particular, direct its policy towards securing ... That there may be established on the land in economic security as many families as in the circumstances shall be practicable.</P>
    <P>Since 1939 that policy has as its primary objective the structural reform of uneconomic holdings throughout the State, with special emphasis on the relief of the acute congestion prevailing in western countries.  To this end performance in recent years was aimed at an annual land re-settlement programme in the region of 30,000 acres.  In addition to the distribution of land among sub-standard land holders and the creation of new life-size farms, it was the policy of the Land Commission to re-arrange into compact workable units holdings which are held in rundale, that is in scattered strips, frequently unfenced and without any proper means of communication between them.</P>
    <P>To keep pace with the upsurge in living standards the Land Commission found it necessary to review from time to time the concept of what a viable farm unit should be, with the result that the area has progressively been increased down through the years from eight to ten hectares to the current level of 16 to 18 hectares of good land or the equivalent in land of mixed quality.  The adoption of this standard in 1962 was designed to take into account the then current outlook and trends in family income and development in farming techniques.  It was considered that a family farm should be capable not alone of affording a standard of living comparable with that available to those engaged in non-agricultural employment but also of maintaining the farm family in comfort under conditions of intensified competition in the future.  Indeed, that was one of the hopes we had when entering the Common Market.  That policy certainly looked to the future and what was going to happen.</P>
    <P>Two milestones in the recent evolution of land policy were (1) the report of the interdepartmental committee on land <Col N="1247" /> reform issued in May 1978 and (2) the White Paper on land policy published in December 1980.  As regards the report of the interdepartmental committee on land reform, I would like to list some of the most important findings and recommendations of the committee.  Firstly, as long as a considerable proportion of the country's land resources remain under utilised and unproductive the agricultural industry cannot make its proper contribution to the development of the economy. This gives the clearest possible justification for directing new policies towards ensuring that all land is, as far as possible, productively and efficiently used in the future.  Secondly, the inherent productive capacity of the land is not exploited to anything like its full potential with the available level of technology. Estimates of the country's grassland potential point to considerable discrepancies between the technical capacity and what is actually being achieved.  Thirdly, whatever growth is being attained is coming from two thirds of our land.  The problem of achieving agricultural development on the low producing farms will not be solved simply by improving farm product prices, increasing the level of investment or applying modern technology.  All these are necessary, but they will evoke a response only from those farmers who are able and willing to combine good management with a basic amount of land.  Fourthly, the land tenure system, characterised by a high incidence of owner occupancy, and thus a virtual absence of long term leasing, coupled with a tradition of late transfer of family holdings, does not provide the basis for a high degree of land mobility from one set of users to another. The land market is limited and the way it operates is not conducive to the emergence of a more favourable farm structure. Many farms are small and of poor quality.</P>
    <P>The main proposals of the committee in dealing with those problems were: future land policy to be based predominantly on measures which would promote the efficient use of land for agricultural development and a new land <Col N="1248" /> agency to be established in place of the Land Commission to implement future land policy.  This agency was to monitor sales of agricultural land, and vendors would have to notify the agency of proposed sales and advertise the sales in a prescribed manner.  The agency would be empowered to operate a system of control in land market transactions and maintain a register of priority entitlement land applicants to whom the agency would endeavour to channel land becoming available on the market.  No purchaser would be allowed to acquire agricultural land which would bring his total holding in excess of a certain level. There would be no limit on the amount of land acquired through a direct inheritance or intra farming transfers.</P>
    <P>A number of other proposals were made which I will not list here.  Overall it was a fairly detailed charter for dealing with the problems of land use and land mobility and obviously one to which considerable thought was given by the committee. It is fair to say that the report has more or less been ignored to date. Certainly, this Bill, which deals only with the dissolution of the Land Commission and does not deal with any new proposal on land policy, reflects that this report was not considered when this Bill was being drafted.</P>
    <P>In the event what followed two years later was a White Paper.  The policy outlined in that had two broad aims: firstly, to influence the land market in such a way as to make it possible for smaller, more progressive farmers to procure additional land; and, secondly, to promote the more efficient use of land so that agriculture could make the greatest possible contribution to the national economy.  Indeed, as Deputy Stagg mentioned yesterday the measures proposed were radical and it was unfortunate that they were not taken on board.  I will list some of these proposals.  All purchases of agricultural land exceeding a certain level would require the consent of the Land Commission or the Land Authority. Purchases of agricultural land would attract a surcharge ranging from 15 per cent to 50 per cent of the purchase <Col N="1249" /> price in the case of farmers depending on the size of the final holding and 60 per cent in other cases.  There would be no surcharge where farmer's final holding did not exceed a certain limit; a small holder whose existing holding did not exceed a certain level could qualify for a premium in respect of such additional land purchased as would bring his final holding up to a viable level.  A new farmers' retirement scheme was to be prepared and earlier succession to be promoted, leasing to be encouraged and facilitated, commonage division to be stepped up, etc.  It also proposed that local lists of suitable farmers be drawn up who would have priority access to land coming on the market.</P>
    <P>When you consider both the inter-departmental committee report and also the White Paper on land policy and what has transpired over the past seven or eight years, I could say that both were ignored except for an effort by the former Minister of State, Deputy Connaughton, to introduce more attractive long term leasing. Nevertheless, one could safely say that the efforts of the inter-departmental committee and also what was proposed in the White Paper were futile and in vain.</P>
    <P>In the light of all that has been written, studied and suggested as a means of improving land use and land structure, where do we go?  We must ask ourselves the basic question; &ldquo;Do we need a land policy and, if so, what form should it take?&rdquo;  We can adopt the stance that changing the land structure pattern is best left to the free play of the market, which seems to be the policy of the present Government.  This means that a fat purse will be the sole criterion of eligibility to purchase.  In other words, whoever has the cheque book will decide on who will buy the land.  The likelihood in that event is that the bulk of land coming up for sale will be bought by wealthy large farmers. There has already been evidence that half of the open market land went to people who were not full time farmers.  If, on the other hand, it is accepted that <i>laissez faire</i> is not the answer, then the question is: &ldquo;What should the aims of the land policy <Col N="1250" /> be?&rdquo;  Is it to promote the more efficient use of the country's land resources while allowing for a reasonable distribution of ownership?  Is this a sufficient aim?  Land is not an asset for the benefit of whoever owns it &mdash; it has a social dimension.</P>
    <P>What are the problems which an effective land policy should seek to put right? I have already mentioned some, but I will summarise them.  Under-use of land is one, because many owners are not able or sufficiently interested to develop their holdings.  There is a considerable number of holdings which are too small to be viable for those who are dependent for their livelihood on agriculture and who are using land efficiently.  The rate of land mobility is slow due to the smallness of the land market, late retirements and reluctance to engage in long term leasing.</P>
    <P>The direction of such land mobility as exists is towards people with other occupations, rather than smallholders and young qualified landless farmers.  We must ask if this House adheres to the long standing acceptance throughout the community of the philosophy that not only do we need a strong agricultural industry but that the basic unit of production must be the family farm where a decent livelihood can be had under reasonable working conditions.</P>
    <P>In County Kerry we have lost over 2,000 from the land in the past ten years. We are losing small farmers at an average rate of 300 every year.  Over 60 per cent of suppliers to North Kerry Milk Products, one of our largest co-operatives, have over 12,000 gallons of a milk quota.  If this policy, or lack of policy, continues, these farmers will be cleaned off the land in ten years' time.  I give another statistic. Only 5 per cent of those supplying the Kerry co-operative have quotas of over 50,000 gallons.  In an area like Kerry where there are so many smallholders there is a need for a policy, for State intervention.  Whoever owns the cheque book will decide on who will get the land. What we will have will be a small number of large farmers and the whole country will be devoid of its very soul, the small farming community.</P>
    <P>In the national plan the Government <Col N="1251" /> presented to Europe, various references were made to rural depopulation and to preserving the small farmer on the land. The reasoning behind the proposal to dissolve the Land Commission &mdash; various reasons were given in support of this and I know that it was proposed by my own party &mdash; was that something would be put in its place.  Is it the intention of the Minister's party, as promised at the last election, that there will be a land authority to take its place?  It is essential to ensure that the small farmer, especially in the west, will not remain an endangered species, as is the position at present.</P>
    <P>Agriculture will remain our largest industry for the foreseeable future.  When we speak of the farmer, and especially the family farmer, we are speaking of the worker in our largest industry.  It is a harsh, unpalatable fact of life that there are still between 70,000 and 80,000 family holdings below the current standard of 40 to 45 adjusted acres.  That acreage is threatened because of what has been happening recently on the land market. The fact that so many farmers subsist on uneconomic holdings and still can win a livelihood from the land is testimony to their industry and determination.  In a recent article published in the <i>Irish Times</i> of 17 March last, Michael Dillon, on the occasion of the presentation of the Small Farm Development Awards, had this to say:</P>
    <P>The progress of Irish farming was well demonstrated yesterday at the presentation of the Small Farm Development Awards.  The standard of the winners of all the classes, and of many others who entered, was very high in any context, and provides a startling contrast with those in the first such competition about 30 years ago.</P>
    <P>All of these people have shown that small enterprises can still be very successful, and that intelligence, determination and commitment to hard work can overcome most handicaps. Very many awards went to husband and wife teams.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1252" /> The article dealt mostly with the enterprise of the small farmer and the potential that rests in that community.  It bears out my point that the small farmer must be protected and given a chance.</P>
    <P>The article continues:</P>
    <P>The Minister for Food, Mr. Joe Walsh, who presented the awards, was particularly pleased with that sort of entry.</P>
    <P>&mdash;meaning the small farmer and husband and wife team&mdash;</P>
    <P>bringing an alternative enterprise on to the farm, at a time when expansion in traditional enterprises is being restricted.</P>
    <P>At this juncture I turn to the Bill before us and must ask a very pertinent question. To what extent does it lay a basis for a national land policy which will eliminate, or at least lessen, the impact of the problems outlined?  I see no reference in the explanatory memorandum to policy in relation to land use, to mobility or to structural reform.  The tone is set in the first sentence which says that the purpose of the Bill is to dissolve the Land Commission, to revoke powers to acquire land under land purchase Acts, etc.  I fail to see, in any of the provisions of the Bill, a mechanism of any kind for the development of a coherent land policy.  Is land policy to be regarded as being of no significance in the future?</P>
    <P>Under section 2, all powers conferred on the Land Commission by the Land Purchase Acts to acquire or purchase land are being abolished, except by way of exchange.  Compulsory land acquisition has in the past been a difficult business, involving objections, court hearings, appeals and ultimately refusals, in many instances, to hand over possession. These powers were considerably curtailed by various High Court and Supreme Court decisions and judgments. These were the checks and balances that one finds in any democratic society.  The rights of individual land owners were fully protected and the Land Commission had to prove their case for acquisition up to the hilt before they could acquire the <Col N="1253" /> land and then often only for very specific purposes such as relief of agricultural congestion in the locality.</P>
    <P>These powers constituted one of the greatest array of weapons designed to provide the ultimate sanction against the neglect and misuse of land that should be put to better use.  As far as I am aware no country in the European Community is equipped with such powers.  Used wisely and discreetly, they are a great deterrent to indifferent land use.  Now they are being wiped out.  I feel that this may prove to be a big mistake.  Could the Minister refer to this when replying to Second Stage debate?  Why not let the Land Commission lie dormant on the Statute Books in case they need to be reintroduced at some future stage to counter abuses in the use and disposition of land, and stop undesirable accumulations which can leave real smallholders high and dry in their quest for additional land. The explanatory memorandum says &ldquo;The intention is to revoke all powers to take over land (except of exchange) for land settlement purposes&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Both the report of the inter-departmental committee and the White Paper envisaged compulsory land acquistion as a last resort.  Why is this concept being overthrown?  I see that with the demise of compulsory acquisition the intention of Section 4 is that the balance of the Land Commission's functions will devolve on the Minister and he will be authorised to delegate to his officers such functions as he sees fit.  I presume that these functions will include adjudicating on applications for purchase of land by non-qualified persons under section 45 of the Land Act of 1965.  In this connection I must ask what are the criteria governing the method for dealing with these applications at present and what will they be under the new arrangements.</P>
    <P>Deputy Doyle referred in her speech to the question of unqualified persons and said that this cateogry should be carefully defined in view of the fact that large companies are now coming into Ireland and buying up large stretches of land, be it for forestry or other purposes, or just to leave it lie dormant.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1254" /> It is our duty as legislators to ensure the land of Ireland will not become again the preserve of the rich and the ranchers with the very existence of our smallholders threatened.  At present member nationals of the EC exercising the right of establishment can buy as much land here as they like without reference to the Land Commission.  All they have to do is put a certificate in the deed of transfer to the effect that they are exercising the right of establishment.  No records are available to show the extent of these transactions.  We have no figures to show how much of the land of Ireland is passing from native to other hands.  Again I would like the Minister to refer to this in his reply.  It will be interesting to know these figures.</P>
    <P>It may be argued that it makes no difference how many EC nationals are buying Irish land since they are entitled to do so.  It is here the relevance of the land commissioners' compulsory powers is seen.  These powers can be used to discourage undesirable accumulation of land, provided they are exercised in a non-discriminatory manner and used in an evenhanded way to discourage Irish speculators as well as non-Irish speculators. Leaving aside EC nationals, what about all the others who can now buy as much land as they like if they have enough money, regardless of whether they need that land?  Will they continue to have a free hand?  This House and expecially the Minister must address these problems.</P>
    <P>Section 8 of the Bill deals with what has always been a difficult and controversial aspect of Land Commission work, that is, land division, getting rid of the land that will still be undivided when the Land Commission are dissolved.  The Minister will now take over that job which has always been left to the independent and impartial discretion of the commissioners. Notices will be published in the paper alerting interested applicants that the lands are to be sold.  How many applicants will see a notice in <i>Irish Oifigiúil</i> or in at least one newspaper published and ciruclating in the county in which the land is situated?  Is there any real <Col N="1255" /> substitute for the detailed and solid local inspection and inquiries that take place at present where every smallholder living within a mile of the land is automatically considered and interviewed?</P>
    <P>My experience of land division is that, while the choice of successful allottees might not always have been my choice, I still could not find fault with the thorough, painstaking efforts of the local inspectors who made such a detailed assessment of each applicant.  Deputy Nealon referred to political interference and so forth by Ministers and, no doubt, because the Minister's party were in power for such a long time, land divisions were sometimes associated with being a member of the local cumann or whatever, but I would not blame the local officers in most cases.  They only submitted their proposals.  One of the reasons for the dissolution of this body was political interference; but whether that is true I do not know.  Certainly, where I saw land distributed I thought it was done fairly in most cases.</P>
    <P>Deputy Nealon referred to land annuities. It seems as if many people around the country who got land from the Land Commission are now seriously in arrears with payments of their half yearly instalments. I see no reference in the Bill to the possibility of enabling these annuities to be reduced or arrears written off. Under the new dispensation, that is when the Land Commission are gone, who will deal with these thorny issues of reducing or mitigating the effects of high annuities? For example, who is going to take responsibility now for these annuities? Now that land bonds are being abolished, according to recent announcements in the papers, would this not be a suitable opportunity to take a new look at the whole question of land annuities and see whether there is a case to be made for encouraging people to pay off the annuities on favourable terms?  A scheme operated last year for house purchase where a number of local authority tenants purchased their houses.  I suggest that the Minister of State present discuss with his Minister the possibility that people who <Col N="1256" /> have land and are paying annuities be given the chance of buying their land and buying out their annuities.</P>
    <P>Another point I would like to mention is the question of rearranging intermixed holdings and dividing commonages. While these are very laudable and necessary operations, they are nevertheless marginal to the mainstream purpose of improving land use, structures and mobility.  With the disappearance of compulsory powers to intervene in these activities, there will be no adequate measures for dealing with unco-operative and difficult tenants and commage shareholders. How will the Minister address this problem with the disappearance of these powers?  How will he acquire this land compulsorily?  What measures can be taken?</P>
    <P>When the Land Commission have been consigned to the scrapheap of history we will have no body or agency to intervene on behalf of the many deserving small farmers and qualified young landless applicants who so desperately need land to make their livelihood.  Deputy Nealon referred to an article in today's <i>Irish Independent</i> in which Dan McCarthy of the ICMSA Family Farm Development Committee referred to this Bill.  I quote from page 8:</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture, Michael O'Kennedy, is now presiding over the sale of land to &ldquo;unqualified persons&rdquo; at the rate of 3,500 acres per month, ...</P>
    <P>This is staggering, really frightening&mdash;</P>
    <P>This is happening at the same time as hundreds of well-qualified young agricultural people are forced to emigrate for the want of land, the chairman of the ICSMA Family Farm Development Committee, Dan McCarthy said.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Foul and fraud&rdquo; is the description given by Mr. McCarthy to the Bill now before the Dáil to dissolve the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>Mr. McCarthy said the Bill was foul because it will permanently damage the viability prospects of thousands of <Col N="1257" /> very good small farmers.  It is a fraud he said because the Taoiseach scarcely two and a half years ago when he led the Opposition, promised the ICSMA that accompanying the Bill to dissolve the Land Commission would be a Bill to establish a new Land Authority.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Minister for Agriculture is now presiding over the sale of land to unqualified persons at the rate of 3,500 acres per month&rdquo; he said.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This cannot be defended, particularly at a time when hundreds of well qualified young persons with either Green Certificates, or one year's training at an agricultural college, or on completion of the three year Farm Apprenticeship Scheme, are forced to emigrate, for the want of land.</P>
    <P>This bears out the point I am making. What kind of mechanism does this House consider should be brought into play to enable these deserving and enterprising applicants to gain access to the land they are more than willing to work to its full potential if they can obtain it?</P>
    <P>When I was researching for this speech I came across a quotation from the Most Reverend Doctor Philbin, Bishop of Clonfert, away back in 1959, writing on rural problems and I will quote an extract from it:</P>
    <P>In Ireland we should not allow ourselves to become pessimistic to the point of passivity about what is happening. We have advantages and assets which we ought to cultivate in order to balance the difficulties we must contend with.  The chief reason why I am confident that we can maintain a wide distribution of land ownership is the attachment of so many of our young men to the land and their desire to become farmers, even in a small way.</P>
    <P>This may seem an extremely controvertible statement in view of the extent to which young people are deserting the countryside.  Yet, to anyone who examines the picture carefully at close quarters, the most significant fact is not the numbers that are leaving the land but the extent to which <Col N="1258" /> the love of farming and the desire to become farmers are rooted in the bulk of our rural population.  This attachment to the land is surely our greatest single economic asset.  It behoves us to give every encouragement and satisfaction to it to see that it secures the recompense without which it cannot survive and to neutralise, as far as we can, the influences that are countering it.  I am convinced that if we build upon this foundation, we can go a long way towards minimising the evil effects of emigration and rural depopulation, even though we shall probably always have to accept a certain measure of these.</P>
    <P>This was back in 1959.  Would these stirring words be easily translated to 1989?  Dan McCarthy is echoing the same sentiments today in the <i>Irish Independent.</i></P>
    <P>There are many other points I should like to develop on this theme of attachment to the land and facilitating easy access, but I do not wish to take up too much of the time of the House.  I will refer briefly to some other matters which should have been dealt with in this Bill. Long term leasing of land is one example. Should we not think in terms of incentives to encourage a general change of attitude to this form of land holding, the advantages of which are manifold?  It is accepted that in addition to actual transfer, leasing could be an answer to the problem of getting land into the hands of younger and more enterprising farmers. However, it is a practice which at present has hardly any place in our land tenure system and there is no easy way to ensure immediate and widespread acceptance of it.  The short-term letting of land on the 11-month system is common, with very often the same land being taken by the same person for several years in succession. It would seem to be a short step from that to a system of leasing for an extended period of five to six years, for example.  Yet this does not happen.  The Land Bill introduced by the then Minister of State, Deputy Paul Connaughton, <Col N="1259" /> tried to do just that but there is no evidence that it has succeeded on the ground.  I appeal to the Minister to try to make long-term leasing more attractive to farmers.  There is a fear regarding land ownership and so forth but if the farmer feels he is protected by law and is given the right incentives I believe he will be prepared to lease his land on a long term basis.  That attitude does not prevail at present among the vast majority of farmers. They are afraid to lease their land for more than 11 months in case by some means they could lose it.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of land ownership which worries me is the relatively slow rate of transfer or mobility.  Deputy Connaughton, speaking some time ago, said that the great bulk of land passing from one management to another is by way of inheritance or gift from one parent to son or daughter.  The Deputy went on to say that late inheritance in Irish farming has been a much debated problem for generations and that the tradition that the Irish farmer remains active in farming and in control of the land right up to his death means that the heir to his farm is denied control during his most enterprising and ambitious years.  Deputy Connaughton concluded that this obviously has an adverse effect on agricultural development, especially in the present day and age when we need the initiative and enthusiasm of younger farmers to cope with the demands of modern farming technology.</P>
    <P>The young farmer establishment aid scheme was an incentive to farmers to hand on farms to their sons.  It has been reasonably successful but unfortunately a farmer must have one labour unit to qualify.  The people with one labour unit are generally the bigger farmers.  The problem remains at the level of the smaller farmers who do not have one labour unit and therefore do not qualify. The Minister might indicate whether it is the intention to change the qualifying requirement for young farmer establishment aid.  An EC directive stipulated one labour unit but that prohibits a large number of young farmers from applying.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>It has all to do with the transfer of land and relates to what I am saying.  I agree with the remarks made by Deputy Connaughton.  We must still think about ways and means of ensuring earlier transfer or at least shared management of the family farm by younger men and women.  In other countries there is a system of formal arrangements and contracts between farmers and their heirs, dealing with work, management and income sharing.  A worthwhile farmers' retirement scheme could prove a very useful mechanism.  This is a topic dear to my heart since I come from Kerry where the Land Commission had such a profound effect.  During my speech I have raised many issues concerning land ownership and use.  There are no easy answers.  Nevertheless this Bill presents the House with a long-awaited opportunity to examine these problems in depth and try to come up with some solutions.  We cannot gloss over the problems. They are there to be faced by us, acknowledged and dealt with.  Do we deal with them now or pass them on to another generation?  That is the point at issue. Dissolving the Land Commission will not solve the problems of young farmers with regard to land transfer.</P>
      <P>We must demand a more imaginative response from the Government.  Their intention as outlined in the policy document sent to Europe is to preserve the rural population.  However, this is a step in the direction of causing further rural de-population.  The Minister should consider new measures to ensure earlier land release and better land distribution to preserve the very fabric of rural Irish society, the smaller farmer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a pity the Deputy was not here then because I admire much of what he has just said.  The Land Commission have served this country well and given many farmers additional land, particularly smaller land owners and congested farmers.  Agriculture is our greatest industry and hopefully will remain so for many years to come.  I come from a rural area and know what the Land Commission have done in rural Ireland, particularly in the west, and the number of small land owners who have been enabled to make a viable living due to the land they got from the Land Commission some years ago.</P>
      <P>The Land Commission made mistakes in the way they divided land.  I want to strongly object to the way some land was divided quite recently.  A small farm was divided and a farmer who had land surrounding this farm was not considered for an allocation.  Yet we talk about fragmented farms, about TB and brucellosis spreading, and the amount of money it is costing the taxpayer.  The division of this land has not yet gone through the Land Registry and it may not be too late for the Minister to do something.  I appeal to the Minister to take another look at this case and consider giving this farmer those few acres of land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Land Commission are making huge profits from land given to farmers at the moment because of the cost of the annuities.  I would support my colleague, Deputy Micheal Kitt, in his proposal that the Minister should make a once off sale of land to farmers who are in some difficulty with repayments.  We introduced tenant house purchase last year.  Let us do the same with land this year.  Perhaps this could be done by way of amendment since there are large numbers of farmers, particularly those with vested land, who are unable to make the repayments because the land was so expensive when they got it and their headage payments are being stopped at the moment to meet <Col N="1262" /> the repayments.  I am asking the Minister to take that into consideration, to include that in the Bill so that these farmers will no longer be penalised through losing headage grants and so on in order to meet these repayments.</P>
    <P>Some time ago the Land Commission when dividing land would not allocate any to a farmer who was working, and many small farmers have to work to subsidise their income from farming.  These farmers were not considered when a farm came up for division because they had alternative income, whether from part time or full time employment, and it must be accepted that there is no such thing as full time employment in factories these days.</P>
    <P>I was never too happy with the land bonds.  The Minister should wind up the land bonds and introduce a more suitable alternative.  I hope something will be done about it in this Bill so that the land bonds will disappear forever.</P>
    <P>The flight from the land, particularly from the farms in the west, has been mentioned.  Thousands of small farms have closed up and have been bought by adjoining farmers.  I welcome the group purchase scheme being introduced in this Bill whereby a group of small farmers can get together to purcahse a farm of land.  It is suggested that we might have absentee landlordism if the Minister implements this proposal but I do not believe this will happen.</P>
    <P>The small family farm is the most important thing in Ireland today.  We see too much of factory farming all over Europe.  The present Commissioner, Mr. Ray MacSharry, with responsibility for rural development, has an interest in small family farms.  I hope he succeeds in what he is setting out to do in Europe, that is, restore the small family farm.  We want to see this happen.  We want to see the farmer with the small milk quota of 3,000 to 6,000 gallons being given an extra milk quota to enable him to make a living, because the only people who are making money from the land are those involved in milk production.  An increase in the milk quota would be of great benefit to our young farmers.  We should be <Col N="1263" /> encouraging those young farmers who have done their hours in agricultural college and qualified for installation aid.  If we want rural Ireland to prosper, if we want people to stay in rural Ireland, we must look after the family farm.</P>
    <P>In general I am happy with the Bill, although I am concerned about a few things in it.  Again, my main purpose in speaking on this Bill today was to ask the Minister to make a once off land sale to the farmers who are in trouble with annuity payments and whose headage grants are being stopped at the moment because they are unable to make their repayments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have grave doubts about the Minister's intention to alleviate the position in regard to the mobility of lands throughout the length and breadth of Ireland.  He is failing hopelessly to tackle the situation.  He has no proposals in relation to the taking over of the work of the Irish Land Commission which served this country well over the years. Any problems in the Departments were certainly not the fault of the Land Commission.</P>
      <P>The Land Commission officers were restricted in the division of land.  Party favouritism bedeviled the Irish Land Commission down through the years and that was the cause of all the trouble.  The Land Commission comprised a body of men appointed by the Department to oversee the distribution of any surplus land that became available, but for far too long their efforts were completely thwarted by political interference.  I say this from experience because I have seen it happen in my own constituency, Cork South-West.  For that reason I am very dubious of the action and the sentiments that lie behind this Bill.  I do not think the Minister is genuine in his approach to the problems that exist in western Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have listened to our colleague, Deputy Mattie Brennan, speaking from his experience of small farmers in his constituency of Sligo-Leitrim, which is very similar to the constitutency of Cork <Col N="1264" /> South-West.  I know only too well of the major problems that exist in the division of land in all the constituencies from Donegal to Cork South-West.  It is important that those farmers who are trying to eke out a living are given viable holdings. There is nothing in this Bill before the House to convince me that the Minister has the will or the capacity to seek a solution to this problem.</P>
    <P>If agriculture is to make its rightful contribution to the economy it is the use to which the land is put that is of importance. It is vital that the rigidity of the system be replaced by mobility.  The legacy of our historical land struggle is the most land-locked, tiered system in Europe.  We have the second lowest number of young farmers and the second greatest number of elderly farmers in the Community.  We also have a growing number of part time farmers.  Only in Italy is the position worse.  The need for land reform in Ireland is as critical today as it was in the 1870s when the first tentative measures were taken to replace the landlord-tenant system, which came about as a result of British colonialism, with a system of owner occupancy.</P>
    <P>Today there is over 90 per cent owner occupancy of land in Ireland and this is seriously impeding the pace of structural change in Irish agriculture.  The total agricultural land of Ireland amounts to 17 million acres, of which 10.5 million acres are used in grazing and pasture, 1.14 million acres is under cereal and other crops, 2.6 million acres represents rough grazing land and 0.75 million acres is covered with woods and plantations.  The remaining 2.17 million acres are in various other uses.  There is a general misconception that massive land resources are mobilised through the land market each year.  The reality is that only 400,000 acres, or a mere 3 per cent of the country's total acreage, change ownership each year.  Of that amount 84 per cent changes hands through inheritance gifts and 14 per cent through purchase on the open market, with a mere 2 per cent going to the Land Commission.  Only 0.6 per cent of the total land in the country changes hands each year through the land <Col N="1265" /> market.  That amount is so small that land mobility cannot be substantially effected. If we are serious about improving our land mobility and maximising our agricultural resources, we must aim for new measures to improve farm structures in a way that will not interfere with the hard-won Three Fs &mdash; fixity of tenure, fair rent and free sale.</P>
    <P>Land is a very valuable commodity. The average farm size in Ireland has increased by only four acres, from 52 acres to 56 acres, in the past 20 years. This is a diabolical position.  The small farmers are debarred from getting extra land, firstly because they cannot compete in an open market, secondly because of the inability of the Land Commission to divide the land among them, and thirdly because of a lack of direction from any Government Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am just spelling out the seriousness of the position and questioning whether the Land Commission should be dissolved at all but rather that they should be given more powers.  Sixty per cent of all Irish farmers have holdings of less than 50 acres of land, well below the level deemed to be capable of giving a viable income to farmers under EC directives.  Bearing that in mind, I would ask the Minister what steps he or the Department are going to take to ensure that they restore viability to Irish farms in conjunction with our EC partners.</P>

      <P>Live horse and you will get grass.  Half the farmers of Ireland are over 55 years of age and one-quarter are over 65 years of age.  That age group own about five million acres of agricultural land or approximately 30 per cent of our total land acreage.  Less than 10 per cent of our farmers are under 35 years.  This is clear evidence of the late age of retirement and succession and it underlines <Col N="1266" /> how the owner-occupancy of land encourages farmers to hold on to their land to an advanced age reducing the rate of land mobility.</P>
      <P>Taking all the EC countries into consideration Ireland showed the slowest rate of increase in farming size over the past 20 years.  Surely this is scandalous when we have had a native Government for over 60 years.  If this is the result, I am afraid we have a long way to go. In France, Holland and Britain where owner-occupancy does not prevail as in Ireland, the annual rate of change is five times greater than in Ireland.  About one quarter of all the agricultural land in Ireland is now being farmed on a part time basis.  Of the 247,598 holdings in this country of over five acres of land, surveyed in the early eighties, 51.6 per cent are described as part time farms. Why?  Everybody knows that it is because the holdings are not viable economic units, that they cannot sustain a farmer, his wife and family, the people who are the backbone of rural Ireland.  To alleviate that problem a mechanism should be set up by the Government to replace the Land Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Statistics show that stocking rates on part-time farms are only half that on fulltime farms, therefore the gross output is only half what it should be as well.  There is evidence that part-time farming is increasing.  The acreage under part-time farming increased by a quarter of a million acres during the last five years and the number of part-time farmers has increased by 6,000.  The lack of an invigorating land policy limits the opportunity for people with drive, energy and ability to enter into farming so as to achieve a high level of productivity.  In view of that, it is essential that the Department of Agriculture and Food steps into the breach immediately and ensure that the small farmers who are crying out for extra acreage are given an opportunity to survive where their fathers and forefathers survived before them in more difficult times.  Is it the policy of the Government to drive every small, uneconomic farmer out of existence?  What steps will the Department take to put a <i>modus operandi</i><Col N="1267" /> into operation to replace the Land Commission? I am very dubious as to whether there is any policy at all apart from the emigration boat or plane, for the small farmer along the western sea board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>The farmers along the western seaboard have been completely ignored by the Land Commission down through the years in relation to achieving a solution to the problem of congested holdings.  This Government have neither the spirit nor the initiative to tackle that problem.  I am amused and amazed by the Minister telling me since I got up to speak this morning that the European package will be the salvation of the small farmer in the west of Ireland.  There is nothing in that package to convince me that it will be the salvation of the small farmer along the western seaboard, because they are emigrating at the rate of 40,000 a year.  I invite the Minister to my constituency where I can take him on tour and show him the number of doors that have been closed up over the past two years.  The people have gone to England, New York, San Francisco and Australia, because there was no land policy implemented by this Government or by previous Governments who dragged their feet on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The time is ripe for the Minister to spell out what will take the place of the Land Commission.  It is clear that when agricultural land is offered for sale, far too often it is passing into the hands of absentee landlords with very stout cheque books.  Local farmers anxious to buy this land have been disappointed on numerous occasions when they were outbid by the wealthy absentee landlords of the twentieth century.  The Government have an obligation to the citizens of the country and should ensure that there is a mechanism to enable farmers to <Col N="1268" /> acquire extra land in congested areas at a realistic market price to ensure the viability of small holdings.</P>

      <P>I said &ldquo;at a realistic market price&rdquo;.  Surely it is not beyond the capability of the Department of Agriculture and Food to see beyond the ends of their noses and see the dangerous situation in rural Ireland?  The rural school has gone forever.  It has been sold to some fellow from East Berlin, West Berlin, Munich, Hanover, Dusseldorf or Amsterdam.  The school that once was ringing with laughter and the sound of mirth from our Irish children is now closed forever.</P>
      <P>The lure of the towns and cities which started 20 years ago still exists.  The bright lights of London, New York, San Francisco and Brisbane drain the youthful talent from the west.  As I have said on occasions, the policy being enacted by successive native Governments means that the emigrant boat is the only alternative left.  This is a sad reflection on Irish national politics.  I think the time is ripe for the Minister to come into the House and produce some concrete measure which will give some ray of hope to the beleaguered small farmers in rural Ireland.</P>

      <P>The situation facing policy makers therefore is quite simple: regulate the land to improve market land mobility.  As I said at the outset, only 0.6 of the land changes hand each year.  Land mobility can only come from early retirement or inheritance, which certainly stimulates the mobility of land.  What have this Government done about an early retirement scheme for our elderly farmers along the western seaboard? They have sat idly by.  They have let the farmer die or sell his land to international business tycoons who come from other EC countries and can buy up <i>ab lib</i> while our virile young farmers living in small-holdings from Malin Head to Mizen Head are completely denied the opportunity of enlarging their holding to a viable standard that would give them an opportunity to settle down and rear a <Col N="1271" /> family who would be of benefit to the nation in the years to come.</P>
      <P>The Norman invasion brought about the dispossession of the native landlords by English colonists and saw leasing flourish.  There were three classes of tenants: the bó-aires or affluent cattle owners, who never owned land but rented it; the saor-cheilís or free tenants and the bond tenants who were always poor.  This description can be attributed today to the small farmer along the western seaboard after 60 years of native Government.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy O'Kennedy when introducing the Bill stated that in the middle of the 19th century through confiscation and plantation the lands had passed into the hands of absentee landlords.  I would like to remind the Minister that today in the 20th century land is now passing into the hands of cheque book farmers, many of whom can be described as absentee land holders living outside the country. This is the situation that exists in the country at present.  In the middle of the 19th century the tenant farmer could be evicted at whim, but the Gladstone Act gave us a tenant farmer charter which introduced the concept of fixity of tenure, fair rent and fair sale.  It is clearly evident that in the dying years of the 20th century the situation calls for change as much as it did in the middle of the 19th century.  I only hope that the Minister in his wisdom will see reality and put an end once and for all to the congested farms that exists along the west and south west.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Thousand upon thousand of acres of mountain commonage are still left undivided. We have seen the Minister for Agriculture and Food instigating measures to combat cattle disease, but I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Kirk, whether he realises that in countless mountain commonages throughout the country herds are intermingling.  What steps will be taken to ensure that this will not cause the spread of disease at a more rapid rate than at present?  What steps are being taken to bring in the compulsory division of mountain commonage?  You would not <Col N="1272" /> need to be a genius to realise, Minister, that you are only cutting a twig to beat yourself or to beat the Department&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">

    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry to say that progress is at a snail's pace.  The Minister has failed to tackle the problem.  If any of the tenants object a number of years may pass before it is divided.  In fact, the person who objects may be dead and gone before the Department of Agriculture and Food make any move to divide the land.  Unless there is a rapid division of commonages we will not alleviate the problem.</P>
      <P>The Minister stated that landlords were bought out during the early years of the century and that the new Irish State intensified land purchase to relieve congestion.  He also stated that Governments have created schemes of migration from the worst affected areas, such as Kerry, Galway and Mayo.  He said that in 1976 it was decided to amalgamate the Land Commission with the Department of Agriculture and Food.  He went on to say that an investigation committee found that the acquisition and redistribution of lands had lost its usefulness. I wonder if it was a case of the officials in the Department of Agriculture and Food who produced that evidence losing their senses rather than the Land Commission losing its usefulness?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everyone is aware that there is as much congestion today along the western and south-western seaboards as there was 100 years ago.  We are also aware that when major tracts of land are offered for sale they are being bought up by non-nationals at the expense of small farmers trying to eke out an existence on adjoining small holdings.  What can be more <Col N="1273" /> frustrating for a small farmer than witnessing the opportunity to make his holding a viable unit being taken away through inaction on the part of the Department of Agriculture and Food?</P>
    <P>The Land Commission have served a very useful purpose but, naturally enough, their role was eroded when other quarters began to interfere with their work.  If the Department of Agriculture and Food take over the responsibilities of the Land Commission, the Minister should ensure that a section is established within the Department to aid the division of mountain commonages in congested areas among small farmers and to assist farmers to acquire land adjacent to their own at market value through a system of interest free loans for so many years.</P>
    <P>There is no use in the Government saying that the structural funds will be the be all and end all of our problems. Our land tenure problems will continue as long as small farmers have to try to eke out a living from small, miserable holdings.  To add insult to injury, the present policy of the Department of Agriculture and Food is to prevent and individual who has not got a viable farm unit from receiving cattle headage grants if his off-farm income is more than £5,250. That is diabolical in this day and age.  The Minister must surely realise that these small farmers would not have to seek an off-farm income if they were able to eke out a living from their farms.  This is the only country in the EC which lays down such a condition in respect of applications for cattle headage, suckler cow or beef cow grants.  This anomaly must be erased by the Department of Agriculture and Food.  If the Minister were to use his common sense he would, with the stroke of a pen, erase that off-farm income clause and give our small farmers the opportunity to make a living from their small holdings.</P>
    <P>I represent a thinly populated rural constituency which has three peninsular areas &mdash; the Mizen Head Peninsula, the Sheep's Head peninsula and the Beara peninsula &mdash; and I know only too well how hard it is for our small farmers to <Col N="1274" /> make a living from their small holdings in that remote area.</P>

      <P>These are the areas which the Land Commission tried to divide but they were inhibited and impeded from doing so because of departmental bureaucracy and red tape. One almost needed to have a party ticket or a Cairde Fáil ticket before one could get any extra acreage on the division of farms in those areas during the past 20 or 30 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For that reason I appeal to the Minister, in order to ensure that as many as <Col N="1275" /> possible of our small uneconomic holdings are brought up to a viable standard, to introduce a scheme to help before it is too late.  If the Minister does not act immediately it may be too late.  There is an old saying that there is not much point in closing the stable door when the horse has bolted; it is no good bringing in legislation when most of our young farmers have emigrated.  Therefore, I am dubious about the contents of this Bill as it has failed hopelessly to outline or to give any promise of substance to the beleaguered farmers with small uneconomic holdings.</P>
    <P>Smallholders will not get much from the Bill because winding down the Land Commission and incorporating it with the Department of Agriculture and Food is not the solution to the problem.  The solution is the creation of a land agency and the Minister must have plenty of information at his disposal to ensure that can be done.  The time is ripe for the Minister to take action because if it is not taken urgently our young farmers will continue to emigrate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not for me to answer.  The Minister should easily be <Col N="1276" /> able to find out the reasons.  A new land agency should be created which will give those farmers an opportunity to acquire any extra land that becomes available.  If they have the heart, courage and determination to play their part in the economy of the country, surely it is time that the Department set a lead showing them ways and means of making their holdings viable?  If that is not done it will soon be too late, if it is not already too late.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that the Land Commission are an ancient institution which have played a notable part in our history and that their passing is an occasion of significance.  It is also an occasion of sadness for Deputies coming from counties with small holdings.</P>
      <P>There has been much criticism here of the Land Commission's delay in allocations and putting out land on conacre for extended periods.  However, we must agree that there was a lot of red tape and we must take into account the number of files which each inspector had for the estate allotments.  They operated under a very fair system whereby they interviewed all the smallholders within a mile of an allotment.  We must concede that they did a good job considering that they were so restricted in many areas.</P>
      <P>In most cases wise decisions were made and this is obvious in my county.  If the Minister asked me to bring him to some of the best farms in the constituency I would bring him to men who started on very small acreage, who got additional allocations of land from the Land Commission and who are now very good and efficient farmers.  My constituency does not have the same number of large estates or tracts of land as other counties.  Land has always been at a premium and there was never enough for small farmers to increase their holdings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Driving daily through County Meath one can see the small Land Commission holdings.  Since this scheme came into operation about 2,000 families have benefited and 1.25 million acres were allotted to them.  That gives an indication of the amount of work done and the benefit derived by the people who came from <Col N="1277" /> the western seaboard.  They made a very good life for themselves and their families. They also contributed a lot to the State and to the county in which they came to reside.</P>
    <P>The most important step to be taken by the Minister and the Department will be the setting up of an alternative to the Land Commission. I hope the structure chosen will avail of the expertise of officers who have worked with the Land Commission and have proved their ability to deal with all aspects of land division.  A great deal of thought should be given to the new structure to ensure that it will cover all aspects of land policy.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in the course of his speech, said that the committee who will deal with land policy in the future will exercise statutory control over the subdivision of farms and over the purchase of land by non-qualified persons, mainly companies, and non-nationals.  That is important because it is annoying and frustrating for small farmers who are endeavouring to improve their holdings to discover that business people and non-nationals are in a position to purchase adjoining farms.  Most of those people do not need those farms to make a living but purchase them as an investment.  There should be tight control on the purchase of land by such people.</P>
    <P>The Minister has told us that the proposed committee will consider the promotion of group purchase and the leasing of land as well as the provision of assistance for schemes for the re-arranging of commonage divisions.  Many Members have referred to leasing and recalled that when a Bill dealing with leasing was going through the House some years ago they expressed hopes that it would fill the void. That has not occurred and farmers fear that if they lease land for a lengthy period it may affect their ownership of it.  It is hard to change their attitude in regard to that.  I look forward to the new committee determining the future of land mobility. They have a difficult task to perform.</P>
    <P>Some years ago when farmers had to contend with bad weather they experienced great difficulty in meeting their <Col N="1278" /> annuity commitments to the Land Commission. Some of them have not succeeded in paying off the arrears accumulated at that time.  I have no doubt that the amount owed to the Department for annuities is huge.  The land was allotted to farmers at a time when it was fetching a high price and they were asked to pay high annuities.  Successive bad summers, and the consequent drop in production, left many farmers in difficulty in trying to meet their commitments. I suggest that the Department consider introducing a scheme similar to that operated by the Department of the Environment for the sale of local authority houses to tenants.  The Minister should consider offering the land to the tenants at half price.  Another suggestion is that, like the tax amnesty, farmers should be given a once-off allowance to cover the arrears.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that in many cases farmers will have no alternative but to sell their holdings to pay their debts to the Commission.  I have no doubt that that will leave them worse off than they are at present.  The Minister should give sympathetic consideration to the plight of those farmers who are finding it impossible to meet repayments.  They are proving to be a great burden to them.  I was pleased to hear the Minister say that it was intended to dispose of the land bank and that there would be no unavoidable delay in doing so.  The land held by the Land Commission should be disposed of as quickly as possible after the changeover.</P>
    <P>We have heard a lot of talk about farm sizes and it is doubtful if 50 or 60 acres can be considered a viable holding.  The system of farming is what should be taken into consideration.  A farmer with a 40-acre holding who has a milk quota of 30,000 gallons can make a comfortable living on such a farm, but a farmer with 70 acres and livestock may be living in poor circumstances.  A viable holding is not defined by the size of it but by the operations that are carried out on it. Some farmers who are involved in cattle dry stock would not have a viable holding even it they were allotted a lot of land.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1279" /> The Department of Agriculture and Food, in conjunction with other Departments, should examine the off-farm activities carried on by small farmers. The Minister and his Ministers of State are doing everything possible to get EC support for alternative farm enterprises such as the production of rabbits, deer, goats, horses and involvement in agri-tourism. However, the return from such projects is very little in the initial stages, particularly when one considers the huge investment involved.  There has been massive development in mushroom and poultry production in my constituency, two of the most successful farm enterprises taking place in the country.  Those involved are getting a steady income which enables them to rear their families. However, we must look further down the line and consider getting involved in processing.  The IDA and other agencies have an ideal opportunity to get involved in such work.  I have no doubt that EC aid will be available for those projects which would be of great benefit to small farmers.  We only process 15 per cent of our poultry, pig and beef produce as against 40 per cent in some EC countries and 60 per cent in America.  That is another area which will have to be examined.</P>
    <P>As I said the Land Commission did much valuable work.  I was involved with a co-op during the mid-sixties when fairly substantial acreages of land were held by the Land Commission.  The Land Commission drained, limed, fertilised and sprayed that land with the result that it was a show piece.  They were the leaders in the pilot areas scheme which was operated during the mid-sixties and they did very valuable work in that regard.</P>
    <P>Mention has been made of land mobility and the farmers' retirement scheme.  The farmers' retirement scheme was introduced in, I think, 1973 but it did not prove to be a success.  It did not bring into play the amount of land it was anticipated to bring in at that time.  Since then the long term leasing system has been introduced.  We have got to realise that the amount of land which changes <Col N="1280" /> hands and is available each year is considerably less than what was available 20 years ago.  Twenty years ago a small farmer could live with the hope that he would get a portion of a larger estate which was near him but that will not be so in the future and because of this he will have to look at other areas.</P>
    <P>While I regret the passing of the Land Commission, I recognise that times have changed.  I appeal to the Minister to ensure that the structure which is set up in the Department of Agriculture and Food will safeguard small farmers so that unqualified persons, whether they be companies or non-nationals, will not get an opportunity of securing land which is badly needed by those who have an interest in farming.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>I could almost concur with everything said by Deputy Jimmy Leonard.  It is great to hear somebody who knows what he is talking about coming into this House.  He is a Deputy I particularly admire because he is always constructive in what he says.  In particular, I would endorse what he said about farmers who have severe borrowing problems and which I believe certainly relate to land.  I will not go into the history of why very good farmers got into difficulties but the Minister, the Government and all of us will have to ensure that the worthwhile farmers who, through no fault of their own but perhaps because of health problems or because of very high interest rates, are in difficulties will get every assistance.  This assistance could be provided by the new land body in conjunction with the ACC and the banks.</P>
      <P>As the House knows various schemes were carried out by the Department over the years.  These schemes were moderately successful and helped many farmers but they did not get to the root of the problem.  As Deputy Leonard said, this problem could have been solved by introducing some type of amnesty where a farmer would have the option to either sort out his problems or sell out.  In this way we could find out whether a farm could be made viable and put back into business again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1281" /> During my childhood years I remember hearing a lot of criticism of the Land Commission but I have to say that the Land Commission featured prominently in rural Ireland.  They were an integral part of the new Free State and they organised, for instance, the transition of land from one sovereign state to another. Purchases of large areas of land from the then landlords was successfully negotiated and for the first time farmers had title deeds to their properties and felt safe in their holdings.  They were no longer mere tenants of their farms depending on the whims of the owners and whether they needed a particular section of land to facilitate whatever enterprise they were engaged in.  For the first time in maybe 500 or 600 years farmers were the owners of the land.  That must be the real hallmark of the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>In the late twenties and early thirties, more land came on the market for distribution. In the early thirties there was a disastrous situation in the farming industry when many farms were abandoned. I remember in my locality the owner of a fairly substantial farm walking out and leaving his farm.  The Land Commission had to move in and erect fairly expensive fencing, build dwelling houses and out offices and divide the farm.  If they made a mistake it is probably that they made the farms too small but perhaps at the time 35 acres was thought to be a reasonable holding.  They tried to allocate such farms to deserving young farmers.  It was said often that they divided the farms among friends of political parties etc.  I do not think that accusation was justified.  Whatever their politics by and large they turned out to be very successful farmers.  The rents for these holdings were small.  If the Land Commission failed in that regard it was simply because the farms were too small.  At that time the Land Commission did not appreciate what a viable acreage was but as time went on they learned from their mistakes and allocated more land to farmers and, where possible, increased the size of farms by giving additional acreage to small farmers.  The term &ldquo;viable holding&rdquo; came into vogue and it was generally felt <Col N="1282" /> that a farmer needed 70 to 80 acres to survive.</P>
    <P>With the worldwide boom in agriculture in the late thirties and early forties land prices jumped and for the first time the Land Commission had to enter into the open market in order to obtain land for subdivision.  Having successfully arranged the transition of the lands of Ireland from British landlords to Irish tenants they ran into very real trouble for the first time.  During the late forties and early fifties many farmers who were interested in buying a neighbouring farm had their bids thwarted by the Land Commission who had moved in to take over the farm for subdivision.  This was considered by farming organisations to be very unfair.  Their interference was resented and criticised, it being felt that they were engaging in a sort of fair trade, freedom of sales type operation which the Land Commission should keep their noses out of.  In the end the Commission pulled back but that was when some of their real problems commenced.  They went and bid on the open market.  This meant that in the late sixties and early seventies when the price of land went through the roof they had to pay more than the land was worth.  That led to a new type of tenant &mdash; one who was no better off than his counterpart who had gone to the bank &mdash; who had to pay an exaggerated price and rent because the Land Commission had to charge such exaggerated rents which very often presented farmers with considerable difficulty.</P>
    <P>I should like to compliment the Land Commission on their tolerance and leniency towards such people.  For example, methods were found of transferring or delaying payments from one year to another.  They were reasonable <i>vis-à-vis</i> arrears of payments, interest and so on. At that time I was very involved with farming organisations and such groups.  I must give local officials working on behalf of the Land Commission much credit in this regard.  They were down to earth men who understood the local scene, maintained close contact with the people and, in turn, had their confidence.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1283" /> Indeed, the commissioners themselves, those who had to take the final decisions, were, like the Judiciary, above politics.  This has not been mentioned in the House before.  Of course, some people might contend the commissioners were a law unto themselves.  But their decisions and arbitrations were final; their powers were greater than those of the Minister.  The earlier criticism of the thirties had to fizzle out as people became more enlightened, knowing that, in the final analysis, those four commissioners were independent and would reach the correct decision.</P>
    <P>The moneys advanced to farmers by the banks in the early seventies, when interest rates were fairly low, meant that farmers found easier, cheaper ways of increasing their holdings.  For the first time in my area anyway a good system known as group buying was initiated. This meant that rather than have three or four farmers bidding against each other for a farm no one of them could afford they brought it between them. Again that takes us back to the Land Commission and subdivision, when there were no problems encountered; they were facilitated.  I know we should not mention names in this House but there was a gentleman called Tom Carroll who should go down in history as one of the best men who ever handled deputations and politicians.  Certainly in the seventies his vision helped farmers in the purchase of land.</P>
    <P>With regard to future farm structures it would appear that the dairying farmers are bent on purchasing all of the land coming on the market.  They are the only farmers with really fat cheque books at present while tillage and beef farmers are experiencing very real problems.  This is something which worries me.  In saying that, I do not begrudge the dairying farmers expanding and developing but I do not like to see it happening at the expense of the tillage men.  I am delighted the Minister of State, Deputy Kirk, is present to hear what I have to say about this.  We are still not putting sufficient effort into bringing the tillage farmer into his own. <Col N="1284" /> We tend to rely on the old faithfuls, grain and sugar beet, along with a certain amount of disorganised potato growing and a limited amount of horticulture.  But I contend we are losing a golden opportunity and I have said so before.  It was a good exercise to appoint a market coordinator in the potato industry but that is not really getting at the root of the problem.  Rather we should do something worthwhile in order to salvage the tillage farmer, to enable him retain his holding against the dairy farmer.  In this respect we should remember that the dairy man is not somebody from Germany or elsewhere, he is the farmer down the road. As Deputy Jimmy Leonard pointed out, the tillage man will have to engage in alternative enterprises some of which can be dicey.</P>
    <P>There is no gainsaying that we can grow the best potatoes in the world.  The Minister of State has said so, as have I: he believes it as I do.  We got the Irish Farmers' Co-operative established but it did not take off as it should have done.  I have no hesitation in saying why &mdash; for the simple reason that the year it was established there had been a massive surplus of potatoes with everybody wanting to join that co-operative and ensure proper marketing for their produce. However, in the following two years there happened to be a scarcity of potatoes when everybody reneged on the co-operative, did not want to be subjected to its disciplines.</P>
    <P>It has to be remembered that we are here talking about family farms.  It would appear that the EC have lost sight completely of family farms and are losing sight of agriculture which is even more worrying.  We seem to have a sort of nuisance value now in Europe.  Every time I read the European Parliamentary News agriculture appears to be put to one side, in other words, they want farmers to retire.  It is bad enough to want politicians to retire but to be advocating farmers to do so is a concept totally foreign to an Irish farmer; they do not want to know about it.  In addition, when one analyses the matter, one realises that we are not creating any surpluses in Europe. <Col N="1285" /> For example, all of our dairy produce finds a ready market.  We are at the top of the league with the Germans French and Italians with regard to our meat products. We can sell everything we produce. I say: let those countries producing the surpluses pay the penalties.  However, that is the type of difficulty we confront.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I would appeal to the Minister of State, perhaps in conjunction with the market co-ordinators, to revert to the producer groups.  The Minister will remember, when on this side of the House, he helped me in the organisation of the horticultural groupings which are now doing so well nationwide.  For example, there is a farmer near my home with seven acres of land &mdash; who featured in a farming magazine <i>Biatas</i> recently &mdash; who is double-cropping, making a handsome living out of that acreage.  Of course we must also devote attention to the processing of potatoes but we must first organise their producers, when we would be doing a great day's work.</P>
    <P>With the abolition of the Land Commission, more than ever before we need a land policy to ensure that land finds its way into the hands of those best able to use it.  I must reiterate my congratulations to the Land Commission over the years in allowing farmers ownership of their land, on their compulsory purchase policy to relieve congestion, thereby creating additional economic holdings.  This has led to a gradual build up of viable family units, farmyard enterprises.  In turn this meant that farming families enjoyed a good standard of living and through their industry, they created local employment in dairy and meat processing, vegetable sales and processing. The growth of the co-operative movement, the massive giants we now have, was based on the solid family farm, economically viable, which was supportive of the co-operative movement.  This scene is changing, and it is not for the better. The Euro outlook, as I said already, seems to be: produce less and we will pay you to do nothing as we have too much food.  Where is the future for the family farm especially if the owner does not have a milk quota?  We, as someone said <Col N="1286" /> recently, are becoming the Aran Islands of Europe.  We are getting the worst of all worlds.  We have quotas imposed on us in the dairying scene, where we could probably survive on prices.  Now we have savage price cuts in grain, where we should have quotas &mdash; in other words, we have the worst of all worlds.</P>
    <P>The definition of a family farm has taken on totally new connotations.  Grain farmers in the present scenario need many hundreds of acres to survive while the dairy farmer could do very well on less than 100 acres.  With all the emphasis on world poverty, and I said this in a recent debate on agriculture, and the ongoing discussions on disarmament, surely our MEPs &mdash; we will all probably be before the people very shortly &mdash; could do something about it, if they are serious about Irish land and Irish farmers, by persuading the super powers of Europe to cut back even 25 per cent on armaments. With that exact figure of 25 per cent enough food could be grown and paid for to feed the hungry of the Third World. That is a reality.  If they are as Christian as they are supposed to be in Europe, then surely be to God that is one of the first things they should do.</P>
    <P>While we are now discussing the demise of the Land Commission we need to have a land policy which would continue to divide and finish the division of commonages and to continue to give help and encouragement for long term leasing. Indeed, the author of long term leasing, group purchasing and sub division of farms by a number of farmers, Deputy Connaughton, is behind me now.  A land policy should ensure that farmland stays in the hands of those best equipped to make a success of farming.  When the Land Commission goes we need something to replace it.  We must retain control over the purchase of land and the creation of non-viable holdings to ensure that we hold on to as many people as possible on the land.  The Minister, who must by now realise the predicament of the tillage and the beef farmers, should immediately restore the research and development side of Teagasc to ensure that all aspects of diversification, so ably dwelt on by <Col N="1287" /> Deputy Leonard, would be fully explored.  Expert guidance is needed now more than ever before, otherwise we will be left with just the dairyman.  This is a bad time for cutting back in this regard.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly, the land leasing policy started by Deputy Connaughton has now more meaning than ever before.  Young farmers can now lease land over a long period, which allows them time to plan and to put out proper fertilisers and fencing on that farm.  It allows them to spend money on that land in the knowledge that they will have the use of this land over a long period of years &mdash; and all this can be done without sinking themselves into debt by overborrowing in order to purchase land.  The landowner on the other hand &mdash; thanks again to the Land Act, 1984 &mdash; can be equally assured that at the end of the letting period he can resume possession of his farm.</P>
    <P>I have witnessed a number of group purchase schemes by farmers and these have proved highly succesful.  The permission to subdivide came readily from the Land Commission and from the Department of Agriculture and Food and each farmer has a welcome addition to his holding for a modest investment.  On this score, however, I must say that urgent legislation is needed to simplify the registration of property since this is still a slow, archaic and far too expensive a process.  It is totally ridiculous to go to the Land Registry and find that there are stacks upon stacks of unsorted problems there in this day and age when we have computers and everything else.  We find letters are toing and froing from the legal offices to Dublin, each one costing in the region of £25 to £30.  No lending agency would dream of lending a £10 note without the title deeds and if one cannot get the title deeds one is in the height of trouble for day to day spending.</P>
    <P>I hope that, in conjunction with a proper land policy, the Minister will retain in his Department a nucleus of competent people to ensure that land leasing and group purchases can be encouraged and that a watching brief can <Col N="1288" /> be kept on the sale of land to ensure that arms do not move into the hands of non-qualified people &mdash; for example, insurance companies, etc.  That is a very real danger.  That is something which always had to be watched and now more than ever.  The Department should not relinquish lightly the powers which are there since the foundation of the State, but I will not go into the detail.  However, because of these powers the agrarian problems we have had over centuries and particularly sensitive issues in rural areas were sorted out because everybody, whether or not they liked the Land Commission, had to admit two things &mdash; first, that they had the power to act and, secondly, that they were independent and competent and were prepared to act.</P>
    <P>We hear much about integrated rural development and the rural economy.  Of course, this is as it should be.  Now more than ever we must develop along these lines.  The rural tourism programme is now supported by the EC, as announced by the Minister.  That is very welcome. Also welcome &mdash; and this is something I have been plugging &mdash; is the help for the non-thoroughbred horse industry.  I have no doubt that agri-tourism has potential, as has the horse industry; but here we must have an advisory back-up service for such ventures.  Teagasc must be restored if we are to succeed.</P>
    <P>At the Spring Show at present we can see what can be achieved with deer farming and indeed with various food ventures. I know the acting Chairperson, Deputy Barnes, has a particular interest in certain food ventures &mdash; I support her in her ideas &mdash; that is the production of health foods.  The natural production of food is something that is a very real alternative, and there is no great mystery about it.  You may have to spend some time on your knees weeding the onions and so on, but you will be adequately remunerated for it.  I do not know of anybody on the land who is afraid of work.  If people in Dublin, London, people such as Marks and Spencers are prepared to pay extra for organically produced food and if there is market for it, <Col N="1289" /> by all means give it to them.  It is like the old argument with beef, where ill-informed people come along and tell the Minister of the day that we should stop the hormone ban and that we should use hormones.  It could be proven medically and scientifically that natural hormones are no harm.  Of course, they are no harm; but the Berlin housewife will not accept that.  She has seen the damage caused by the excessive use of artificial hormones.  If she is prepared to pay £6 per pound for Irish beef then we should give it to her the way she wants it.  If people in Marks and Spencers want genuine hormone free meat and free range eggs we should not do a Glenroe type of skit on it; they should get the genuine article.  I know the Acting Chairperson is getting worried about me because I am straying away from the Bill.</P>
    <P>We need a back-up service if we are to go into new ventures.  Deputy Leonard mentioned deer farming, rabbit production and a whole range of other products. From experience I know these are highly expensive ventures.  There is no lending agency at present which would support these ventures except where they were totally confident that there would be a back-up service that would ensure that the people who spend the £6,000, £7,000, £15,000 and £20,000 knew what they were doing.  It is great to talk about new ventures and we need to have them, but all that is left at present is the dairyman and perhaps a man with a good sugar beet acreage.  Certainly, the big run of farmers at present outside of dairying depend on basic tillage.  They will not survive without help.</P>
    <P>Something that has not been mentioned in the whole debate about the Land Commission, land and land distribution is that trying to make middling land out of very bad land is a waste of time.  A new approach should be found to this problem.  We are wasting scarce national resources on trying to make land out of something that would never be land.</P>
    <P>Now that we have the new company, Coillte Teoranta, I should like a system to emerge under which, like land leasing, <Col N="1290" /> the owners of the land would continue to be the owners and insurance companies, banks and the State would become involved because EC grants would pay for the planting, but the husband and wife team would be allowed to stay on the farm holding and be paid a living wage or income to look after that 90 or 100 acres of forest and watch it grow. When the timber was harvested the land would still belong to the owners.  We should look very seriously into that matter.  While driving around the countryside, I saw many areas where such a system would keep people on the land.</P>
    <P>I conclude by hoping that the Minister of State who is listening attentively will think very carefully about the market co-ordinator.  To coincide with that, we should all get round to organising the potato growers and the potato industry. We would all be with the Minister on this.  There is the graph of ups and downs, surpluses and scarcities, massive imports during times of scarcity and dumping in times of surplus.  We need regulation about the amount of potatoes needed and the same co-ordination that has existed in the horticultural groupings.  I hope the Minister will retain in his Department the necessary group of people &mdash; Land Commission people are still around &mdash; in a small section in his Department and not apologise to anybody for it.  That action would hold the powers, that have been in existence since the foundation of the State, to carry out those operations that are as important as ever.  If there were a change of heart in the morning, or a change of pattern, or a need for re-expansion or rebuilding, the nucleus would be there but, more important, the powers would be there.</P>

      <P>I am certain that the Minister of State, Deputy Kirk, will ensure that this happens.  I was very interested to hear all that has been said and have to agree with it <i>in toto.</i></P>
      <P>The Land Commission and the Office of Public Works were probably the most maligned public bodies ever, in that people who expected results from them claimed they acted unnecessarily slowly and insensitively.  I would have to agree with the Minister that much of the criticism was unfounded and unfair.  The Land Commission did serve a noble purpose in adjusting the land ownership system and addressing the land question. The old system under which landlords railroaded their tenants and treated them in most cases, not like second class citizens but more like animals to be herded at their whim, certainly demanded a change.  The Land Commission largely changed the face of agriculture from that point of view and progressed from that unhappy era.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like most other speakers, I would like to thank the Land Commission staff for their tremendous work over many years in settling numerous disputes which, because of our history, were and still are commonplace.  I thank the Land Commission for making so many holdings viable.  They are about to be abolished.  I am not sure that it is a good move that they should be dispensed with without a replacement of some sort.  There are some criticisms that could be made, but <Col N="1292" /> now that they are being abolished it would be pointless.  In my connections with and representations to the Land Commission, I was not always happy that they acted with speed but, generally speaking, I have to agree with the results they produced.  Often, the more haste the less speed was the philosophy to which they adhered, and one which on most occasions was successful.</P>
    <P>The Land Commission helped farmers to become viable and we must now consider farm incomes.  That is the bottom line.  The average farm income here has recovered to almost the level of 1984 following a rise of 31 per cent in 1987 and a little more in 1988.  These figures come from the preliminary results of the National Farm Survey published by An Foras Talúntais, now Teagasc.  Despite the very considerable gains recorded in 1987 and the slight improvement on them in 1988, a high proportion of farmers continue to have a very low income from their farming activities.  It is very difficult to get this message across the length and breadth of this country.  Farmers, farming people and their representatives and those of us here who represent in the main the farming population, can easily understand, but to get the message across to the urban population is very difficult. Irrespective of who puts forward figures, urban people are till reluctant to accept them.</P>
    <P>The preliminary results confirm the findings of previous surveys which showed a wide difference in income according to the system used on farms, the size of farm and the region in which it was located.  The volatility in farming incomes in recent years is highlighted in this survey.  Average farm incomes declined by 9 per cent and 11 per cent in 1985 and 1986, respectively, probably because of the very bad weather conditions. They rose again substantially in 1987.  This puts the income level attained in 1987 at about 6 per cent above that of 1984 in current terms, but this still represents a decline of about 6 per cent in real terms over the same period.</P>
    <P>The main concept of the income used in that survey is family farming.  This is <Col N="1293" /> the difference between the value of gross output and operating costs and represents the return for their labour to all family members working on the farm.  This could be husband, wife and children and, of course, management and investment. For every two farms where income increased in 1987 it fell for the third. Despite the very considerable gains recorded in the last few years, a very high proportion of farmers continue to have a very low income from their farming activities.  While about 10 per cent of farms have had an income of £15,000 or greater, about two-thirds of farms had income of £5,000 a year or less from farming.  With the limited opportunities now for expansion in the current policy climate a very high proportion of farms will continue to have low incomes.  Also a factor of the pattern of change between 1986 and 1987 was that larger farms had a bigger relative increase in income than small farms.</P>
    <P>The major factor linked with persistently low incomes from farming is low output.  I suppose the Land Commission played a part in years gone by in that if a farmer were able to increase the size of his holding it should follow that his capacity for greater income should be there.  Therefore, if expansion in output is curtailed because of EC policy or the other developments then farm incomes can be maintained or increased only by more direct income support or by a reduction in farm numbers, something we must be very careful not to do.  I and my party wish to see as many farm families continue to exist as is possible.</P>
    <P>I would like to give the number of farms in various categories in 1987: 88,700 farmers had income from zero to £2,500; 37,000 between £2,500 and £5,000; 20,000 between £5,000 and £7,500; 15,000 between £7,500 and £10,000; 12,000 between £10,000 and £15,000 and, as I said, 19,000 of £15,000 or over.  Believe it or not, in 1984 16,000 farmers had no income whatever.  By 1986 that figure had increased to 27,000.  For 1987 the estimate is 26,000.  That is a reflection indeed of the way farmers in those categories are being treated.  When <Col N="1294" /> they sought help from the various State agencies they found it very difficult indeed to come by any assistance.  As I go on here today I will continue to say that a little assistance at this stage will keep those people going; it will keep them off the dole queues competing for resources that are already heavily competed for.</P>
    <P>There is an urgent need for a policy of small and medium size farms in the non-disadvantaged areas, whether this be by way of replacing the Land Commission with another body or increasing the amount of land at present classified as disadvantaged areas.  In Wexford, my constituency, up to now we have had something like 3 per cent of the land of the county designated as disadvantaged, whereas our neighbours Waterford have something like 60 per cent.  Whether that is because there was a Minister for Agriculture from there in the recent past I do not know, but many people believe that. Kilkenny has in excess of 40 per cent, Carlow 40 per cent and Wicklow 45 per cent.  Let me repeat, Wexford has 3 per cent, as if the impression should be that when you cross the border from those counties into Wexford you are entering the promised land.  The land in Wexford is no better than that of any of its neighbours. I do not know whether it is because we are poor lobbyists or not good at whining, or whether the Wexford farmer was prepared to get up in the morning and make the best use of his time and the bit of land he had, that we were not successful in getting more land included in the disadvantaged areas.  Because of the Government's intention to increase the disadvantaged areas in the fairly near future I, like all my colleagues in Wexford, have been invited to have a look at the land in the constituency.  Being the only practising farmer among them, I hope I know a little more than the rest about this; but I have to say they fully support the case being made by the Wexford farmers that at least 33 per cent, which is still below the average of our neighbours&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We have been invited to places like Macamore, which Deputy Connaughton and the Minister of State, Deputy Kirk, have heard about on many occasions.  The land is so bad there that one of the farmers who was ploughing there last October, when the weather was reasonable, had to give up when bad weather came.  He still cannot finish ploughing that field, and this is 4 May.  It is difficult for anybody outside Wexford to believe that is the case but, unfortunately, it is.  Quite an amount of spring barley and sugar beet are still to be sown in Wexford, even at this late stage. Therefore, I say to the Minister that, in order to keep as many of the farmers in Wexford and all over the country on the land of Ireland, assistance from the disadvantaged areas schemes would be sufficient to do that.  The option is to take them from the land, put them on the dole queue and they will compete with all that unfortunate group already on the dole queue for resources; whereas the small bit of assistance at this stage through the disadvantaged areas scheme, which in the main is paid for by the EC, will keep them going.  That is the way we must look forward if we are keen on keeping our people in dignity and at work and keeping the dole queues as small as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any policy should indicate clearly what help is required to provide a decent standard of living for farmers on low acreages and help them achieve the necessary targets. I do not think the small farmers or farmers generally have been over demanding.  In the absence of a real recognition of the plight of these farmers and little effort being made to help them in their difficulties, many have already applied for the assistance I have spoken about.  It is a sad reflection on all of us <Col N="1296" /> that proud farmers, who were prepared to work for maybe 18 hours a day in order to survive, are now coming to our clinics and asking us to get money from the health boards literally to put bread on the table.  It is a very sad day when that happens, but that is not the saddest part of it.  When they approach the various State agencies they are treated as if every farmer in the country were a millionaire, as if because you have land you should be able to survive.  It is easy to sit down in an office in Dublin and say a cow gives so much or you can plough 200 acres a day when it is raining, but out on the ground it is a different scene.  Unfortunately, many things are not taken into account.  Assistance should be considered by those who understand the position. I would not dare ask for anything for nothing.  If people are in genuine need, that need should be recognised without their being treated as second class citizens or regarded as always telling lies and looking for something for nothing.  I know there is an enormous amount of social welfare fraud and I am delighted that this Government have been quite successful in dealing with it but, on the other hand, we must be careful to treat people with respect and dignity.  I call on the Minister to insist, with the Minister for Social Welfare, that anyone assessing a farmer's means should understand the farming situation on the ground.</P>
    <P>I now refer to the question of cereals and how badly off the cereal grower is. This matter relates to the Bill in that it would now take 200 acres of spring barley to accommodate a farm family.  Most farmers in my area are tillage farmers and the average holding is 60 acres.  Quite obviously that would not generate sufficient income.  If the Land Commission are dissolved and there is no protection for these people they are likely to go to the wall.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hegarty has already said that we need to consider greater diversification. I would mention vegetables, particularly since the Minister of State with responsibility for horticulture is with us.  I compliment him on his achievement over the past two years in a very difficult <Col N="1297" /> area.  None of us expected that he would cure our import ills.  Various figures are given but it seems that about £400 million worth of vegetables are imported each year which we ourselves could grow.  The Minister has succeeded and has created an attitude of mind that we can grow our own.  I would ask him to continue along this road.  There must be scope for vegetable growing and general horticulture since we still have enormous imports of vegetables.</P>
    <P>We are sometimes inclined to forget cereal substitutes.  I understand that 14 million tonnes of substitutes are imported into the Community.  Our surplus is more or less of the same magnitude.  The simple answer would be not to import and to let the mountain disappear, but that is a very simplistic attitude.  It is not quite as easy as that.  I would appeal to the Minister and the Government to take a much harder look at the position and to take a much stronger line in Europe in regard to substitutes.  Is this wonderful European Community to subsidise people from outside or are we to look after the cereal growers within the Community?  We must do the latter.  Our own people come first.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I know you are well acquainted with the farming scene.  Since the Land Commission are about to be dissolved, I wonder how the cereal grower will get extra land in order to make his holding viable.  The Minister said he intended to let market forces dictate the ownership of land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ten years ago it was nice to be in farming and it was very easy to get money from the lending institutions to buy land. The banks and ACC competed in dishing out money.  The bank manager almost ran after a farmer asking if he had enough money.  Many farmers ran into trouble. In Wexford, 800 of the 5,000 farmers in the county borrowed heavily to increase the size of their holding, but when <Col N="1298" /> interest rates went up they found themselves in severe financial difficulty.  Even to this day, we are attending banks with constituents trying to alleviate the problem and to get write offs.  In many instances there were family splits arising from the freedom with which the banks and ACC dished out money.</P>
    <P>Since Fianna Fáil came into office things have improved substantially. Farmers are becoming a little more confident and are seeking to buy land. However, land prices have increased drastically during the past year.  Land is now being sold at unrealistic and uneconomic prices, I can see the same situation developing that we had a few years ago.  The banks, who never take risks, will be calling in those people.  They should manage their money more carefully.  The ultimate responsibility rests with the farmer who should also be very careful about the amount of money used for the purchase of land.  I have confidence in the future of farming but I have seen too many people go under because of bad management in the past.  I am disgusted at the way the banks, ACC and the lending institutions generally have behaved during the past ten years.</P>
    <P>The number of farmers here is declining rapidly year by year.  The Land Commission were able to slow down that process to some degree.  The Government now intend to dissolve the Land Commission and I am wondering if there is to be another body to replace them. As things stand there is quite a lot of undivided land.  I would like the Minister to tell me, when he is replying, how soon the undivided land will be allocated to farmers.  Since the Minister's intention is to do away with the Land Commission I would like to know how he intends to look at the exorbitant rents farmers are paying for land.  In my constituency in some instances it is £160 per acre, which is completely uneconomical.  In fact at this stage some groups of farmers are prepared to let land got from the Land Commission fall by the wayside.  I have made representations on behalf of groups and individuals and the response to these <Col N="1299" /> is slow.  I know the staff in the Commission is small but, before the final whistle blows, let us make sure that the question of the price per acre is resolved and that the land already in the Commission's hands is divided.</P>
    <P>It is my belief that a little assistance for the small farmer at this stage will keep him off the dole queue and working for the State.  We must be conscious of the need to keep as many people in rural areas as possible with a little assistance by way of help through the social welfare system, including them under the disadvantaged areas scheme, or giving them extra capacity by giving them extra land.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is sad that the Irish Land Commission is being dissolved. I had the pleasure and privilege of being in charge of that body for four and a half years during the lifetime of the last Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the demise of the Land Commission it must have been obvious to everybody that unless there was a major change of policy the Land Commission as we know it would have no future. There is no point in being hypocritical about this; there has been enough hypocrisy in this House in the last few days in regard to the Land Commission generally. The Land Commission was set up to do a particular job 100 years ago and they did that job particularly well.  We found ourselves with vast estates, often owned by non-nationals which were not being farmed very well, and thousands of small peasants, as they where called at the time, who would have had no future here without some body to ensure that they got parcels of this land.  I have great admiration for the Land Commission.  I know it has shortcomings but I would not go so far as some of the leading journalists in agriculture who castigated every single thing the Land Commission tried to do in the past; but that is all history now. There are many generations of Irish people who have nothing in the world to do with land at this stage, who have passed on from rural Ireland and are now living in our towns and cities but whose <Col N="1300" /> families made a living on the land parcelled out to them by the Land Commission. Such people will regret the fact that the Land Commission will not be in existence after this week.</P>
    <P>I have strong views on the Land Commission and on land policy.  It would be unfair to say that Fianna Fáil are the only ones to let down the Land Commission. Successive Governments in the last 25 years let it down because they did not change the policy which was one of acquisition and subsequent redistribution of land.</P>
    <P>The Land Commission had far flung power to acquire land.  If one were looking for such power through our courts now one would not get it.  The Land Commission had the power to acquire land in a whole range of situations.  That power will be gone after this week, such is the way our judicial system and our way of thinking have evolved in the last 25 years.</P>
    <P>The bottom line now is whether we are to allow outsiders from anywhere, the US, Holland, Denmark etc. the right to buy agricultural land on the open market just like people who are trained and make their living from agriculture and who are not trained for anything else.  Everybody who has anything to sell, from a house or car to the clothes he wears is entitled, if he decides to sell, to get the best price on the day.  Nobody would countenance a situation where that right would be taken away.  If we go that far with agricultural land, where does that leave the stated policy of trying to keep the maximum number of people on the land &mdash; and the person has not been born yet who could say what the optimum number of farming families is?  There would be nothing whatever to stop a foreigner from coming into the heart of County Galway or any other county and buying the land provided he or she has enough money.  In Agriculture House where permission must be obtained, they are writing permissions as if they were merely dog licences because there is no one there to decide who is and who is not entitled to buy land.  The only question I see being asked over there is whether there is a typist to type the <Col N="1301" /> approval to let people in.  These are hard words, but true.</P>
    <P>Following the admission by the Minister, at which I am not surprised, that market forces will be allowed to dominate the whole scene, let nobody talk to me again in this House about keeping the small farmer on the land because his days are well and truly numbered.</P>
    <P>I have always been a critic of one aspect of the Land Commission policy over the years and that was dividing land on the basis of numbers rather than on ability to farm.  If there was 40 acres for division and there were five farmers in a townland, usually each farmer would get eight acres and no consideration whatever was given to their ability to farm.  From the first day I went into Agriculture House I was a critic of that policy but the horse was well gone at that time.  The reason for that practice was that there was such pressure, political and otherwise, that it was very difficult for any officer to say farmer A was more entitled to land than farmer B. Basically at the end of the day you would be choking off an avenue by which a family made a living.  That was a very difficult problem to overcome and it certainly gave the Land Commission a bad name in the sense that much of the land allocated often went on the public market or was rented to another farmer. It certainly did not augur well for the method of distribution.</P>
    <P>It now appears that the only criterion that is necessary to acquire agricultural land in Ireland is money.  If you have the money you can buy land where you like, when you like and as much of it as you like.  Now that the Land Commission are being dissolved, that in itself is not a tragedy; the tragedy is that nothing is being put in its place.  I heard Dan McCarthy of the ICMSA &mdash; I publicly congratulate him &mdash; speaking on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; this morning and I have to concur with a lot of what he said.  He said it is very important that there be an overall monitoring body to deal with all aspects of land policy.  I do not think Fianna Fáil have the slightest intention of setting up such a body.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be political about this <Col N="1302" /> because there has been a plague on all our houses for the past 25 years as far as the Land Commission are concerned but in more recent times farmers and the organisations that represent them have been allowed to take a very prominent part in, for instance, the ERAD scheme. I see no reason why a national body, council or some kind of statutory body could not be formed to oversee land policy in the future.  They could do a different job altogether from that carried out by the Land Commission.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">

    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>No, not an advisory role.  They would have to have some power otherwise nobody would take the slightest notice of them.  One thing I have always said about the Land Commission is that they were regarded as the Cinderella in the Department of Agriculture. I am prohibited from mentioning names but there are two or three people &mdash; one of whom I am looking at today, Tom Duggan, and some of his collegues &mdash; who have done great work in this area.  I have never met people with such expertise in land policy.  At least four or five people spent their lifetime working in this area and if they had been taken notice of 20 years ago the position would be much better now.  I am not being political because this is not the only Government that did not take notice of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At this stage it is important that an overall statutory group be set up, comprising farming organisations such a Teagasc.  I do not see why the auctioneers and valuers' association, with whom I had a lot of discussion when I was Minister, the banks and other bodies should not be included.  They are also entitled to be listened to.  The biggest problem that would arise in this regard is that there would be a conflict of interest on that board and that is why the Government are not going ahead with it.  For instance, a farmer who owns 300 acres may decide some day that he wants to buy another 300 acres &mdash; technically there is nothing wrong with that if he can afford it &mdash; but what about the farmer living beside him <Col N="1303" /> who owns 40 or 50 acres but does not have the purchasing power?  He would be submerged before the sale goes ahead. As a society we have to make up our minds whether we will provide some help for such a farmer.  I said earlier that we should not in any way impede or obstruct a public auction, and the people I am talking about would obviously have to come up with the money but they should be given some chance to get the first bite at the cherry while at the same time ensuring that the seller gets the full price on the day.  It is very difficult for a smallholder to come up with that money but the worse thing we can do is to throw our hands in the air and say we are not interested, and to let the market forces operate.  If we do that we would be committing those people forever to the bottom of the pile.</P>
    <P>The land authority I was speaking about had a lot to do in many other areas on the agricultural scene.  When I was in office I introduced a Bill dealing with long term leasing.  There is no point saying it shook the agricultural world, but it was a step in the right direction.  The reasons for its introduction was, first, to get across to the elderly people who had land they were not using that there was in operation a legal system whereby if a deal was made between the lessor and the lessee, for whatever number of years was specified, the tenant would have no right to the land after that time.  That provision was not included in previous legislation.  It opened up a horizon for young people and was greeted at the time with great enthusiasm.</P>
    <P>I travelled extensively around the country at that time and I saw many young people attending the meetings in all areas.  Maybe some people thought there was more to the Bill than was the case, or maybe some people thought that Exchequer moneys should have been provided for the system, but whatever our personal views of the matter at the time, it was obvious the Exchequer could not get involved to the degree that could create an artificial limit in regard to land leasing.  There was also a price squeeze <Col N="1304" /> in farming at that time and it is only now that long term leasing is becoming a great possibility again.</P>
    <P>Because the Land Commission were not getting State funding to purchase land in the ordinary way &mdash; obviously everyone knew the Land Commission were on the way out then &mdash; I introduced the concept of the group purchase scheme. There were two or three very basic principles involved and at least I proved it could work.  The figures in the Minister's Department show that it was actively administered.</P>
    <P>Basically, the concept was that where three or four farmers in a townland had not financial resources to buy the farm, they joined together and bought it as a group.  There was one very important factor in that and that was that one had to have a referee, somebody without a chip on his shoulder whom the four could trust and who would have expertise in dividing land.  The land was not necessarily divided into quarters, as one man might have £5,000 to spend and another £20,000.  That was where land division experts came into account.  They were the honest brokers, and it worked.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Daly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have of course already made a major statement to this House on the matter on 14 April in the course of the general debate on the National Development Plan.</P>
      <P>I am, however, glad of this opportunity to outline again for Deputies the broad content of the plan in so far as it relates to the affairs of the Department of the Marine.</P>
      <P>The plan embraces all the major economic responsibilities of the Department of the Marine.  It covers sea fishing, fish processing, aquaculture, and fishery harbours. It contains a major programme of development for commercial ports and harbours and shipping.  Under the tourism aspect there will be every opportunity for the development of viable marina and angling projects.</P>
      <P>Total investment in the sea fisheries and aquaculture programmes could be up to £150 million over the period of the plan.  Significant additional funding has already been provided from our own resources in the 1989 budget.  This funding will be complemented by receipts from the Community under existing facilities.  The sea fisheries aquaculture sector has been dealt with in detail in the recently published BIM Development Strategy.</P>
      <P>Total investment of the order of £45 million will take place in fish processing over the period of the development plan. Of this, assistance of about £20 million will be sought from the EC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Suitable marine related tourism projects &mdash; such as marina and angling projects &mdash; will be assisted under the tourism aspect of the plan.  Over the period of the <Col N="1306" /> plan investment of over £300 million will be devoted to tourism projects.  Of this more than £160 million in aid will be sought from the EC.</P>
    <P>In relation to port development, the National Development Plan recognised the importance of ports to the Irish economy and the need to achieve faster transit times to Britain and mainland Europe. The document submitted to the European Commission stated that proposals have been prepared by the Government for the development of the main Irish commercial ports.  The estimated total cost of the proposed investments outlined in the plan will be about £72 million.</P>
    <P>A variety of different types of shipping projects will be assisted under the plan. The plan contains provision for expenditure of up to £65 million over the period.</P>
    <P>A programme for fisheries harbours development was outlined in the plan also.  The programme is designed to provide adequate infrastructure at carefully selected harbours.  The total investment envisaged is £19 million over the plan period.</P>
    <P>I believe that the Structural Funding sought under the plan, together with the funding available from existing facilities for sea fishing and aquaculture will underpin in a significant way the development of all marine industries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking if the Minister is satisfied with the submission which was made to Europe on 22 March in relation to the section dealing with fisheries and harbour development.  Is the Minister satisfied that half a page in this submission is sufficient to impress on Europe the importance of the fishing industry to Ireland and the necessity to develop our fishing harbours?  I put this question because I am extremely concerned at the inadequacy of the submission made in the overall plan.  Will the Minister elaborate on how this submission will convince the powers that be in Europe that there is a need to make substantial funding available under the Structural Funds for fishery and harbour <Col N="1307" /> development?  Will the Minister elaborate on the importance of developing our harbours &mdash; since we are the only country in the EC which will not have land access to the European market &mdash; equipping them so as to ensure that there will be effective and efficient transportation of goods from this country, especially since over 80 per cent of our goods&mdash;&mdash;</P>

As the Deputy is well aware, the plan is a broad outline document setting down priority areas and it is quite specific in certain areas.  In the area of responsibility of the Department of the Marine, I have already again today outlined the broad thrust of the plan and where we hope to make major and significant improvements in the infrastructure, not only for sea ports but also in the fishing ports.  A sum of £19 million over the period of the plan is a realistic sum which will make a major contribution to the provision of infrastructure that will help the fishing industry to develop further.</P>

I have also endeavoured in the course of this reply to <Col N="1309" /> indicate precisely how we hope to achieve that.  In relation to fisheries development generally, all Deputies will agree with the necessity for some investment in fishery harbour infrastructure, to enable the industry to prosper and develop.  We have plans on hand for the development of the large fishing harbour areas, such as Rossaveal.  A new development plan recently got underway in Dingle with £5 million being invested there.  We have work in hands in Killybegs, Greencastle, Kilmore Quay, Clogher Head, Burtonport and a number of other smaller harbours like the one down near the Deputy in Carrigaholt.  We are not neglecting the smaller harbours either. The purpose of this investment is to provide additional space and berthage in harbours especially where there is overcrowding, to enlarge and deepen basins where there are problems with silt which has built up over a long number of years, and to dredge approach channels, install lifting platforms and generally improve the infrastructure, such as ice facilities.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. P. Gallagher)</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland <Col N="1310" /> in the latest FEOGA <i>tranche</i> for fisheries will secure a total of 1.597 million ECUs for aquaculture and fleet development. Decisions on the allocation for fish processing will not be available for some time yet.</P>
      <P>The total allocation for aquaculture for Irish promoters comes to 1.117 million ECUs.</P>
      <P>As regards fleet development, 480,000 ECUs has been approved for refurbishment and modernisation.  A total of 19 projects are involved.</P>
      <P>As regards fleet construction, as the Deputy will be aware, the EC Commission, which has exclusive responsibility in this regard, has generally speaking maintained a policy of not aiding boat construction for the past two years.  The reasons for this are related to the over-capacity in the Community's fishing fleet and the programme the Community has for its reduction.  I should add that those difficulties had been created for us and were not of our own making. However, we realise that we are in Government and are responsible for the decisions of previous Governments.  I repeat that a decision was taken by the previous administration when they communicated to the Commission that we had a gross registered tonnage of 32,000 tonnes.  That was a gross underestimate, to say the least, which has created problems for us.  However, as I have said, we are in Government and we are prepared to accept responsibility and are doing our utmost to resolve the difficulty and we have been successful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Commission has maintained this policy on this occasion for those countries such as Ireland, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Denmark and Belgium, which the Commission sees as having the greatest difficulties.  Significantly, however, there has been a relaxation, albeit minor, in respect of some other countries where the excess fleet capacity is seen to be of a lesser order of magnitude than in the group of countries I have just mentioned and where the Commission have formed the view that the targets the Commission have set out are capable of being achieved.  This augurs <Col N="1311" /> well for the possibility of the renewal of the giving of construction grants to countries such as our own.</P>
    <P>We are in discussions with the Commission on the implementation of the Irish programme and we hope, in co-operation with the industry, to be in a position soon to finally convince it of the special merits of our case, that is, that the figure of 32,000 tonnes was much less than the registered tonnage on the water. This should open the way to the financing of the new vessels required for the Irish fleet.  Might I add, a Cheann Comhairle, that I was disappointed that there were no grants for the construction of new vessels, even though we had our applications in, but I think the House will accept that we are put in a very invidious position as we must be responsible for the mistakes of previous administrations.</P>
    <P>While fleet development is, of course, an important element of our development strategy for the fishing industry, our plans are much wider in scope and coverage than just the fleet.  These plans also relate to pocessing, aquaculture and ancillary services.  The additional first time employment, both full and part time, envisaged in the development plan is expected to be achieved as follows: aquaculture, 2,140 jobs; fisheries, 800 jobs; processing, 1,040 jobs; ancillary services, 390 jobs.  We are determined to ensure that these targets will be met and, indeed, the indications already are that in most categories they are on the way to being well achieved.</P>

Will the Minister justify the statements of intent that he and the Minister have made about the BIM programme to create 4,400 jobs while the fishermen cannot improve their fishing fleets or buy new vessels, because the Minister has allowed the situation to develop in which Ireland is not being provided with FEOGA grants?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Marine if he will consider relocating the sludge dumping site in the Irish Sea used by Dublin Corporation and place it further out to sea, in view of recent information that the current site is not the most suitable location; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>In July 1988 a survey was carried out by my Department of monitor the effects of sewage sludge dumping at the approved site off Howth Head.  The survey indicated that while dumped material was widely dispersed there were some localised problems.  The report of this survey and a subsequent report reviewing previous surveys at the sludge dumping site were released by my Department early this year.</P>
      <P>The Department is now looking at alternative dump sites further offshore. Before relocating the sludge dumping at a new site, the environmental impact of this action must first be assessed.  This will be done by carrying out an environmental impact assessment, including the use of a predictive model.  The model will subsequently be used for ongoing monitoring and will be tested against experimental dumping.  The time scale envisaged is that the model will be available by the end of this year, with experimental dumping commencing early next year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the long overdue movement in this area.  It is a matter of grave concern to everyone, especially the people of Howth, that the sludge of the city of Dublin is dumped so close to them.  Could the Minister indicate the general location of alternative sites further offshore?  Having regard to the fact that the corporation ship travels once every two days, would the Minister consider that at a little extra cost the ship could in fact move well out into the Irish Sea, well off the south coast of Ireland, perform its dumping and return within the schedule currently available to it?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not got the precise details of the proposed relocations available here.  However in the REMOT study which we commissioned there was no major signs of change from the previous study in 1983.  As I have indicated already, we published that survey.  The 1988 study was a reconnaissance survey and was not as comprehensive as that <Col N="1315" /> carried out in 1983, but it indicated that conditions on the sea floor had not deteriorated signficantly between the period 1983 to 1988.  Because of the gaps in the information available we held meetings with the Department of the Environment and Dublin Corporation. Further studies are now being undertaken. As I said, the environmental impact assessment will be carried out on a new site and if further information becomes available I will supply it to the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, I thank the Minister for his reply.  Would the Minister accept in general principle the findings of the International conference, &ldquo;Managing the Irish Sea&rdquo;, held in Dublin in November 1988 that the Irish Sea is more akin to a lake in which water has a life span of nine months and is to a great extent unsuitable for the dumping of sludge? Secondly, can the Minister tell us if the investigations are seeking to trace the build up of nitrates, and the related invasion of algae, in the bay associated with the dumping of sludge so close to the bay?  In short&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, the study to which the Deputy refers indicates that there are no major pollution problems.  It does indicate that overfishing is one of the major problems and points out that there is no significant evidence to suggest that any major damage is being done arising from this type of dumping.  As the Deputy is aware, we are working closely with the Department of the Environment and the Dublin Port and Docks Board.  There is a continuous process of examination and <Col N="1316" /> study and any further improvements that we can make in this area will be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnSMcCoy" hpid="Mr. McCoy Mr. McCoy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCoy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister consider the possibility of drying the sludge, which could be used in the making of garden fertilisers?  It would seem that it is very costly to transport sludge which has a high liquid content, but with an onsite drier or dewatering system costs and the risk to the environment could be greatly diminished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with what the Deputy has said.  Research is taking place in that area.

With the development of new technology there may well be more acceptable means of disposing of sewage and sludge in the future.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 21 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1317" /> At the outset, I would like to take this opportunity to express my full support for the proposal to erect a memorial to those Irish seamen who lost their lives on Irish ships carrying vital supplies to this country during the 1939-45 Emergency. In an effort to further the proposed project my Department obtained sanction from the Minister for Finance for the making of a grant, not exceeding £14,500, during 1989, towards the cost of erecting a suitable memorial to those seafarers who served this country during a time of peril.  The grant commitment, however, was made subject to the strict condition that it be paid only in the event that the project proceeded as planned and that the remainder of the costs involved would be met by the promoters.</P>
    <P>The Irish Merchant Seamen Memorial Committee has recently lodged an application for the payment of this sum.  In response my Department have written to the secretary of the committee seeking details of progress to date relating to the proposed project.  On the receipt of satisfactory information arrangements will be made for the speedy payment of the grant assistance.</P>
    <P>My Department have no responsibility in relation to the administration of funds under the national lottery.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, I thank the Minister for his reply.  Would the Minister briefly elucidate on the special strict conditions attached to the payment of this grant?  I understand that the committee have fulfilled their own commitments in so far as they have secured a site at City Quay in Dublin and have obtained planning permission from the local authority who have waived all fees for the development.  I ask the Minister to outline to what extent this rather modest sum of £14,500 will meet the needs of the committee in erecting this long overdue memorial?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department have sought further details on the tenders received, the estimated cost of the completed project, the funds already raised and the proposals for further funding.  As I said, <Col N="1318" /> we have agreed to pay this money provided the project can go ahead, but the Deputy will be aware that this project has been in the pipeline for a long time. Even though funding has been approved on different occasions, because the project was never executed the money was never paid over.</P>

We have succeeded for the first time in gaining some rights in the North Sea, east of four degrees west, where most of the mackerel are in the autumn fishery.  We wanted to ensure that we retained at least 13,000 tonnes.  We have managed to retain 15,800 tonnes.  This will ensure that we will be able to compete with all of the other countries fishing there.  There is a tremendous demand for mackerel and I <Col N="1319" /> am satisfied that we will be able to compete with all of the other countries and have our fish on the market either on the Continent, Egypt or Nigeria just as quickly as any of the other countries.  To cater for the needs of the smaller boats we have established &mdash; although this may not directly relate to the matter before us &mdash; a herring management regime to ensure that the smaller boats which cannot travel to the North Sea will be able to catch herring throughout the year.</P>

      <P>The national quota is down almost 17,000 tonnes and of the present quota only 15,800 tonnes remain to be caught from October.  Given that processors have had a very lean season and that there is much unemployment in the processing industry, would the Minister ensure that most of the 15,800 tonnes of mackerel which remains to be caught, which would be fished east of the four degree line, will be landed at Irish ports?  I understand that in recent times a large amount of the fish caught has been landed elsewhere. Fishermen are inclined to land fish at the most convenient port and because of this would the Minister consider subsidising trawlers to come west, even to Killybegs in his own constituency which has been particularly hard hit by recent developments?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Of the quantity landed already this year, some 55 per cent has been landed in this country. While that may not appear to be high, we must compare it with the landings of Scottish boats in their country.  Even though they are fishing on their own doorstep, 95 per cent is not processed and no value is added to them.  They are put into luggers. I accept the point that we are fishing quite a distance from home and we shall try to do everything to entice the boats to come back.  I have no doubt that the boats are more than anxious to turn to Killybegs, because the price is much better when the catch has been processed ashore there.  We should remember that <Col N="1320" /> we had the worst winter possibly in living memory and that smaller boats only went out about four times from 15 December to March.  We will entice them, but not to take risks.</P>
      <P>The question of a better price is a commercial decision; and if prices are almost equal I have no doubt that the fishermen realise that the processing facilities in Killybegs, Galway and Dublin will always be there.  Fishermen are very realistic and businesslike and know it is in their best interests to come home, because they know there are factories on water and on wheels which can be moved at any time. However, I take the Deputy's point and I realise the implications it can have for employment in the area.</P>
      <P>I must also say that I do not think everybody will agree that it was a bad year.  It was a reasonably good one, taking all these factors into consideration. The Deputy can be assured that we will continue to do our utmost to convince the Commission that there should be an increase in the total allowable catch.  As a result we will get our 21.3 per cent.  We are locked into this percentage because of the decision taken in 1983 but, thankfully, in 1991 there will be an opportunity to review it.  We have very strong grounds on which to appeal to ICES which should warrant at least a small increase in the quota.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister recognises that it was an extremely bad winter and that many boats were unable to operate.  In view of that, will he agree that there is a special case for his Department to give some financial assistance to facilitate landings in the west?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not wise from a business point of view for the Government to be involved in a question of that kind.  The price of mackeral will always find its own level; it is a question of supply and demand.  It would be wrong to interfere in any way, but we have made numerous efforts over the past two years to try to impress on the Commission the necessity to provide an export subsidy to <Col N="1321" /> third countries.  That existed some years ago and when it was discontinued we were given the impression that it would be available to us through some other channel.  However, there is no point in giving the Deputy, the House or the industry the impression that we will be in a position to make it available.  The avenue to explore is that in relation to subsidies to third countries.  I am not a pessimist but I would not like to deceive the House or the Deputy.  We will pursue it vigorously, and have been doing so, but of course the Council of Ministers and the Commission will decide at the end of the day.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8, 12, 14, 15, 19, 22, 30 and 32 together.</P>
      <P>The Review Group on Air/Sea Rescue Services were established not to investigate search and rescue services off the west coast exclusively but to examine the structure and the operation of the air/sea rescue service within the State's area of responsibility which includes the seas off the south and east coasts of Ireland as well as a large area extending to approximately 200 miles off the west coast.  The group's terms of reference also require them to make recommendations to ensure a cost effective and efficient service to meet national and international requirements.  Within the context of these terms of reference, it will be a matter for the group to determine the manner and extent of their inquiries.  I expect, however, that the group will examine the operations and capabilities of each of the component organisations in the search and rescue system, including the Air Corps, and recommend any possible improvements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding a completion date, I do not <Col N="1323" /> wish to tie the group to a precise date for submission of a report.  The Minister did, however, address the group at their inaugural session held on 7 April 1989 and impressed on them the need for urgency.  The frequency and timing as well as the attendance at and conduct of meetings of the group are a matter for the chairman and members.  The records of their meeting are confidential.  Taking account of the nature and extent of the consultations and investigations which are involved, I anticipate that the report would take some months to complete.</P>
    <P>The membership of the review group reflects the fact that search and rescue is a truly international service not limited by national boundaries and that decisions taken by individual states can have implications for the search and rescue operational procedures in force in neighbouring administrations.  For this reason, the International Maritime Organisation, which are the United Nations agency responsible for safety at sea, have undertaken the development of an international search and rescue plan and have encouraged neighbouring states to enter into discussions regarding the establishment of common procedures and practices.  This is in keeping with the provisions of the Safety of Life at Sea Convention, 1974, and the 1958 Convention on the High Seas, in accordance with which contracting Governments undertake to co-operate with neighbouring states for the provision and maintenance of an adequate and effective search and rescue system and to assist and advise other states in the establishment or review of its service.</P>
    <P>The decision to invite outside participation in the workings of the review group was taken in the light of the international co-operation which exists in the area of search and rescue &mdash; co-operation which was demonstrated so effectively in the marine incidents which occurred in recent months &mdash; and with a view to ensuring that any changes to our system would not disrupt practices in neighbouring states.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1324" /> Automation and demanning of lighthouses has been going on for more than 20 years.  The current programme will lead to the automation of the remaining manned lights by the middle of the nineties. The automation and demanning programme of the Commissioners of Irish Lights is being implemented for sound economic reasons and the Commissioners are satisfied that the excellent quality of service mariners have come to expect from Irish Lights will be maintained on automation.</P>
    <P>Concern, however, has been expressed at the demanning of the lighthouses because of the cessation of the incidental coastwatch assistance lightkeepers are in a position to provide by reason of their location.  Since those concerns were first raised, I have taken steps that have in effect transformed the position of vessels in difficulty around the coast.  Since March 1987 my Department have installed a comprehensive network of VHF stations providing a 24 hour listening watch on the distress channel on all coasts.</P>
    <P>There have been suggestions that a visual coast-watching service be established to replace that provided informally by lightkeepers.  I consider that this issue falls within the terms of reference of the Review Group on Air/Sea Rescue Services. I look forward to seeing what views the review group have on the matter.</P>
    <P>Finally, the content of memoranda for Government and the record of Government discussions are confidential and it is not the practice to reveal them.  I can say, however, that no options have been excluded in advance of the review group's deliberations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that the committee were established following the expression of concern here and outside about the inadequacy of the air/sea search and rescue service around our coastline?  The committee have met and the Minister should be in a position to report to the House who attended and, in particular, if experts from outside the country attended.  Is the Minister aware that the <Col N="1325" /> public consider the establishment of the committee as a fobbing-off exercise by the Government so as to delay a decision on the air/sea rescue service?  Will the Minister accept that there is a need for the Government to take urgent and practical action in regard to that service?  Will he accept that the position is highly unsatisfactory? Will the Minister give some indication when he expects the committee to be in a position to report?  Their terms of reference are specific and it is important that a report should be submitted to the House in the next four or five months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>It was as a result of the great concern of the Government about such a service that the committee were established.  I can appreciate the public holding the view that the Government were engaged in a fobbing-off exercise when irresponsible Members continue to impress that on them.  I have the greatest admiration for the West Coast Search and Rescue Action Committee and their report will be taken into consideration by the committee established by the Government.  We do not take decisions on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis; we believe in making decision that will last.  In our view it is necessary to await the report of the committee.  The committee should have some international flavour and avail of the expertise of officials from the Community such as Mr. Benda.  Indeed, Mr. McDonald, the coast guard attaché of the US Embassy in London, has been consulted.</P>

I look forward to receiving the report of the committee which will be presented to the Government.</P>
      <P>I should like to tell the Deputy that no option will be excluded in advance of the deliberations by the review group.  I should like to remind the House that the public were given an opportunity, through a notice in the national newspapers, and in the <i>Skipper and Marine Times,</i> to make submissions to the review group.

There is no question of the group not working or not taking an interest in the matter.  The committee have sufficient information to consider in the meantime.  When their report is made available it will be presented to the Government for a decision.</P>
      <P>I must emphasise that the Government have not excluded any options.  I was surprised that Deputy McCartan clarified that he was not in favour of privatisation. I am in favour of the provision of the best search and rescue service for the country and I do not exclude anything.

      <P>asked the Minister for the Marine, in view of a decision announced at the weekend of 14-16 April 1989 by freight carriers operating on the North Atlantic routes between the United States and Europe whereby (1) rates are to be increased by 10 per cent to and from Ireland and (2) Waterford is to cease to be a base port, the action he intends to take directly and in conjunction with the European Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the comprehensive response given by me on 26 April last when this matter was raised by his party colleague, Senator Bulbulia, in the Seanad.</P>
      <P>In my reply, I already articulated the Government's concern at these developments and went on to outline the contents of a letter which I had written to the chairman of the North-Eastern Atlantic Conference Line, strongly urging that they reconsider their proposals relating to arbitrary charges and Waterford port.</P>
      <P>The letter was written following extensive consultations with shippers' interests who in their dialogue with the representatives of the Conference Line, have made abundantly clear that they are unwilling to accept either the rates increase or the removal of Waterford as a designated feeder port to the Conference Line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy may also have seen reports of my speech in Waterford on Tuesday <Col N="1329" /> of this week at the celebration of Bell Lines 25th year of operations at the port. In my speech I reiterated the Government's support for Irish exporters in their refusal to accept these impositions and noted with satisfaction the advent of real competition in this important area with the arrival in recent years of major non-conference lines who provide competing services on trans-Atlantic routes.</P>
    <P>The question of taking up this matter with the European Commission will be considered in the light of the response of the conference.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the letter the Minister sent to the chairman of the North-Eastern Atlantic Conference Line, may I ask what reaction he expects to this letter?  Was it a request that these charges be not increased and that Waterford be not deleted as a base port, or was it a demand?  In other words, if they do not agree to what the Minister has asked, does he have any recourse to taking tougher action in the form of sanctions against these companies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I think all of us first became aware of this problem when it was announced on the night of the Irish Chamber of Shipping dinner in Dublin.  I took the opportunity that night of familiarising myself with the proposed measures and the serious implications which the additional charges would have not alone for Waterford and the south-east but for the country as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the Minister's letter to the chairman of the Conference Line, I should point out to the Deputy that the Conference Line are a commercial company made up of a consortium of shippers. They have been told of the serious implications of these developments for the country but we have pointed out the serious implications for themselves.  I fully believe that when the Conference Line took this decision they did not realise the importance of the business from Waterford for them and the rest of the country.  They are not the only Conference Line there; there are two other conference lines and while in <Col N="1330" /> Waterford I took the opportunity to meet with both &mdash; OOCL and Johnson-Stephens who represent Top Galiant Lines.  I was surprised when I noted their quotations.  One line sails weekly and the other sails fortnightly.  The chairman of the North-Eastern Atlantic Conference Line who has by now received the Minister's letter must realise that good business sense must prevail.  We have had numerous meetings with the shippers in the country.  The Irish Shippers Council have met with the Conference Line people and I think it is fair to say that the Conference Line people did not seem to be aware of the seriousness of the problem for the country.</P>
    <P>Following the Minister's letter, when I was in Waterford celebrating with Bell Lines their 25 years in business &mdash; of course, they have been in business for many more years as George Bell &mdash; I took the opportunity of meeting with the other people involved and made it clear publicly to the Conference Line that if this had happened some years ago it would have had more serious repercussions. However, because there are other conference lines providing a service there at present, I feel confident that the response from the chairman to the Minister will be favourable.  The Deputy can take it that since we first heard of the proposed measures the Minister, the officials of the Department and I have been working assiduously pointing out to them the serious implications of this move for the whole country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish that the Conference Line's intentions were as innocent as the Minister has outlined.  However, I suspect that there is something very sinister about this whole episode.  It does seem that an attempt is being made to squeeze the main sea container carrying company in this country, Bell Lines, out of business. Has that been drawn to the Minister's attention?  It looks as if these people are trying to direct the traffic which Bell Lines currently have to their own operators within this State.  The motive for <Col N="1331" /> their actions could be extremely dangerous so far as the future of Bell Lines is concerned.</P>

While I was delighted to attend the Bell Line celebrations of their 25 years in business, I thought I would have the opportunity of meeting Deputy Deasy at those celebrations so that we could have discussions.  It is not just the interests of Waterford that are involved here: the interests of the country as a whole are involved, and we have a responsibility to look after them.</P>
      <P>Bell Lines are a very big company and if this proposal is introduced I believe they will be able to face it.  I believe the problem lies with the Conference Line and that at the end of the day they are the people who will suffer most.  In saying that I am optimistic that good commercial sense will prevail.  The Minister, the departmental officials and I have taken this matter very seriously because of its implications for the sea freight service and we have left absolutely no stone unturned.  I take the Deputy's point and we will certainly take the matter up with the Competition Commissioner &mdash; or his office as soon as we have some response from the Conference Line.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Marine if, in view of the widespread dissatisfaction amongst fishermen with the result of the dredging of the harbour <Col N="1332" /> at Helvick, County Waterford, officials from his Department will meet with representatives of the fishermen to see if a satisfactory conclusion to the matter can be reached.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that with the assistance of a 50 per cent grant from the Department of the Marine Waterford County Council placed a contract for the carrying out of some dredging work at the fishery harbour at Helvick Head, County Waterford, in November-December 1988.  I understand that due to a combination of circumstances the planned work was not completed.</P>
      <P>I further understand that the county manager of Waterford suggested to the fishermen that they might employ a consultant to survey the harbour and I gather that the fishermen are considering this suggestion.  In fact, I heard reports on Raidió na Gaeltachta this morning from the deisceart go bhfuil siad ag obair ar seo agus is dóigh liom go mbeidh an plean seo acu le haghaidh an bhainisteoir contae agus dúinne taobh istigh de achar gearr.  I understand from reports that they have proceeded and I will arrange for officials from my Department to meet with them, following receipt of the fishermen's consultants' report.</P>

      <P>I do not know if the Minister is aware that even though a considerable amount of money has been spent on this operation the end result will probably be worse than what pertained before the work started.  The fishermen are extremely annoyed that the dredging scheme went so badly.  When the Minister said he would get officials from his Department to meet with them, was he referring to the fishermen concerned in Helvick?</P>

      <P>Both the Minister and I have met more representatives and fishermen in the past two years than the previous Ministers did in four and a half years.  When this report is ready &mdash; and as I said reports on Raidió na Gaeltachta this morning suggest that the report will be ready within a short period &mdash; officials <Col N="1333" /> from the Department will meet with a deputation of fishermen.  In fact, I think they met on numerous occasions, but maybe not in the same circumstances, during November-December.  I know the Deputy's interest in Helvick and we are very anxious that the dredging of the harbour and the approach channel will be carried out and that the road to the fishery co-operative will be tarmacadamed. We were advised at the time that £50,000 would be sufficient to carry out all this work, but unfortunately there were some hiccups at the time.  It is a matter I will gladly discuss with the Deputy and give him our views.  I do not think it is a matter that could easily be discussed publicly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>The dredging scheme went badly wrong and the problems now are greater than before the work started. Who is drawing up the report to which the Minister referred in his reply and when does he expect it to be published?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>This was suggested by the county manager, Mr. Hurley.  The reports of the meeting of Waterford County Council would give a reasonable insight into the problems the Departmental engineer and others carrying out the work encountered.  It was suggested by the county manager that the fishermen's representatives should themselves have a report prepared on what further works they envisaged needed to be carried out.  I am reasonably familiar with Helvick Harbour and the problems that obtained there with neap tides for larger boats gaining access.  The site survey conducted at the time indicated that the bar consisted of sand and silt and that much tougher conditions actually existed, such as stone and cobble being unexpectedly encountered.  That caused a delay but all the material was subsequently removed by the dredger.  The channel through the bar achieved design level for the most part of 2.7 metres or 9 feet.  Just under two-thirds of the inner bar basin was removed.  I can agree that the work has not been completed to our satisfaction.  We have ascertained that, <Col N="1334" /> because of the lack of co-operation on the part of some people, the loss of time for which the State had to pay was some £4,000 &mdash; which may not appear to be a lot but is almost 9 per cent of the overall cost.  I would be only too pleased to discuss the matter with Deputy Deasy in an endeavour to have the problem resolved.</P>

If our expectations for Structural Funds are realised the projected investment this year would be £3 million and £4 million for each of the next four years.  This year's harbour development programme includes major improvements at Dingle, Rossaveel and Killybegs.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clohessy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Marine the number of complaints which his Department have received of fishing boats being dragged by underwater vessels for the year 1987-88; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department have not received any complaints of fishing vessels being dragged by underwater vessels for the year 1987-88.</P>
      <P>It has been established conclusively in one case only that a vessel was sunk in and around Irish waters by a submarine i.e. the <i>M.F.V. Sharelga</i> on the 18 April 1982.  No lives were lost on that occasion. In another incident in 1984, the <i>M.F.V. Oriel</i> was dragged backwards in the Irish Sea.  However, Malin Head coast radio Station received a report on 17 October 1988 that the <i>M.F.V. Crystal Sea</i> was being towed backward at approximately two knots in the Irish Sea approximately 12 miles off Wicklow Head.  The cause of the problem was never definitively established. This incident occurred outside Irish territorial waters and did not involve Irish registered vessels.</P>
      <P>Speculation on the involvement of submarines in fishing vessel casualties is fuelled by the apparently unaccountable sinking of many such vessels.  However, preliminary inquiries into such incidents have shown, that fishing vessels may sink for a number of reasons such as, for example, structural defects, human error and unfavourable weather conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned that every possible step should be taken to ensure that submarines operate in a responsible fashion <i>vis-à-vis</i> fishing vessels.  To that end, and to minimise the danger posed to fishing vessels at sea by submerged submarines my Department brought the matter to the attention of the International Maritime Organisation &mdash; IMO &mdash; which is the <Col N="1336" /> London-based United Nations specialised agency responsible for safety at sea. As a result a resolution was passed by the IMO Assembly in November 1987 recommending that a submerged submarine, if information on the presence of a fishing vessel and its gear is available, as far as possible should keep out of the way of that fishing vessel and any gear connected to it unless the submarine is disabled.</P>
    <P>It would also be helpful if fishing vessels which experience difficulties with submarines report such incidents promptly to the relevant maritime authority which in the case of Irish waters is the Marine Survey Office of the Department of the Marine.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Have the Minister's Department taken any steps, in particular with regard to the 12-mile limit of our jurisdiction, to ensure that submarines in those waters travel on the surface as is the requirement of international law?  Has the Minister considered going beyond the International Maritime Organisation by way of bilateral approaches to the countries which are clearly identifiable &mdash; in effect three only &mdash; that are overcrowding the Irish Sea?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of submarines is one for the Minister for Defence or the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  Of course, my Department have a very practical interest in submarine activity in so far as we have responsibility for the safety of life at sea.  Obviously we would be interested in ascertaining whether any submarine activity would pose a hazard to other shipping.  The Deputy is quite right in pointing out that submarines travelling inside the territorial limit must travel on the surface. We have made this requirement known regularly to the International Maritime Organisation with regard to any vessels travelling within our territorial waters. Indeed all countries would find themselves in a similar position; there would be unanimity on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1337" /> Certainly we would like to have knowledge of any submarines travelling submerged inside the 12-mile limit.  There was a recent incident when a submarine came to the assistance of a fishing vessel which had got into difficulties off the north coast when fortunately no lives were lost, and when they were most helpful. However, I realise the Deputy's intention was that at every available opportunity we have it made known to the various countries involved that submarines travelling within our territorial limit must travel on the surface displaying their flag.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the confinements of the Irish Sea and its importance as a fishing area, would the Department consider supporting the initiative for a movement in the management of the sea toward the total ban of submarine traffic?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only recall that the reason for all the activity in the Irish Sea is that one of the ports used by the countries involved is Holylocke on the Scottish coast, from where they travel up and down the Irish Sea.  Certainly it would make life much easier for everybody concerned if they decided to go north or west and down the west coast. However, I do not think it was the Deputy's intention to have the problem transferred from the east to the west coast.</P>

      <P>In the course of my reply to a similar question put down by the Deputy some time ago I indicated that the issue raised complex and sensitive legal issues requiring careful examination.</P>
      <P>I must confess that, to date, I have been unable to resolve the difficulties of finding a mechanism which would enable the Government to assist former Irish Shipping workers without running the risk of exposing the taxpayer to a very large liability, possibly of the order of £200 million.</P>
      <P>On 14 April 1989, the Minister for Labour and the Minister for the Marine met a delegation of former Irish Shipping Limited employees.  They explained in detail the difficulties involved which I had explained to the House some time previously.  I have no further information other than from paper reports that legal proceedings are pending.  As yet I am not aware whether they have been initiated. If that is the case I would be somewhat fearful at this stage of venturing into deep waters.</P>

      <P>I would expect that within that period there should be a definite answer.</P>
      <P>Can I take it now that the Minister's answer is no, that the Government because of the complex sensitive legal issues &mdash; I have never been able to find out what they are &mdash; do not intend doing anything for the employees of Irish Shipping many of whom have not got the wages that are due to them?

      <P>I am not surprised <Col N="1339" /> that the Deputy should ask me that question. In my reply on that occasion to which he refers both in relation to the question itself and the supplementaries I made it clear that the matter was an extremely complex one which raised sensitive issues.  I genuinely felt at that stage that a six months timescale might be appropriate.  With the gift of hindsight it appears that the timescale has turned out to be somewhat ambitious.  The liquidation is still pending and indications are that it will not be completed for some five years.  A distribution of preferential creditors took place on 15 December 1988.  In the meantime we are continuing to examine the issues but as many Deputies on all sides of the House have acknowledged the issues are complex and fraught with danger.  The Deputy says he cannot understand what the legal difficulties are. I believe that commercial law would take its course here and any measures taken by us at this time could have serious effects and could cost the taxpayer something in the order of £200 million.  The statutory redundancy was paid.  I should like to inform the Deputy that the Government discussed this matter but did not take any decision as yet.</P>

May I ask the Minister if he has explored possibilities outside of existing legislation?  First, why are there wages outstanding?  Surely that matter should have been resolved years ago.  There is no legal difficulty whatever about paying off the wages that are due to some employees?  Secondly, has the Minister explored the possibility of some type of <i>ex gratia</i> payment, the establishment of a particular fund or whatever that would be outside the sensitive and complex legal area because of the responsibility which we all have and which the previous Government had to the employees of Irish Shipping?</P>

I will definitely pursue the question of wages outstanding.  The Government have discussed it but as yet there is no decision on it.

    <Title>Irish Land Commission (Dissolution) Bill, 1989: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I was saying before Question Time that so far as the dissolution of the Land Commission is concerned, for the first time in 50 years we now have no control over the amounts of land being purchased by outsiders, foreigners and, indeed, by persons inside Ireland who have no expertise in farming. This obviously must come as a great shock to people who genuinely believed there would be some mechanism to protect their interests.  I had also gone on to talk about the group purchase scheme which I introduced when I was in the Department.  For the life of me I can never understand why this type of scheme was not introduced many years earlier. One of the great problems with the acquisition programme was that it was not cost effective.  It was too cumbersome and too much taxpayers' money was tied up in the actual purchase of land down through the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The particular scheme which I introduced four or five years ago meant that the State was not involved in the purchase of land.  There were no land bonds &mdash; which would have been an advantage <Col N="1366" /> from the beginning &mdash; and that meant that the people who were most likely to farm the land well were those who were most likely to pay for it and get on with the job.  We put it to the test and, as I said before Question Time, we have the figures to prove that if the Land Commission personnel on the ground understood the fears and the anxieties of people involved and there had been a vote of confidence in the staff of the Land Commission to act as the honest broker, then we would have saved millions of pounds to the Exchequer and we would have a much quicker, sharper and much more cost effective scheme.  Unfortunately, in my view, that came about 15 years too late.  By the time we were able to implement it the great disposing of the Land Commission staff had begun and in the last two years the ghost was given up altogether.</P>
    <P>When I see a Fianna Fáil Bill proposing to dissolve the Land Commission I think I have seen everything in Irish politics.  I fully understand the reasons for the Land Commission being wound up and am not objecting to that, but I am objecting to no authority being put in their place.  I want to stitch the following matter into the record.  Only four years ago a big farm came up for sale in Laurencetown, near Ballinasloe in County Galway. Everybody knew that for the previous five years the Land Commission had not been involving themselves in acquisition proceedings under any Government; they were just not purchasing land.  We had introduced the group purchase concept and I was junior Minister at the time, with responsibility for lands.  Naturally, the people concerned came to me and said there was something dreadfully wrong with a Government who would not provide money to buy that 300 acre farm and divide it out.  I said that we were not going to do that and that the Government before us had not done it.  I advised those men to buy the farm between them and promised to put the Land Commission staff at their disposal and for the various amounts of money that they had available we would allocate land at a <i>pro rata</i> basis to them.  It dawned on those farmers that <Col N="1367" /> that was the thing to do.  Deputy Treacy, now Minister of State, was at that meeting and could see no reason that the Government would not take the farm over, pay the land bonds and give the land out in the ordinary way.  Not alone that, he reckoned that the 15 persons residing in cottages adjoining that farm were entitled to a small number of acres for nothing out of the estate.  That was only four or five years ago.  Fianna Fáil have done a great turn-around in so far as that episode was concerned.</P>
    <P>The acquisition of land, payment in land bonds and redistribution five or six years later was not cost effective.  In so far as that part of the Bill is concerned, I shed no tears.  However, I am particularly upset at some of the matters raised in the Minister's speech and some statements which have been made here this week.  It appears that market forces will now be allowed to dictate.  In other words, if you have the money you can buy the land and if you have not, nobody is there to help you in any way.</P>
    <P>There are two other factors to which I wish to refer.  I put forward the proposal earlier today that we should have some type of overall authority with a certain amount of bite, that would look into all matters relating to land policy.  An agricultural country is entitled to that.  It is important to realise that there is a number of areas in which, when this Bill gets through the House, there will be difficulty.  What will happen to the group purchase schemes that are on the books but obviously are not being worked at the moment?  Who will provide the manpower, the publicity campaigns and so forth?</P>
    <P>Secondly, who will divide the commonages that are left?  I am long enough in the tooth to know that in so far as many of the major problems in agriculture are concerned they do not extend to the division of commonages.  However, if you happen to be a commonage owner, particularly in one of the western counties, and genuinely want to divide the commonage and have one or two people who are obstructive &mdash; these are in every <Col N="1368" /> townland in Ireland &mdash; how will it be possible to divide those commonages and get on with the show?  We found it hard enough to divide them when there was a Land Commission man available to act as a referee, but what will happen when he is not there?  Is there any system through Teagasc or the FDS or is any thought being given to that?  In that last two years nobody in Agriculture House has given any thought to those problems, small though they may be.  When you put the lot together as a land policy, you are obviously on the wrong track.</P>
    <P>Let us consider the multiplicity of fragmented farms all over the country.  It is quite possible that one farmer is quite prepared, under certain circumstances, to exchange land with the neighbour in order to make a more useful, economic holding.  People who do not understand the system would say that if people are that eager about it, let them do it and not use taxpayers' money in doing so. Perhaps there should be a cost factor involved.  One thing I am sure of from my four and a half years experience of dealing with the Land Commission is that unless there is some person, the honest broker about whom I talked, who has expertise in land and land distribution and understands the psychological reasons for the tantrums that people get into when dealing with land, no scheme will be successful.  I proved conclusively, with the new purchase scheme, that you could settle matters in a month which took six years previously and cost literally several hundred thousand pounds of taxpayers' money.  That may be an oversimplification but there are great grounds to believe that that scheme can be successful.</P>
    <P>With regard particularly to the west, but this concerns other areas as well, there is the question of turbary rights. Nobody seems to lift a finger nowadays about this matter.  You can phone one of the few remaining Land Commission offices and they say they are not geared for this.  The fuel rquirements of many families is very important to them and if they knew who owned the turbary rights they could settle matters.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1369" /> I spoke about the concept of some sort of control on land sales.  I made it very plain that it would be a very loose arrangement.  I believe that the owner of the land is entitled to the last penny at public auction, but it is very important that qualified, suitable, small family farmers are entitled to the first bite of the cherry.  I said that one thousand times in the last 20 years and if I live another 20 I shall say it just as often.  There is an obligation on the State to ensure, in some way or other &mdash; and I have to accept that this is a difficult case &mdash; that these small farmers are protected.  We cannot wash our hands, do a Pontius Pilate on it and let market forces dictate.  If that happens, let nobody come into this House and say that we carried the flag for a certain type of small to medium farmer.  I am not talking about farms of five, or 12, or 20 acres.  I am talking about the vast majority of farmers who are getting no State support, being deemed not to be entitled to it, who have a poor enough standard of living because they have very limited acreage and who are absolutely top class, qualified farmers.  I am not talking about gombeen men but about the best in the business at a particular level.</P>
    <P>The time is most opportune &mdash; and in fact has passed &mdash; to have some type of national body, statutory body in place.  I sincerely hope that the next such legislation we will see, either enacted here in the House or as a ministerial direction, will provide for some body with the type of personnel I have spoken about here today.  I could go on for two hours about this subject if I was allowed.</P>
    <P>There is something about the agricultural community that I cannot understand. Unless there is an increase of ½p on the gallon for milk or 1p on the pound for beef, the structures always take second and third place in any discussion I had with any group of farmers, organised, unofficial or what have you.  That is a great pity, because at the end of the day it is very important to have structures that can meet eventualities that will turn up in time, and great thought must be put into them.  I remember in the lifetime of the last Government something we spoke <Col N="1370" /> about in Macra na Feirme years ago, a measure to expedite the transfer of land from father to son.  However it is organised, it is important that there be a system that would make it attractive for a retiring couple to hand the land over.  I introduced a long term leasing concept which in itself is very good.  I cannot say it was a world shattering performance, but it needed to be done and it created a vehicle for quite a number of people.  As it turned out, the income margin in farming became tight but I assume that from now on the basis for long term leasing will become favourable again or the climate will become favourable for it.</P>
    <P>We pay stamp duty on the transfer of a farm from father to son, and this was linked up with the concept, provided certain educational standards were attained in the agricultural area.  Several thousand small farmers were concerned in this. This Government for one reason or another decided to disband and discontinue that scheme.  That is unfortunate. Maybe the rationale behind it is that it might be better to drop it for a year or two and reintroduce it, but I hear nobody, from the Minister or the two Ministers of State down, ever refer to this.  If we believed the land of Ireland should be in the hands of people best equipped and trained for it, then obviously the younger the generation the better chance we have of shaping up to the problems of 1992.  We went to great lengths for that and I do not hear too much from the agricultural press at the moment about the fact that it is not there, and I am not sure that the agricultural organisations are too worried about it. However, many medium to small farmers cannot understand why when they go to transfer the farm now it is costing thousands of pounds in some cases because of stamp duty.  There is a fair case to be made there, particularly for any new monitoring body who come in to replace the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>A land authority should have certain clearly defined powers.  They should not be toothless, as we say, because we have too many talking shops.  They should be composed of various people and interest groups who make up the whole agricultural arena.  I referred to it earlier <Col N="1371" /> today and said certainly all the farm organisations and Teagasc, the advisory people, should be represented; and there is no reason at all why auctioneers and valuers and all such people should not have a big impact on such a body.  There should be clearly defined Government policy and, working within those confines, this statutory board would do the things we believe would be good for the agricultural industry.  Very little was said about this all week.</P>
    <P>It is not enough for Fianna Fáil to come along and say this happened in the Coalition's time, it was decided to cease the Land Commission's activities then, four or five years ago.  Great time and effort were put in a few years ago to the concept of replacing them when this went before the House, but there is not a single word about it at the moment.  It is no harm that the agricultural community know through this House what exactly is proposed for them or, if it is not proposed here, that they organise themselves to make sure that the powers that be, irrespective of who is here, will ensure certain proposals are put in train that will be to their benefit in the whole land policy area in the years to come.</P>
    <P>I do not know what is going to happen in 1992.  Can anybody foresee what is going to happen in many areas of Irish life?  Certainly, the scene will never be the same again.  Consider the prospect of many thousands of our valuable agricultural acres being marked up right across the country by people who have no commitment to this country or to agriculture who are coming here, maybe for financial reasons, maybe to bury money, maybe because we have a clean environment. Of course, we like them to come to this country; but do we like them to come at the expense or potential expense of many thousands of medium sized farmers who would make a very fruitful living had they got that extra land when they wanted it.</P>
    <P>This House had heard this kind of talk for many a long year.  This will be the last time we will hear it in the context of the Land Commission because they will be gone whenever this Bill is enacted.  I make a very strong plea to the Minister <Col N="1372" /> here today to try to convince his colleagues in Fianna Fáil &mdash; and a great deal of convincing will have to be done right across the country &mdash; that a land authority is very important.  At the moment I foresee little enough trouble for the next year or two.  We will be on auto pilot and let everything happen that should or can happen; but if that is not planned for, then in the next five or six years there will be many very unhappy Irish farming families who will believe genuinely that someone somewhere let them down. Whatever you do, make sure there are some personnel in every county, whether under the aegis of the FDS, Teagasc, or anybody else, to do the jobs I am talking about in relation to group purchase, division of commonages, division of bogs and so on.</P>
    <P>Let us make sure there will always be enough staff for years to come under the vesting section and other areas of the Land Commission.  If it is decided to let the staff levels run any lower there will not be a solicitor or his client in the country but will be up the wall because they will not get the documents they are looking for.  The documents are over there, as I know because it was my job to see them when I was over there, but it is like going through the eye of a needle at the moment to get them out because the staff are not there.  Although this is not within my remit, let me say if a fee must be charged to get them out, then provide for that; but do not let the scene be such that technically you can come into the Dáil and say the system is there and we have it manned when it is not there.</P>
    <P>It was not today nor yesterday the numbers in those offices began to fall.  I have been approached by several solicitors on this and I know from my constituency that there must be some reasonable level in those offices &mdash; they will have to be there for many a year &mdash; and they will have to be staffed by the people who are good at that work, who have a great expertise built up, and, God knows, there are some of them left yet. In this cost conscious country of ours I would even go so far as to say that I would not oppose some small charge to <Col N="1373" /> ensure that offices are staffed and necessary documents are readily available.  We must certainly not allow staff with expertise to leave and we must ensure that numbers are adequate.</P>
    <P>This is quite a sad day for the country. A lot of people will miss the Land Commission, although it ceased to be relevant about 25 years go.  Major policy changes should have been made then and a full-blooded land authority should have been established to do the things I have been talking about.  I will always say in fairness to the people who dissolved the Land Commission that there was never a need for the State to buy land, pay for it in land bonds which nobody wanted and then spend five or six years distributing it.  I accept that it was time to change that system but we must ensure that there is some kind of replacement authority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will begin by referring to the reasons the Land Commission is being dissolved.  My colleague, Deputy Connaughton, hit the nail on the head when he mentioned that the Land Commission and its agencies had outdated procedures and functions for a number of years.  They made themselves totally irrelevant.  Thousands of acres were held by the Land Commission for many years without distribution and this caused aggravation to people who hoped they would receive an allotment.  Further aggravation was caused by the fact that nothing was done with this land apart from 11-month letting, year after year. No money was being lost to the State but confidence was being eroded in the ability of the Land Commission to be decisive and function as it used to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other problem which killed the Land Commission was inflation, which savagely overtook the whole problem of the re-allocation of land, particularly from 1975 onwards.  Land prices escalated and the Land Commission had to pay very high purchase costs.  When reallocating, the land annuities were such as to make it virtually impossible for the recipients to bear the financial burden. Countless people found themselves in severe financial difficulties.  The Land Commission were very accommodating <Col N="1374" /> and anxious to assist in every way possible. The very fact that the problem arose repeatedly and was not catered for in any substantial way as the deathknell for the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>Presiding as we are at the dissolution of the Land Commission, there is a need for some regulatory agency.  The party opposite made many loud noises about a replacement agency when this matter was mooted by the previous Government.  I am sorry that the same noises are not being made now.  I would reiterate the necessity for a land agency or some regulatory body.  The whole physical and social structure of rural life is likely to change dramtically in the next few years. Whatever body is established must take account of the role which will have to be played in the future.</P>
    <P>There is much talk about 1992 and about the level playing field, open competition and market forces deciding the order of the day.  A number of countries in the Community have their own social policies in order to preserve the fabric of their society.  Some of them have made a number of mistakes, from which we could learn.  Because of the number of small farms and land units in various parts, we have to accept that it is virtually impossible for a farmer with a family to exist as they did 50 or 100 years ago on 25 or 40 acreas.  They cannot eke out a worthwhile economic income.  The obvious conclusion is that there will have to be a combination of two jobs.  A person with a small farm will hold down a job in industry and at he same time look after the farm, perhaps growing vegetables and fulfilling other household needs.  This trend is already developing.  Unless we are to see the complete erosion of the society which exists in rural Ireland there will have to be greater acceptance of this type of thing.  With modern technology it will be possible for young people using fibre optics to work in industry without leaving their home.  It matters not whether they operate from the centre of the city or from the provincial town. Perhaps they will work in the environment in which they are born and reared.  It is unlikely that this will be allowed to happen unless some regulatory agency is established to guide <Col N="1375" /> developments towards that objective.  It will be too late to begin in five or ten years time.  Given the kind of emigration we have experienced in recent years and the rate at which it is likely to continue over the next couple of years, it is imperative to create a situation where such people can acquire a small property in the country, in the case of those who come from that type of background.  If we do not take such action we could find ourselves, as Deputy Sheehan so colourfully said, with a lot of high flying executives in rural Ireland with no knowledge of or commitment to the fabric of the rural structure.  They would not blend in well and are not the ideal solution.</P>
    <P>A rural development agency might fill the necessary role.  There is an important area which I hope will not be forgotten. The fabric of rural society must be preserved at this important time of evolution in our society.  I would ask the Minister to consider setting up some kind of regulatory agency in the evolutionary period into which we are now heading.</P>
    <P>The land has always been an emotive issue and always will be.  Life was lost for it.  It will continue to be an emotive issue regardless of how unimportant it may seem in high financial circles.  For that reason it is important that the ideals and the motivating forces that guide the people who live on the land are not forgotten.</P>
    <P>The level playing field and the open market can be positive, but they can be a destructive and fragmenting influence also.  A milk quota can have a dramatic effect on the value of the land when a small farm is put up for sale and this, in turn, can have a dramatic effect on access to that land by the people in the area. Suddenly it is out of the control of those who were born and bred and lived on the land and into the control of the people with the cheque books, the people with access to high finance, and it is a totally different ball game.  There has been an inflationary trend recently which has not been helpful in dealing with the transfer and acquisition of land or its productive capacity in terms of those who are attempting to purchase it.</P>
    <P>In recent times we have seen that inflation is rearing its head again.  The <Col N="1376" /> peculiar thing is that it seems to be accepted by some as a positive thing.  Of course it is always helpful and positive to somebody who wishes to dispose of property if they suddenly find that property is worth more; but once a property of any description takes on a value which is totally unrelated to its productive capacity on the original cost of construction there is grave danger.  We should remember what happened from the early seventies onwards when land prices escalated to such an extent that there was competition between the various purchasers who went to their bank managers and were able to dictate the price of the property depending on how friendly the bank manager was.  The price related not to the production capacity of the land but to the availability of finance or credit.  Five or ten years down the road the people who had been lured into borrowing vast sums of money from banks and various other financial institutions who, in turn, spent years trying to squeeze it back out of them ended up destocking and leaving rural areas. People were so overburdened with debt that the only recourse they had was to close the door behind them and leave the country.</P>
    <P>For that reason it is important that there be some regulatory agency with powers to guide the people who will be influential in determining where land will go over the next eight or ten years and so preserve the rural fabric of society at which people from all over Europe marvel when they come here.  We should try to ensure that it does not disappear.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to make a contribution to this debate.  I have listened with interest to the contributions of many speakers, whose number shows there is a keen interest in what is happening in the House today. This is a sad day for the country.  We are discussing The Irish Land Commission (Dissolution) Bill, 1989 and there is nothing to replace it.  That strikes fear into the hearts of the small farmers of the country, the very people we are supposedly protecting.  There is nothing in place now to protect them from unscrupulous outsiders who can come in <Col N="1377" /> and take land that is becoming available in the countryside.</P>
      <P>Tributes have been paid to the work of the Land Commission, and rightly so. They were not without their faults, but they had a very difficult task to do.  Dealing with land is never easy.  People think hard before they surrender land.  It takes a lot to persuade people to the idea that tidying up parcels of land that are scattered or far removed from the farm or the household is in their best interest. The Land Commission did a lot of good work here and their job is not finished.</P>
      <P>It is only right to point out that during the last general election Fianna Fáil campaigned on the promise that there would be a land authority put in place of the Land Commission.  I would like to know where are the proposals to bring in this land authority.  There is no point in talking about it in 12 or 18 months time when the expertise of the people whom we are now going to make redundant is lost. What will happen to the inspectors, the people with a deep knowledge and commitment, whom I have had the pleasure of meeting and dealing with over the past 20 years in my own county of Cavan and later in the constituency of Cavan-Monaghan? They went about their duties in a manner that was a credit to them and which would be a credit to many Departments if the same painstaking effort were made in coming to a decision about things that matter.</P>
      <P>It appears to be the policy to get rid of the small farmer.  The county committees of agriculture were abolished.  We now have Teagasc.  Agricultural advice is no longer available to small farmers.  It is available to the larger farmers who can pay for it.  We have agricultural instructors who got out of the system, took redundancy and set themselves up as agricultural consultants, and I admire them. That is fine for the people who can afford to pay them the sort of money they would be seeking for the advice they have to give and the work they were doing in this country from the foundation of the State.</P>
      <P>I would like to quote here from Article 45.2 of the Constitution:</P>
      <P>The State shall, in particular, direct its policy towards securing:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1378" /> v.  That there may be established on the land in economic security as many families as in the circumstances shall be practicable.</P>
    <P>We have a duty in this House to protect the rights of the small farmer.  I wonder if what we are doing here today is constitutional? This is not a policy to be adopted or disregarded at will.  It is a solemn directive to the Oireachtas and the principle that should dominate all farming choices.</P>
    <P>Let me give some idea of what has happened here in relation to small farmers since 1946.  In 1946 the number of people working in agriculture was 575,000 or 40 per cent of the working population.  By 1971 &mdash; a quarter of a century during which the national population remained static at just under 3 million &mdash; the number engaged in agriculture had dropped to 273,000 or less than half the 1946 level.  By 1981 &mdash; and this is more relevant &mdash; a decade later during which the national population had increased dramatically by 15 per cent, the number in agriculture had dropped by a staggering 30 per cent to 189,000.  By 1986, a mere five years later during which the national population continued to expand, the number of people working in agriculture had dropped still further to 171,000, a fall of over 10 per cent. Throughout that 40 year period there has been a steady and unrelenting decrease of over 2 per cent each year in the farming population.  In other words, where there were nine farmers five years ago, there are now eight; where there were nine farmers 15 years ago, there are now six and where there were nine farmers 40 years ago there are now two and a half. The message is spelled out clearly in those facts.</P>
    <P>In the early fifties the indications were that the farming population should decrease to about 300,000 over one generation in order to achieve viable and healthy stability.  By 1976 that marker had been significantly overrun and despite the smaller numbers it was apparent that no more than one-third of farmers had achieved viable status, that the future was in the balance for another one-third and that the remaining one-third would not survive.  By 1980 there was a <Col N="1379" /> reduction by one-third in the 1970 figure. Today, when the farming population has shrunk to a catastrophically low and unacceptable level, one-third of farmers still have no prospects of survival, one-third have an uncertain future and one-third are secure.  It is the farmers with no prospect of survival and those with an uncertain future about whom I am concerned. Without the Land Commission or an up-dated land authority to take their place there is no hope for those farmers.</P>
    <P>Forty years ago there were 575,000 farmers farming 11 million acres and there are now about 65,000 farmers, with a reasonable prospect of survival, farming about four million acres to good effect, whereas there should be 200,000 farmers farming 11 million acres to good effect.  Our national farm base continues to shrink at an unabated rate.  To reduce the numbers in farming is certainly not the answer.  The startling aspect of this statistical review is not so much what has happened but that it is still happening and is set to continue at an unabated pace unless very active and immediate steps are taken, first, to slow down the epic tide and then to hopefully reverse it to as healthy a level as the Constitution envisages.</P>
    <P>In reply to a question put down in this House to the Minister for Agriculture and Food on Wednesday, 26 April asking him to give an up-to-date list of estates that are to be divided in the year 1989-90 in the counties of Cavan and Monaghan, the reason for the long delay in the division of such estates and if he would made a statement on the matter, he indicated that over 1,000 acres in counties Cavan and Monaghan have still to be divided.  I would like to know how this land will be divided.  The Minister stated in his speech on Second Stage of this Bill:</P>
    <P>I should like to make clear that the enactment of this Bill will not affect the continuation of certain work and functions of the Commission.  These are the disposal of land on hands; the revesting in the names of the new owners of land already allotted and land yet to be allotted; the exercise of statutory control over the sub-division <Col N="1380" /> of farms and over the purchase of land by non-qualified persons, mainly, companies and non-EC nationals; the promotion of group purchase and leasing of land as well as provision of assistance for schemes for rearrangement and commonage division, miscellaneous statutory and other obligations, such as the collection of annuities, custody of title documents and the management of lands awaiting disposal.</P>
    <P>How can this continue if these people are to be made redundant and if there is no mechanism in place to continue the work they started?</P>
    <P>This morning I listened to the spokesperson for the ICMSA &mdash; an organisation who have their ear close to the ground and I compliment them &mdash; Dan McCarthy, coming out very strongly against what is happening in the House today.  I believe that over the weekend there will be a storm blowing in this country as a result of what we are about to do.  Perhaps before we dissolve the Land Commission we should step back and take a look at the necessity of putting into place an organisation that can look after the welfare of the small farmers.  When I am talking about small farmers I am not harping on people with 15, 25 or 30 acres. About 25 years ago 30 acres could have been seen to be a viable holding, but that is not the case today, but it is still possible to have a viable holding on 50 acres of Cavan land.  I am not talking about the midlands or the south where I am sure you would need fewer acres because the land is much better.  Because of the thriftiness and the ability of Cavan-Monaghan farmers to roll up their sleeves and do a day's work, they can still survive.</P>

      <P>We are coming back, watch out for us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those people can still survive on 40 acres.  I visited a 40 acre holding last week where there are 25 cows and the quota is 52,000 gallons.  You will not read about these people in the papers, but they have set a very high standard.  These two brothers are doing an excellent job on that farm and earn an excellent livelihood.  I <Col N="1381" /> know their figures are way above the average, and I am sure there are big inputs, but a very high standard has been achieved.  The income from such a farm would keep a husband, wife and young family and they would have no fear of the future.  That is not possible in many cases because of the quota restriction and the availability of the quota to small farmers. That is another area that may not be totally relevant to this Bill but it is part and parcel of the whole scene.  Two months ago a quota of 45,000 gallons of milk was transferred from the north-east to the Minister's end of the country for £110,000 cash.  I was at an EC committee meeting yesterday and I asked officials if this was possible and they said it was.  It can be done with in the regulations, and it has happened.</P>
    <P>The Land Commission are being abolished, the farm advisory service has been reduced and milk quotas are being transferred to the south, with the result that the whole north-eastern region will become totally depopulated.  That is not good for the country, and it is certainly not good for that region.  For that reason alone I am asking the Minister, in the name of humanity and fair play, to set up a land authority to give them further powers and to let them get involved in the whole business of land and milk quotas. That is the type of organisation that is needed as we approach 1992.  Perhaps the whole issue of the internal market has been blown out of all proportions and after 1992 people will probably wonder what it was all about.  Certainly barriers will be lowered but if people from European countries come here and buy land that would be serious and we would need some mechanism to protect our people.</P>
    <P>Under the present policy of afforestation, good agricultural land is being bought up and planted.  Years ago the policy in the Department of Forestry was that non-arable land, land far removed from main roads, would be planted.  What is happening now?  It is costing too much to make roadways into these backward places, as the people in the forestry business will confirm, and it is much handier and cheaper to plant trees along the main roads, but that was not the original intention. It was not intended to plant good <Col N="1382" /> land that was convenient to roadways and to services but rather to plant the backward, mountainous areas and marshland. I would certainly support the planting of that type of land but I would not agree with people competing with small farmers for much needed acreage. Seven, ten or 15 acres can make a great difference if one is under pressure.</P>
    <P>I have a high regard for the Minister who was quite factual at the RDS yesterday when he told people what sort of job they were doing.  That is what we want, not humbug.  If people are told the truth, they will produce results.  I appeal to the Minister to go back to his Cabinet and tell them that they have to put something in place of the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>Some of the Minister's own backbenchers were reluctant to come in and support the Bill.  Unfortunately, I was out of the House so I did not hear their contributions, but I have a high regard for the people who I know have contributed, and I have no doubt that their contributions were in line with what I am saying.  We need a system to protect the people with regard to the restructuring of land.</P>
    <P>I referred to over 1,000 acres in Cavan-Monaghan, but that is not the whole story.  A lot more land is involved when one starts reorganising and swapping the land about.  Ten or 15 years ago, it was difficult to get a farmer to agree to swap with a neighbour a field which he had inherited because the field was more convenient to the neighbour.  That mood has changed now and because of disease control and so on, people realise that it is important to have their holdings in one unit.  In dividing 1,000 acres I am sure another 1,000 acres would come on stream in swaps and reorganisation generally.</P>
    <P>I hope I got the message across.  I am speaking on behalf of the farmers of Cavan-Monaghan and on behalf of the 12 western counties.  Some foreigners and others seem to have the cheque books to buy on the open market, and good luck to them.  We are not in that position but we are improving.  However, we still need the structures to help us to continue the job.  I would not say that outsiders are not welcome; of course they are; but the <Col N="1383" /> people on the ground are entitled to the first refusal.  They will not get that opportunity unless we put a mechanism in place to replace the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>Now that the Minister of State, Deputy Kirk has come in, I appeal to him to take on board this problem, although the problem would not be as acute in Louth, where we tend to think that the farms are bigger and the land is better although it is not that far from the Monaghan border.  I hope that when this Bill comes back before the House it will encompass our proposals. We would admire the Minister for doing that.  We have supported the Government in the past by pointing out where they have gone wrong.  The Minister should take on board the propositions I have made and the figures I have quoted from <i>The Application of EEC Funding to Rural Development in Ireland</i> a booklet well worth reading.  There is aid and goodwill available from the EC for rural development in Ireland.  The EC are concerned to protect the small farmer.  The funding is available but we must fight our corner to get it.</P>

      <P>Coming from the west of Ireland, and representing a segment of the people there, it is appropriate that somebody should refer to the fact that the land question has for 700 years been part of what we are.  Michael Davitt would turn in his grave if he knew that the Government were about to abolish the Land Commission.  We need a land settlement policy.  It is preposterous that the Government should propose to abolish the Land Commission without replacing it with another body.  The history of the Land Commission is a social study of the development of Irish people.  The Minister understands that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Land Commission inspectors were a peculiar breed.  When faced with public representatives making representations in relation to portions of land, the Land Commission official would be very noncommittal, in case there might be a perception that a certain person would get a certain portion of land.  Over the years, we were blessed with many Ministers for Lands, some of whom have gone to their eternal reward.  As I grew up, I often <Col N="1384" /> heard stories from Fianna Fáil Cumann meetings.  Most of that period was Fianna Fáil dominated and at these meetings individual Ministers for Lands divided estates between members and he might forget about the Comhairle Ceanntar chairman who, at the end of the night, might say &ldquo;You have not given me anything at all&rdquo; and the whole lot would be scrubbed, they would start all over again and work out a new land division before ever a Land Commission inspector came near the place.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Many a quietly supportive farmer went home happy in the knowledge that he had secured 50 acres from the Minister's visit and 50 years on, his grandchildren are still waiting for it to arrive, but it never did.  Those days are gone and the Government obviously intend to nail them completely.</P>
      <P>In dealing with small farmers, the division of estates was very important.  It created a lot of bitterness and division but it also created unity among those who were going to get portions of the land. TDs at party meetings were faced with irate people who wanted to know how the other fellow could get the land, and the argument changed when a different Government came into office.  This always was and always will be part of what we are.  I regret the Minister's proposal to abolish the Land Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When Land Commission officials were moved into the land tax area they disseminated a whole new range of information and knowledge.  Farmers who might have had the use of a grandmother's estate or an uncle's estate might not be very forthcoming in having that declared.  It was a fact of life, certainly up until a number of years ago, that a great deal of land was not vested in the names of those who had the beneficial use of it.  The Minister for Social Welfare's investigations brought a certain amount of this to light.  It is fair to say that while a farmer may have the use of 20 to 25 acres of land through family connections or legacies from America, far more land <Col N="1385" /> could be made available.  The Minister understands what I am talking about.</P>
    <P>When there were attempts to transfer former Land Commission officials from land tax to their own area there was a total collapse in the system and Land Commission officials were at work but had nothing to do because there was no land to divide and their role was very unclear.  Those officials who had dealt with farmers down through the years were not accepted too kindly into tax collection.</P>
    <P>This is a far more serious problem than some people would have us believe because many of the bigger companies and corporations with surplus funds and profits are now investing in land acquisition. Resource companies who are acquiring property all over the country are being set up on a fairly regular basis. That is in fact a trend not only towards national landlordism, which is happening in some counties, but towards international landlordism.  It is only right and proper, fair and feasible that there should be some restraint on the trend whereby significant quantities of this country's soil is being bought and held in hands of multinational companies, foreigners or other EC nationals.  On the Continent they do not have the opportunity nor, in some cases, the right to ownership because of the cost or structure of the acquisition of land, but they always like to say that they have a place they can call their own.  Continentals, French and Germans in particular, have a very great tendency to want to acquire a place of their own.  Right along the west coast, from Donegal to west Kerry, significant numbers of foreigners have acquired land in the past decade.  This is a serious trend and we, as Irish people, have to ask ourselves whether we want to sell our country, lock, stock and barrel to these people, though under EC law they have the right to purchase land here. However, I think it is only fair that there should be a method of restraining this trend.</P>
    <P>There has been significant development in forestry plantations.  In my own county a significant number of individual householders have had vast areas of plantations put right up to their front doors <Col N="1386" /> while 3,000 to 10,000 hectare plantations start at the edge of rural communities. This destroys the whole fabric and character of an area.  I know that forestry is important, but there has to be a land use policy.  Some countries, on an acreage basis have ensured that every single acre is zoned for a particular purpose.  There is indiscriminate development in many areas in our country.  That is regrettable. It is important that a specific land policy be brought about whereby land that comes on the market or that is available for transfer should come within a Government backed co-ordinated land policy.  If the Government of the day wish to have a land policy they must be prepared to pay for it.  It appears to me that the Government are not prepared to make the resources available to implement a land policy or a decent reusage or settlement process.  It is only when the water in the tap runs dry that people appreciate the value of it.  It would be regrettable if, in ten years time, we would have left our decreasing farming community in a position where they would be unable to acquire land either because of the price of it or because it would be snapped up immediately on an open market by international companies or by foreign individuals with plenty of money to spend.</P>
    <P>I want to address my remarks on commonage to the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food Deputy Kirk.  There are different kinds of commonages and the division of some of this has caused problems for the tenants or shareholders.  The law states that where a majority require division it can be done through the courts, but often there are objections because a minority group or an individual tenant holder might have much greater use of the commonage than other shareholders.  The use of commonage lends itself to the spread of bovine TB and I remember raising this issue with Mr. Gibbons when he was Minister for Agriculture.  This question needs to be looked at seriously. However, there are particular types of commonage that cannot be divided because of an interest by the wildlife section of the Department of Forestry.  I will send the Minister information on <Col N="1387" /> some of these commonages.  There is an EC directive by which funds can be made available for commonage areas that are unique and that are part of our distinct heritage in terms of flora, fauna, botany and all of that.  There is a number of such commonages in the west and they have caused a great deal of controversy.  The Minister might deal with the directive and sort out some of the problems of funding.  If the Government wish to have a land settlement process and land re-use proposals, they must be prepared to pay but it appears that this Government are not prepared to put up the resources to provide a structured and ordered land policy.</P>
    <P>As I have said, there is a trend towards international landlordism.  Many of the spectacular scenic areas of the west have been purchased by people from abroad. While there is no legal restriction on them, I think it would be a shame that such areas could no longer be in common usage, as it were.  Archbishop Cassidy used to operate a system whereby the produce of diocesan land was used to assist Third World countries.  There is a strong moral argument that we, who have had our own difficulties for hundreds of years, should not allow land to lie fallow when it has an inherent capacity to produce food that could assist those who do not have enough food to live, thereby saving a great number of lives.</P>
    <P>As I said, forestry development has become a very significant factor in land use.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The Land Commission officials would always talk to farmers about the bit of commonage when they were proposing to give them additional <Col N="1388" /> land.  Land Commission officials dealt with land that was either given to the Department of Forestry or sold to them by individual farmers so I think it is somewhat relevant, although your interpretation, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle might be more accurate than mine.  The history of the development of land is unique and has caused a great deal of strife.  The essential point is that there should be a restraining force in regard to the sale of land in this country.  In his speech the Minister went into the background behind the introduction of this Bill.  He said the Bill is designed to bring about the dissolution of the Land Commission, the revocation of the power of the State to take over land, except by exchange for land settlement purposes, and the transfer to the President of the High Court of the jurisdictions vested in the Office of the Judicial Commissioner and the Appeals Tribunal.  Were the existing land commissioners consulted about this matter?  Were they asked for their views and any poposals they may have?  Were they asked how they would see land policy developing in the years ahead?</P>

      <P>Ar an gcéad dul síos ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghlacadh leis an gCeann Comhairle agus leis an Leas-Cheann Comhairle as ucht an seans a thug siad dom cás Ghairmscoil Cholmcille ar an gCnoc, Indreabhán, Co. na Gaillimhe, a thógáil suas ar an Adjournment. Rinne mé ceithre nó cuig iarracht an t-ábhar seo a thógáil suas, agus is é an fáth ar lean mé leis ná an phráinn atá ag baint leis an scéal.  Roimhe sin chuir mé trí cheist sa Dáil ar an Aire Oideachais faoi chás na scoile le dhá bhliain anuas, agus tá súil agam nach mbeidh sé ag teastáil ceist eile a chur síos taobh istigh den tseachtain seo chugainn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>De réir na bhfiosruithe is déanaí atá déanta agam ó fuair mé na céadta litreacha ó thuismitheoirí na bpáistí atá ag <Col N="1389" /> freastal ar Ghairmscoil Cholmcille in Indreabhán agus na múinteoirí den chéad scoth atá ag teagasc ann, is é an chaoi ina bhfuil an scéal faoi láthair ná go bhfuil olean beag don scoil réitithe ag ailtire na Roinne agus go nglactar leis go mba cheart tús áite a thabhairt do Ghairmscoil Cholmcille taobh istigh de na scéimeanna atá ullmhaithe do Chontae na Gaillimhe. Ní féidir leis an Roinn Oideachais a rá liom go soiléir an mbeidh airgead ceadaithe don scoil an bhliain seo nó an bhliain seo chugainn.  Anois, tá a fhios ag an Roinn Oideachais cé chomh práinneach is atá sé go ndéanfaí an obair fheabhsúcháin, seomraí breise agus áiseanna breise a chur ar fáil, toisc go bhfuil tuarascáil faighte acu ó na cigirí a thug cuairt ar an scoil agus a aontaíonn leis na tuismitheoirí agus leis an mbord bainistíochta go bhfuil na feabhsúcháin ag teastáil go géar.</P>
    <P>Is é an chaoi ina bhfuil cúrsaí faoi láthair ná go bhfuil sa scoil, scoil a tógadh i 1955 do chaoga a cúig dalta, 210 ndalta ar an rolla.  Ag an am ar tógadh an scoil bhí cúig rang teagaisc bhuana bunaithe, is é sin, permanent classrooms.  Faoi láthair tá cúrsaí go dona do na páistí agus do na múinteoirí, mar níl sa scoil ach trí leithreas chun freastal ar 100 cailín agus seachtar múinteoirí ban, agus trí leithreas chun freastal ar 100 buachaill agus ochtar múinteoirí fear.  Baintear úsáid as an leithreas mar sheomra na gcótaí chomh maith, agus níl aon seomra gléasta do bhuachaillí ná do chailíní.  As na seomraí ranga féin tá dhá cheann acu réamhdhéanta atá fós in úsaid, os cionn fiche bliain de aois.  Cé gur caitheadh £4,000 ar dheisiúchán práinneach, mar go raibh baol ann go dtitfeadh siad as a chéile ar fad, tá dhá sheomra ar iasacht faoi leith ó Údarás na Gaeltachta, rud a ndearna mé tagairt dó dhá sheachtain ó shin sa Teach seo nuair a bhíomar ag plé cúrsaí Údarás na Gaeltachta.  Níl na seomraí seo feiliúnach mar sheomraí ranga.  Níl aerú sna seomraí is mó acu agus níl a dhóthain de sholas lae sna seomraí.  Tá siad mífheiliúnach do theagasc nó do aon rud.</P>
    <P>Thar aon rud eile tá contúirt mhór i gceist do na páistí.  Caithfidh siad dul trasna phríomhbhóthar na Gaillimhe i gCois Fharraige seacht n-uaire nó níos mó in aghaidh an lae chun freastal ar <Col N="1390" /> ranganna taobh istigh de na seomraí sin. Tuigeann an tAire Stáit go rímhaith an stair atá ag baint leis an mbóthar céanna. Chaill páistí a mbeatha ar an mbóthar sin.  Tá sin ar eolas.  Tuigeann an tAire an chontúirt atá i gceist.  Chun tagairt a dhéanamh do na háiseanna atá ar fáil sna seomraí praiticiúla, is é sin, ina múintear na hábhair phraiticúla, tá siad as dáta. Fiú amháin, tá mé ag déanamh tagartha go dtí seo do na háiseanna bunúsacha atá tuillte mar cheart ag tuismitheoirí agus muintir na Gaeltachta, na bunriachtanais, dáiríre, chun teagasc a dhéanamh.</P>
    <P>Tá an suíomh ina bhfuil an scoil tógtha an-bheag.  Tá géarghá le leathnú ar an spás le go mbeadh seans chun caitheamh aimsire a chur ar aghaidh do na daltaí.  Is cosúil go bhfuil suim ar leith ag an Aire Stáit i gcaitheamh aimsire agus i spórt.  Is é an méid atá ar fáil don 200 scoláirí seo ag freastal ar scoil dara leibhéal lánGhaelach sa Ghaeltacht ná cúirt chispheile amháin.  Chomh maith leis sin níl aon halla spóirt acu nó níl aon seomra tionóil, rud atá ar fáil sa chuid is mó de na scoileanna ar an leibhéal céanna.  Níl aon seomra bia ag na scoláirí, agus, mar a dúirt mé, tá an scoil féin tógtha ar acra amháin talún agus an foirgneamh ag tógáil suas 75 faoin gcéad den spás sin. Níl aon seomra ar fáil do na múinteoirí sa scoil, rud ar dhírigh an TUI aire an Aire Oideachais air le fada.  Tá breis agus £100,000 á chaitheamh faoi láthair ar fhearaistí don fhoirgneamh nua, cé nach dtuigtear cathain a bheidh na foirgnimh nua ar fáil.  Is ait an rud é go bhfuil an t-airgead seo ar fáil, toisc, ag an am céanna, nach bhfuil an scéim bhunúsach don scoil ar fáil.</P>
    <P>Tá tábhacht ag baint leis an scoil seo thar an ngnáth.  Mar a dúirt mé, is í an scoil seo an seans atá ag na múinteoirí agus ag na tuismitheoirí, go háirithe muintir na háite, muintir áite inar tógadh agus inar mhair daoine mar Mháirtín Ó Cadhain, a bpáistí a chur go dtí scoil lán-Ghaelach. Má ligtear don scoil seo na háiseanna a ligean síos beidh brú ar na tuismitheoirí a bpáistí a aistriú go scoil dara leibhéal eile.  B'fhéidir an scoil, mar shampla, sa Spidéal.  Ní bheidh éinne cinnte go mbeidh oideachas trí Ghaeilge ar fáil mar atá sé ar fáil faoi láthair i Scoil Cholmcille ar an gCnoc in Indreabhán.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1391" /> Níl mise ach ag déanamh achainí amháin ar an Aire Stáit, agus is é sin, tá mé ag iarraidh air a rá leis na tuismitheoirí seo agus leis na múinteoirí go ligfear don scoil dul ar aghaidh go dtí an staid inar féidir na doiciméidhí ar fad atá críochnaithe anois dul go dtí an conraitheoir.  Is é sin, an scoil a ligean don &ldquo;contract stage&rdquo;, agus b'fhéidir dáta a thabhairt ar cathain a bheidh na foirgnimh nua ar fáil don bhliain seo nó an bhliain seo chugainn.</P>
    <P>Tá sé de nós ag Airí agus Airí Stáit, ar ndóigh, rud mar seo a rá: &ldquo;Ó, bhí seans ag an Rialtas a bhí ann rud éigin a dhéanamh. Tá muidne ag déanamh i bhfad níos mó,&rdquo; agus mar sin de.  Bíonn argóint i gcónaí idir an Aire Stáit agus mé féin faoi chúrsaí mar sin.  Ag an bpointe seo ba mhaith liom rud amháin a dhéanamh ríshoiléir, agus is é seo: bhí cruinniú poiblí i gColáiste Lurgan in Indreabhán.  Bhí mé féin ann ag éisteacht leis na tuismitheoirí. Is éard atá ag teastáil uathu ná a mbunchearta i gcúrsaí oideachais.  Tá siad dílis don teanga.  Tá siad dílis don áit.  Tá siad dílis don dúchas atá ag baint leis an áit.  Teastaíonn uathu go mbeadh na cearta céanna ar fáil acusan is atá ar fáil in aon chuid eile den tír, agus mura ndéantar rud fiúntach beidh an scoil seo agus an córas oideachais faoin gcúrsa gairmscolaíochta i mbaol.  An rud atá ag teastáil anois ná dóchas a thabhairt do na tuismitheoirí agus freagra a thabhairt do na ceisteanna atá fágtha.</P>
    <P>I emphasise that this school built for 55 pupils, and that now has an enrolment of 210 pupils, has facilities of a very basic kind that cannot be accepted as tolerable for pupils or teachers.  When the students cross the road to the two leased factory buildings, putting their lives in danger several times a day, it is a reminder to us all that if even one child is injured or killed &mdash; something I hope will never happen &mdash; we would ask ourselves why it was necessary for them to do so.  I would like, in resolving the issue of the new building, to know if a definite date can be given for its completion.  Will it be this year or next year?  When will all stages be completed?  The situation is very bad.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister of State when he will allow this project to get to the stage <Col N="1392" /> where the contract documents can be sent to contract.</P>
    <P>Tá cúpla rudaí atá tábachtach le lua, b'fhéidir, agus is é seo, ag an cruinniú poiblí bhí daoine ag iarraidh an bhféadfaí airgead a fháil Ó Chomhphobal na hEorpa nó ó fhoinsí airgid eile ar nós an chrannchuir náisiúnta, an crannchur bocht atá mar bhunús do gach caiteachas na laethanta seo.  Níl aon chiall ag baint le seift den sórt seo.  Tuigim go maith gur imigh sa tuismitheoirí go clinic an Aire Stáit agus gur léirigh siad an chaoi in a bhfuil cúrsaí faoi láthair.  Iarraim air a bheith báúil le cás Gairmscoil Cholmcille.</P>
    <P>Is iontach an rud é &mdash; nuair atá mé ag féachaint anois tá siad os mo chomhair &mdash; na litreacha a fuair mé ón Spidéal, ó Indreabhán, Baile an Domhnalláin, An Cloch Mhór, Ros a'Mhíl, Bearna agus go leor áiteacha eile.  Léiríonn na litreacha sin agus na seolta atá ag baint leo na paróistí atá i gceist.  Tá na tuismitheoirí taobh istigh de na paróistí sin ag déanamh iarracht leanúint ar aghaidh le scolaíocht a chur ar fháil trí mheán na Gaeilge dá bpáistí.</P>
    <P>Murar féidir leis an Aire Stáit freagra a thabhairt do na tuismitheoirí sin beidh sé deacair glacadh leis go bhfuil éinne i ndáirire faoin Ghaeilge nó faoi na Gaeltachtaí féin.  Tá deacrachtaí uafásacha ann ach glacann gach duine atá i ndáiríre faoi athbheochan na Gaeilge nó faoi slánú na Gaeilge nó an Ghaeltacht go gcaithfear a dhéanamh slán an rud atá tábhachtach, na bunpharóistí ina labhraítear an Ghaeilge mar ghnáth-theanga. Sin an fáth.  Ní pointe polaitíochta atá i gceist agam, beag nó mór.  An rud atá ag teastáil anois ná go seasfadh an tAire suas agus go ndéarfadh sé liomsa, &ldquo;Tá mo aigne déanta suas agam, táim chun ligean don scoil dul ar aghaidh&rdquo;.  Mar a luaigh mé tá an plean feabhsúcháin réitithe agus glachta leis istigh sa Roinn féin.  Glactar leis go bhfuil an clár ann.</P>
    <P>An t-aon rud atá ag teastáil anois ná focal simplí ón Aire Stáit is an Roinn, go bhfuil sé ar intinn aige an scoil agus na scéimeanna is na pleananna a ligean ar aghaidh go dtí an chéim inar féidir le conraitheoir tosú ar an obair.  Tá súil agam go ndéanfaidh sé sin, agus má deir sé sin beidh a lán daoine buíoch de, mé <Col N="1393" /> féin san áireamh.  Tá an cás déanta agam, cás simplí, cás práinneach, agus sin an fáth go ndearna mé an méid iarrachtaí agus a rinne mé é trí Cheisteanna Dála a thógáil suas agus go bhfuil mé buíoch gur lig an Ceann Comhairle agus an Leas-Cheann Comhairle seans dom é a thógáil suas an tráthnóna seo ar an Adjournment.</P>

Tá sé go han-dona.  Na blianta ó shin ba chóir go mbeadh foirgneamh nua curtha ar fáil don scoil.  Ach is é an deacracht atá agamsa ag an am seo ná, cé go bhfuil na pleananna réidh agus an phleanáil críochnaithe, mar a dúirt an Teachta, níl mise ná an Roinn in ann na tairiscintí a thabhairt isteach.  An deacracht atá againn ná nach bhfuil an t-airgead againn.</P>
      <P>Tá fonn ormsa dul ar aghaidh leis an scoil seo, ach tá a lán scoileanna ag an stáid a bhfuil an scoil seo ag an am seo, agus is é an t-airgead an deacracht atá againn.  Níl a dhóthain airgid againn chun na scoileanna seo a chur amach go dtí na tógálaithe, mar a déarfá, agus níl mé in ann a rá ag an am seo cén uair a bheimid in ann na tairiscintí a thabhairt isteach. Mar a dúirt mé aontaím leis an Teachta faoin stáid ina bhfuil an scoil seo.  Tá sé go han-dona.  Níl na seomraí ranga cearta ann.  Níl na seomraí do na hábhair teicneolaíochta agus mar sin curtha ar fáil sa scoil.  Mar a dúirt an Teachta, tá cúpla rang trasna an bhóthair i monarcha Údarás na Gaeltachta, agus níl sé sin ceart ar chor ar bith, go mbeadh ar na daltaí dul trasna an bhóthair seo, agus aontaím leis go bhfuil sé dainséarach. Mar sin, tá an cás go han-láidir agus tá fonn ormsa dul ar aghaidh leis an jab seo chomh luath agus is féidir liom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree completely with the Deputy in the case he has made in regard to this school.  Since I was appointed Minister of State at the Department of Education I took an interest in the school and I agree <Col N="1394" /> that it is in a deplorable condition.  For example, there are only three toilets for more than 100 boys and eight male teachers, and three toilets for more than 100 girls and only 24 coat hangers in that toilet accommodation for those girls.  Many of the classrooms are totally inadequate, not least those which are across the road from the school.  I agree with the Deputy that it is unsatisfactory to have children crossing that dangerous road to classrooms.</P>
    <P>The facilities in all the technical subject rooms are obsolete.  I accept that many of the science subjects are taught in general subject rooms.  Physics and chemistry are taught in classrooms that do not have any facility for practical work.  French is being taught in the metalwork room.  In general, the accommodation in this school is grossly inadequate.  We have reached tender stage but while I am anxious to accede to the Deputy's request to put the project out to tender it is not possible for me to do so or to say when we will be able to take the next step.</P>

It is unfortunate that I must remind the House of the inactivity of the previous Government in their four-and-a-half years in office.  I was left with an almost impossible task in regard to vocational schools in County Galway.  Deputy Higgins and I have attended several meetings <Col N="1395" /> in vocational schools in Galway and have heard very reasonable cases made by parents.  There is no doubt that the very bad accommodation in those prefabs must be improved.</P>

      <P>I have heard the Deputy say that other schools were his priority. One school is as bad as another.  Without wishing to score a political point in regard to this, I must point out that between 1982 and 1987 only one vocational school project came out of the Department of Education for County Galway, the project for Loughrea vocational school.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>It was.  I was concerned about this when I took office and I was presented with a report on the state of school buildings in County Galway dated 14 April 1987 which indicated that schools in Indreabhán, New Inn, Athenry, Portumna, Ballinasloe, Gort and Tuam were in a deplorable condition. We have made some progress, though not as much as I would like, in that we have proceeded with New Inn and there are developments in regard to Gort and Portumna.  Indeed, there have been developments in the planning stage in regard to Athenry.  It is because there was no progress in the county for five <Col N="1396" /> years that I am left to deal with a major build-up.</P>
      <P>I find it difficult to accept that because the position is different in other counties. They must have had seven or eight new vocational colleges or schools erected in County Cork during that time.  I accept that Deputy Higgins has not been political about this issue but I cannot help wondering what was happening in County Galway during the period of office of the National Coalition.  It appears there was no pressure of any consequence put on the Department of Education to improve the accommodation in the Galway schools.</P>
      <P>I should like to assure the Deputy that we will make progress with Indreabhán and the other schools.  He attended a meeting during the election campaign in Gort and saw for himself the deplorable condition of that school.  The school in Portumna is in a bad condition in that the prefab accommodation is falling down. The other schools are in a similar condition. I should like to assure the Deputy, and the parents of the children, that Indreabhán has a high priority with the Department.  We are most anxious to proceed with the project and we accept that it must be dealt with as a matter of urgency.  I should like to assure the Deputy that it will have my full attention and I will do everything possible to proceed with the project soon.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.30 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 9 May 1989.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Marine if he has satisfied himself that the Sealink owned <i>Earl Harold</i> ferry chartered by B &amp; I, fulfils all safety regulations; and the steps he has taken to ensure that all ferries serving Irish ports are of the highest safety standards.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Minister for the Marine (Mr. Daly) Minister for the Marine (Mr. Daly)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Daly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4, 17 and 26 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The foreign registered passenger ferry <i>Earl Harold</i> has been chartered from Sealink by the B &amp; I Line to serve <Col N="1342" /> summer traffic on the Rosslare to Pembroke route.  The vessel recently underwent her scheduled annual overhaul and has been surveyed in the United Kingdom in order to ensure compliance with the 1974 International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea.  The United Kingdom Department of Transport subsequently issued a Passenger Safety Certificate in respect of the vessel detailing her compliance with the relevant international requirements.</P>
    <P>The <i>Earl Harold</i> was inspected under Port State Control arrangements by marine surveyors from my Department on her arrival in Rosslare on 10 April 1989.  The vessel was further inspected by my survey staff on 11 and 21 April and they are satisfied that the vessel complies fully with all applicable Irish, UK and international safety, pollution prevention and other standards.  Sealink passenger ferries are inspected every six months also under Port State Control arrangements by my Department's surveyors. The Memorandum of Understanding on Port State Control is an agreement between the maritime authorities of 14 European countries aimed at ensuring that ships comply with international safety, pollution prevention and other standards.  All deficiencies found during inspection are reported to the Port State Control Computer Centre at Saint-Malo, France.  In addition, vessels may be detained to rectify deficiencies, allowed to proceed to the next port where the deficiencies must be rectified or given 14 days to rectify the deficiencies, depending on their gravity.  Under the Port State Control Memorandum, each member state undertakes to achieve an annual total of inspections corresponding to 25 per cent of the estimated number of individual foreign merchant ships, as distinct from ship's movements, which entered its ports during a 12 month period.  During 1988, 246 foreign registered vessels were inspected while in Irish ports.  Twenty-six of these were detained by my surveyors until deficiencies identified during the inspection had been rectified.</P>
    <P>Three passenger ferries are registered <Col N="1343" /> in the State and under existing legislation these are subjected to an annual survey by my Department's marine surveyors for the renewal of their passenger and safety certificates.  These certificates which detail crew requirements and the number of passengers permitted to be carried, are only issued when the vessels are considered to be in a seaworthy condition. The operators of these Irish-registered passenger ferries are also represented on the National Ferry Safety Committee, which was established in October 1987.  The committee, which is chaired by my Department's Chief Surveyor, reviews safety procedures and standards on board Irish-registered ferries, considers any measures necessary to improve safety and makes recommendations, as appropriate, to the ferry operators and to myself.</P>
    <P>All vessels registered in the State and foreign registered ships when in an Irish port or territorial waters must comply with the provisions of the International Maritime Organisations Safety of Life at Sea Convention, 1974.  A set of 21 statutory instruments was executed in 1983 in order to give legal effect to the convention while a further set of 12 instruments giving effect to the First Amendments to the Convention was executed in 1985.  The rules concern such matters as life-saving applicances, stability, navigational facilities, fire protection, construction, surveys, radio installations.  Stability requirements are set out in the 1983 and 1985 Passenger Ship Construction Rules which apply the standards provided for in the 1974 Safety of Life at Sea Convention.  The convention does not apply certain stability requirements to ships built before 1 September 1984.  The United Kingdom authorities have now sought to ensure that all its passenger ferries, irrespective of age, comply with the stability standards laid down in respect of ships built after 1 September 1984 and for this reason UK shipowners, including Sealink, were asked to carry out detailed stability calculations on all their passenger ferries. <Col N="1344" /> Ships which on the basis of these calculations do not comply with the stability requirements for newer ships will, it is intended, be phased out or modified.</P>
    <P>The UK initiative in so far as stability requirements are concerned has not been adopted to date by the International Maritime Organisation, which is the United Nations agency responsible for safety of life at sea and therefore is not a requirement internationally.  My surveyors will continue, therefore, to survey vessels in respect of compliance with the stability requirements of the 1974 Safety of Life at Sea Convention, which are the highest standard in force internationally.</P>
    <P>There is no evidence to suggest that passenger ships built before September, 1984 would not comply with the stability requirements relating to newer ships. Indeed the <i>Herald of Free Enterprise</i> which sank in March, 1987 did comply with these requirements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Marine the plans the Government have for the promotion of the fish processing industry, especially with a view to taking full advantage of any opportunities which might arise from the completion of the internal market after 1992; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Minister for the Marine (Mr. Daly) Minister for the Marine (Mr. Daly)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Daly)</NameTxt>
      <P>The increasingly competitive market environment as we approach the 1992 deadline for the completion of the single EC market and related measures such as more stringent Community health and hygiene requirements will impact significantly on the fish processing sector.</P>
      <P>These are among the principal reasons why the Government have adopted comprehensive plans for the development of the processing sector including the implementation of detailed measures to ensure the highest quality levels.</P>
      <P>These plans are set out in the BIM document &ldquo;Charting a New Course ... Development Strategy for the Seafish Industry&rdquo;.  I have arranged that a copy be forwarded to the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1345" /> The strategy envisages a wide range of actions on marketing and processing. These include the following:</P>
    <P>&mdash;the initiation of a new quality assurance programme to link in with the proposed new Fish Marketing Bill and EC Health and Hygiene Regulations.</P>
    <P>&mdash;the channeling of marketing assistance through strategic product groups and building of strong export companies that can succeed in the more competitive environment arising from the Single European Market.</P>
    <P>&mdash;the undertaking of market research and product development to identify and exploit those product/market segments where the Irish industry has a comparative advantage.</P>
    <P>&mdash;an expanded programme of seafood promotion at home and abroad.</P>
    <P>&mdash;a stronger overseas marketing presence with specialist BIM staff and back-up from CTT and Embassy Network.</P>
    <P>&mdash;improved domestic distribution of fish through selective assistance under BIM's grant scheme.</P>
    <P>&mdash;the implementation of an expanded programme of sustained exploratory fishing for whitefish and other under-utilised species.</P>
    <P>&mdash;the encouragement of investment in whitefish processing facilities in line with improved raw material supply as well as added-value processing of farmed fish and shellfish.</P>
    <P>&mdash;supporting projects that demonstrate strengths in marketing and raw material access.</P>
    <P>&mdash;the encouragement of greater concentration and scaling up of firms in the sector, and,</P>
    <P>&mdash;improved quality and hygiene standards through implementation of licensing programme.</P>
    <P>The development of the fish processing sector forms an important part of the National Development Plan.  Assistance <Col N="1346" /> for fish processing will fall under the scope of Council Regulation (EEC) No. 355/77.  The total investment envisaged in fish processing projects over the Plan period is £45 million and the assistance sought amounts to some £20 million.</P>
    <P>The Commission have recently circulated the draft of a new proposed Regulation to follow on from No. 355/77.  This will be progressed though the Council over the remainder of the year.  The adoption of this proposal should enhance the volume of funds available for Ireland in the development of the fish processing sector.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Daly)</NameTxt>
      <P>While Kinsale is not a major fisheries centre in national terms fishing does, of course, play an important role in the economic development of the area.</P>
      <P>In 1987 Kinsale ranked in 26th place in the list of top ports for fish landings with a total value of the order of £0.5 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The State has been supportive of any proposals which have been put forward for the region.  In particular, BIM have <Col N="1347" /> recently approved capital grants for projects which, when implemented should improve the infrastructure in the area of fresh fish handling, processing and distribution. Pilot aquaculture projects have also been approved for State aid.</P>
    <P>BIM have planned to double the capacity of the ice plant at Kinsale in 1989, at an estimated cost of £55,000.</P>
    <P>The fishing industry in Kinsale will, of course, gain from the implementation of the BIM Development Strategy for the Sea Fish Industry which is designed to maximise the contribution to the national economy of this industry and, in particular, its contribution to the economy of coastal areas.</P>
    <P>Any viable proposals which may be put forward will, of course, be fully examined in the implementation of the Development Strategy.</P>
    <P>Fishing needs will be taken account of in the assessment of any commercial development plans for the port.</P>

Expenditure will be concentrated particularly on Dublin, Rosslare, Waterford and Cork ports and will involve the following elements: provision of appropriate berthing facilities; investment in improved facilities, including bulk cranes, lift-on/lift-off equipment and terminal buildings. The estimated total cost of the proposed investments in commercial ports under the aegis of my Department between now and 1993 will be about £59 million.  This level of investment will ensure that the commercial ports are developed on a basis which will maximise their contribution to the integrated <Col N="1350" /> development of the economy and the provision of essential transport support services for industry.</P>
    <P>The Shannon Estuary Development Corporation Bill which is at present before the House is indicative of my view that the remit of commercial harbours should extend to marine-related tourist, recreation and amenity facilities where opportunity for such facilities exists and where these facilities would not be incompatible with the principal function of the harbour which is to provide a safe, cost effective and efficient service to exporters and importers.</P>
    <P>The Exchequer provision for commercial harbours this year is £429,000.  It is proposed to direct the bulk of this money to quay reconstruction works at Drogheda Harbour.  The Exchequer provision for fishery harbours this year amounts to £3.1 million.  This money is mainly earmarked for development works at Rossaveel, Killybegs and Dingle.  The amounts of money to be spent on each of the harbours mentioned above will be determined by the amount of work which is carried out during the year.  As the Deputy is aware, progress on harbour development is subject to a number of conditions including climate.</P>
    <P>Expenditure by the commercial harbours from their own resources is a matter for the harbour authorities. Should the Deputy wish to obtain information on particular harbours I will ask the harbour authorities to supply more detailed information to him.</P>

    <P>(b)  The harbours at 1 to 16 above are commercial harbours i.e. harbours scheduled to the Harbours Acts, 1946 to 1976 and under the aegis of my Department.  There are also scheduled harbours at Annagassan (Co. Louth), Ballyshannon, Baltimore, Bantry Bay, Buncrana, Dingle, River Moy (Ballina, Co. Mayo), Westport and Wexford and Wexford but there is little commercial traffic at these ports at present.</P>
    <P>(c)  Other important ports which also cater for commercial traffic are Rosslare which is managed and operated by Iarnrod Éireann and Greenore and Arklow Jetty which are privately owned.</P>

      <P>On 26 April 1989 I received a deputation from representatives of the Limekiln Farm Community Council concerning their request for funding for pedestrian overbridges across the Western Parkway Motorway in Tymon North Regional Park.  I informed the deputation that the cost of providing an overbridge, <Col N="1363" /> in a central location, would be accepted as a charge against State road grants for the Western Parkway Motorway.</P>
      <P>The local authority, Dublin County Council, have now been invited to submit, to my Department for approval, preliminary design proposals and details of the precise location of an overbridge.</P>

      <P>My Department issued a circular to local authorities on 20 February 1984 which drew their attention to the special need for a periodic inspection of elm trees on or adjoining public roads because of the swift spread of Dutch Elm disease.  A general circular setting out the powers and duties of road authorities regarding roadside trees and hedges, issued on 1 September 1988, indicated that priority should be given to the removal of dead trees, dying trees or trees with obviously extensive decay.</P>
