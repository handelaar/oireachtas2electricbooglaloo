    <Title>Dún Laoghaire Harbour Bill, 1989: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Minister for the Marine (Mr. Wilson) John P. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It gives me great pleasure as Minister for the Marine to move this Bill to have Dún Laoghaire harbour, a harbour noted for its commercial and leisure activities, placed under my control.  The purpose of the Bill is solely to transfer to me, as Minister for the Marine, those responsibilities currently enjoyed by the Commissioners of Public Works in relation to Dún Laoghaire harbour.</P>
      <P>The principal provisions of the Bill are to be found in the following sections. Section 2 provides for the transfer of all property, rights and liabilities of the Commissioners of Public Works in relation to the harbour.  Section 3 provides for the transfer of all the functions of the Commissioners of Public Works exercisable in respect of the harbour. Section 4 provides for the transfer of any administration and business performed by the Commissioners of Public Works in connection with any function transferred. Section 8 provides that all powers in relation to any charges exercised by the Commissioners of Public Works at the harbour will be exercised by me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The thinking behind the setting up of the Department of the Marine in relation to harbour development was to bring harbours under the one administrative and planning umbrella, whether commercial, fishery or recreational.  The fishery harbours of Dunmore and Howth are being transferred by means of an order under section 2 of the Fishery Harbour Centres Act, 1968.  It was hoped to effect the <Col N="2399" /> transfer of Dún Laoghaire harbour by a Transfer of Departmental Administration and Ministerial Functions Order under the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Act, 1939, but for legal reasons this was not possible.  The purpose of the legislation now being proposed in respect of the transfer of Dún Laoghaire harbour is purely technical and is intended solely to meet the Government's objective of effecting the transfer of functions in relation to the harbour from the Commissioners of Public Works to the Department of the Marine.</P>
    <P>This Bill in no way compromises the House's scope for either approving or rejecting proposals which the Government may bring forward at a future date following on my announcement that an interim harbour board for Dún Laoghaire is to be set up.  The setting up of any statutory body will require further legislation which will take some time and should not be allowed to hinder the immediate transfer of legal responsibilities provided for under the Bill.  I hope this short Bill will commend the support of the House, agus molaim an Bille don Teach.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a technical Bill which, in effect, transfers the property of Dún Laoghaire harbour from the Commissioners of Public Works to the Department of the Marine.  In addition, all the functions and any administration and business that is presently performed by the Commissioners of Public Works is also being transferred to the Department of the Marine.  Of course, the Department of the Marine are being empowered to continue any legal proceedings that are being taken and are empowered to carry on or complete any works that are at present being done by the Commissioners of Public Works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What advantage is this Dún Laoghaire Harbour Bill to Dún Laoghaire harbour or the Borough of Dún Laoghaire?  All it is is a transfer from one Department to another and I see no massive advantage to the harbour itself or to the borough as a result.  In fact, I would like to know <Col N="2400" /> what is the need for the transfer.  The Commissioners of Public Works have managed this harbour financially on a day-to-day footing and have incurred no expense to the State in recent times.  We are aware they do not have the finance for major development work, but they have not cost the State.  They also have the expertise in the management of public buildings and in managing and maintaining this harbour.  What additional or better equipment, knowledge or professional people are available within the Department of the Marine to do a better job in Dún Laoghaire harbour than the Office of Public Works have done for many a long year?</P>
    <P>The situation is not satisfactory.  It is very difficult to envisage any major transformation in Dún Laoghaire harbour as a result of this transfer from the Office of Public Works to the Department of the Marine.  The Minister has an onus to come into this House and tell us what the advantages are.  All we have heard this morning is an outline, section by section, of the Bill which is basically a legal, technical and bureaucratic procedure that is of no major development advantage to the area.</P>
    <P>Dún Laoghaire harbour is not going to progress or develop as it should until a harbour authority are established and properly put in place.  It would be far more useful for the Minister to be before this House this morning with a harbour authority Bill for Dún Laoghaire harbour rather than with a bit of technicial legislation. It is extremely important that the Minister comes to this House at a very early date with legislation to set up a harbour authority.  It is to be hoped when a harbour authority are established that the proper co-ordinated development of Dún Laoghaire harbour can be put in place, but that can be done only if the harbour authority are empowered to involve themselves in such work.</P>
    <P>Dún Laoghaire harbour is a unique national asset to Dún Laoghaire Borough and there is an onus on the Government to ensure that it is enhanced and developed as far as possible.  Development should take place which would not be detrimental to the environment.  Be it <Col N="2401" /> the attractive scenic environment of the area or the general historical, structural and architectural environment, it is important that it be maintained.  The leisure facilities there can be improved substantially. Some of the commercial operations there can be dramatically improved.  I speak in particular about the ferry terminal and ferry work in the future.  This Bill does nothing to enhance anything of that nature.</P>
    <P>Over the years quite a number of reports, plans and development proposals have been drafted in relation to the harbour and it is disappoining that all we get here this morning is technical legislation. In 1983 McCarthy &amp; Partners, Consultants, did a development proposal for Dún Laoghaire.  Very recently the former Minister for the Marine, Deputy Brendan Daly, commissioned a report of the planning review group which was published last year, and in general is quite a commendable report.  I hoped the Minister now would have been in a position to draft legislation along the lines proposed by this review group because many aspects of it are highly commendable.</P>
    <P>I warn the Minister that I would object strongly to any licence or any private development being allowed until a harbour authority is set up.  It is imperative that any development there will take place only in conjunction with and under a harbour authority.  I hope the Minister at this stage will not see fit to go ahead and give licences to any private group until he has established a harbour authority.</P>
    <P>I have reservations in relation to this Bill and I hope the Minister will give me an assurance that the harbour authority will be set up and that legislation brought into this House at an early date to establish a harbour authority.  The present situation is unsatisfactory.  Ample evidence and documentation have been around for a long time and the Minister and his Department should have acted upon them.  That has not been done.  Why are we going through a bureaucratic transfer with no teeth, no effect, no extended economic advantage, not to talk about development advantage?  My reservations about the Bill will persist until I get an assurance from the Minister <Col N="2402" /> that legislation will be introduced quickly to establish a harbour authority.  I am very aware of the concern in the Dún Laoghaire area in relation to the establishment of a harbour authority.</P>
    <P>My colleagues, Deputy Monica Barnes and Deputy Seán Barrett, have repeatedly brought to my attention the concern expressed by the people of Dún Laoghaire and further afield, about the haphazard actions that have been taken there particularly in recent times.  The Minister is in a position to correct it and there is an onus on him to ensure that this is resolved quickly.  What we have before us today resolves nothing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryOSullivan" hpid="Mr. G. O'Sullivan Mr. G. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>This obviously is a technical change and as such probably must be welcomed by the two Departments. However, I have reservations about it if that technical change does not improve the situation in Dún Laoghaire. The most important question is what effect the Bill will have on the residents of Dún Laoghaire and the people using Dún Laoghaire Port at present.  It is most important that a harbour authority or harbour board be set up there.  Legislation has been promised, we had a working party on harbour legislation and the restructuring of the harbour board was to be put in place by the previous Minister. I want to know when the Minister intends putting that legislation before the House.</P>
      <P>I presume, and the Minister may enlighten us, that Bill gives the Department of the Marine an opportunity to plan properly for Dún Laoghaire in terms of the commercial aspect, leisure and the passenger terminal.  The Department of the Marine can look into the future whereas the Commissioners of Public Works are not in a position to do so.  I presume that from now on the Department of the Marine will have a greater input into Dún Laoghaire harbour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have certain reservations because all we are getting in the Bill is a very brief outline of the techncial aspects which does nothing to allay fears people have in that area.  Without a harbour authority Dún Laoghaire could be in limbo.  The Minister should spell out when he intends putting in a full harbour authority comprised of local interest, people from the <Col N="2403" /> trade unions and fishing interest.  There is huge potential for expansion in Dún Laoghaire.  Its proximity to Dublin makes it ideal for commerce cum leisure and a revival of fishing.  I hope the Minister will look positively at that aspect.  In fairness, the Minister has grappled with the problems since he came to office and I hope he will have success with most of them. Perhaps he would give an indication to the House when he intends setting up a harbour authority in the Dún Laoghaire area.  I know he has said an interim authority would be set up, and I think that is good enough at this stage, but what is necessary is a convincing statement from the Minister that a harbour authority will be set up in Dún Laoghaire for the interests in Dún Laoghaire.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>First I welcome the opportunity that the presentation of this Bill gives for a debate on Dún Laoghaire harbour.  However, I am disappointed that the opportunity has not been used to introduce more comprehensive legislation. During a recent meeting with a deputation from Dún Laoghaire Borough Council we met with the Minister for the Marine and I asked him if he would not use this Bill to establish a Dún Laoghaire Harbour Authority and to introduce the necessary legislation.  He explained how difficult it is to get parliamentary time for the introduction of legislation and said that was the reason it was intended to establish an interim authority.  I can understand the difficulty getting parliamentary time and in getting legislation prepared.  However, I think it is a waste of parliamentary time for Dáil Éireann to spend an entire day dealing with a Bill which is purely technical, which simply transfers the responsibility for Dún Laoghaire harbour from one Government Department to another, particularly when that has already been done in practice and has been in place for over a year, and when we urgently need legislation to establish a harbour authority which would provide a legislative basis for the future development of Dún Laoghaire harbour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The very least I expected today was <Col N="2404" /> that the Minister would use the opportunity to announce the establishment of the interim harbour authority, to announce the members of it and the powers and functions of that interim authority.  I am very disappointed that he has not done so particularly since it is now six weeks since he promised the deputation from the Dún Laoghaire Borough Council that he would make that announcement within two weeks.  I ask the Minister &mdash; and I would like him to respond &mdash; what is the reason for the delay in announcing the interim harbour authority?  Has he changed his mind about it?  In response to a Dáil question last week he informed us that the powers of the interim harbour authority would be advisory but in the course of the meeting with the deputation, of which I was a member, he made it clear that the powers would be considerably more wide ranging.  The Minister's failure to announce the establishment of the interim harbour authority today seems to suggest that the Government are yet again backsliding on the establishment of a harbour authority for Dún Laoghaire.  I accept, and it is important to give credit where it is due, that since the Department of the Marine took responsibility for Dún Laoghaire harbour we have seen a considerable improvement in the way the harbour has been managed as opposed to the neglectful way it was managed previously.</P>
    <P>Dún Laoghaire is one of the finest man made resources in this country.  It has enormous potential for serving the recreational needs not only of the people of Dún Laoghaire but of the greater Dublin area as well.  It can be developed, for the creation of employment and it can enhance the environment of both Dún Laoghaire town and Dublin Bay, but it has suffered enormously from neglect down the years.</P>
    <P>For most people Dún Laoghaire harbour was the port through which this country exported its people and it is remarkable that, despite the enormous number of Irish people travelling out of the country, through emigration, and back to visit their relatives, passenger facilities throughout this port have not been developed.  Indeed, the attempts <Col N="2405" /> which were made in the sixties to provide a new ferry terminal had to be abandoned because the terminal was too small and too dangerous.  It was a waste of taxpayers' money to try to provide that terminal when it had to be subsequently abandoned.  It was also wrong that the rail link which connected the ferry to the Dún Laoghaire railway station was closed down.  For foot passengers it is now much more difficult to use that ferry because people have to carry their luggage to the station.</P>
    <P>Side by side with that, the harbour's potential for leisure facilities was allowed to slip into the hands of the waterfront yacht clubs who catered for the better off and privileged people in our society.  The only element of the harbour which was left to local people was the facility to walk the piers &mdash; which thousands do every week &mdash; or to use the inner harbour, the old coal harbour which was never properly developed.  The fabric of that harbour was allowed to deteriorate through the years.  Meanwhile, the local people looked on with considerable frustration. The borough council have been arguing for many years for the establishment of a harbour authority with some kind of local control and which would integrate the harbour with the borough. I would like to mention the sterling work which has been done by individuals such as Mr. Matt Byrne of An Taisce and Mr. John de Courcy Ireland who highlighted the neglect of Dún Laoghaire harbour.</P>
    <P>Six years ago The Workers' Party produced a document on the harbour in which we highlighted the neglect.  We argued that the harbour could be developed for the creation of employment in a constituency where there are 7,000 people out of work.  We argued that the facilities of the harbour could be used to open leisure facilities for all, not only those who could afford membership of the yacht clubs.  All that produced at the time was the establishment of a liaison committee which had no powers, which met only twice and then petered out. Towards the end of 1987 we saw a great flurry of activity: the business expansion scheme would allow tax breaks for people who invest in marinas and there was the <Col N="2406" /> prospect of EC money and a quick buck being made from Dún Laoghaire harbour. Suddenly we had a proposal on the table by a two pronged company, which was set up specifically for this purpose, and after all the years of neglect and delay, they managed to get prompt Government attention to the point where the Government made a decision without even consulting local interests, the local council or anybody else.  This House knows only too well that that proposal produced a storm of local protest.  People were brought together in the Dún Laoghaire Watch Committee to oppose that proposal if for no other reason than it proposed to establish a private marina in the area of the harbour used by ordinary people of the borough who could not afford to use other facilities.</P>
    <P>The House also notes that that proposal was subsequently withdrawn by the Government and a planning review group was established to consider the future development of Dún Laoghaire harbour. Such was the Government's enthusiasm for the development of Dún Laoghaire harbour in mid-1988 that they gave the planning review group only three months to do their work.  All the various interests had to beaver away and 70 different submissions were made to that planning review group.</P>
    <P>It is now almost 12 months to the day since the planning review group made their report.  Where is the legislation to implement any of the recommendations in the planning review group?  What has happened to it?  We got several promises: in the Dáil, in November 1988, we were told that the report of the planning review group would be examined by the Government within a matter of weeks.  On 14 February 1989 the Minister of State said, &ldquo;I can assure the Deputy that the Government have not wasted any time over the past 12 months and will not waste any time over the next few weeks in reaching a decision on the future development of the harbour&rdquo;. At a meeting with the councillors from Dún Laoghaire Borough the then Minister for the Marine promised that the Government would make a decision <Col N="2407" /> within a matter of weeks.  That was last February.  Where is it?</P>
    <P>All we have today is a Bill which transfers responsibility for the harbour from one Government Department to another.  That is not what was recommended by the planning review group. Their report stated:</P>
    <P>We recommend that the management and development of the Harbour should be entrusted to an Authority consisting of a Chairman and 6 ordinary members, appointed by the Minister for the Marine on the basis of their competence to contribute to the running of the Harbour.</P>
    <P>The report goes on to state:</P>
    <P>The Authority should prepare a comprehensive management plan for the Harbour to provide for the kind of development envisaged in this report.</P>
    <P>Both the general public and the Harbour users should be afforded an opportunity to comment on the Management Plan before it is adopted.</P>
    <P>The report continues as follows:</P>
    <P>As a general principle, the Authority should act as a Semi-State development agency, with the power to borrow or attract funds to implement its plan.</P>
    <P>The applications for EC funds under the &ldquo;National Programme of Community Interest for the Greater Dublin Area&rdquo; should be supported.</P>
    <P>The report goes on to make various recommendations as to the kind of functions the harbour authority should have. Why are these recommendations not being implemented 12 months after the publication of the report of the planning review group who were given only three months to report because of the Government's enthusiasm to get things moving in Dún Laoghaire harbour?  It seems that as the prospect of making a quick buck from Dún Laoghaire harbour receded, so too did the Government's enthusiasm for bringing forward legislation to establish a harbour authority.  The Minister had a golden opportunity today to annouce the establishment of such an authority but he failed to do so.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2408" /> After all the debate that has taken place through the years about Dún Laoghaire harbour we should have before us a comprehensive Bill which would establish a harbour authority and enable that authority to draw up a management plan for the harbour encompassing various proposals which have been made.  Many commercial bodies and interested groups made very studied and serious proposals in the belief that a harbour authority was to be established and that their submissions and efforts would be taken into account.</P>
    <P>Development of the harbour should be centred on a number of areas, the first and most critical of which is the car ferry. I am disappointed that the Minister has not used the opportunity to state his commitment to the retention of the car ferry in Dún Laoghaire.  Forty per cent of surface passengers in and out of this country travel on the Dún Laoghaire car ferry.  It sails the shortest sea route between this country and Britain.  Given that the channel tunnel when completed will make this the only island member of the EC, Dún Laoghaire harbour should be developed as the main port serving this country and the rest of Europe.  Far from subscribing to the recommendations of the Planning Review Group which supported the notion of funding being sought from the EC for the development of Dún Laoghaire harbour, it does not feature at all in the Government's submission to the EC.  It is quite remarkable that the Government have not sought EC assistance to develop facilities at our major passenger port.  Sealink have put forward very good proposals for the development of passenger facilities and these should be supported.  This is critical to the future of the harbour.</P>
    <P>Better facilities should be provided for existing users of the harbour.  I am not talking just about the yacht clubs which by and large are able to look after themselves and are fairly well catered for.  I am talking about the many other people who constitute the majority of users of Dún Laoghaire harbour.  These include the Dún Laoghaire Sailing School, for example, who train 700 people each year and expect to train over 1,000 people a year by 1990.  They are still based in a <Col N="2409" /> building in George's Street rather than having facilities in the harbour area.</P>

      <P>I hesitate to interrupt the Deputy but it seems he is straying very far from the subject matter of the Bill, which he admits is very limited in scope and confines us to discussing the transfer of responsibilities from the Commissioners of Public Works to the Minister for the Marine.  I have given the Deputy a lot of latitude but I would ask him to stay with the measure before us. The overall development of the harbour must await another day.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I will co-operate with you but it is difficult.</P>
      <P>The Bill cries out for comment on what it does not contain, namely, the provisions required to develop Dún Laoghaire harbour in the interests of the people who use it and the many people who need employment in that area.  Since the Bill covers the transfer of responsibilities for the management of the harbour to the Department of the Marine, it is appropriate that some comments should be made by Members of this House on how the harbour should be managed in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Facilities should be developed to cater for existing users, people who may not be as well organised as some of the betteroff users and are confined to using the inner harbour where facilities are almost non-existent.  I refer to people who belong to sailing schools, trawler men, sea anglers, sea scouts and the VECs who train people in sailing.  Each year Dublin City VEC train 300 young people in sailing, most of whom come from the inner city and Dún Laoghaire VEC train young people from that area.  The university <Col N="2410" /> boat clubs and St. Michael's Rowing Club also use the harbour.  So far these people have not been adequately catered for and the development of facilities for them will have to be a priority.</P>
    <P>A number of proposals have been put forward during the past year or 18 months concerning the development of the harbour. Some of those proposals are very attractive, some not so.  It is important that any development should have two main objectives.  First, it should widen the use of the harbour for leisure purposes by the general public.  Secondly, it should be aimed at the creation of employment.  We have seen the kind of developments that have taken place on the southern coast of Britain where very exclusive developments, combining expensive housing with private marinas, have been built to cater for the new rich which have been generated by Mrs. Thatcher's Britain.  I do not want to see that kind of development replicated in Dún Laoghaire and any development based on that kind of exclusive approach would be very strongly resisted by the people of the area.</P>
    <P>As the Minister said, this is simply a technical Bill transferring responsibility from one Department to another. However, there are a number of omissions in it and I will be proposing amendments on Committee Stage.  One which I will be tabling &mdash; and which the Minister should consider in the meantime &mdash; is that the Bill makes no mention of the transfer of rights of workers employed in the harbour.  I would have thought in any transfer of responsibility provision would have been made to protect the rights of the people who were formerly employed by the Office of Public Works and whose employment is, presumably, now being transferred to the Department of the Marine.  However, I will deal with this on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>It is a great disappointment that this opportunity has not been used to introduce the kind of legislation that people in Dún Laoghaire have been calling for many years.  It is a great pity that we will spend a day sitting here dealing with a Bill which is simply giving legislative effect to something that has already happened while, as you quite rightly pointed out, <Col N="2411" /> we cannot deal with more substantive issues about the future development of Dún Laoghaire harbour.  My fear is that, despite all the debate about Dún Laoghaire harbour over the years, because of continuing Government inaction and their failure to establish a harbour authority, Dún Laoghaire harbour will miss the opportunities now presented for development.  That would be a great pity for the harbour and the people of the area.</P>

      <P>I see the Bill as a step in the legislative process relating to Dún Laoghaire harbour and, in that sense, I welcome it.  It is a technical Bill transferring the functions in relation to the harbour from the Commissioners of Public Works to the Department of the Marine.  Nonetheless it affords the opportunity to make some points and I will make just a few briefly of a broader kind but, I hope, within the limits of the Bill.</P>
      <P>Dún Laoghaire is a magnificent harbour of 250 sheltered acres of water even in its present underdeveloped state.  It has been estimated that the harbour &mdash; directly and indirectly &mdash; provides 1,000 jobs and generates £17 million of economic activity annually, mainly from the ferry service.  The harbour is, therefore, vital to the local economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dún Laoghaire is obviously syonymous with the ferry service.  It is the major passenger entry point and tourist gateway to the east coast.  The harbour is visually attractive and adjacent to our biggest urban population of one million people. In that sense it is a major amenity apart from the other uses to which the harbour <Col N="2412" /> is put and will be put in future.  To date the harbour has obviously been developed mainly as a port for passenger and ferry traffic and, limited as the development has been to date, the harbour has the advantage of being saved the unattractive features of an industrialised setting handling bulk cargo and so forth. The harbour, therefore, with its ferry background fits easily into the residential and commercial setting that makes up Dún Laoghaire and it is a particularly attractive entry point for tourists.</P>
    <P>I strongly favour the retention of the ferry service as I see it as being vital now and to the future of the harbour. Conscious of the problem of the public interest dimension, the former Minister for the Marine, Deputy Daly, established in April 1988 a planning review group chaired by Professor Dermot McAleese to examine overall harbour policy and to recommend the best method for progress on the development of the harbour.  This group addressed the question of the ferry terminal and I want to focus on that for a moment or two.  I am very happy to note that the review group came down in favour of the retention of the ferry service in Dún Laoghaire.</P>
    <P>A second option, which the review group did not favour, was the transfer of the ferry operation to Dublin Port.  While passenger traffic is clearly important to Dún Laoghaire, there is an important freight element as well which brings in something in excess of £1 million per year.  Indeed, the revenue generated by freight, as well as the passenger side, is vital for the survival and maintenance of the harbour as we now know it.  There is a view that all cargo handling should be concentrated in the port of Dublin. However, I disagree with that view because the concentration in Dublin would lead to traffic delays, congestion, downside time costs and would leave a dependence on Dublin Port which strategically, is not what the country needs.</P>
    <P>Obviously trouble can occur in industrial relations and, therefore, we need the capacity for freight handling in a port near Dublin.  Indeed, much freight traffic is lost to Northern Ireland as matters stand; it has been estimated that one million tonnes of freight traffic goes <Col N="2413" /> through Northern Ireland ports.  The characteristics of these ports is that they have efficient services, such as roll-on roll-off facilities, but they have smaller ships which can speedily transport goods to Britain and to mainland Europe.  My point, therefore, is that the smaller ships going back and forth from Northern Ireland ports, with their drive-on drive-off facilities, could be replicated here by having an east coast portal zone running say from Drogheda to Wicklow with Dublin Port playing its role but not totally dominating all freight business.</P>
    <P>As I said, I am very pleased that the review group recommended the retention of the ferry terminal at Dún Laoghaire and I would like to see the service retained in the future as part of an east coast portal zone and authority. There is, of course, a need to upgrade the ferry terminal facilities and perhaps the Minister when replying will let us know his intentions in that respect.  This upgrading of facilities could include, among other things, an improvement of the interchange with CIE so that the DART can be used with reasonable ease.</P>
    <P>In relation to harbour development, marinas obviously spring to mind but they are only one component.  The review group report rightly recommends the maintenance of the balance between recreational, commercial and public service activities in the harbour.  The report concludes that Dún Laoghaire is uniquely well placed for marine-related leisure activities.  The under-utilisation of the national asset that is Dún Laoghaire harbour undoubtedly could be made up in part by the development of marine facilities. This would not inhibit other developments in the harbour and must be seen not to do so.  In addition to leisure benefits, the development of marina facilities would provide an impetus for marine-related commercial activity and, therefore, jobs like boat building, repairing, sail-making and so on.  This would bring much needed jobs with significant benefits for the borough.</P>
    <P>There has already been considerable reference to the need for comprehensive legislation in relation to the harbour.  I share that view.  The Bill before the House constitutes a step in the legislative <Col N="2414" /> process toward the establishment of a full statutory authority for Dún Laoghaire. In that sense I welcome the soon to be established interim harbour authority.  I join other speakers in urging the quick establishment of that interim authority. Obviously the sooner the full statutory authority is established the better but the interim board will serve as an important temporary measure.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's intention &mdash; he has gone public on this &mdash; to set up an interim harbour board for Dún Laoghaire, followed of course by a statutory board.  One might well ask: what will this interim board do?  We know already that their functions will be advisory &mdash; it is not a statutory body &mdash; but I hope their membership will be comprised of interests that will be in a position to evaluate, in a balanced way, the various proposals put to them for the development of the harbour, like marinas and so on. This interim board will then make recommendations for the development of the harbour particularly in respect of marina facilities.</P>
    <P>Clearly if there is major development at Dún Laoghaire so much can be spent from the public purse, but so much only. There will have to be a joint partnership between the public and private sectors in this respect.  The interim authority will play a valuable role in evaluating the proposals put before them so that they can pass on their recommendations to the Minister for action.</P>
    <P>I see the Bill before the House as limited in scope but constituting an important part of the legislative process for the further development of Dún Laoghaire harbour.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate Deputy Hillery on his maiden speech in this House.  It is appropriate that his remarks should concentrate on an area of such interest to all of us.  All representatives of the Dún Laoghaire constituency would agree that there has been a totally cohesive, co-ordinated approach to this whole matter on the part of Dún Laoghaire Corporation.  I want to pay tribute to Dún Laoghaire Corporation councillors who have used all their power, influence, backed by much <Col N="2415" /> research and study, to ensure that Dún Laoghaire harbour retains its unique qualities, ensuring that in turn, its development will add not alone to the leisure facilities and amenities of the area but also to its desperately needed employment prospects.</P>
      <P>Bearing in mind that co-ordinated approach on the part of public representatives, at Dún Laoghaire Corporation and Oireachtas level along with almost all of the interest groups in Dún Laoghaire, it is all the more surprising that at this stage we are debating only a small technical Bill.  It had been our belief for some years past that we would not have reached this stage without having had a permanent harbour authority responsible for the management and development the harbour so desperately needed.  Bearing in mind all the goodwill that is prevailing, all the submissions, research and reviews that were carried out on Dún Laoghaire harbour, it is all the more inexplicable that the Minister was able to introduce only this small technical Bill today.  We accept entirely that there is a legal, technical process to be gone through to transfer the management and, hopefully, the development of Dún Laoghaire harbour to the Department of the Marine.</P>
      <P>I join other Members who this morning expressed disappointment that this opportunity was not availed of, first, to announce the membership and terms of reference of the interim authority for Dún Laoghaire harbour and, second, to have initiated debate on the requisite legislation to establish the full statutory harbour authority needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will not repeat points raised already by other Members except to emphasise the urgency of the development of Dún Laoghaire harbour.  The Government, in drawing up their <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and so on emphasised that we must use our natural resources to create employment and to expand the type of industry we so badly need here.  I believe there is no more attractive proposal in Ireland today to meet both needs than the development of Dún Laoghaire harbour. Yet, despite the emphasis this Government have placed on tourism and its <Col N="2416" /> resources, we in Dún Laoghaire find ourselves in grave danger of losing even the few amenities we have there.  We live in trepidation that Sealink Car Ferries will become tired of unfulfilled promises to update the facilities at that harbour in order to accommodate and provide high standards for the over one million passengers who use the ferries each year.  I will not delay the House discussing those facilities yet again.  We have done so on many occasions &mdash; by way of Parliamentary Questions, on Adjourment debates and on every debate pertaining to industry, employment and tourism here.  Yet we find ourselves at the end of 1989 with a small, technical Bill whose provisions merely transfer powers but do not give us any idea of how comprehensively those powers will be exercised.</P>
    <P>While expressing disappointment that the membership of the interim authority was not announced today I want to place on record &mdash; and I know other Members will agree with me &mdash; that when, eventually, the membership is announced the representative interests of Dún Laoghaire and their cohesive, political approach to the whole matter over the years will be reflected in that membership. In so doing the Minister would be merely recognising the type of support given to the development of Dún Laoghaire harbour.  Indeed, I would go so far as to say he would be doing a grave injustice to the proposed development if all those interest groups were not represented in the membership of that authority.</P>
    <P>There has been remarkable evidence of the interest and pride on the part of the community in the development of Dún Laoghaire harbour, especially when it was feared that that harbour might be hived off to private interests, to privileged interests, thereby not alone not extending to the public the facilities that should be made available to them but perhaps even containing them.  Public meeting after public meeting in Dún Laoghaire demonstrated that the people of Dún Laoghaire have pride in what they consider to be the unique facility that is theirs.  They are also extremely concerned about how the development of that harbour will be carried out.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2417" /> I want to pay tribute to the planning review group set up by the previous Minister, Deputy Brendan Daly, for the work they have done and who reported, as Deputy Gilmore pointed out, almost a year ago to the day.  They set out very clearly in that report the work which had to be carried out with all urgency.  They recommended that not alone should market research be carried out but that the environmental impact of the harbour should be taken into consideration as well.  However, none of those recommendations has been carried out, and none of them can be until the interim harbour authority are set up.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will respond at the conclusion of this debate today because there are a few questions which need to be answered urgently.  One of these questions relates to the date when the interim authority will be set up.  I believe the date for the setting up of the interim authority should be given to us today. We need to hear from the Minister that the upgrading of the facilities for Sealink are in train.  As was pointed out by Deputy Gilmore, we need to be told by the Minister how the workers now employed in Dún Laoghaire harbour will be protected and, hopefully, their work expanded.</P>
    <P>This is the very least that has to be done in this Bill.  I would not like to think that it will be well into 1990 before the comprehensive Bill required is introduced. Included in that Bill should be the work which will be carried out under the aegis of the interim authority.  We should not have to wait for yet another year or another review group in order for this to be done.  We should put it up to the Government that the needs of this country are job creation, a utilisation of our natural resources, an expansion of our tourism industry and, in particular, adding to resources which already exist. Not alone have those opportunities existed but they have been presented in the clearest terms to the Government.  It is beyond understanding why no further progress has been made and why, as all speakers have said, this small Bill is the only response we have had.</P>
    <P>The potential leisure facilities to be provided at Dún Laoghaire harbour are <Col N="2418" /> of incredible importance and some of the EC Structural Funds have to be allocated towards these facilities.  I know that Dún Laoghaire Corporation have had no indication from the Government as to whether this proposal has been taken into consideration or whether submissions have been made.  Dún Laoghaire harbour should justifiably receive an allocation from the EC Structural Funds.  I would ask the Minister when he is replying to the debate to indicate that a development of such importance, not alone to Dún Laoghaire but to the whole east coast and national tourism in general, has been included within the development plans for the EC Structural Funds.  As has been pointed out before &mdash; and perhaps it needs to be pointed out again to this Government &mdash; Dún Laoghaire harbour serves not only the needs of the community of Dún Laoghaire and the east coast itself but, it is, as Deputy Hillery said, a most attractive entry point into Ireland for a large number of tourists who visit the country.  One of the great disappointments to the commercial, business, hotel and community interests of Dún Laoghaire is that because of a lack of development of the harbour and the surrounding areas the harbour is used merely as a drop-off point and has not been made sufficiently attractive to entice visitors to spend any length of time in the area before they travel to other parts of the country.  This area is one of startling beauty and even the harbour itself is unique.  Down through history it has been recognised as unique not just in regard to its beauty but it encompasses in its stonework much of the history of the borough and the craftwork of many people who live in the borough.  Indeed, it is a monument in every sense of the word to the craftsmen who built this unique and historical harbour.</P>
    <P>This harbour has wonderful potential as a tourist attraction and it flies in the face of all reason as to why none of the promises made by the Fianna Fáil Government have been carried out in regard to job creation or the expansion of tourism.  Despite a total acceptance of what is needed in Dún Laoghaire and the goodwill towards this development no move has been made by the Government <Col N="2419" /> in this direction.  As we move towards 1990 we will merely have passed over powers from one Government Department to another.</P>
    <P>I am glad of the opportunity to have contributed to the debate today.  I join with Deputy Gilmore in saying that this is a unique occasion because a Bill which has concentrated solely on Dún Laoghaire has taken up the whole Order of Business for today.  However, I am disappointed that we have not used this special day to far greater advantage by expanding on the development of Dún Laoghaire harbour.  I hope that when we debate the next stage of the Bill we will have something meaningful and very definite to debate and that the people of Dún Laoghaire will see that reflected in reality in bringing to fruition one of the great unrealised potentials of this country.</P>

      <P>I see this Bill as the key to the future of Dún Laoghaire.  While its essence is contained in a few sheets of paper, nevertheless as Deputy Barnes said, it is Dún Laoghaire's day in the Dáil.  We are grateful to the Government &mdash; whether we be from the constituency or not &mdash; for giving us the opportunity to talk about a priceless asset.  While the legislation before us appears to be rather short and pithy, it is nevertheless the key to the future development of Dún Laoghaire. The transfer of powers from the Commissioners of Public Works to the Department of the Marine can be seen as the beginning of a new awareness of the potential of Dún Laoghaire.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1815 under the reign of the late, <Col N="2420" /> I assume unlamented, King George III there were eight habour commissioners appointed under the Kingstown Harbour Commissioners Authority.  Under the State Harbours Act, 1924, the functions of the Kingstown Harbour Commissioners were transferred to the Commissioners of Public Works.  This legislation provides for the transfer of power from the Commissioners of Public Works to the Department of the Marine.</P>
    <P>We have a very historic area with great potential in Dún Laoghaire harbour. Since the foundation of the State that potential was never recognised.  As a public representative and Dáil Deputy for the area for the past 25 years I have always felt a sense of guilt that Dún Laoghaire quay and Dún Laoghaire harbour never received the recognition they deserved.</P>
    <P>I see the development of Dún Laoghaire harbour as the focal point for the future development of Dún Laoghaire and its hinterland.  There are many proposals for the development of the harbour, including marina development, which was the subject of great controversy in the community over the past two years.  That controversy was generated when the proposals were presented without discussion &mdash; that is not the democratic way to do things.  The basic problem was that people were not alerted about the intended developments in the harbour.  As my colleagues in the constituency have said, this matter has now been dealt with and people are aware of the proposed developments.  I would like to see our new masters, namely the Department of the Marine, take account of the views expressed by all strands of public opinion in the Dún Laoghaire area.  People have expressed concern about access, their democratic right to utilise the existing facilities in the 250 acres enclosed by the East and West Piers, and the position of the four yacht clubs, the Dún Laoghaire Motor Yacht Club, the Royal Irish Yacht Club, the Royal St. George Yacht Club and the National Yacht Club.  I will deal with the yacht clubs later.</P>
    <P>Those people who espouse the ideology of absolute State ownership should recall that the yacht clubs are located on <Col N="2421" /> territory that is leased to them by the State.  Similar arrangements will apply to a marina development.  The State will undoubtedly have an input.  I do not believe in the ideology of absolute State ownership or authority.  I believe a joint venture with a private input and State ownership, as put forward in some of the proposals, should be considered.  The democratisation of Dún Laoghaire harbour and the need to take account of all interests are the main concerns of the people of Dún Laoghaire.</P>
    <P>For six months of the year Dún Laoghaire harbour lies idle.  When the last boat is taken from the swinging moorings in later autumn or winter, Dún Laoghaire is effectively used by people like myself people who use the East Pier, pedestrians and many birds.  It is an extraordinary sorrow to me and others concerned about the development of Dún Laoghaire that the East Pier is heavily used by pedestrian but the West Pier is overgrown with grass.  That is the tragedy of Dún Laoghaire.</P>

      <P>Thank you for your guidance and direction.</P>
      <P>The Bill sets up an interim harbour authority.  As we know, the interim harbour authority was proposed by the planning review group which reported in November 1988.  Indeed, we are celebrating the first birthday of that review group and I hope we will not be here next year celebrating its second birthday.  I am concerned that the longer the development of Dún Laoghaire harbour is left in abeyance the less likely it will be developed.  As I have already said, when this new group meet they should consider as a matter of urgency the various proposals for marinas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One mile on either side of Dún Laoghaire right along the sea front there is huge potential for development.  The former Salthill Hotel site is being used for an apartment development.  The site of the old Ibex works, where the Dún Laoghaire market was situated, is going to be built on.  There is a marvellous proposal for the Pavilion site.  Taking these developments in context, one can <Col N="2423" /> see a marvellous future for the development of Dún Laoghaire.  If one goes anywhere on the south coast of England or the south coast of Spain one sees developments similar to that proposed for Dún Laoghaire, and marina after marina development.  I would like to see, as an immediate task of this type of legislation, which proposes to transfer responsibility from the Commissioners of Public Works to the Department of the Marine the setting up of an interim harbour authority or of a full harbour authority and that that harbour authority get on with the business of developing Dún Laoghaire.</P>
    <P>I will not intrude on your kindness, Sir, nor will I attempt to stretch your credulity in the context of trying to maintain a narrow band of comment on this very technical Bill but once more I would put before the House a number of proposals that might be considered by our good friends in the Department of the Marine who will shortly be setting up an interim harbour authority.  I would ask them to examine the various proposals put forward, for example, by Carlisle Leisure Developments, Marina Development (Ireland) Ltd., the Dún Laoghaire harbour Westpoint Development and the Power-Walker proposal.  I expect if one had the courage one would have to put one's views in order of preference in relation to these various proposals.  For my part, I have to congratulate Marina Developments (Ireland) Ltd. for their proposal because at least they had the courage to come forward with what they considered to be the best development in the context of the coal harbour and its environs.  They were prepared to bring money up front and develop it.  They gave the impetus to the whole question concerning Dún Laoghaire and its development at present.</P>
    <P>I congratulate that company and express my sorrow for a large part of the controversy which was heaped on their shoulders, as I believe, by a lack of information to the public.  I would like to make it clear that the directors of Marina Developments (Ireland) Ltd. made an effort to talk to the various interests but unfortunately they were not very well received.  The reason for that is that the <Col N="2424" /> development was parachuted on the community without proper democratic discussion. I know you can bring discussion in the democratic sense too far but somebody has to make a decision.  In this lovely country of ours we are inclined to talk around problems rather then trying to find solutions to them and that is probably what happened in the context of Dún Laoghaire.</P>
    <P>A first class proposal was put forward by Carlisle Leisure Developments, the Royal St. George Yacht Club and the National Yacht Club.  That proposal is for a first class development and should be considered seriously.  Either the proposal from Marine Developments (Ireland) Ltd. or Carlisle Leisure Developments should be given the green light immediately.  Why not give the two of them the green light?</P>

      <P>I am concerned about this matter.  I would not say my suggestions are particularly original but I hope they will be considered by the people who are now charged with the proper development of Dún Laoghaire harbour. As you have said, Sir, the purpose of the Bill is to transfer the responsibilities currently enjoyed by the Commissioners of Public Works under the Safe Harbours Act, 1924, in relation to Dún Laoghaire harbour to the Minister for the Marine. I hope, when these responsibilities have been transferred, the Minister will take into account the various matters I have outlined.  In addition, he should make sure that a company of the merit and integrity of Sealink Car Ferries is properly accommodated.  That is a precious company in the context of Dún Laoghaire.  While the concept of a unified car ferry terminal is very worthy and something I would like to see in Dún Laoghaire, in the context of the type of development being proposed by the interim harbour authority, a unified car ferry terminal might not be able to be accommodated in Dún Laoghaire but there certainly will always be room, and a welcome for organisations like Sealink. They have done a marvellous job for Dún Laoghaire and continue to perform a very important function in the economic and social life of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also like these people, under the new regime, to consider the slum conditions of the car ferry terminal where people are kept out in the most appalling weather conditions week in week out, particularly in winter months.  I would appreciate if the conditions at the terminal could be considered because you <Col N="2426" /> cannot get a cup of tea or a meal immediately on the harbour front.  These are unfortunate conditions and should be improved when responsibility is transferred to the Minister for the Marine.</P>
    <P>I thank you, Sir, for your indulgence. We will have the opportunity of discussing in more detail what we consider to be the merits of the various developments in the context of Dún Laoghaire harbour. Nevertheless, this Bill before us, as I and others have already said, although small in its presentation is a new light at the end of the tunnel.  Over the years the potential of Dún Laoghaire has not been taken account of and more particularly the potential of Dún Laoghaire harbour has been less considered by successive Governments.  This Government are to be congratulated on the idea of transferring power on the one hand and the proper operation of that power in the best interests of the Community on the other hand.</P>

      <P>In conclusion, to return to my speech, the main factor of the Bill before us, as I have said, is to transfer this power and to ensure that the harbour is properly managed.  We all hope that will happen.  I would like to place on record my appreciation of the former Minister's work.  While I know his media persona and his private persona differed, I have always found the previous Minister for the Marine, Deputy Daly, to be approachable and understanding and very appreciative of the difficulties under which we operated in the Dún Laoghaire area.  It is to his credit that we have in front of us here what amounts to the <Col N="2427" /> catechism for the future development of Dún Laoghaire harbour.  After all, it was he who set up the Dún Laoghaire Harbour Report Group under the leadership of Professor Dermot McAleese.  In congratulating the Minister on the one hand and appreciating the work done by Professor McAleese &mdash; I have paid tribute to him elsewhere &mdash; and his colleagues on the other, let me say that what we have here is the blueprint for the future development of Dún Laoghaire harbour.</P>
      <P>Now that I am in good humour, I would also like to take this opportunity to congratulate the incoming Minister for the Marine on his appointment and to say to him that I would appreciate it if he would look, as I know he will, to the public representatives in the area, be they the national or local public representatives, for their views on the future development of Dún Laoghaire harbour.  May I also wish the new Minister of State in the Department of the Marine health, happiness and success?</P>

      <P>Coming as I do from a neighbouring constituency, let me first of all thank my colleague, Deputy Andrews, for his contribution to this debate.  I also note that all of the public representatives for the area are present in the House and I would like therefore to congratulate my colleague, Deputy Brian Hillery, on making his maiden speech, and also my colleague on Dublin County Council, Deputy Gilmore, and my old friend, Deputy Barnes.  I presume that Deputy Barrett has also been involved in this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is quite flimsy and there is not a lot one can say on it.  However, it is welcome that the Department of the Marine can now plan the future development of this area in a proper way.  One of the questions dealt with in this debate is: what lies ahead?  As a member of Dublin County Council and working as I do with many of the councillors for the area I am aware of the frustration felt by local Deputies and councillors and their <Col N="2428" /> input in trying to advance the development of this harbour.  The Department of the Marine have been looking after the harbour since the beginning of the year, so this is merely a technical process. I understand the Minister will quite shortly establish an interim harbour board and that they will be looking for people with experience in the area of finance.  I also hope there will be a strong local involvement.</P>
    <P>I think it was Deputy Gilmore who referred to the unemployment figure for the area.  It was important that he did so as many people are inclined to look on this area as an area which serves the elite. To my knowledge, this is not true.  In any future development of the harbour we should cater for those who can and cannot afford to be members of the yacht club. The Department of the Marine should address this issue in planning the development of the harbour to ensure that everybody will be able to enjoy the fruits of this development in this unique area.  I presume that the members of the yacht club are quite self-sufficient.  I am not <i>au fait</i> with their activities but I am surprised that Deputy McCartan is not going to speak on this Bill given his deep interest in the sea.  I understand that he was here earlier but I did think he would be present in the House.</P>
    <P>The importance of Dún Laoghaire harbour has been referred to already in this debate by a number of speakers.  Reference was also made to the development of the channel tunnel and the vital importance of this link.  I would like with your permission, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, to refer to one aspect and that is&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Since it is now the Department of the Marine who have control of this particular harbour I have one request to make of them.  Obviously they will plan the future development of this harbour but I ask them to take note of the following.  As the representatives for this area are aware, a particular holding company, Sea Containers, own Sealink.  They also own between six and eight ports, including Holyhead, in the UK which they purchased from the British Government for something like £66 million back in the seventies.  I understand that the owners of Stena, the biggest ferry boat and container operators in Northern Europe, are mounting a takeover bid of Sea Containers.  To raise cash to fight off this bid Sea Containers are selling off bits and pieces of their operations.  What I ask the Minister to do, and I am quite serious in making this suggestion, is to consider buying Holyhead port.  I am not suggesting that the State go out and buy it on its own.  My suggestion would be that the Minister try to mobilise some Irish business interests in the transport field and put together a consortium of Irish companies with the aim of purchasing Holyhead port.</P>
      <P>As one can appreciate this is a vital link.  As other speakers have suggested, it is only three hours by boat from Dublin and 40 per cent of surface passengers travel via this port.  Given this process of integration and linkage with Europe, if the Government, through the Minister for the Marine, could convince some Irish business interests to purchase Holyhead port this would be a very positive and outward looking step.  Obviously we need to concentrate on the development of our own assets and ports but why do we not extend the argument a little bit further and say why, if Sea Containers are selling off Holyhead port, should the Irish Government not take a keen interest in such a proposal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the only suggestion I have to make.  A number of other suggestions have been made to other Deputies.  In conclusion, I would like to congratulate the Minister for the Marine and his Minister of State and to wish them well in their term of office.  I would like the Minister to take on board my suggestion <Col N="2430" /> which is, as I said, that we look outwards. So much has been said about the need to link in with Europe and this is a practical way by which we can link directly in with the UK.  If we were to do this we would not be at the mercy of foreign-owned shipping companies who operate from Holyhead.  Instead we would have a concrete link with the UK and thus a concrete link with Europe.  Therefore I think this is a positive suggestion and I hope the Minister for the Marine will look seriously at it.  I am not asking him to go out and purchase it on behalf of the State but rather to try to put a consortium of Irish business interests together to ensure, as I said, Ireland would have a concrete link with the transport system on the completion of the internal market.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick West):</i> I would like on behalf of the Minister and myself to thank Deputies for their good wishes.  I express thanks to the Deputies who have contributed to the debate and, more particularly.  I congratulate Deputy Brian Hillery on his maiden speech.  I have listened with great attention to the contributions this morning and I congratulate those who participated in the debate.  I can assure those Members that their comments will be read and considered with great interest.</P>
      <P>When the Minister was presenting the Bill to the House he stated that its purpose was to enable the necessary legislation to be put in place to effect the transfer of responsibility for Dún Laoghaire harbour from the Commissioners of Public Works to the Department of the Marine.  Deputies will be aware that the Department of the Marine have been responsible for Dún Laoghaire harbour under administrative arrangements sanctioned by the Department of Finance since 1 January 1989. Since that date that Department made every effort to ensure that available resources were used for the overall benefit of the harbour and its many users.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2431" /> In the meantime the harbour has been tidied up generally, a new marine activity centre has been opened, a weighbridge installed and other security measures brought forward.  However, it is undesirable that that <i>ad hoc</i> arrangement should be allowed to continue for any longer than is absolutely necessary.  It would take, as Deputies will be aware, some time to bring forward legislation to provide for more permanent arrangements for Dún Laoghaire.  The House will appreciate that the purpose of the Bill is purely technical.  I have noted with satisfaction that Deputies have used the opportunity to express their views on the ideal future for Dún Laoghaire and on what may emanate from the planning review group.</P>
    <P>I assure the House that their contributions will be borne in mind when the long-term mechanism for the harbour is being considered.  Deputies Gilmore and Barnes raised questions about the rights of workers.  I should like to tell them that their rights will not be changed in any way in the transfer from one Government Department to another.  Views were expressed in regard to the terminal ferry and while I would like to make comments at this stage I must say that it would be wrong of me to pre-empt the deliberations of the advisory board of the harbour. I do not think I should make statements on developments that may or may not take place.  That will be a matter for the board which will be set up.</P>
    <P>Some weeks ago the Minister announced his plans for an interim Dún Laoghaire harbour board.  The function of that interim board will be to provide <Col N="2432" /> the necessary assistance on the management of the harbour and to make recommendations for its development. The Minister has not yet announced the terms of reference of the board or its membership as he was anxious, as I was, to have the views of Members taken into consideration.  I wish to state, however, that an announcement on the setting up of the interim board and its terms of reference will be made within the next few days.  The Committee Stage of the Bill will be taken as soon as possible, subject to agreement between the Whips.</P>
