      <P>Yes, I have already indicated that I agree in principle to having a debate on the Defence Forces but there is an aspect of this matter which I should like to draw to the Deputy's attention, that is, that before the summer recess we will have to deal with the Defence Estimate.  Perhaps it might be possible to bring that Estimate forward and have the debate on the Estimate, but I suggest that matter could be dealt with by the Whips.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>When the debate adjourned last evening I had referred to the fact that the bands of income taxable at the standard rate&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;of 32 per cent and the bands of income taxable at the middle rate of 48 per cent had been increased in the Finance Bill by more than 7 per cent which exceeded twice the projected rate of inflation when the Minister made his Budget Statement here last January.  The net effect of this, together with section 1 and the other reliefs and allowances which appear throughout the Finance <Col N="2309" /> Bill, is that the Government have more than attained their target of bringing twothirds of Irish taxpayers into the standard rate of tax.  I say they have exceeded their target because when they first voiced that aspiration the standard rate of tax was 35 per cent.  Instead of bringing 66 per cent of the population into a 35 per cent rate they brought 64 per cent of the tax paying population into a 32 per cent standard rate of tax.</P>
      <P>The marginal tax rate of more than 600,000 taxpayers will fall as a result of the budgetary provisions and the provisions in this Finance Bill.  From 1982 to 1987 the rate of personal taxation was inexorably increasing.  Last year that rise in taxation was arrested and this year it has been turned around.  That is of great significance to the Government when combating the pay element in inflation. Deputy Desmond, Deputy Noonan and other Deputies have adverted to the danger of a resurgence of inflation in the Irish economy.  I take this opportunity to urge the Government not to resort to any drastic action to control resurgent inflation.  The approach the Minister has signalled is the correct one, namely, a steady hand on the tiller rather than any drastic or precipitate action which might damage the economic growth which the success of the Government's financial policies over the past two years has generated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Desmond spoke at great length about imported inflation.  The reason inflation is being imported is that the value of property is rising and the amount of net income available to people after tax is rising.  There is an atmosphere of buoyancy and confidence in the economy and consumer spending is on the increase.  The borrowing capacity of taxpayers is on the increase because of the increase in the value of their property. When that trend takes place within an economy there is a natural tendency to purchase more imported consumer goods.  That is why we are in danger of importing inflation into the economy.  It is ironic that because of the very success of the Government's financial policies over the past two years there is a danger <Col N="2310" /> that inflation will come back into the economy.  Rather than take drastic action, such as has been taken in the United Kingdom, I would urge the Government to maintain their present course of action.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Bill continues the £286 PRSI allowance against income for tax purposes.  The argument has been made on a number of occasions that the average industrial wage earner will pay about £1,000 in PRSI.  The rate of PRSI for employees is fixed at 7.75 per cent up to a ceiling of £16,700 per annum.  The argument has been used that if an employee is paying 7.75 per cent of his gross wages in PRSI and he is only allowed to claim on average about 2½ per cent, in effect, he is paying tax on income he does not have.  That is not correct because no taxpayer in this country is paying tax on more than his gross income because of the system of personal allowances which operates.  I do not know why the figure for this allowance was fixed at £286; neither do I know why it is necessary to renew it each year in the Finance Bill.  Perhaps the Revenue Commissioners do not want to encourage us to believe that this allowance will stay permanently within the tax system. Nevertheless, it must be pointed out that renewing this allowance for the tax year 1989-90 will cost the Government in excess of £51 million.  While the allowance could be more generous in terms of the actual amount of PRSI paid by taxpayers one has to recognise that the Revenue must be protected and that the budgetary provisions must strike a fine balance.  Though this is a small allowance it is very expensive.  I thank the Minister for continuing that allowance.</P>
    <P>Section 4 reflects the success of the Government's economic policies.  Basically, the section provides that people on preferential loans who are taxed on the difference between a 12 per cent rate of interest and the actual rate of interest they are paying on their preferential loans will be taxed now on a different amount; they will be taxed on the difference between the actual interest payable on their loan and a figure of 10 per cent.  The <Col N="2311" /> reason for this change is obvious &mdash; it is because of the drastic fall in the rate of interest over the past two years.  That is a barometer of the success of the economic policies being pursued by this Government.</P>
    <P>I am not quite sure, a Cheann Comhairle, what the reason is for lines 26 to 30 of section 4 of the Finance Bill.  This is part of the definition of what constitutes a preferential loan for the purposes of the section.  The text states that a:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;preferential loan&rdquo; ... does not include any such loan in respect of which interest is payable at a rate that is not less than the rate of interest at which the employer in the course of his trade makes equivalent loans for similar purposes at arm's length to persons other than employees or their spouses;</P>
    <P>I cannot think of any particular loan or any particular situation that falls within the ambit of those words.  Will the Minister indicate what situation he has in mind there?</P>
    <P>I would also like the Minister to address the question of the reduction in the benefit in kind in section 4.  This is confined to persons who have got preferential loans for mortgage purposes.  A loan for a mortgage is one of the very few loans on which the taxpayer can claim against his income for tax purposes. Despite that, these are the people who are benefitting by the reduction in the benefit in kind on which they will be taxed under section 4.  In other words, mortgage holders are being given an advantage twice over as a result of section 4.  They can claim the interest against their income for tax purposes and those with preferential loans will now be paying tax on a benefit in kind which is substantially less than the benefit in kind on which other preferential borrowers will pay income tax.  Will the Minister indicate why this is the case, why persons who have preferential loans other than loans for mortgage purposes will be at a double advantage as against persons with <Col N="2312" /> preferential loans for mortgage purposes?I agree that the category of persons who can claim interest on loans against their income for tax purposes is now very limited.  However, the Minister will be aware that certain categories of persons who borrow money to purchase shares in a company can claim the interest against their income for tax purposes.  If those people are given those loans now at a preferential rate they will pay tax on a notional benefit in kind which is equivalent to the difference between the actual preferential rate and 12 per cent. When replying will the Minister say why the benefit in kind in this case is not reduced to the difference between the preferential rate and 10 per cent, the same as it is for mortgage borrowers?</P>
    <P>Section 5 deals with mortgage interest relief and it further restricts the amount of relief which can be claimed against one's income for mortgage purposes from 90 per cent of the amount borrowed to 80 per cent.  The maximum limits of £4,000 in the case of a married person and £2,000 in the case of a single person are continued.  There has been much comment on this and I notice that the comments being made from the Opposition benches during the debate on the budget when this was first announced are very different from the comments now being made.  With the resurgence of the inflationary problem, the Government strategy in further restricting mortgage interest relief is now obvious.  In 1987, when mortgage relief was first restricted to 90 per cent of the interest paid, the mortgage rate here was 12½ per cent.  Now as a result of sound fiscal and financial policies over the past two years it is down to 8¼ per cent.  The greatest impact of the initial restriction and now of this further restriction will be on those on the highest marginal tax rates and that is how it should be.  Even with this further restriction and taking mortgage interest at 8¼ per cent, a single person can still claim full income tax relief on up to as much as £20,000 borrowed to purchase a house and a married person can claim full income tax relief on up to £40,000.  In view of the concern expressed even in <Col N="2313" /> this morning's papers and the comments by the Minister for the Environment yesterday and of various economists who have been warning us about the dangers of inflation coming back into the economy, fuelled largely by galloping house prices, this is a very reasonable provision indeed.</P>
    <P>The Government are no doubt conscious of what has happened in the UK over the last few years.  Property values, particularly in the southeast, escalated dramatically with the result that the value of people's collateral increased beyond their wildest dreams and this enabled them to borrow.  This also gave the financial institutions an incentive to lend and in turn there was an incentive to borrow along with the capacity to borrow more because of the general atmosphere of confidence that was generated.  This resulted in a huge increase in consumer spending, a great deal of which went on imports which threw the UK balance of payments out of line.  Last year the Chancellor predicted a deficit in the balance of payments of about £4 billion.  As a result of irresponsibly reducing rates of taxation, of escalating house prices and increased consumer expenditure, the UK net balance of payments deficit for last year ended up in the region of £18 billion as opposed to a forecast of from £3 to £4 billion.  The result is that there is pressure on the currency.  The Chancellor had to raise interest rates no less than 13 or 14 times in a period of less than 12 months in order to protect sterling because if sterling is allowed to drop imported inflation in the UK will put the situation completely out of control.  We must avoid that.  We are in the advantageous position of having seen what has happened there. We must take remedial action to avoid that here.  The restriction on mortgage interest relief is one such action that can properly be taken here.  If similar action had been taken in the UK to control house prices, I doubt that they would be in as bad a situation as they are today.</P>
    <P>The other factor about mortgage interest relief is that even with the reduction to 80 per cent, the cost to the Exchequer in tax foregone will be £165 <Col N="2314" /> million in the tax year 1989-90.  That is a considerable bonus to persons purchasing houses.  It is no more nor less than a transfer of resources to home owners at the expense of all taxpayers including persons who cannot afford to get on the first rung of the housing ladder.  In present circumstances with the economic backdrop to this Finance Bill, the Government cannot be expected to provide more.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell worried about persons on fixed interest, those who took out local authority loans at a fixed rate of 12 per cent. The Deputy's argument was that the restrictions which we are introducing for other taxpayers on mortgages should not apply to those people because they have not benefited from the drop in interest rates.  I am not unsympathetic to that approach and I would not fall out with the Minister if he did something about it but if I were in the Minister's position I would be inclined to do nothing about it because when interest rates were raging into the mid teens nobody suggested that persons with local authority loans paying interest at the rate of 12 per cent should be penalised <i>vis-à-vis</i> other taxpayers because they had the advantage.If we were to do something now to give them a tax advantage <i>vis-à-vis</i> other taxpayers because they are paying interest at a fixed rate when interest rates have dropped, we will be driven inexorably to the conclusion that if interest rates rise again above their fixed rate of repayment we will have to penalise them <i>vis-à-vis</i> the other taxpayers because the pendulum has now swung the other way and the advantage has shifted to them. Rather than get into that sort of situation, it would be better to leave well enough alone.  I shall not fall out with the Minister if he wants to do something about the matter, but my view is that people take on fixed interest rates for better or for worse.  They must take their chances.  The pendulum can swing one way or other. We should not punish them tax-wise if the interest rate goes down any more than we should use the Finance Bill to <Col N="2315" /> penalise them if the interest rate goes up above what they have been paying.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan, Fine Gael spokesman, made reference to indexation of the maximum amount claimable if interest rates go up again.  I am unsympathetic to that type of provision in a Finance Bill.  I do not agree with an automatic mechanism that operates according to how the interest rate moves.  If a similar situation occurred here as occurred in the United Kingdom and interest rates rose by almost 90 per cent &mdash; as happened over a 12 month period in the United Kingdom &mdash; the budgetary figures put before the Dáil by the Minister for Finance on 25 January would be £100 million out of line. If Deputy Noonan's suggestion had been taken on board, because of the increase in mortgage interest relief which would automatically apply and the increased tax forgone, the revenue side of the account would drop by about that amount.  If that were so no Minister for Finance could plan the nation's finances.  One would not know where one would be at the end of the year.  One cannot predict what will happen to the rate of interest.  If the tax take depends to such a large extent on the rate of interest, the Minister might as well not do the figures on it at all.</P>
    <P>In his contribution to the budget debate, Deputy Noonan recognised the delicate state of the nation's finances &mdash; I give him credit for that.  He adverted to the fact that we had to get the figures practically dead on.  I quote from his speech in Volume 386 of the Official Report dated 25 January 1989 at column 277.  This refers to the current deficit and the Government borrowing requirements.Deputy Noonan said:</P>
    <P>On the totality of the figure the Minister goes just over £1 billion on the debt &mdash; £1.057 million is the figure he has come in with.  I know the sentiment in this city among the people who will be funding this deficit, who were saying during the week that if the Minister passed £1,050 million they were going to get very uneasy and if he passed <Col N="2316" /> £1,100 million the game was over.  The Minister is very close to the fringe.</P>
    <P>It was not a Fianna Fáil spokesman or member of the Government who said that, but Deputy Noonan.  This is the very man who is now looking for an automatic mechanism to be inserted in the Finance Bill.  In the event of interest rate increases as happened in the United Kingdom, we would be not £50 million over target but £100 million.  That is undesirable.  It is bad law, inappropriate in a Finance Bill and I urge the Minister to reject it.</P>
    <P>Section 7 deals with the business expansion scheme.  This is a scheme of tax concessions for investment in certain businesses.  Originally it was confined to the manufacturing industry.  It was introduced by a former Minister for Finance &mdash; I think Deputy Bruton rather than Deputy Dukes.  When introduced initially it proved to be very restrictive.  Two years ago it was widened considerably to allow the business expansion scheme funds to go into other areas of the economy. Unfortunately, because of the Government's liberalism and their desire to see these funds spread into other areas of the economy and the restrictions lifted and loosened, this scheme has been abused out of all proportion.</P>
    <P>There have been statements in the media, two from firms of accountants in the newspapers this morning, urging the Government to withdraw section 76 which contains anti-avoidance provisions.It was necessary to bring in this section because down the years successive Governments had given tax reliefs to get direct funds into particular areas of the economy, tax relief such as allowing capital acquisition losses because it was inequitable to do otherwise.Instead of being glad that they got those reliefs, tax advisers and some of their clients have abused them and turned them into mechanisms of the most blatant and arrogant form of tax avoidance.  It was necessary for the Government to move drastically to stop that.</P>
    <P>The cost to the Exchequer of the business expansion scheme was rising quickly <Col N="2317" /> before the Budget Statement of 25 January.It came to £2 million in 1986 but has cost £13.5 million already this year with a rush of schemes to beat the 5 April deadline.  It is estimated that up to £70 million may have been raised in BES schemes in the 1988-89 tax year.  The final cost to the Exchequer could be of the order of £30 million.</P>
    <P>The safer BES projects which were being touted around the city carried money-back guarantees so that investors were getting the tax advantage with no risks to themselves.  People were told that they could not lose, that they were backed by a bank which guaranteed the money.  Unfortunately, there are too many people in this country who cannot win.</P>

      <P>I am sorry to interrupt the Deputy, but I feel bound to remind the House that there is a time limit to this debate.  It must conclude this evening.  So far as I know, there are a number of Deputies offering.  I am sure Deputies will have regard to the time factor involved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to mention two aspects briefly.  First, there has been criticism of the general restriction of £2.5 million maximum per qualifying company.I agree with that necessary provision.I have been recommending it for some time.  The initial intention of the Government in introducing the BES tax concession was that small, high risk manufacturing companies, or companies which might not necessarily be in the manufacturing field but be going into a field which might create jobs, would get seed capital.  If any company has already obtained £2.5 million of BES funds &mdash; there will be exceptions, of course &mdash; I cannot see why they could not borrow whatever they need from then on from other sources.  If they are not in a position to do that, there must be something wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 7(d) provides that relief in relation to certain option or guarantee arrangements will not be available unless the investors' shares are purchased at a <Col N="2318" /> price equal to their market value at the time of purchase or acquisition.  It will often prove very difficult indeed to establish the exact market value of those shares.  Nevertheless, I agree with this provision which is necessary and is designed to counteract a particular tax avoidance mechanism.</P>
    <P>Sections 11 to 14 deal with accelerated capital allowances.  The 1988 Finance Act reduced these allowances and these sections continue in that vein.  They are designed basically to restrict the maximum accelerated capital allowances that could be claimed in any one year to 50 per cent of expenditure.  Section 11 deals with machinery and plant, section 12 with industrial buildings and section 13 with farm buildings.</P>

      <P>I am aware of that.  The provisions relating to accelerated capital allowances make no distinction between banks and other financial institutions who purchase machines and buildings for subsequent leasing and persons who purchase them for use in business. Regardless of this point, I welcome the provisions because they are in line with the international trend, which is to reduce the rate at which business can claim capital allowances as a trade off in return for reducing the basic rate of corporation tax.  We have seen a trade off here also where the basic rate has been reduced to 43 per cent from 50 per cent.</P>
      <P>Section 15 deals with toll roads.  I welcome the increase in the capital allowance for toll roads from 50 per cent of the capital expenditure incurred in a period to 31 March 1992.  However, the section restricts the type of income against which these allowances can be claimed.  There is no doubt that this will decrease the attractiveness of the allowances for those who were interested in providing such toll roads as it was hoped that the available capital allowances could be set off against taxable profits from other activities within their company or group.  It may take a long time before a positive cashflow is generated by the toll road and therefore the restriction of the allowances to such income seems to be harsh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the provisions in the Bill relating to collective investment undertakings.The Minister had indicated that the present system of taxing unit trusts is out of line with what is happening in other EC countries.  In Ireland unlike every other EC country, if I am not mistaken, <Col N="2320" /> unit trusts are taxable as a unit, but that is now being changed.  With the mobility of capital in particular after 1992 we would have been at a comparative disadvantage with other countries which tax individuals on unit trusts.  It is the Government's intention to eliminate the competitive disadvantage which results from the peculiar nature of our tax laws. However, I question whether the Minister has actually succeeded in doing that. I am worried that the undistributed income of a unit trust is subject to withholding tax, as some of that income can be attributed to foreign investors.  My understanding of sections 16 and 17 is that withholding tax will still apply if some of that income is attributable to a foreign investor and that he would have to apply to the Revenue Commissioners for a rebate of tax.  I understand this does not obtain in other countries which have similar unit trust laws.  Therefore I ask the Minister to look again to see if there is any way we can avoid that situation. Would it be possible to have some provision whereby the undistributed income of a unit trust which is attributable to foreign investment would not bear the withholding tax and that withholding tax would apply only to a proportion of the undistributed income?</P>
    <P>I welcome the provisions in the Bill to restrict the use of section 84 type loans. I had hoped to explain in some detail the basis of section 84 loans but in view of the time limit and the Ceann Comhairle's remarks, I will refrain from doing that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I will, indeed, if we get to that section on Committee Stage.  In 1986 the Government imposed a levy on the banks to limit their section 84 type gains.  However, section 84 lending continued and has exploded from £800 million in that year to £1,300 million last year.  The latest refinement in section 84 lending involves a bank borrowing in high interest currencies, then coverting to low interest currencies, covering the <Col N="2321" /> exchange risk in the currency markets, lending to the customer at the low rates and claiming tax relief at the high rates. That is an ingenious mechanism but it was high time to stamp it out.  Various Deputies wanted to know how much this was costing the Exchequer in terms of tax foregone.  The figure for 1986 was £50 million per annum and this year it has risen to £80 million per annum.  The restriction introduced in the Bill will put a ceiling on the tax leakage and then it will be sharply reduced as non-manufacturing firms based in Shannon are forced to phase out domestically sourced loans by the end of 1991.  The Government are concerned only with domestically sourced section 84 loans and are not concerned with foreign based loans because the tax leakage is from foreign exchequers.</P>
      <P>I welcome the provisions relating to capital gains tax.  One wonders what benefit capital gains tax is to the economy.  I notice the Minister did not give the figure for revenue accruing to the Government from capital gains tax but gave an overall figure of £45 million for capital taxation. In my opinion taxing capital gains is of very little benefit to the Irish economy at this point in time.  We have heard arguments from the Left about the low level of capital taxation and how that demonstrates we are living in an unfair economy.We are living in a very delicate economy and the confidence in it was shattered from 1982 to 1987&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a good debate on the Financial Resolution relating to the flat rate VAT refund for farmers.  Deputies will be aware of how the value-added tax system works.  Paying back value-added tax at a flat rate to unregistered farmers is an exception to the general way in which value-added tax operates.  Any businessman who wants a VAT refund has to register.  Most farm outputs are mainly zero rated.  Therefore most farmers would be permanently due refunds. If most farmers were to register it would involve great inconvenience and expense for themselves as well as administratively.Therefore, the Government &mdash; I do not remember which Government &mdash; decided, rightly, that to avoid all this administrative nonsense, worry, inconvenience <i>et cetera</i> on the part of farmers, they would try to calculate what VAT they paid on inputs as a proportion of the total value of their output and repay that by way of flat rate repayment pitched at the appropriate percentage.  To work out the percentage for unregistered farmers simply take the figure for output and the <Col N="2323" /> figure for VAT they have paid on their inputs.  The latter is a fraction of the former.  People in the Department of Finance tell me the figure is of the order of 1.4 to 2.5 per cent.</P>
    <P>When this system was first introduced the rate was 2.4 per cent rebate.  It was reduced in stages to 1.7 per cent and then to 1.4 per cent.  Now the Minister proposes to increase it to 2 per cent. Apparently the reason for the reduction from 2.4 per cent progressively to 1.4 per cent was that farmers were in arrears with their income levies, health levies <i>et cetera</i>.  Admittedly, if this was so &mdash; I have no reason to assume it was not &mdash; reducing the amount of flat rate VAT refund is a rather crude instrument because you are dealing with the sector as a whole and farmers who were up to date with their levies, health contributions <i>et cetera</i> were punished as were those who had defaulted, had not paid them in time and were in arrears. However, if on the one side the Government have financial obligations, the Government owe money to a sector and on the other hand that sector owes money to the Government, if that sector does not pay the Government fully what it owes, should the Government pay that sector what they owe it?  As I have said, it is a crude instrument.  The innocent are punished with the guilty.  There was considerable improvement in payment last year.  There is some speculation as to whether that was due to the tax amnesty or a sudden change of heart on the part of the farming community.  I am willing to give the farmers the benefit of the doubt.</P>
    <P>Deputy De Rossa in his contribution on the Financial Resolutions on 25 January said that last year farmers paid £42 million in income tax and their flat rate VAT rebate amounted to £80 million.  He went on to suggest that farmers were costing the Exchequer money in the sense that they were getting back twice as much as they paid in.  That demonstrates a misunderstanding.The £80 million flat rate VAT repaid to farmers represented only a proportion of what those farmers had <Col N="2324" /> already paid by way of VAT.  Income tax is a separate thing altogether.  Since the flat rate VAT was introduced, every year unregistered farmers paid more than they got back.  In some cases I estimate they got back roughly only half what they paid over.  To say that last year farmers paid £42 million in income tax and got back £80 million VAT is a facile argument.  I would say last year unregistered farmers paid something in the order of £130 million to £140 million in VAT.  They were getting back only a proportion of that.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains provisions in two different Parts to allow the Collector-General of Taxes to allow business people who are paying VAT to pay it on a yearly basis or any basis less regular than the usual two monthly basis.  It also provides for allowing employers who are deducting PAYE and PRSI from their employees to pay this to the Exchequer on a yearly basis or on some basis less regular than the usual monthly basis.  I am glad the Collector-General is being given a discretion here because the Collector-General's office is not noted for its liberalism or radicalism.  Business with a high turnover and low profit margin can get into very severe financial difficulty. Even if they are only a few months in arrears with their VAT, that can be sufficient to drive such a business to the wall and I have seen that happen.  As far as PAYE and PRSI are concerned I urge the Collector-General to exercise his discretion sparingly.  We are all aware of what has pertained and still pertains where employers need no section of any Finance Bill or encouragement from Government or any other source to withhold PAYE and PRSI not just for a period longer than they were supposed to hold it but to hold on to it altogether. Of all the hard cases, hardship and misery experienced during the recent economic recession, the most traumatic case I have come across concerned employees whose PRSI and PAYE have been deducted from their wages week in week out regularly and then their company goes into liquidation and when they apply for social welfare they find the employer has not paid over for the last six months, the last <Col N="2325" /> year or the last two years what he has taken from them for the Revenue Commissioners to whom it is supposed to be paid.  An employer who behaves so is beneath contempt and I would not like to think the Collector-General would exercise his discretion under the Income Tax (Employment) Regulations, 1989, (S.I. No. 58 of 1989) in such a way as to give any encouragement to that tendency.</P>
    <P>In his Budget Statement the Minister said, as reported in the Official Report, 25 January 1989, column 250, Volume 386, and I quote:</P>
    <P>There has been considerable concern expressed in recent years about the steady outflow of works of art for sale abroad and particular mention has been made of the impediment which VAT at 25 per cent represents to their reimportation.  In order to facilitate the retention and relocation in Ireland of works of art over 100 years old I propose to reduce the VAT rate on their sale and importation to 10 per cent.  A new zero rate is not possible under EC rules.  The reduction to 10 per cent will take effect from 1 July next and will cost the Exchequer £0.3 million this year.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on section 56 of the Bill where he goes beyond his budgetary aspiration.  He has provided this relief regardless of the age of the work of art in question.  I welcome that. It is generally speaking for the good.  It must be a very rare happening.</P>
    <P>On section 56 I want to draw a small matter to the Minister's attention.  The definition of the various items which are affected by the change is not entirely clear.  I am not quite sure why subparagraphs (a) and (b) of section 56 do not deal with mass produced items. Deferring to the Ceann Comhairle's previous ruling, that is possibly more appropriate for Committee Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the extension of self-assessment to capital acquisitions <Col N="2326" /> tax.  Section 67 is particularly valuable. At present when a person is assessed by the Revenue Commissioners for capital acquisitions tax he has three months to deliver a return and one further month after the delivery of the return to pay his tax.  I am glad the Minister is extending the four months' amnesty where a person assesses himself.  It is entirely right and logical.</P>
      <P>Section 70 deals with cases where persons assessing themselves for capital gains tax purposes undervalue the assets which are to be the subject of the tax. The whole idea of self-assessment is that we trust the taxpayer and depend on his integrity.  If the taxpayer is caught out undervaluing assets in this way it is only right and proper that there should be some provision to penalise him as a discouragement to others.  The section is welcome but I am not happy that it is entirely clear that the surcharge refers to tax on the real value of the property, the value which the Revenue Commissioners, and presumably any independent tribunal to whom the matter has been referred, decide the property is worth.  The Explanatory Memorandum refers to the tax ultimately due but there is no such reference in the text of the Bill. The Minister might consider that point with a view to ensuring that the surcharge will apply to the tax on the final value of the property, not the undervalue which gives rise to the surcharge in the first place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 37 (4) of the Capital Acquisitions Tax Act, 1976 provides that a return has to be made on a form provided by the Revenue Commissioners.  Section 73 of this Bill adds to that to provide for cases of self-assessment.  A return can now be made on a form approved by the Revenue Commissioners.  How will that approval manifest itself in practice?  Will the Revenue Commissioners publish a list of the returns which will be acceptable?Do they have to write back within a particular period saying that a return is acceptable?  Does silence imply consent? If a person does not hear from the Revenue Commissioners after a reasonable period may he assume that the return is <Col N="2327" /> acceptable?  The position should be clarified.</P>
    <P>I welcome that part of section 74 which extends the favoured nephew provision. The additional concession will cover a very small number of persons.  It covers the case where a disponer gives a limited interest to himself and the remainder to his nephew.  There is no question of extending the scope of the favoured nephew provision.  The disponer is the person who creates the limited interest.  If anybody else creates the limited interest then that other person is the disponer and the relationship between the nephew and that other person is the relationship that will operate for capital acquisitions tax purposes.  Referring to the favoured nephew concession, the Explanatory Memorandum, which was presumably written by the Revenue Commissioners, states:</P>
    <P>This concession is being retained, and it is being extended by this section to gifts and inheritances taken by a nephew or niece on the expiration of a limited interest created by the disponer....  At the same time, the opportunity is being taken, in the context of a self-assessment tax, to set out for the guidance of a taxpayer the minimum hours of work constituting &ldquo;working substantially on a full-time basis&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I have a suspicious nature but I am very sceptical of any offer of help or guidance from the Revenue Commissioners.Unfortunately, in this case my suspicion is borne out.  The second part of section 74 is a crude attempt to cut considerably the scope of this relief, which the Revenue Commissioners never liked in the first place.  They have done so by setting out the number of hours that constitute &ldquo;working substantially on a full-time basis&rdquo;.  In the case of AE versus the Revenue Commissioners in 1984 the High Court decided that a woman who milked cows for her uncle for an hour in the morning and an hour in the evening qualified as a favoured niece, but she would not qualify under <Col N="2328" /> this section.  I note that a child from the age of 15 upwards can be taken to be working substantially on a full-time basis. It is most unreasonable to have a requirement that anybody of schoolgoing age or furthering their education beyond schoolgoing age into their early twenties&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree to have his officials look at this again with a view to reducing the number of hours? Would he also elaborate on what the word &ldquo;exclusively&rdquo; means in line 46 of page 68?

    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been much debate about section 76.  A number of accountants have issued reports asking that this section be withdrawn.  One must remember that the Minister did not come in here on a malicious whim deciding to punish so and so.  There is a long and dishonourable background to the introduction of section 76.  It arises because reliefs, allowances and concessions which have been given in this House over the years have been abused.  The Minister is right to close the loophole.  The main question raised by Opposition Deputies, particularly <Col N="2329" /> Deputy McDowell, relates to the limited appeal procedure.  The Revenue Commissioners will form an opinion that a transaction is a tax avoidance transaction.The courts have no jurisdiction to say whether that opinion is right or wrong.  They can only say whether it is reasonable that the Revenue Commissioners have arrived at such a conclusion.I must have read about 500 UK tax cases where a High Court judge, an Appeal Court judge or a Member of the House of Lords said, referring to a decision of the special commission on taxation in the United Kingdom, that he would not have arrived at that conclusion himself.  The issue has been raised whether that limitation on the power of the courts to hear appeals is unconstitutional.I have studied the matter and it is my opinion that it is not.  This legislation is long overdue.</P>
    <P>I wanted to say much more but because there are other speakers I will not.  I started last night by wishing the Minister well.  I want to take this opportunity to do so again.  I am confident he will make a success of his new brief.  It is in the interest not only of the Government but of the country as a whole that he does.

      <P>First, I would like to thank Deputy Hegarty for allowing me this slot.  It would appear, listening to Deputy O'Dea, that the world has passed him by and he has not noticed.  We have a Finance Bill of 100 pages with an Explanatory Memorandum of 15 pages dealing with finances for the current year and, to the ordinary man or woman, and indeed some Members of this House, it means damn all.  It is good, I suppose, that there is the odd individual like Deputy O'Dea who is prepared to come in and tease this thing out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2330" /> The situation in this House at the moment is very unreal with the Government Party being supported totally by the second largest party in the House.  I am referring to Deputy Dukes and all those who support him; I am not one of them at the moment since the Whip was removed from me, so I am speaking as an independent.I cannot understand why a party that is supposed to act as an Opposition are acting the way they are.  Hundreds of people around the country have expressed the opinion that the general scene is unhealthy and the youth are emigrating at a desperate rate, but nobody seems anxious to do anything about it. This is what we should be talking about rather than what we have heard during the last hour from Deputy O'Dea.  I regret that the party elected to oppose are now collaborating in this way with the Government.  The only opposition I see in this House is from the Labour Party.  It is necessary for Fine Gael to take up the issues and they are failing to do it; they are failing in their role as an Opposition.</P>
    <P>It is what is not in this Finance Bill that I want to talk about.  Recently I heard the chairman of the Southern Health Board talking on radio about the imminent collapse of the board.  The same applies right around the country.  People have to wait weeks for simple medical treatment or operations.  Children are awaiting orthodontic treatment, and if they do no get it before they reach a certain age it will be too late.  Nobody seems to care and nothing is being done.  I know money is tight, but there is a section of the community that cannot afford to have these treatments done privately and on behalf of whom nobody is speaking, and money should be channelled in their direction. The Labour Party say their bit now and again, as do Fine Gael; but when the time comes to go into the lobbies and express opinions as they should be expressed, they will not do it because they are scared the Taoiseach will call an election and obliterate them entirely.</P>
    <P>When I was Junior Minister for Health in 1985 the chief executive of the Eastern <Col N="2331" /> Health Board almost fought with the secretary of the Department of Health about the allocation of funds.  I had to stand between them to stop them from fighting. The chairman complained that he and his board members had built up services in the western area and they were now being decimated.  They were not, in fact; there was a small belt tightening exercise.  The chairman was upset about it and was continuously available to go on television with other members of the board or on his own to criticise the Government of the day.  Today the situation is much worse but I hear no complaint from the Minister of State or from the chairman, Deputy Doherty, who is now seeking election to Europe and who is presiding over the decimation of the services in the western area.  His predecessor who is a member of the European Parliament and also seeking election is not complaining either.  It is ironic that those who complained so loudly then are silent now.  I would like to see some money to help alleviate&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you very much for your guidance, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.I just wanted to make the point that the Minister could amend the Finance Bill in such a way as to provide money for health.  The health cuts hurt the sick, the old and the handicapped and now, with the collaboration of the second largest party in the Dáil, the health services are being decimated.  I would like to see money being provided and I am entitled, within the bounds of this 100 page Bill, to ask for that.  I am not asking for too much, just a little.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2332" /> What was once a primary industry here is now reduced to a secondary one, again with the co-operation of the second largest party in the Dáil.  Most people and many farmers are not aware that one cannot have an adviser now from an agricultural institute without paying £30.  If you are in the category of a big farmer you have to pay £50 and for subsequent visits you also have to pay.  Originally it cost £42 million to run the new allembracing agricultural body, Teagasc, but that has now been reduced to £28 million.  Where is the remaining £14 million going?  As I see it the first thing that has been done is to reduce the number of staff by 600.  It is then expected that the farmers will give about £4 million in contributions.  The fabric of rural society is being broken down and will eventually go beyond the point of no return.  As a result there will not be the revenue one would expect to be generated in small towns and villages.</P>
    <P>There has been a lot of talk about closures.  The one that got the most publicity in recent times was the closure of the Thurles Sugar Factory.  I do not know whether that decision was right or wrong. It would be hard to identify which side the Minister for Agriculture and Food was on.  Tuam sugar factory closed three years ago and no replacement industry has been set up since.  It is only now that the people in that area feel the pinch of that closure.  I am warning the people in the Thurles area to beware.</P>
    <P>As I have said, there is mass emigration.  There is not a family that has not been affected by it.  In some cases entire families have emigrated.  We are getting the finances of the State right but there will not be too many around, if there are benefits in the future, to enjoy them.  Recently a clothing factory in Longford closed down with the loss of 250 jobs.  There was not a word about the closure of Castlebar bacon factory.  The factory in Claremorris is being run down until it can be suitably taken over.  That factory catered for many families down through the years and nobody is saying anything now to prevent its closure. There is no political clout in that area <Col N="2333" /> which has two Fianna Fáil representatives and one Fine Gael representative, and that is the way the position will remain.</P>
    <P>I noticed on a television programme that emigrants were brought over on St. Patrick's Day to provide the little battle between the two bands in the St. Patrick's Day parade in Achill.  It is regrettable that there was not enough locals to take part.  I suggest to Deputy Denis Gallagher that in the first half of the competition next year he can play with one band and in the second half he can play with the other.  Recently a member of the Fine Gael Front Bench advocated &mdash; I do not know whether or not it is their policy &mdash; that there should be free telephone calls for Irish emigrants.  What a lousy contribution.</P>
    <P>Before the 1985 local authority elections the Taoiseach said the Government would give £500 million towards county roads.  I suppose £1,000 million will buy off the electorate in the next elections. They talk big.  By 1995 we will not need to be talking about these roads because there will not be many people travelling on most of them.  In all probability the entire population will have emigrated. There are water charges, refuse collection charges and many other charges but in many cases the water supply is not even fit for human consumption.  Many announcements have been made by the Minister, Deputy Flynn, about sewerage schemes&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Indeed it is not.  Of course without a little political clout you <Col N="2334" /> will not come within any of these announcements being made by the Minister, Deputy Flynn.  I know that Border security, by virtue of the better co-operation &mdash; if I was to quote the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mr. Tom King, when speaking on the &ldquo;Late Late Show&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>By virtue of the fact that there is now better co-operation between North and South &mdash; to quote Mr. King &mdash; under Prime Minister Haughey, Minister Lenihan and that Republican from Limerick, Minister Collins, we will not have to spend the same amount of money there as was spent previously.  I am sure there will be a saving in that area and that the money can be spent elsewhere.  Of course we all knew there was exceptional co-operation between that party and the authorities in the North, as the Dowra case proved.  I think there was a reciprocal arrangement some time later.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, I am surprised that a special allocation was not provided in the budget this year for the Gaelic Athletic Association.  When it did not appear in the budget I thought it would be in the Finance Bill but I regret to say that is not the case.  There was talk of DIRT, VAT on hurley sticks, rates on GAA grounds and buildings and even hospital closures and health services.  The questions of emigration and extradition, issues that are also close to the GAA, also arise but they are not saying one word about them.  I thought that the GAA, for keeping as quiet as they have done, would have been given a special grant but I am sorry to say that has not been done.  Were it not for the fact that I have a couple of friends standing for the European elections I would express my opinion a lot more clearly.  However, people generally know what I mean.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dennehy</NameTxt>
      <P>That shows my inexperience and lack of time in the House. Despite the amount of publicity the Deputy got in the recent past, he is worried about opposition and the lack of it, particularly, as he said, from the second largest party.  He said that the only opposition that is evident is from the Labour Party.  What I, as a fairly newcomer, would like to ask him, with his experience, is to define opposition.  That is fairly important.  Should it be the long hard slog of trying to produce alternative policies, the nitty-gritty of going through legislation &mdash; in this case the Finance Bill &mdash; dealing with items that may later be used or abused in the High Court or the Supreme Court to get millions of pounds from people, as has happened in the recent past, or should it be the kind of mischievous attack on individuals or on Government policies?  A recent example was the criticisms of the beef industry and the stand taken in regard to the price of petrol.  Is that what the Deputy thinks being in Opposition should be about? Does he think the Opposition should undermine the economy?  Should we oppose submissions made for European funding?  Is he referring to opposition for the sake of getting publicity in the newspapers in the run up to the European elections?  I do not think that is the role an Opposition should play.  I hope we have seen the end of the personalised type of opposition.  All Members should be willing to contribute to debates on legislation going through the House in an effort to seal off any loopholes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been mention of close downs but I should like to remind the House that in Cork we lost Fords, Dunlops, Verolme Cork Dockyard and 37 other small companies.  There was not too much fuss about those closures and I have copies of suggestions put forward at the time as to what should be done. <Col N="2336" /> However, very little was done.  In regard to policies for the Cork region we are at last emerging from the nightmare that we experienced over many years.  In the last week we have heard the good news about Whitegate and I am sure Members like Deputy Hegarty will welcome it.  Some people suggested that we should sell Whitegate, that it was a white elephant and a millstone around the necks of the taxpayers.  Now we are being told that we should do something else with it.  It has been purchased for the nation and could be a crucial factor in taking on the Seven Sisters and others.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the call on the Minister to withdraw section 76 which deals with tax avoidance.  I accept that there is a need for careful drafting in any Bill but it is important to bear in mind that those in the PAYE sector have welcomed that section.  We are all aware of the few notorious cases which forced the Minister to take this action.  We are all aware of the abuses of the BES and other legitimate avoidance schemes.  It is unfortunate that some people were not satisfied with those schemes and sought a redefinition of tax provisions from the courts in an effort to gain further concessions.  The hall-mark of the Government has been their willingness to face up to such abuses and to act speedly to close them off.  For example, they acted speedily to cut off tax evasion at the Border and were criticised for doing so.  I was shocked to hear one of my constituency colleagues, an old experienced hand, Deputy Peter Barry, saying that we should not tamper with the conditions there, that we should be good Europeans and so on.  I cannot understand why he made such a statement at a time when the traders this side of the Border were being bled dry.  I am pleased that there has not been too much fuss about that issue since.  The Government have also faced up to the abuse of the tax avoidance schemes and sealed the loopholes.  That is what the public admire most about this Administration.  My advice to the Minister for Finance is to retain section 76.  In fact, he should, if possible, strengthen it.</P>
    <P>Another issue that was kicked around <Col N="2337" /> last week was the warning by the Central Bank on property prices and the dangers involved.  There has been a negative reaction to that warning from the building societies, and, as far as I know, the banks have not reacted.  It is important to stress that there are dangers inherent in what is taking place.</P>
    <P>The increases in the price of house property have been crazy.  In my view, encouraging people to seek bigger mortgages to follow such increases is dangerous.  There is the danger of fuelling inflation although we are all determined to keep it down.  I should like to ask the banks, the building societies and other lending agencies if they have forgotten what the farming community experienced some years ago. At that time there was so much money around that the lending institutions sponsored seminars throughout the country to explain to farmers how easy it was to borrow money, how they should borrow more to improve their holdings and, in particular, buy extra land.  Farmers were encouraged to bid against one another and to borrow beyond their means.  We are all aware that when the change came they were unable to meet the payments.</P>
    <P>Everything was grand until interest rates increased and the unfortunate borrowers were unable to meet the extra cost involved.  The banks were not very sympathetic when that occurred.  If the bubble bursts again I wonder if the banks, or the building societies, will be sympathetic to the mortgage holder who will find it difficult to meet the repayments.  I do not think so.  Their record shows that they will not.</P>
    <P>There is money available thanks to the careful housekeeping by the Government.The Government are borrowing less and because the money is available lending institutions are tempted to lend above what is called the standard income related levels.  If they continue to do that untold damage will be done to the economy.A rule of thumb which was applied to lending has been breached.  I appeal to the lending institutions not to let greed change their normal conservative guidelines.I advise mortgage holders not to over extend themselves and to allow for <Col N="2338" /> possible increases in interest rates.  It is important that they should bear in mind that banks may be unsympathetic partners if they find themselves in financial difficulties.  Those intending to purchase property should bear in mind that the Government, by careful management of the public finances, have been able to keep our interest rates approximately 6 per cent below UK rates.  At one time we did not think that would be possible but it has been achieved.  There is a danger that outside influences will push up our rates.  If house prices continue at their crazy level there is a danger that interest rates will be increased.</P>
    <P>People should not forget what happened to the farmers some years ago.  I advise people not to borrow beyond the limit of their ability to repay.  In fact, they should not go too close to their limit.  If interest rates are increased people may find that they are beyond their ability to meet the increases.  That is an important message, even more important than the danger of fuelling inflation.  I am sure Deputy Hegarty will be able to tell the House of the difficulties farmers experienced some years ago.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance on many occasions has admitted that more must be done in regard to personal taxation. Now the argument is how quickly or radically the change should be.  It must be accepted that in the last two years we have seen the greatest changes in the taxation system since the foundation of the State.  They took place under this Administration who will continue on that course.  We have seen what could be described as radical changes had not people come up with the woolly-headed idea of a 25 per cent standard rate of tax off the top of their heads.  We must continue to do more.  More will be done as we get our economy under greater control, and greater reliefs can be given.</P>
    <P>Yesterday we heard Deputy Desmond O'Malley seeking radical changes in taxation.We saw the results in Britain of their endeavouring to do too much too quickly in that respect.  Deputy O'Malley quoted the British rates of taxation, demonstrating in a very negative fashion how <Col N="2339" /> they could affect us here.  However, he did not couple with that another directly related factor, that is, prevailing interest rates.  If he wanted to portray an honest picture of the overall economic position he should have linked the two.  Deputy O'Malley must accept that, in endeavouring to alter one too quickly we have somewhat curtailed the other, that being our ability to repay the taxpayer. However, the control of interest rates is a definite point in our favour which he should have mentioned.</P>
    <P>It must be said of Deputy Desmond O'Malley that always he wants radical and immediate solutions to all problems. I can remember very clearly the arrogance of that Deputy when, as a Minister of my party, he saw the answer to Ireland's energy problems in the establishment of a nuclear plant.  His attitude then was &mdash; to hell with the objectors &mdash; including those in our party at the time who were worried about the proposal. His radical proposal was not feasible then, nor do I believe his present radical proposal of a 25 per cent standard tax rate to be feasible.  The public now accept what is being done; they accept the necessity for control and acknowledge that their interests are being served by this party's efforts to facilitate them and to meet their needs.</P>
    <P>Deputy Jim Mitchell yesterday described a colleague of mine as being an economic illiterate.  I listened carefully to him.  If that phrase were to be used by many Deputies I would regard it as a serious insult and would be regrettable. However, emanating from somebody like Deputy Jim Mitchell with his proven track record and reputation for never really meaning anything he says, it can be interpretated as just another off-thetop-of-his-head statement.  Like all his later statements, it was incorrect because the person to whom he referred &mdash; to use the jargon of my area &mdash; would lose him on economic affairs and most other matters, if I might put it that way.</P>
    <P>The Deputy went on to make other factually incorrect statements.  He engaged in a long, rambling comparison <Col N="2340" /> of figures between 1982 and 1987.  At no stage did he comment on the key statistic of that period, a figure mentioned again here this morning, relating to our national debt.  He did not tell us that when he and the remainder of his colleagues at the time took over in 1983, as a nation we owed £12 billion.  That debt had been accumulated over 60 odd years, granted much of it since 1977, we had been borrowing.The Deputy also failed to tell us that when that Government &mdash; which must surely go down in history as one of the most divided and possibly inept ever to administer this country &mdash; left office, they had managed to double that debt. Within a very short period, as a nation we owed over £24 billion; that is a fact and it is on record.  Lest anybody attempt later to talk about opposition to that Government, about how we shouted at that time, it must also be put on record that that was a majority Government unlike the present one which is a minority one.</P>

However, they were not always in a majority position.  At one stage, towards the end of their term, one group dived for cover.  The remainder, including Deputy Jim Mitchell, brazened it out for a few months.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDennehy" hpid="Mr. Dennehy Mr. Dennehy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dennehy</NameTxt>
      <P>I must refer to various points raised by Deputies.  For example, Deputy Jim Mitchell did not tell us yesterday that, in doubling the national debt &mdash; this is important because it relates to what Deputy Donnellan had to say a while ago about health matters and so on &mdash; his Government burdened taxpayers with additional debt service charges which, if available to this Government today, probably would cover all our health costs.</P>
      <P>I must say I was most unfair to Deputy Carey and his colleagues last year when, in my eagerness and youthfulness, I said they had squandered it.  Perhaps they did not squander all of it but certainly they spend £12.5 extra billion in four years; that is a lot of money.  The servicing of that debt would pay for all our health costs today.</P>
      <P>Since Deputy Jim Mitchell claimed yesterday that my well qualified and learned colleague is an economic illiterate it is beyond my ability to come up with a suitable title to adequately describe a Deputy with his record.  I will leave it at that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provisions of the Finance Bill cannot be discussed in isolation without reference to the <i>National Development Plan 1989-1993</i>, the national agreement and the overall targets set in the general economic scene supported by the majority of the community including, and most importantly, the leaders of the organised sections of the farming, trade unions and employer groups.  There may be fringe groups or individuals at seminars or meetings contending that something should be changed but the <Col N="2342" /> leadership are with us.  They have said; yes, we are in agreement with you; we might rattle the sabre somewhat but overall we agree with what you are doing for the country.  Therefore it would be reasonable to expect across-the-board support in this House and not, as the last speaker said, opposition for opposition's sake.  Rather, we should get support on the developmental aspects of these plans.</P>
    <P>There is a real danger in interpreting the present reality between the different issues now facing our economy and workforce.Over the past couple of months there have been serious and devious attempts made to undermine Government efforts, even those of individuals. Indeed Members have come into this House and been mischievous in their comments.  They have told falsehoods, untruths, deliberate untruths, as demonstrated even at a meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts a few days ago.  I hope the people of Dublin and the remainder of the country will answer those people when they next have a chance.</P>
    <P>Speaker after speaker has referred to what we regard as our greatest social problem at present, that is unemployment.Yet the same people who complained a couple of years ago about the blackguarding going on in the beef industry, that we should not be exporting beef on the hoof, contending that it should be processed here creating jobs for our workers, now come in here and undermine the whole industry.  They must realise they cannot have it both ways.</P>
    <P>The whole question of creating jobs, in beef processing or oil exploration &mdash; a subject very dear to Deputy Hegarty and me because in our area there is now a free port which can compete with Aberdeen in the servicing of the rigs and so on&mdash;&mdash;</P>

On the question of the European elections I have to say that we were lambasted, when Deputies Hegarty, Carey and one or two others had a go at us and we had to soak up the punishment.

      <P>Deputy Noonan, the Fine Gael spokesman on Finance, said he was disgusted and annoyed with the Government's steady-as-she-goes attitude and one or two commentators outside this House have spoken about a bland budget and Finance Bill.  That is rubbish.  We had courageous daring Ministers, like Deputy Noonan, who ran up our £12.5 billion bill.  If our steady-as-she-goes attitude means getting our foreign debt and balance of payments under control and increasing industrial growth while our Ministers get the best results, I welcome it.  Everytime we feel like getting radical the cost of servicing our national debt should bring us back to reality.</P>
      <P>I think somebody said yesterday that we should throw caution to the wind with regard to tax but I do not think we should, I do not think that in a short period of three to five years we can achieve a 25 per cent rate of tax for everybody, and I think even the least knowledgable people outside are aware that this is not on.  They know that it is a ridiculous scenario to paint in the short term and they agree with the steps the Government are taking at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Major changes have taken place and hopefully these will continue.  The Finance Bill is a very large document but it is needed in our movement forward with regard to the National Development Plan, the European Community regional submissions, the national agreement and <Col N="2347" /> various other initiatives which have been taken, for example, in relation to oil exploration.  We need this Bill to control any abuses in this area and also to encourage initiatives in other areas.</P>
    <P>I wish to conclude by apologising to the two Deputies on the Opposition benches.  If I upset them in any way I am genuinely sorry for doing so, and I am not being facetious in saying that.  Both Deputy Paddy Hegarty and Deputy Donal Carey have been most helpful to me since I came to this House and if I upset them in any way it is because of a lack of experience on my part more than anything else.</P>

      <P>You are putting me at a grave disadvantage, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, before I start.  I have to say that I was surprised at the Deputy's comments because I took him to be a more liberal man.  In fact, when he was Lord Mayor of Cork on one occasion I publicly commented on his performance as being apolitical.  I wish to put it on the record of the House that I was disappointed that the Deputy said John Cushnahan was not worthy to stand for us in Munster.  His family were very much involved in the struggle for Irish freedom and I believe that deep down we all wish for the day when we can live together as one nation. This was a brave step by Fine Gael and I believe it will work out well for them.  I am sorry that that comment was made in the House.</P>

      <P>Going back again to borrowings and what happened between 1983 and 1987, I would have to take the House back a little further to 1977 when the real rot started.  Deputy Deenehy said that farmers got themselves into great difficulties.  It was not the farmers who got themselves into difficulties.  We borrowed substantial sums of money at 6.75 per cent under Richie Ryan, or &ldquo;Richie Ruin&rdquo; as he was called at the time.</P>
      <P>Somebody who is no great friend of ours, and who was at one time a director of the Central Bank, said that if the same Ritchie Ryan had got another term in office in 1977 we would now probably be in the black.  That has to be put into the record.  Furthermore, if Deputy Dennehy or any of his friends were foolish enough to get into debt in 1977, they would know how hard it is to get out of it.  We did not get out of it for four and a half years.  It got worse and it is still not getting any better.  The national debt is the same and we are still paying back £2 billion and will be for a very long time thanks to &ldquo;the bould Jack&rdquo; and &ldquo;the bould Martin&rdquo; in 1977.</P>
      <P>I remember one specific case of a man who borrowed £25,000 in 1976, which was well within his capacity to pay, at 6 per cent.  That man had a farm injury and between 1978 and 1980 that loan increased from £25,000 to £80,000 because he was injured and did not earn any money on his farm.  That was when things went wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2349" /> A Second Stage Finance Bill is not a subject to excite much concern.  The debate is usually one where Deputies hone in on specific areas of concern to us in our own constituencies &mdash; and we did some queer things this morning.  We are now full and active members of the European Monetary System and if we get our priorities right we should now be in a position to do the right things for all of our people.  Everybody agrees that the political consensus on economic management has been particularly beneficial in getting our inflation and interest rates down to the present levels.  We have a good base for economic growth and the creation of employment.  This country can no longer afford to lose its most talented people and this seems to have been the result of this Government's strategy.</P>
    <P>A major reform of our income tax system is more urgent now than ever before.  I welcome the move towards self-assessment as a means of simplifying an already very complex business.  The PAYE sector should, I believe, be given a much broader scope for claiming allowances.For example, they should be able to claim for education costs especially as greater numbers do not qualify for State grants.  The should be allowed to claim the full costs involved in the repair and refurbishment of their homes especially since there are now no grants available for such work.</P>
    <P>In relation to VAT we heard much high tech talk this morning.  Basically, I see VAT as a see-saw operation.  What does the State get at the end of the day with all this to-ing and fro-ing of money and administrative costs?  Is there anything in it for the State at the end of the day?  As somebody said recently, we must get it right first time.</P>
    <P>We are a nation of producers, processors and sales people.  We must convince Europe that we are the best and that our goods are the best so that they will buy our goods and will continue to buy them in still larger quantities.  We produce sales literature and television programmes showing our country in all its beauty and charm.  When visitors come <Col N="2350" /> here they see one of the worst litter problems in Europe.  This will have to change. Money will have to be provided through the Department of the Environment.</P>
    <P>Our country roads are a disgrace and whatever Deputy Donnellan might say, that there will be nobody there to use them, all our infrastructure depends on these roads.  Every load of material from a farm has to go out by means of a farm road and a farm gate.  These are the most vital roads of all.  Any county engineer will tell you that this pothole filling programme of the past few years &mdash; this patch upon patch effort by local authorities &mdash; is, indeed, very shortsighted and unwise.  Our roads are in need of a major overhaul, and they need it now.  In the interests of road safety, would the Minister allocate some few pounds to the county councils to ensure that we get our hedges cut?</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture and Food referred to flora and fauna.  There is no fear of the flora.  We have hedge parsley, angelica and all sorts of umbelliferae almost as tall as the cedars of Lebanon, almost meeting in the middle and nothing is being done about it.  When we ring the county council we get the lame excuse that they do not have the money.  If we are to seriously talk about tourism then, in God's name, allow the tourists to see some of the country, do not trap them in a mass of weeds.</P>
    <P>A document on housing was issued recently by the building societies.  They pointed out, and the Minister raised it yesterday and on television last evening, that we have a problem.  Why have we a problem?  The real problem was not mentioned by the Minister when he rounded on the building societies.  The problem is we are not building houses any more, There is no such thing as a local authority housing scheme.  In my county where we talked about hundreds of houses annually we are now talking about a house here and a house there. Why are houses retailing at inflated prices?  Little matchbox houses in towns are making as much as £20,000 for no other reason than that is all young couples can get for £20,000.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2351" /> With the daily announcements of money from Brussels the Government must introduce a major housing programme.In my own area we have lists as long as your arm of people awaiting council houses.  We have people living in flats that are totally unsuitable for human habitation.  They are more like rabbit warrens.Some of them are several storeys high, with collapsing ceilings, rickety stairways and of course, no emergency exits.  This must stop if we are to have any semblance of a Christian caring society.</P>
    <P>We had plenty of builders but, of course, a number of them have emigrated.An entire house can be built from native, indigenous raw materials, thus creating employment.  Our chippies and masons will return if these houses are built by our local authorities and if money is provided.  We have tenants who will pay the full economic rent for these houses so that they will not be a loss to the State. It will be of multi-benefit to the State because genuine employment will be created &mdash; making blocks to the sawing of timber, to building the houses and paying rent for these houses.</P>
    <P>I am concerned with the policy to push the responsibility for housing loans to banks and building societies.  Banks and building societies are now picking and choosing their clients and local authorities are left basically with low income groups and groups with little security.  In the past the county councils had a better cross section of borrowers and were thus in a better position to service their customers.Now they are left with one section, the weaker section, which, obviously, will cause more problems.  Reconstruction grants must be restored quickly otherwise we will double our national monuments in a matter of a few years. We will have twice as many of them in our towns as we have now if we do not start our reconstruction programme quickly.</P>
    <P>In relation to housing in rural areas many young couples for various reasons &mdash; cheaper sites, love of the country, better environment for rearing their childern &mdash; are keen to build houses in <Col N="2352" /> rural areas.  The land owner, who is often under pressure from his bank, is a very willing customer.  In the past many such land owners sorted out their own financial problems by selling a few sites.  Nowadays, however, it is becoming increasingly difficult for these people to get planning permission within a reasonable period, if at all.  There is no point in blaming the planning officers in their diligence to adhere to the letter of the planning laws.  We in this House make the laws but the time is now ripe for a major overhaul of these laws.</P>
    <P>If otherwise useless land can be utilised for a nice housing development, why not?  We are told we cannot have a proliferation of septic tanks.  In this age of technology it should be the easiest thing in the world to devise some sort of central treatment plant where all these houses could be linked and this would solve the problem.  Much greater social problems have been caused and are being caused by putting too many people together, by cramming them into housing estates, very often in an alien environment without proper services and recreational facilities.Surely modern technology has the answers to the proliferation of septic tanks.</P>
    <P>When we get down to debating this allimportant subject we are given reasons why we cannot build &mdash; the roads are too narrow, one is upsetting the skyline, that there are too many bungalows together and so on.  That is all a lot of rot.  The roads can be widened.  In every other European country the skyline can be protected with a nice little row of conifers. That is no problem to everybody else but it is a problem for us.</P>
    <P>Unemployment is a matter for grave concern in this House and it is dwelt on by the Minister in his budget and in the Finance Bill.  The Minister made the point that we must do better than the emigrant ship.  Dublin, Cork and Rosslare are the modern Queenstowns. Each week, busloads of well educated, well trained, young people leave our shores for the UK.  We must put more real effort into job creation.  FÁS schemes are all right but they are not the <Col N="2353" /> long-term solution.  We have plenty of young entrepreneurs with ideas but they do not get enough help and encouragement to set up in business.  There are so many snags attached to starting one's own business that most people cannot qualify under the FÁS schemes.  Various snags are hampering what is otherwise a very good scheme.  There are people in various State agencies who have a problem for every solution.  People who should encourage others to take high risks when they identify areas which could be successful, are far too negative. I had the experience of such people when I was Minister.  We still import simple household furniture, garden furniture and simple farm machinery which could be produced here.  We have not yet got around to doing that and anybody who has tried has not received the help or encouragement or the seed money to get going on a proper footing.</P>
    <P>We as parliamentary representatives would be gravely lacking in doing our duty if we ignored poverty, the greatest problem of our time.  We meet people at the weekends who are screaming at us to know what we are going to do about the real abject poverty in our midst.  Various voluntary caring organisations have taken it upon themselves to try to do the Government's work in alleviating poverty and hunger.  The Society of St. Vincent de Paul has expanded to every town and hamlet and a plethora of new charitable groups have been set up to cope with the growing problem.  The Government should start by restoring our welfare homes.  These homes cost money but a lot of people who cannot afford to look after themselves and who have nobody to look after them were well cared for in these homes both spiritually and medically.One of the worst things this Government did was to close the welfare homes.  The wealthier sections of the community are not affected.  They have elaborate places being set up round the country costing something like £200 a week.  I am talking about the person on a non-contributory pension of £50 or £60 a week who is being sent from hospital back home to a cold empty house where <Col N="2354" /> he will not be a problem for anybody for very long, because he will not last very long in it.  That is not in accordance with the precepts of a Christian caring community.That is not the way to behave in so-called opulent times.  Since this debate started we have been hearing about how well off we are.  If we are that well off, the State should look after these people.</P>
    <P>Why should Rehab and others have to do the work of the Department of Health?  They often do not have the proper structures to do the Government's work.  We in Fine Gael put forward a simple solution to the Government when we were talking about the health boards. We should scrap the health boards.  If countries much larger and wealthier than ourselves can manage the entire health scene from one office in the capital city why cannot we?  When I was on the Council of Europe I had the pleasure of visiting some of these offices to see how it was done.  If with modern technology and computers that can be done in much bigger wealthier nations, why do we need to have counsellors and doctors and all sorts of people traipsing around the country trying to administer a few pounds when this administration could be done from one office in Dublin saving millions of pounds with which we could reopen our welfare homes and look after our old people?</P>
    <P>My favourite subject, agriculture, was not mentioned by me today because I spoke on it last week in the House.  I was very negative last week but I have to say today that certain good things are happening in agriculture.  I compliment the board of ERAD on their work to date in disease eradication.  I met Dr. Downey and his colleagues yesterday and I am impressed with their efforts.  When I had responsibility in that area I started off to do a few things like the collection of reactors and to implement more positive identification of animals by better tagging systems.  I am delighted that the board of ERAD have now decided to go down that road, more or less pointing out that there is not a mysterious solution to disease eradication but that there are a few <Col N="2355" /> good pointers, the first being to compensate properly for the loss of the animal.  We did not do that and I am the first to admit it.  We should also make sure, having compensated for the loss of the animal, that anybody who is messing around with disease is penalised.  That approach should get the support of all sides of the House.</P>
    <P>Deputy Donnellan accused Fine Gael of reneging on their role in Opposition. I categorically reject that.  As somebody who has been in this House nearly as long as Deputy Donnellan, I believe that we in Fine Gael have been highly responsible in Opposition.  We identified what had to be done in the run-up to the last general election and we told the people, but of course we all have the vision of a leprechaun at the end of the rainbow with the crock of gold.  That Celtic mentality is there and there was a slim hope that perhaps Fianna Fáil had a crock of gold that Fine Gael did not have and people opted for &ldquo;health cuts hurt the poor, the old and the sick&rdquo;.  Unless people are altogether out of their minds, they must know now that there is no soft option and that whoever rules the country will have to keep within budgetary constraints.  That is not to say that from now on we will not lambaste them in every way we can because in many areas the Government have not dealt wisely with the talents they got.  Like the man in the Gospel, in many cases they have buried the talent.  I hope that retribution will come to them in due time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MJNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  The improvement in the public finances since Fianna Fáil returned to office has been dramatic. The trend so far this year suggests that yet again the budget targets will be met and bettered.  The Minister and his Cabinet colleagues are to be complimented on this, although the annual addition of new borrowings is still too high.  It is interesting to reflect on the recent US presidential election where one of the main items of contention was the growing <Col N="2356" /> debt which the country had built up over a number of years.</P>
      <P>When one reflects on the ratio of debt to gross national product for Ireland and the United States and considers the hype and anxiety generated in the run-up to the American presidential election and exactly what the figures were and compare those with ours, one will see how serious our problem was on Fianna Fáil's return to office.  The 1988 debt-GNP ratio for the United States stood at 30 per cent, whereas our figure was of the order of 133 per cent.  This shows, if it needs to be shown, the magnitude of the problem which faced the Government and the country.  The position will not stabilise within a short time.  The Government have made great inroads into stabilising that debt and it is hoped that within the next year or two it will be stabilised.</P>
      <P>The Exchequer returns for the first quarter of this year were very encouraging.The results achieved in the past few years, with inflation at an all-time low &mdash; although regrettably there is a small increase again at the moment &mdash; with interest rates at six full percentage points lower than those of the United Kingdom, are all indicators of confidence in our economy and our Government. On the downside, we have still the problem of emigration and the stubborn problem of unemployment.  If we can get our economy working again these can be overcome, it is hoped, within the not too distant future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a strong recovery in consumer spending at the moment.  Retail sales in January were up 7 per cent in volume terms on January 1988.  Unemployment in the first quarter of the year was lower than in the first quarter of last year, which is a welcome move.  Manufacturing employment in the final quarter of 1988 shows a year to year increase for the first time since 1980.  In the building industry, employment in the larger firms in January and February was some 7 per cent higher than in the corresponding two months of 1988.  This, together with the increase of 30 per cent in housing starts in the first two months of 1989, is an indication of the substantial recovery <Col N="2357" /> which is now under way in the building industry, after several very lean years.</P>
    <P>The trends so far support the Government's expectation of a further substantial balance of payments surplus this year.  Exports have risen by 24 per cent in value, year to year, in the first two months of this year.  It would be opportune to compliment the Minister of State, Deputy Brennan, on the work that he has been doing not just in issuing the good figures on a monthly basis but also on his genuine interest in improving the export performance of our industry and his encouragement to our industrialists to get out and market their products, particularly in the run-up to 1992.  These figures reflect the continued buoyancy of our export markets and the all important improvement in competitiveness.</P>
    <P>There has been a strong growth in the value of imports.  Imports of capital goods are up by 20 per cent.  As expected, imports of consumer goods also are strong, in response to the recovery in private consumption.  It is important that our industry should be aware of this improvement in consumption and should be in a position to compete favourably with the imports from our neighbours. The overall prospect for 1989 remains one of strong economic growth.  The budget time prediction by the Minister of a 3.5 per cent increase in real GNP will, I feel, be realised.  As a result of all this there is a new air of confidence.  It is good to see new investment taking place around the country.  New starts are being made in a number of areas and are to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>While the problems are still formidable, people now see that the earlier pattern of despondency and economic decline can and will be broken.  This can be done only if we continue along the path this Government have outlined over the past two years.</P>
    <P>The recent movement in price increases is a source of worry to all of us, since the cause of this increase comes from within our economy rather than outside it.  I would hope that the words of warning echoed here last night by the Minister for the Environment will be <Col N="2358" /> heeded and that if we are going to see a major movement in inflation, we ourselves will not be the cause of it.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal with some aspects of our movement towards 1992, in particular the EC Directive on the free movement of capital which will certainly affect the Irish economy between now and the end of 1992.  On Directive No. 361 of 1988, in a joint statement issued by the Taoiseach and the President of the European Commission in October last year it was announced that Ireland, being committed to the complete removal of exchange controls by the end of 1992 would, from the end of 1988, remove all restrictions on the purchase of medium and long term foreign securities by Irish residents and would not be seeking any further derogation from the Commission in this area.  This decision was explained by the Minister for Finance at that time when he revealed that the investments allowance since 1 January 1988 had come nowhere near the limits prescribed by the Commission.  He said that in the first nine months of 1988 there had been a big inflow of funds from non-residents to the Irish gilts market.  He pointed out that it was no longer possible to plead balance of payments difficulties to justify retaining any restrictions on investments in medium and long term securities. However, he also pointed out that there was no obligation to liberalise short term capital movements, nor any intention to do so.  Resident investors would therefore not be free to purchase short term foreign securities or to convert from medium and long term into short term foreign securities.The only exception that would be allowed would be that the institutional investors would continue to be allowed to purchase short term foreign securities with Irish currency within 12½ per cent of their cash flow.  This was a vote of confidence in our economy at that stage.</P>
    <P>There was an obligation under this directive to submit by the end of 1988 proposals aimed at eliminating or reducing risks of distortion, tax evasion and tax avoidance linked to the diversity of national systems for the taxation of <Col N="2359" /> savings and for controlling the application of the systems.  The proposals were submitted to the Commission in February 1989.  They suggest a minimum of 15 per cent withholding tax on saving throughout the Community, I understand.  This would be in line with what we have been doing in relation to our deposit interest retention tax.</P>
    <P>The Commission also suggests measures to improve co-operation between tax administrators within the Community and any tax provision of a Community nature must be adopted by the Council acting unanimously.  I understand that Luxembourg and the United Kingdom are not too keen on this proposal so far. It is hoped that that can be sorted out in time for the 1992 deadline.</P>
    <P>The Directive provides for certain derogations which are to be applied for limited periods in the case of Ireland, Greece, Spain and Portugal.  Ireland is permitted until the end of 1992 to continue to apply or reintroduce restrictions on operations in securities dealt with on the capital markets and operations in unit trusts of an undertaking not subject to Directive 611 of 1985 and medium and long-term financial loans and credits. Ireland may also defer until the end of 1992 the liberalisation of operations in securities normally dealt with on the money market, current and deposit accounts, unit trusts, short-term loans and credits, personal loans, physical importation and exportation of financial assets.  It must be accepted that the free movement of capital must constitute a constraint on the national policy of management of our public finances.  The Department of Finance have said that Ireland should be able without undue difficulty progressively to remove the remaining exchange control over the period to the end of 1992.  The experience gleaned from recent relaxation in exchange control restrictions supports this opinion, but the Department's optimistic view is founded on the progress made in rectifying the public finances, improving the balance of payments and reducing inflation.  Therefore it is important that Fianna Fáil would continue &mdash;<Col N="2360" /> and I have the utmost confidence they will &mdash; down the road they have been travelling during the past two years.  It is my view that maintenance of confidence nationally and internationally in the Irish economy must command a high priority in formulating and implementing national financial and economic policy under this new regime, even at the expense of foregoing desirable projects which might imperil that objective.</P>
    <P>The existence of exchange controls and other restrictive legislation may have facilitated the introduction of a range of new taxes on financial services, such as bank and insurance levies and DIRT tax. If we are to move towards a single market as proposed, we will come under pressure as a Government to relax some of these levies so that our financial institutions and insurance companies can compete on what they term a level playing field.  At present they feel they are at a disadvantage because of these taxes.</P>
    <P>The income tax changes proposed in the Bill are aimed at improving the position of low income families.  This is to be welcomed.  The reduction in the standard and top rate of tax underpins pay moderation in the economy and begins the process of driving down income tax rates and restoring the incentive for enterprise and effort.  Unfortunately, this has been lacking for far too long in the Irish workplace.This first move by the Minister for Finance to reduce the rate of personal taxation is very welcome.  The Government have shown the direction in which they wish to go in future reform of personal taxation.  The overall cost of this year's income tax package is over £200 million in a full year.  Taken together with the concessions introduced in the 1988 budget, cumulative reliefs costing well over £700 million over the period of the <i>Programme For National Recovery</i> have now been provided by the Government compared with a commitment of £200,000 in the programme.  We have shown, if proof were needed, that we are serious about our commitment.</P>
    <P>At present data processing and software development services qualify for <Col N="2361" /> the 10 per cent rate of corporation tax. In order to reflect the recent developments in the computer industry, certain related consultancy and technical services will now qualify for this 10 per cent rate of tax.  This is to be welcomed as the computer and related industries have been of great benefit to the Irish economy over the past ten years.  Any move that the Government and the Minister for Finance can make in this regard is to be welcomed.  These reliefs will provide significant and substantial assistance to the industry.  The relief for corporate investment in films has been sadly overlooked for many years by various Ministers for Finance.  The provisions announced in the Finance Bill will assist the film industry, which I regret to say is in a very poor state.</P>
    <P>Petrol dealers will be licensed in future. The purpose of the new licence is to equip the Customs and Excise more effectively in the fight against petrol smuggling which is a huge problem.  I do not believe that everybody is aware of the significant amount of petrol and fuel oil which is being smuggled across the Border.  Anything that the Minister can do to control petrol and oil retailers and indeed wholesalers is to be welcomed and the proposal to license them will go some way towards identifying where the problem occurs.</P>
    <P>There is a provision in section 47 for the introduction of a ten year driving licence at a fee of £20.  For far too long people have been caught out by forgetting to renew their licence on a three yearly basis and I know that many public representatives have been approached to see if they can do anything when the licence lapses.  This is a positive step.</P>
    <P>The business expansion scheme takes up a substantial part of the Finance Bill. Section 7 introduces five new measures and restricts the BES to its original purposes.The Minister has clarified and perhaps rectified some of the abuses which may have been taking place under the scheme.  For example, where BES money is being used for the purchase of a ship, that ship must represent the beneficial addition to the Irish shipping register.  It also imposes a limit of £2.5 million on <Col N="2362" /> the amount of money that a group of companies can raise under this scheme; it excludes international leasing and related financial services and excludes selfcatering accommodation in the city or county of Dublin and the urban areas of Cork, Waterford, Limerick and Galway where I understand a number of schemes under the BES had been undertaken. Finally it provides that relief will not be available on shares where options or guarantees are held which provide for sale at other than market value at the end of a five year period, for which shares must be retained under the scheme.  I think these provisions will help to restore the scheme to its original purposes.</P>
    <P>In conclusion the Minister and the Government have gone a long way in holding the &ldquo;steady-as-she-goes&rdquo; policy of rectifying the national finances which must be at the heart of everything the Government and the Minister do.  Unless we can reduce our debt substantially we will be unable to create the climate and raise the funding we must get in order to reach the employment levels we need.</P>
    <P>The previous speaker, Deputy Hegarty, made a comment in relation to local authority houses.  If I am not mistaken, he said a number of local authority tenants would be in a position to pay the full market value of the rent.  The full cost to the Government of renting local authority houses is in the order of £80 to £85 per week.  As any local authority member will know, in no way can the majority of local authority tenants pay anything like that.  If they could they would not have waited two and three years to qualify for local authority housing; they would have secured a mortgage and got their own houses.  However, I believe very often people on the local authority list are in flats paying £25 to £35 per week for rent and that once they are allocated local authority houses and rent is set at, say, £15 they claim inability to pay.  We should look seriously at this whole area of the return we get on local authority housing.</P>
    <P>In general this is a good Bill and I hope it gets a speedy passage through the House.</P>
    <Col N="2363" />
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>The new slogan of the Minister for Finance &ldquo;steady as she goes&rdquo; seems to be the norm which everybody picks up on this Bill.  It is an indication of what the future holds for 1989-90.  At the same time we have the hype of the <i>National Development Plan 1989-1993</i>, the bonanza of £ millions coming from the EC and the claim by the Minister of State, Deputy Máire Geoghegan-Quinn, about the manner in which the Government have handled the proposed plan and the way in which this huge expenditure is to be distributed throughout the country. However, it seems that what is lacking in the Minister's economic commentary is how he sees our relations with the EC. We have provided for this plan, but other elements are ignored.</P>
      <P>For instance, last year or the previous year the stress was on harmonisation of taxes.  There is no provision at all in this Bill for that.  The next, and most important, subject being discussed now is monetary union.  There is nothing whatsoever in this Bill to provide for progress towards that.  The only real opposition is coming from across the water from Mrs. Thatcher. The rest of the countries of Europe are most anxious to proceed with monetary union.  The Irish are going to provide the Presidency in January 1990 and I would have thought we would have set out some small token to indicate our willingness to play a full part in this union. We should at least have put in a simple provision to state the Irish accounts in punts and in ECUs as the Minister does, and in this way try to use dual terminology.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Great efforts have been made to get national plans such as I have referred to put into place so that, when the Single Market comes into being in 1992 all the elements will be there and progress can be made.  Therefore, I regret that &ldquo;steady as she goes&rdquo; seems to mean &ldquo;omit as much as you can&rdquo;.  I regret that a Minister who has such a terrific background in business, is a successful businessman, became Minister for Finance and was formerly Minister for Industry and Commerce, who had recognised all the elements necessary to make progress and <Col N="2364" /> to meet competitive elements, can produce here nothing better than &ldquo;steady as she goes&rdquo;.  However, maybe he will get some action from the Department of Finance particularly with regard to monetary union.</P>
    <P>Recently we have seen moves by this Government towards privatisation.  The other day here the Minister for Energy defended the sale of Tara Mines.  He did not respond adequately to the challenge by Deputy Richard Bruton when he said the Government should have sold the stake in Tara Mines for approximately £60 million instead of £35 million.  If the Minister for Finance had put a real value on this mine the expedient price of £35 million accepted by this Government would have been rejected.  I would like to see more action from the Department of Finance and across the other Departments of State when it comes to the sale of assets.  I may be wrong to criticise the price of £35 million, but it would be better for this Government and for the privatisation process if the relevant documents were laid before the House setting out how the calculations were made.  For instance, I am interested in forestry and the Minister for Industry and Commerce had an interest in it some time ago.  The forestry people are selling off property and Bord na Móna are disposing of bog. Nobody on the private side understands how this bog is being disposed of to Coillte Teoranta or what the price will be.  We are not going to be told.  We have asked questions of the Minister and he says this is a private matter, it cannot be discussed, the Department of Finance make their own arrangements.  That is not satisfactory.  An open tender system should apply to the disposal of bogs and the Department of Energy in supervising this matter should insist that the real base price is put in so competition can flourish between Coillte Teoranta and private forestry and the new companies.</P>
    <P>One of the great strategies on which the Government are placing emphasis is the expansion in the rate of planting.  That is more or less dependent on whether in the future we can successfully develop a <Col N="2365" /> semi-mature timber market.  If the private companies feel they are at a disadvantage due to the underhand trading of the State, there will not be great success.The Government are pinning their hopes on successful expansion of forestry development.  The EC are providing major grant assistance but the basic principle is that there must be a competitive element with regard to the land acquired for forestry.  I want some kind of tendering system.</P>
    <P>I have come across another case where the Department of Finance do not seem to be taking a stand against this cloak and dagger way of disposing of State assets. A tour company at Shannon Airport was recently disposed of.  A competitor bought into it and there was no public tendering.  I do not know how the Department and Aer Rianta succeeded in arriving at this exchange or how the purchase was made.  The company who made the purchase is a legitimate, successful company but there are competitors who would have been interested in the purchase, who would have liked a share of this market.  They did not get an opportunity to bid.  The success of Castle Tours was based on taxpayers' money, which provided the base.  The Department of Finance have an obligation to oversee these matters properly.  This House has a role to play.  The details of these transactions should be laid before the House so that the public can see that the Government are not interested in under-the-counter deals.  Open competition is necessary.  I appeal to the Minister to have his Department examine this matter.</P>
    <P>In the course of his speech the Minister said he was worried about the way this economy might suffer because of its open nature and he asked for restraint in various areas.  Restraint for Ireland Incorporated, if one can call it that, is rather a big thing, especially when at the outset this Government got together with various sectors and made a deal and a promise.They gave the labour element an increase.  All Deputies on the Government side today were complaining about the huge problem their Government <Col N="2366" /> inherited on coming to office and how difficult it was for them.  Before the change of Government when we were on the other side we were saying that Ireland Incorporated was insolvent, yet the first action of this Government when they came to power was to make an agreement giving a wage increase to the labour elements in Ireland Incorporated.  If the Minister was running his own business in Longford-Westmeath or North County Dublin and his company was insolvent, I do not think his bank manager would give him an additional loan in order to grant another increase.  It sounded a bit hollow when the Minister lectured the House recently about restraint in regard to public pay and how he intends to control it.  He and his colleagues in Government gave the lead.  When they were on this side of the House they wanted to pay everything, including £75 million to the teachers.  Of course, the teachers are still looking for that £75 million.  The previous Government were criticised for not paying &ldquo;what was due to the teachers&rdquo;&mdash; they were the words used.  The teachers of Ireland still have a share in Ireland Incorporated and they have had to put up with a reduced dividend.</P>
    <P>If this country is to be successful we will have to take a hard look at it.  This depth charge dropped by the Minister for Finance that there will be no further special increases might bring a round of further unrest, but I hardly think so.  I noticed only a little noise, a few ripples from the trade union movement about this denial.  In former times when the Labour Party were in Government with Fine Gael there would have been a huge explosion and the Minister for Finance would have been accused of interfering in the bargaining process.  How everything has changed.  Just look at the difference in a couple of years.  The new party in power are able to dictate the trends of the economy.  Is it not great that everybody agrees it is necessary?  I am not satisfied that they are going far enough.  When the Australians arrived at the difficult debt stage we are talking about, they made an agreement.  Mr. Hawke put a moratorium on wage increases for two or three <Col N="2367" /> years and the Australians were proud to take part in it.  In this country the previous Government produced a formula for a standstill in wages but Fianna Fáil said it was wrong.  Now they are advising people that no special increases will be allowed. They are still hanging on to the old idea that there is a little deal to be done and if you pick away at it using terms like &ldquo;steady as she goes&rdquo; this country will eventually resurrect itself out of the grey mist some fine morning.  In the meantime thousands and thousands will have gone away.</P>
    <P>Deputies on this side of the House do not have the same flow of language that Fianna Fáil had when they were decrying emigration on those benches.  I remember listening to Deputy Frank Fahey, now Minister with responsibility for sport, waxing eloquent over here about emigration and the great loss to the economy.  He accused the then Government of absolute neglect.  Since then he has been encouraging his Taoiseach, and he has gone himself, to ensure that these lads get into America.  The Taoiseach's press releases contain various data about his asking President Bush to legalise all the poor Irish fellows who are over there illegally.  He even asked President Reagan to give an amnesty before he left office.  How it is acceptable when they are on one side of the House but not when they are on the other is beyond me.</P>
    <P>I am coming to the point.  The reason there is some small progress and some confidence returning is that this party guaranteed to support the policies which were originally in the John Bruton budget of 1987.  What irritates me is that I have never heard any acknowledgment of the support he is receiving.  The Minister's predecessor, Deputy MacSharry, is supposed to be a cold man, but when it came to dealing with the Opposition he had a generous streak.  He related to the Opposition.  He acknowledged that there was a need for financial rectitude, that Ireland Incorporated was insolvent.  The present Minister for Finance has the best background a Minister ever had at this <Col N="2368" /> juncture.  He has a businessman's background.He should be able to expand employment and the wealth of this country.  If the Minister is successful in his own business he should be good for Ireland Incorporated.  There is talk of confidence in Fianna Fáil and confidence in the economy but that we are only half way there and that tougher decisions have to be made.  Deputy Noonan, the Fine Gael spokesperson on Finance, has been asking this Government for the past two years to join with him in a programme of tax reform.  The Government do not do that but fiddle around with little things. The target was to bring 66 per cent of taxpayers into the 35p tax rate; now there is 64 per cent on the 32p rate.  That does not make a huge difference to the man on the street.  The price of the pint of Guinness has gone up by 30p and that will take care of any modest tax relief that has been given in this budget.  If the Minister really has confidence in the economy he should take his courage in his hands and accept Fine Gael's offer regarding tax reform as a matter of urgency.  Most of the people who have left this country did so because they could see no future and were cynical about the lack of action on the part of politicians.</P>
    <P>This Bill further expands the legislation on income tax, corporation tax and capital gains tax.  The whole field is getting wider.  I wonder if some future Minister for Finance will consider bringing in a consolidation Act of all the tax regimes to get them into some simple form that can be understood.</P>
    <P>All of the amendments that have been put in have so complicated things that the Department of Finance now find it necessary to bring in this new section 76, called the anti-avoidance section.  The anti-avoidance section is lovely until the Revenue Commissioners get their hands on it.  I am sorry to say that I have had sad experiences with the Revenue Commissioners in regard to the way they treat people.  The Revenue Commissioners insist on their brief without any regard for the social consequences on some people.  I saw some particularly sad cases in regard to the withholding tax.  This tax was <Col N="2369" /> meant to get at the medical profession in general, resulting from complaints of much tax avoidance in this area.  There were to be allowances made for people who were suffering hardship.  I had occasion to make representations on behalf of a doctor who had come upon very hard times and was obviously destitute as the result of a drink problem. The reply from the Revenue Commissioners began with the statement that the man was a tax defaulter.  That was the first line in the reply from the Revenue Commissioners, the bottom line as far as they were concerned; this man was not entitled to an exemption from the withholding tax because he was a tax defaulter.  I understood that but the poor man was suffering from a disease and that should have been taken into account.  It is in exceptional cases like this that the withholding tax gets a very hard name and is despised by the people who have to pay it.</P>
    <P>The operation of this anti-avoidance section will have to be supervised as to the role to be played by third parties. Their track record to date has not impressed me and that is why I am mentioning it.  The other day the Tax Officials' Union had a meeting and decided to black representations made by Deputies.  Such cases would no longer receive priority but would take their place in the queue.  The reason people come to Deputies is to try to expedite matters that are delayed because of particular difficulties, such as a person being illiterate or some other social considerations.  It is for those reasons that Deputies undertake to make representations.  The Tax Officials' Union say that Dáil Deputies are exploiting the system to the detriment of the general public.  I reject that accusation and I would like the Minister for Finance to get in touch with the Revenue Commissioners and the Tax Officials' Union about this proposal to black representations made by Deputies.</P>
    <P>One of the problems about tax here is the way the Revenue Commissioners administer the system as if everything was either black or white.  There may be good reasons some people are in <Col N="2370" /> difficulty.  I am currently dealing with a case about arrears of tax.  A man who got sick and had to retire from business is still getting bills for VAT for 1972 onwards.  That man is in extremely bad health after having two legs amputated. I received a letter from the Revenue Commissioners saying that as this man is a tax defaulter they are taking proceedings against him.  When Deputies make representations they should be listened to on occasion, unless it is the policy of the Revenue Commissioners to ignore them altogether, in which case we would have to have another look at the system in order to defend democracy.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dennehy, when speaking earlier, talked about the progress that has been made in this country.  He mentioned the oil and the agricultural areas.  He spoke very loudly in praise of Deputy Lawlor and the way in which he was vindicated from the assaults made from other benches.  The one thing that I regret is that while Deputy Lawlor vindicated himself &mdash; and I congratulate him on that &mdash; allegations such as those flung across the House, cast a doubt on the Members of this House.  I regret very much that business people will now completely lack confidence in the Members of this House. Deputy Lawlor is probably an exception in so far as he has been appointed a director of a public company.</P>

      <P>I am not stuck for something to say.  I will comment on the Deputy's constituency later if he wishes.  The point I am making is that a Deputy has been made a director of a public company and I do not believe that is wrong.  It is right that Deputies should have commercial experience at that level because when they get into Government they will have the necessary experience to make hard, cold, commercial decisions.  That is the position in every other Parliament in the world.  I regret very much the incident about which some Deputies felt they had to launch an attack on Deputy Lawlor.  I just wish to make that point which is contrary to the spirit in which Deputy Dennehy made his point.</P>
      <P>I spoke earlier about the tender system and the need for competition.  In the run-up to 1992 this Finance Bill should be setting us up for competition costs.  I champion the cause of Shannon Airport which is in my constituency.  In the <i>National Development Plan</i> which was published recently the Minister for Finance said we would have an air tunnel to reduce the effect of the freight charges following the opening of the Channel tunnel.  In this Bill the Minister, instead of reducing hydrocarbon and petrol costs, has increased them.  In section 36 provision is made for an increase of 88p per hectolitre in the rate of excise duty on petrol.  That is no help to competition; it is anti-export.  If the Minister had to make a hard decision he would probably have to cut public expenditure in some area which might even affect the constituencies of both Deputy Aherns&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am doing all right, am I not, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle?  The Government miscalculated the whole position in regard to petrol.  Deputy Michael Noonan, Limerick East, on budget day, told the Government about the increases that had taken place in the price of crude oil, the probable increases and gave some of the reasons for them.  Yet the Government decided to target one of the essential elements of rural life, the motor car.  They put additional tax on petrol but now, because of delays in delivery, I understand that the INPC are seeking an increase of 27p per gallon.</P>

      <P>The effect of the failure of the Government to make a decision about petrol prices in January will be that motorists will have to face an increase of the order of 30p to 35p per gallon before the end of June.  As a result inflation will rise and that will be followed by demands for wage increases.  Earlier I referred to Ireland Incorporated and how necessary it was for us all to make a sacrifice.  The Government brought the social partners around a table and made a deal under which wage earners were given an increase in pay but the country could not afford that increase and taxpayers complained vehemently about it.  On Committee Stage the Minister should announce a reduction in the VAT rate on petrol.  If he does not our competitiveness will suffer.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce, who resides in a Dublin constituency, is not <i>au fait</i> with the extreme hardship experienced by those living in rural areas due to the condition of roads. It is bad enough for them to have to put up with a myriad of potholes but now they will have to face huge increases in the price of petrol.  People in rural areas are making real sacrifices.  I have heard many Government members refer to the success of the economy but it is being achieved at the expense of those living in rural areas in County Kerry and County Clare.  There are potholes from Ennis to Loophead and the people have to put up with them.  This morning I received a letter from an emigrant following his visit to lovely Doonbeg, an area with which the Leas-Cheann Comhairle is familiar.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring to section 36 under which the Minister increased the rate of excise duty on petrol by .88p per hectolitre.  I am asking him to give more money to the Department of the Environment or to reduce the rate of excise duty on petrol to help those who reside in rural areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister interrupted me to say that <Col N="2376" /> there had been a reduction in the cost of electricity and I accept that that has taken place.  The ESB erected a huge generating station at Moneypoint in County Clare and in the course of the construction of that complex did a lot of harm to our road network.  The House agreed to put rates on ESB premises but we find that the Ministers for Finance and the Environment do not propose transferring the income from rates on Moneypoint to Clare County Council.  They are putting their arms around that money and passing it on to Merrion Street and the Custom House.  That is not fair.</P>
    <P>There may have been a reduction in the price of electricity but the people of Clare are paying for that reduction by having to cope with potholes, roads caving in and flooding as a result of the construction of the station at Moneypoint.The Minister for Finance, when introducing the Bill which made the ESB liable for rates on their property, should have indicated that it was his intention to transfer that revenue to the national Exchequer rather than hand it over to local authorities.  Had he done so we might have had second thoughts about it. Some Members of my party might agree with the Minister's move and for that reason I should like to stress that I am expressing a personal opinion.  County Clare has suffered more than any other county as a result of the development at Moneypoint.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>Fine Gael are doing well in the European election campaign.  Deputy Nolan was concerned about the need to meet budget targets and expressed delight that the Government had met their target and would not have any overruns.He was pleased that the Minister did not have to provide for any strange happenings during 1987, 1988 or 1989. However, he should have said that all <Col N="2377" /> Governments since 1972 have had difficulties with their budgets and overruns. He should have pointed out that outside influences have a big bearing on what goes on in our economy.  Outside influences will have a big bearing on what happens to the price of petrol here in the future.  For example, the explosion on the rig in the North Sea yesterday will result in an increase in the price of petrol in the UK.  The problem in Alaska also led to an increase in the price of petrol.  I should like to ask the Minister to consider reducing the excise duty on petrol before Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>In the course of his remarks the Minister referred to a new provision <i>vis-á-vis</i> inheritance tax.  I congratulate him on tackling this problem because I have encountered several difficulties in that respect.  The problem seems to arise through the Revenue Commissioners' interpretation of the provisions.  The particular phrase that appears to cause the Revenue Commissioners much difficulty is &ldquo;working substantially or on a full-time basis&rdquo;.  For example, I cannot understand how, in the case of brother and sister or, say, first cousins living in the same house &mdash; one occupied in the house most of the time and the other out working on the farm &mdash; when the person who has been engaged on the farming activity dies the person who has been minding the house cannot be exempted.  I cannot understand when representations are made to the Revenue Commissioners in this respect why they cannot accept a person's <i>bona fides</i>.  There must be some response on the part of the Revenue Commissioners to genuine representations.</P>
      <P>The introduction of self-assessment constitutes another U-turn on the part of Fianna Fáil which was not acceptable at all when they occupied the benches on this side of the House.  They advanced so many arguments about how people's privacy would be infringed &mdash; prying officials allegedly releasing information about persons, their bank accounts and so on, a litany of reasons &mdash; that self-assessment could not be supported at that time.</P>

      <P>I will be charitable and will not comment on the last contribution.</P>
      <P>This Finance Bill is an essential element of the Government's economic strategy for 1989.  The reductions in personal tax rates provided for in the Bill are positive evidence of the success of the recovery programme that has been in operation for well over a year.  Lower inflation rates, lower interest rates, moderate levels of wage increases and the hard evidence that the Government are bringing public expenditure under control are further indicators of the success of Government policies.  However, there is the danger that the improvement that has taken place over the past two years in these areas may give rise to a degree of complacency.  This would be a mistake.</P>
      <P>Industry in Ireland can prosper and thereby create jobs only if it is more competitive than those of other nations with whom we trade.  In today's environment where approximately 75 per cent of our export values are to the European Community, it is of crucial importance that Irish firms compete not only with their competitors in the domestic market but also in markets abroad.  The importance of this fact is becoming more apparent in the run up to the completion of the internal market in the EC Community in 1992.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recent improvements in the cost structure of Irish industry are, therefore, as timely as they are essential.  At the same time it cannot be presumed that the task has been completed.  Every other country in Europe is as aware as we are of the <Col N="2380" /> importance of reducing input costs to industry.  Despite the real improvements that have occurred in Ireland there are a number of cost areas that are high by EC standards.  Therefore, cost competitiveness must not be viewed as an objective that has been attained, nor should it be looked upon as a short-term objective.  It is an objective that must be pursued and maintained over the long haul.</P>
    <P>It is imperative that we maintain the momentum that has brought about the improvements that we have achieved. This momentum must be continued on two points.  Firstly, there are a number of cost factors where real improvements have taken place.  These improvements took place, however, from a position where Ireland had some of the highest costs in the EC and where now we have average costs by comparison with other EC countries.  Our small economy and peripheral geographic location should make us strive to have some of the lowest costs in the EC.  Secondly, there are areas where costs are still too high.  Transportation is one of these.  Insurance is another.  Therefore, there remains much to be achieved in attaining sustainable cost competitiveness in our economy. That must be our goal.</P>
    <P>This Bill provides for amendments of tax law in a number of areas affecting industry and international services.</P>
    <P>Fund management, one of the growth areas in the financial services industry, has been targeted as a priority activity within the International Financial Services Centre.</P>
    <P>Section 16 of the Bill implements a special tax régime which will apply to unit trusts and similar investment funds which establish in the centre.  Such funds will not be subject to taxation on their income or capital gains provided that they are under management by a company in the centre, are established for the benefit exclusively of persons resident outside the State and are subject to regulations implementing an EC Directive on Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities, otherwise <Col N="2381" /> known as UCITS.  Similar provisions will apply to such funds located at Shannon.</P>
    <P>This régime brings us into line with the taxation position in relation to fund management in certain other European countries with which we will be competing for fund management business.  In that regard, I wish to announce to the House that I have made regulations implementing the directive.  Such implementation, well ahead of the EC deadline of 1 October 1989, makes Ireland one of the first member states to have brought this directive into force.</P>
    <P>The regulations, which will come into effect on 1 June 1989, will apply to UCITS whose sole object is the collective investment in transferable securities of capital raised from the public, which operate on the principle of risk spreading and whose units are redeemable at the option of the unit holder.  The regulations appoint the Central Bank as a competent authority in relation to the authorisation of UCITS situated within the State.  They will enable UCITS situated within the State, and authorised by the Central Bank, to market their products into other member states without the need for further authorisation.</P>
    <P>Under the regulations, UCITS may be constituted either as unit trusts, investment companies with fixed capital or investment companies with variable capital.The regulations have been designed to promote both a prudent and flexible environment for international fund managers located here.  They herald a new era for investors.  Considerably tighter controls to the benefit of unit holders are being introduced in a wide number of areas, including the structure and obligations of management companies, investment companies, and trustees; the investment policies of UCITS; publication and contents of prospectuses and reports; auditing requirements; publication of issue and redemption prices; and inspection and enforcement powers of the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>The regulations are expected to give a substantial impetus to the IDA in their marketing of the International Financial Services Centre as the location for fund <Col N="2382" /> management within the EC.  In anticipation of the implementation of the Directive, the IDA have had detailed discussions with more than 30 international fund managers anxious to operate unit trusts and investment companies from the centre.  Five firm proposals have already been received and are likely to receive IDA endorsement shortly.  Many more applications are expected to follow the publication of the regulations.</P>
    <P>The year 1992, for European fund managers, will begin on 1 October 1989. There is no doubt that the industry, while unsure of its exact effects, is welcoming the considerable opportunities it will provide in relation to marketing into the very large European investment market.  The Government believe that the International Financial Services Centre will be a major base for such fund managers. In that context, the publication of the regulations, in close succession to the Finance Bill, will enable fund managers, both here and abroad, to examine simultaneously both the regulatory and taxation aspects applicable to UCITS situated within the State.  We are confident that they will respond positively to both.</P>
    <P>The business expansion scheme was introduced in 1984 to encourage the private investor to invest his money at risk capital in industrial and other traded services companies.  It was a condition of the scheme that the equity investment involved would be maintained for at least five years.  Subsequently the scheme was extended to other priority employment generating activities including tourism, shipping and trading houses.  As a means of encouraging equity investment by private investors in developing enterprises of this nature the scheme has proven to be very successful indeed.  Since the inception of the scheme investments totalling £48 million in 350 separate companies have already been notified.</P>
    <P>Most of these companies were smaller companies engaged in manufacturing and other traded activities and the BES investment, by strengthening the financial base of the companies, offered the prospect of a substantial return to the <Col N="2383" /> economy in terms of output, foreign earnings and jobs.  While investments totalling £26 million for the tax year just ended have already been notified it is clear that the BES investment in that year has been substantially higher.  In addition during March last we had a total of eight designated investment funds, promoted by leading financial institutions, active in the market.  Between them these funds have been able to raise a further £20 million under the BES scheme from private investors for investment during the current tax year in new equity in eligible companies.</P>
    <P>With the accelerated uptake of this scheme widespread concern has arisen about the reduced risk nature of some of the more recent investments made under the scheme as well as arrangements being offered which would have the effect of eliminating the risk to the investors.  The generous tax relief granted under the scheme was designed to compensate for the high risk that genuine equity investment in non-quoted developing companies can entail.  It would be a matter of concern if investment moneys were to be diverted from these to low or non-risk companies for which a tax relief would be difficult to justify.  The amendments to the scheme proposed in the Bill are designed to reorientate the BES scheme back to its original objectives and direct the BES investment to where it will yield maximum benefit to the economy in terms of output and jobs.</P>
    <P>Computing services and software development are attractive economic activities for Ireland because they employ professional, highly qualified staff and because they are fast developing sectors with much potential for our young graduates and school leavers.  There are now some 4,800 people employed in these activities.  I expect that this will increase, given the right mix of strategy and economic management, to a level of 8,500 jobs by 1993.</P>
    <P>There is a wealth of economic data concerning information technology and software services and according to such studies the EC market for software and <Col N="2384" /> software services reached a value of approximately 22.2 billion ECUs in 1987. That compared with 19.4 billion ECUs in 1986 and represented a growth rate of about 19 per cent.  A market volume of approximately 52 billion ECUs is forecast for 1992.  Given our highly developed telecommunications links with the rest of Europe, and indeed with the world, there is every reason to expect that Irish operators will benefit from and participate in this European development.  I am taking steps to ensure that domestic computing services and software establishments have every chance of doing so.  I have been assisted in this by a working group who recently submitted a report to me.</P>
    <P>But as well as the domestic, indigenous and local firms, we look forward to growth as a result of the establishment of computing services and software houses in Ireland by overseas companies who will be attracted here not alone by sound economic policies but also by the supply of well educated and well trained young people.</P>
    <P>To assist the development of this sector I had been keen to see the scope of the 10 per cent rate of corporation tax which now applies to data processing and to software development activities extended to cover a number of other computer services.  This is a sector which is developing and adapting at a very fast rate and not alone are new developments being introduced but there is now an increased tendency for operations to specialise in particular segments of computing services to software development, etc. establishments.</P>
    <P>It was for this reason that I was anxious to have a provision in this Finance Bill to permit certain services not comprehended by the terms &ldquo;data processing&rdquo; or &ldquo;software development&rdquo;, qualify for tax treatment on the same basis as those services so as to permit the industry in Ireland to participate in a process of development to be found in this industry in other advanced economies.Were we not to make such provision now there would be a most serious risk that the development of this industry here would be hindered. <Col N="2385" /> Provisions have been included in the Bill which will curtail the cost to the Exchequer of section 84 loans.  These restrictions on section 84 lending will not affect manufacturing industry but are intended to exclude certain activities of less economic benefit to the country. During the last decade section 84 type finance has been a valuable funding mechanism for manufacturing industry. It has helped to attract new industrial projects to this country and provide a cheap source of debt funding for existing manufacturing operations.  For the above reasons the Government are concerned that this financing mechanism should remain available to industry.</P>
    <P>Section 8 of the Finance Bill, deals with preferential status of the Revenue Commissioners in certain winding up situations, arising as a consequence of the recent concession to small businesses allowing them to remit PAYE amounts deducted from employees at intervals longer than the normal monthly remittance period.  The maximum interval between remittances is one year and, where this facility is used, it would need to have the prior agreement of the Collector General.  This concession to business represents an issue within the overall Government initiative to relieve administrative difficulties imposed by Government agencies on business operations. This development is in line with the measures agreed by the Government last year within their programme to eliminate or ease wherever possible, the administrative burdens that are seen by small companies as a hindrance to their business operations.</P>
    <P>In the meantime a number of issues have been identified from the submissions of Departments and representative bodies which can be considered in the context of identifying existing regulations and procedures which might inhibit employment creation and maintenance.  Generally no one of the measures identified by Departments and agencies appears of major significance in inhibiting employment and any impact from this point of view is likely to lie more from making progress <Col N="2386" /> in removing red tape across a whole range of measures so that a cumulative effect is achieved in terms of impact.</P>
    <P>The high personal taxation levels which have persisted in Ireland and the relatively low income thresholds at which higher marginal tax rates apply have been widely perceived to be a considerable barrier to employment creation by: (i) acting as a disincentive to enterprise and effort; (ii) serving to push highly qualified and skilled people into emigrating to countries where their qualifications and skills are in demand and not subject to the same high tax levels that prevail in Ireland; and (iii) widening the gap between gross and net wages, i.e. forming a &ldquo;tax wedge&rdquo;, so that the gross cost of employing people is driven upwards for employers.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for a welcome reduction in the standard rate of income tax from 35 per cent to 32 per cent, a reduction in the highest rate from 58 per cent to 56 per cent as well as increases in the tax bands.  This maintains the progress that was commenced in 1987 towards reducing the burden of personal tax and increasing the incentive to work. Reductions in the rates of income tax will result in increased disposable income for households and a corresponding increase in demand for goods and services.  An increase in demand for goods and services will lead to more jobs.</P>
    <P>I particularly welcome the provision in section 25 of the Finance Bill aimed at improving the fiscal incentives for investing in audio-visual production.  This is a topic to which I have referred on a number of occasions in the past year.</P>
    <P>In my capacity as Minister for Communications, I am particularly conscious of the opportunities available to this sector arising from current and projected increases in the number of new television services at European level and the increasing internationalisation of these services.  It is estimated that over the next five years there will be a tenfold increase in demand for new programme material to fill the schedules of these services.</P>
    <P>Increasing attention is being given at <Col N="2387" /> European institutional level to the objective of ensuring &mdash; for both economic and cultural reasons &mdash; that most of the programme material for these new services is European-based.  It is recognised that the European audio-visual production sector is in general considerably weaker than the much more dominant US production industry for a variety of reasons, not least the diversity and richness of individual national European cultures and languages.</P>
    <P>The aim at European level over the next few years will be to strengthen the European production sector by developing aid packages and fiscal and financial incentives.  This is already manifest in the European Commission's Media Programme under which a series of projects under the distribution, production and training aspects of the audio-visual sector have been set in train through the draft Directive on Broadcasting Activities which explicitly recognises the objective of achieving a majority of European-orig-inated programmes on European TV services and through the emerging French proposals for an Audio-visual Eureka programme which will seek to strengthen international co-operation in developing the programme production sector.</P>
    <P>A window of opportunity is opening for our audio-visual producers, as broadcasters seek new and expanded sources of supply.  In this expanding situation it will be easier for new producers to sell their product to the new and expanding broadcasters.  While this is not an area in which Ireland in the past has had a particularly strong tradition, there are good omens for the future.  There has been a mushrooming of new production companies in recent years, technical facilities recognised as excellent worldwide in the form of TV and recording studios have been developed here, and the human capital in the form of an imaginative and creative people, whether artistic or technical, is also available.</P>
    <P>At domestic level the development of the third television channel, where a significant proportion of the material is <Col N="2388" /> expected to come from the independent sector, will greatly stimulate that sector.</P>
    <P>What has been lacking is a competitive financial environment.  I believe that the proposals in the Finance Bill will make an important contribution towards redressing that particular weakness.</P>
    <P>I would now like to refer briefly to telecommunications and postal matters. For the past two years Bord Telecom Éireann have turned the corner and shown a profit.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach recently indicated that downward pressure on service costs, including telecommunications and postal charges, is one of the keys to competitiveness and must be maintained.  On the telecommunications side there were reductions of 20 per cent, 25 per cent and in some cases 30 per cent in international call charges by Telecom Éireann in October 1988.  The possibility of further reductions in telephone charges is being kept under review but further progress will depend on the company's continued financial improvement.  On the postal side there has been no increase in charges since 1986 and the cost of posting a standard letter is now 10 per cent cheaper in real terms than in 1983.  The Government is determined to ensure that Ireland's competitive advantage secured through the stringent control of the nation's finances over the past two years is not eroded and I am pleased to note that An Post will be maintaining postage rates at current levels for the remainder of 1989.</P>
    <P>I now wish to say a few words about the <i>National Development Plan 19891993</i> which was submitted to the European Commission last month.  This plan sets out the structural measures which Ireland proposes to implement over the next five years in conjunction with the European Community Structural Funds, with a view to achieving the national and Community aim of greater economic and social cohesion.</P>
    <P>The plan recognises that high quality and price competitive telecommunications and postal services are essential to economic development.  The services are all the more essential in Ireland's case because of the country's position &mdash;<Col N="2389" /> an island on the edge of Europe.  Since 1980 Ireland has invested £1.46 billion in the modernisation and development of the telecommunications service.  This investment is now paying dividends in a significant expansion of the service and improvement in its quality.  However, compared with most member states of the Community the level and penetration of telecommunications development remains low and a full range of modern services is still not available nationwide.</P>
    <P>To remedy this deficiency it is intended under the plan, <i>inter alia</i>, to continue expansion of the network to cater for market growth at a high quality of service, complete the digitalisation of the telephone transmission system, increase to about 60 per cent (from 45 per cent in 1988) the proportion of telephone exchange lines capacity served by digital exchanges, extend direct access to international networks and complete national coverge for mobile communication services.</P>
    <P>During the period of the plan, Telecom Éireann's proposals for capital expenditure will be of the order of £675 million. Of this amount £369 million is considered eligible for assistance from the Structural Funds.</P>
    <P>On the postal side the plan provides for automated mail sorting equipment to reduce mail handling costs, modern mail centres in Dublin and other infrastructural development at regional centres.  The investment in the foregoing measures is estimated at over £20 million during the plan period.</P>
    <P>As I indicated recently the Government objective over the next five years, the period of the plan, is to create 100,000 gross jobs in industry and internationally traded services.  It is envisaged that direct expenditure of over £3,000 million will be undertaken on industrial development activity over that period with up to £1,200 million being contributed by the State and the EC Structural Funds.</P>
    <P>There is now a great air of confidence on the part of industry.  The results of the post-budget survey of the Small Firm Association (SFA) of the CII showed that 75 per cent of small firms are now <Col N="2390" /> optimistic about future prospects, a considerable improvement on recent years. In 1987 only 17 per cent of firms expressed this optimism while in 1988 the percentage was 46 per cent.</P>
    <P>One might conclude that the growth in business confidence that has occurred in recent years is more determined by the overall thrust of policy and by hard evidence of a Government determination to tackle any underlying deficiencies and imbalances in the economy.</P>
    <P>Other important findings of the SFA survey were (i) that over 47 per cent of small firms plan to increase employment over the next 12 months compared to 39 per cent recorded in the second quarter after the 1988 budget.  This is an important outcome in that last year small business was the most dynamic employment generating sector accounting for over 7,600 of the 19,600 jobs created in manufacturing industry and international services; (ii) that a growing concern about potential recruitment difficulties with 10.3 per cent of firms expressing concern about &ldquo;finding qualified employees&rdquo; and 17.9 per cent indicating concern about &ldquo;hiring better employees&rdquo;.  In similar post-budget surveys in recent years concerns about potential recruitment difficulties did not figure as an issue; and (iii) that the issue of greatest concern to small industry as indicated by the survey is input costs &mdash; listed by 27.7 per cent of firms surveyed.  This is a finding which supports the Government's concern to resist inflationary tendencies.</P>
    <P>Evidence to support the view that Irish industry is indeed set on an expansionary course is demonstrated by the fact that manufacturing output grew by over 10 per cent in 1988.  Whilst that growth was highest in the leading sectors like electronics and chemicals, it was more evenly spread than in previous years.  Similar growth in manufacturing output is set to continue in 1989 with again a positive contribution from the traditional sectors.</P>
    <P>Further evidence to support the growth pattern of Irish industry can be found in the statistics relating to capacity utilisation.The capacity utilisation of Irish <Col N="2391" /> manufacturing industry has been improving every year since 1983 and for 1988 was 74 per cent compared with 71.5 per cent in 1987.  Capacity utilisation in Irish manufacturing industry is, however, low by EC standards.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding this Ireland remains a very open economy and is sensitive to international developments.  The business environment in this country is, therefore, dependent to a large degree on trends in international trade.  Strong growth in the UK economy over the last few years and the consumer boom which accompanied that growth will have given a boost to Irish exports to the UK.</P>
    <P>A second external factor that will of course impact on the domestic business environment is the advent of the single European market in 1992.  The opportunities that will present will be many but there will be threats also.  This brings me back to the points discussed earlier in relation to competitiveness and it is, therefore, worth reiterating that in order to maximise the opportunities for selling our goods both in the domestic and the wider European market it is imperative that we be able to produce and sell our goods more competitively than those of our major trading partners.</P>
    <P>In the more immediate situation Ireland continues to enjoy excellent export performances.  As with the growth in manufacturing, the leading sectors have contributed substantially to this performance but there is evidence that the growth in exports is becoming more broadly based.  The outlook for strong export growth is set to continue aided by our relatively low cost economy, an increase in investment spending on the part of Irish industry and the continuance of what is still a good international trading environment.</P>
    <P>With respect to sound financing, the growth in recent years of different forms of equity capital in Irish industry is encouraging.  The emergence of Nad-corp, the business expansion scheme, venture capital companies and the expansion of the Irish stock market have all <Col N="2392" /> contributed to placing Irish business on a sounder footing.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the realisation that the management skills needed to run a company today cannot be treated in a haphazard fashion is being more forcefully articulated.Evidence of this can be found in the increasing attention being placed on management development by the industrial promotion agencies.  The recent report to the Minister for Labour on management training is also most timely.</P>
    <P>This country's future, our living standards and the job prospects of our young people all depend on the enterprise and initiative of Irish industry.  All in all the indications are that if we maintain the present path we can look forward to the economic growth and development that are so essential for our future wellbeing. Consequently this Finance Bill introduced by the Minister for Finance on behalf of the Government is an essential element of the Government's economic strategy for 1989.  The moves in this Bill in relation to the business expansion scheme, in relation to the financial services area, in relation to taxation of UCITS, in relation to section 84 and in relation to personal taxation changes are all indicative of an economy on the move. The Finance Bill is a central part of that economy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he will report on the investigation carried out as a result of the recent attempt by three prisoners to escape from Mountjoy Prison; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>On 20 March last three prisoners made their way on to the roof of one of the wings at Mountjoy Prison.  Prison officers who were patrolling the grounds of the prison detected the presence of the prisoners on the roof and took appropriate action to prevent their escape.  While it is a cause for concern that the prisoners managed to make their way on to the roof, the outcome of the incident was satisfactory in that the deployment of staff, allied to their vigilance and prompt action, frustrated the escape attempt.  The staff deployment scheme in use is, of course, designed to cope with any incidents of this type which arise.</P>
      <P>The investigation into the escape attempt centred on establishing how the offenders succeeded in gaining access to the roof as well as tracing the sources of material which they obtained to assist in the escape attempt.  The Deputy will appreciate that an investigation into any attempted escape inevitably deals with detailed prison security arrangements and that, for obvious reasons, there are severe limits to the amount of information about such matters which it would be open to me to disclose.  I can assure the House, however, that security arrangements at all the prisons are kept under continuous review and that special attention is paid to any deficiencies which may come to light as a result of the investigation of particular incidents.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  Is the Minister happy that the problems in Mountjoy Prison do not arise from gross overcrowding, the age of the prison and its total unsuitability to hold such large numbers?  How can the Minister justify not opening Wheatfield <Col N="2394" /> Prison at this stage in view of the continuing problems in Mountjoy arising from escape attempts or from the latest suicide cases in that prison?  What proposals has the Minister, if any, to deal with the recommendations in the Whitaker report in relation to alternatives to custody?  I am sure the Minister will agree that there are large numbers of prisoners in Mountjoy contributing to the overcrowding who could be dealt with by applying other means of punishment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a whole series of questions that could be answered and I am prepared to answer them but the Deputy would really need to put down a whole lot of separate questions to get the sort of answers his question deserves.  I recognise that Deputy Barrett is keenly interested in this area and I would be glad to give the information.  I could not deal with that very wide-ranging series of questions in dealing with this question, but there are certain sections of the supplementary questions with which I must deal as they come within the ambit of the question.  With regard to overcrowding and whether this contributed to the incident, each of the prisoners involved in this incident was accommodated in a single cell so overcrowding did not have a bearing on the escape attempt.  Manning levels at the prison are kept under continuous review in the light of changing circumstances.  I am satisfied that sufficient staff were available to deal with the incident.  I would stress that the central point is that the escape attempt failed and that the security precautions in the prison intended to cope with this type of attempt were adequate.  Of course, the prison authorities are conscious of the safety of the staff, and staff numbers on duty are kept under continuous review. There is a number of other questions on the Order Paper dealing with other matters raised there but, just briefly, because it fits in with this, having regard <Col N="2395" /> to the suggestion made by Deputy Barrett in his supplementary question in relation to overcrowding in the prisons, he is quite right, there is serious overcrowding in our prisons.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if, in view of the recent death of a prisoner (details supplied) and the number of prisoners who have previously committed suicide in prison, he will appoint a medical director for the prison service as was recommended in the report of the Committee of Inquiry into the Penal System published in July, 1985; and if he will undertake to improve conditions within Mountjoy Prison immediately to relieve overcrowding; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to preface the reply to this question with an expression of my sympathy to the family and friends of the person referred to in the question.</P>
      <P>Regarding the appointment of a medical director for the Prison Service, the position is that efforts by the Civil Service Commission to recruit such an officer have so far proved unsuccessful. However, the chief medical officer for the Civil Service has found it possible to make time available to discharge a number of the more important functions which were envisaged as appropriate to the director.  The chief medical officer has visited the prisons and has had consultations with the medical officers. While efforts to recruit a medical director will continue, I am satisfied that an adequate medical service is provided for prisoners and I shall refer further to this matter later in my reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2396" /> In relation to pressure on prison accommodation, I accept that the prisons generally are having to cope with a greater number of prisoners than is desirable but the planned opening, from the middle of this year, of the new place of detention at Wheatfield will give some welcome relief in that regard.  I do not accept that pressure on accommodation played any part in the recent tragic incident, particularly as steps are taken to ensure that the area in which this prisoner was accommodated does not become overcrowded.</P>
    <P>An inquest on the death referred to in the question will take place in due course and as all matters relevant to the death will be inquired into on that occasion, I do not consider that it would be appropriate for me to comment on them here. I believe, too, that sensitivity to the feelings of the family and friends of the deceased at this time, so soon after the death, requires a considerable degree of reticence in that regard.  I regret that others do not appear to consider that such sensitivity is called for and that this unfortunate death has been the occasion for instant critical statements in relation to the conditions in which certain offenders are detained in Mountjoy.  I refer to these statements now only for the purpose of allaying public concern that may have been created by them.</P>
    <P>The statements referred to a certain group of offenders who are held in the separation unit and base in Mountjoy Prison, and described these as punishment areas without natural light.  I want to emphasise that this description is totally incorrect.  Such segregation as is employed is in the interests of the offenders concerned and to facilitate the provision of appropriate medical attention for them.</P>
    <P>An additional medical doctor has been appointed as medical officer to Mountjoy to attend exclusively to these offenders and he is available to such offenders every day.  When the necessity arises, such offenders are transferred to appropriate hospitals outside the prison for tests and/or treatment.  Such offenders also have available to them, within the prison, <Col N="2397" /> a wide range of other services, including psychiatric, psychological, welfare and chaplaincy.  The fact that, of necessity, offenders are kept in secure or segregated conditions does not in any way interfere with the provision for them of all appropriate medical services of the highest quality.</P>
    <P>I deem it necessary to point out these facts to counteract the inaccurate and unfair picture that has been given publicly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his lengthy reply and share with him the sympathy that we all have for the relatives and friends of the prisoners.  There is no question of trying to light on this case in order to make any particular point, apart from the points that we have made in this House on many occasions before and which, unfortunately, have been highlighted once again.  Is it not true that the area in which these prisoners are kept &mdash; prisoners who have been tested for HIV virus and have been found to be positive &mdash; is the basement of the prison? Is it not true that the Whitaker report on the prison service declared that this area was dark and oppressive and suited, if at all, only as short stay accommodation? Obviously, it was they implied that it should be used as punishment accommodation.It is simply totally unsuitable for keeping those who are already ill or suffering from depression.</P>

      <P>I have outlined in my reply to Deputy Colley the facilities available. The basic difficulty in treating those addicted to drugs, as those who are familiar with this area will know, is the lack of motivation of the addict.  All those in prison who are addicted to drugs will have had extensive experience of treatment in community based facilities.  It is a regrettable fact that those treatment efforts have not been successful, not due to any lack of effort or will on the part of those running the programmes but due to the behaviour of the addict.  With regard to the new prison centre at Wheatfield, I shall be finalising that issue very shortly and shall be taking into account the difficulties we are experiencing in the prison system as a whole.  The subject of people in ill-health will have to be given every consideration also in moves that I will be making shortly with regard to the new prison.</P>

Would he agree that since the introduction of the Extradition (Amendment) Act of 1987 the operation of the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act of 1976 has become extremely cumbersome and difficult?  On 13 December last, on a particular extradition case which was decided by the Attorney General, that is the case of Patrick Ryan, the Taoiseach said: &ldquo;The charges which have been brought against Patrick Ryan are of a most serious kind, and they should be investigated by a court&rdquo;.  He went on to say that the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act should be applied.  I am simplifying what he said.  It is an absolute public disgrace.</P>

The Prosecution of Offenders Act of 1974, which provides for the establishment of the Office of Public Prosecutions expressly provides in section 2 (5) that the Director of Public Prosecutions shall be independent in the performance of his functions.  The requirement for the consent of the Attorney General for certain proceedings, which is contained in section 20 (2) of the 1976 Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act, does not apply to the offences alleged in this case.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice the reason, in view of the overcrowding in our prisons and the growing cost of custodial sentences, greater use is not made of community service orders especially for minor offenders, first time offenders and fine defaulters; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldineKennedy" hpid="Miss Kennedy Miss Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Miss Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if fine defaulters could be more appropriately dealt with by the use of community service orders as an alternative to imprisonment which costs the State up to £600 per week for each prisoner; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 and 9 together.</P>
      <P>Since the scheme was introduced in 1985 approximately 4,000 community service orders have been made and I am generally satisfied with the operation of the scheme.  I have previously made clear my wish that the scheme be availed of as an alternative to imprisonment to the widest possible extent.  The House will appreciate, however, that the extent to which community service orders are made under the Criminal Justice (Community Service) Act, 1983, is a matter for the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A change in legislation would be necessary to enable community service to be substituted for imprisonment in the case of fine defaulters.  While I will keep this matter under review, such a change would involve a departure from a central feature of the present scheme in accordance with which community service may be imposed only in cases where the court, <Col N="2403" /> but for the availability of community service, would have deemed a custodial sentence, rather than a fine or other noncustodial sanction, to be the appropriate penalty for a particular offence.  This feature of the scheme was designed to ensure that community service operated as a genuine alternative to custody, rather than as a replacement for other non-custodial sanctions and this is an aspect which would have to be borne in mind in the consideration of any proposals for amending the legislation governing the scheme.</P>
    <P>I should mention that there is no evidence to suggest that the use of community service in the case of fine defaulters would significantly ease pressure on custodial accommodation.  For example, on 1 March 1989 only 17 offenders were serving sentences exclusively for non-payment of fines and all but two of these were being accommodated at &ldquo;open&rdquo; prisons.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that two probation or community welfare officers could be employed for the cost of keeping one prisoner in prison for one year, and the undoubted success of the scheme in terms of keeping people out of prison, would the Minister explain why the number of probation or community welfare officers has been allowed to drop in the past year?  Would the Minister not agree that there seems to be empiric evidence that despite his praises for the service, which are well earned, in practice the Department have allowed these services to contract rather than expand?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I have already made it very clear during the course of my reply &mdash; which I believe was a very comprehensive reply to the questions from Deputies Mac Giolla and Kennedy &mdash; that community service is a sanction available to the courts and it is a matter for them to decide whether it is appropriate in a particular case.  Generally speaking, except in cases where there is a mandatory sentence of imprisonment, <Col N="2404" /> such as life imprisonment for murder, a court can impose a sentence of community service if it deems it appropriate. Of course, I would welcome more use of this scheme.  Let me say that the Deputy should not forget that I was the one who got the scheme up and going in the earlier stages of my involvement with the Department of Justice.  I will do everything and anything to encourage the use of a scheme because not alone can I see the economics of it but the common sense of it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">

      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I take on board what the Minister has said that on a particular day only 17 prisoners were in prison for defaulting on fines, but I ask the Minister to consider the difficulty that these sentences are very short, often five day sentences, and that when taken over a year they would represent a great number of prisoners and therefore the cost would be commensurate.  Would the Minister not consider that a meeting with the Judiciary might be appropriate in order to alert them to his wishes?  Many fines are imposed for anti-social, but non violent offences and therefore the changes in the legislation required should not pose such a great difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not interfere with the functions or duties of the Judiciary in any shape or form.  I know that is as it must and should be.  However, a number of months ago when I was dining with members of the Judiciary I availed of the occasion, when the matter was being discussed in a very loose and informal way, to encourage the use of community service orders.  I spoke with members of the Judiciary who were very involved in <Col N="2405" /> this area and in my view there cannot be any misunderstanding with regard to the position and what I would like it to be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that there is unanimous agreement that community service orders are a means of punishment without putting people into prison but that a vital cog in the wheel as to whether a community service order should apply in a particular case is whether the judge has a pre-sentencing report in front of him prepared by the probation and welfare officers?  Unless these people are available to provide that service to the judge, we will not have the number of community service orders that should be applied.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have said, it is the court who decides who will be dealt with under the community service orders.  I believe it is the view of everybody in this House that we should have greater use of community service orders.  I will take on board the comments that have been made during the discussion here this afternoon and will have the matter considered by my officials.  When I am advised as to the validity of the comments made this afternoon, perhaps we can have a further discussion on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the former Select Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism recommended, having consulted the Director of Public Prosecutions, that <Col N="2406" /> changes be made in the procedures affecting the Director of Public Prosecutions to allow for a procedure which would make it possible for a statement to be made by a member of the Government or others when a prosecution does not take place in certain cases and where the public interest would demand this; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the recommendation to which the Deputy refers.  It was made in the fifteenth report of the Select Committee which is entitled <i>Pros-ecution of Offences</i>.  While I have no statutory or other responsibility in relation to the Office of the Director of Public Prosecution, I am aware that the general refusal of the director to give, publicly, reasons for decisions not to prosecute is not based on any reluctance to be accountable for his decisions but on the fact that a policy of giving reasons would inevitably, in very many cases, mean serious damage to the reputation of individuals.  The same attitude was adopted over the years by successive Attorneys General who, before the appointment of the director, discharged the functions now discharged by him.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will recall that the recommendation made by the select committee concerns the use of section 2 (6) of the Prosecution of Offences Act, 1974, which provides for a procedure whereby the Attorney General can consult with the Director of Public Prosecutions in relation to the director's functions.  It is not a matter for me as Minister for Justice to determine the circumstances in which the Attorney General should consult with the director and I do not wish to make any comment in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as I might have any role to play in relation to the committee's recommendation I must say that I am not persuaded that any useful purpose would be served by the introduction of a procedure as recommended by the committee whereby a member of the Government, or any other person, would be enabled to make a statement to the effect that having scrutinised a particular file he or she is satisfied that the decision by the <Col N="2407" /> director not to prosecute was taken in accordance with proper legal criteria.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the report of the select committee was unanimously presented to the House after a meeting between the then Chairman, Deputy Woods, the then Vice-Chairman, myself, and the Director of Public Prosecutions as a reasonable way of allaying public fears when prosecutions do not take place, in circumstances where the public do not understand why a prosecution has not taken place?  In all these circumstances would the Minister not agree that it would be reasonable for some facility to be found to explain the reasons for such non prosecutions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with that particular recommendation.  In cases where there has been public concern from time to time about a decision by the Director of Public Prosecutions not to take a prosecution the concern has been to know his reasons.  I do not believe that a bald statement by another party to the effect that they had scrutinised the file and were satisfied that the director had taken his decision based on legal criteria would meet the nature of that concern.  Furthermore, I doubt that the recommended procedure is in comformity with the Prosecution of Offences Act, 1974, under which the office of Director of Public Prosecutions was established.  Under that Act the director is given independent status.  On the other hand, under British law on which the committee's recommendation would seem to be based, the Director of Public Prosecutions is subordinate to the Attorney General.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that it is desirable that the Director of Public Prosecutions remain independent but that it is not desirable that he should remain beyond the possibility of being accountable, that there is a difference between being independent and being accountable?  I leave aside <Col N="2408" /> murder or multiple murder, but let me mention multiple deaths resulting from car accidents.  I had such a case concerning multiple pedestrians where prosecution did not take place, I am satisfied quite correctly given explanations were given privately.  Would the Minister not agree that there should be a procedure whereby accountability is allowed without interfering with independence?  Since the Minister referred to the 1974 Act, is that not what this House is for?  Can we not change the Act if we wish?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>On the one hand, Deputy Mitchell wants the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions to retain its independent status and on the other hand he wants a degree of accountability.

I have a request from the IFA to meet their president, Tom Clinton.  I have replied that I would be prepared to meet him and hear their viewpoint.  That I will do and I have asked that he will come in whenever he is ready.  The matter should be dealt with quickly.</P>
      <P>I am bearing in mind what Deputy Noonan has mentioned because there is a great deal of concern that this situation might go on and on and prevent a number of other everyday activities which we accept as normal in rural Ireland.  With regard to suggestions made about the British Act of 1984 and the Northern Ireland legislation, we will look at these matters.  I have not examined them and I have no note on them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal that the information sought by the Deputy is not available in the form requested and could not be obtained <Col N="2412" /> without a disproportionate use of staffing resources.  I can, however, give the Deputy some indication of the length of the process for examining applications on the basis of a survey of 148 recently completed cases carried out by the tribunal.</P>
      <P>There were four categories of applications in the survey.  Details of the categories and of the average time-span for processing each category to final payment are as follows: applications in respect of non-fatal injuries under the original scheme decided by one member &mdash; 47 months; applications in respect of non-fatal injuries under the original scheme decided on appeal to three members &mdash; 58 months; applications in respect of fatal injuries &mdash; 34 months and applications in respect of non-fatal injuries under the amended scheme &mdash; 23 months.</P>
      <P>The main reasons for the delays in processing applications is the large number of claims received during the years 1982 to 1986 when the scheme was amended. In this context I should mention that towards the end of last year there was a large backlog of decided cases awaiting payment.  This backlog was eliminated by the provision of £4 million by way of Supplementary Estimate.</P>
      <P>Last year £5.938 million was paid in awards under the scheme compared with £2.612 million in 1987 and £2.764 million in 1986.  The payment of such a large amount last year resulted in a significant improvement in the delay period for finalising applications.  I have no plans at present for any further improvements.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice the progress which has been made by the Garda in providing adequate protection for Dublin Bus crews against assaults or robberies; if his attention has been drawn to reports that a group from the United States known as the Guardian Angels are threatening to put vigilante type groups on the buses to deal with such attacks; if he will outline the attitude of his Department to such a <Col N="2413" /> dangerous development; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the problem of attacks on late-night bus crews and passengers is continuing to receive special attention.  There has been close liaison and co-operation for some time with Dublin Bus in this matter and since last October a number of measures have been taken by the gardaí and by the company. These measures, which I have previously outlined in the House, include intensified patrolling of known trouble spots by uniformed gardaí, making gardaí available to travel on buses as appropriate and the provision of mobile patrols, including joint Garda-Dublin Bus patrols to escort certain buses on selected routes.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities are satisfied that these measures are proving effective and there has been a downward trend in incidents involving violence on buses in the past few months.  Since last October proceedings have been instituted against some 135 persons in respect of various offences relating to such incidents and 48 convictions have been obtained so far.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities are continuing to monitor the situation and to maintain close co-operation with Dublin Bus with a view to taking whatever action may be appropriate to further alleviate and control the problem.</P>
      <P>On the question of the so-called &ldquo;Guardian Angels&rdquo;, while I would welcome and, indeed, encourage active support from all citizens to the Garda Síochana in the fight against crime, such support must be within the law and must have due regard for the rights of all citizens.The potential dangers inherent in any self-appointed &ldquo;vigilante&rdquo; type group becoming involved in the very sensitive area of crime prevention and law enforcement are all too obvious.  As Minister for Justice, I should like to make it absolutely clear that any attempts by individuals or groups to take the law into their own hands will not be tolerated in this country.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if his attention has been drawn to a recent statement by an assistant commissioner of the Garda Síochána indicating a more business-like approach to the policing of the Dublin Metropolitan area which involved specific plans and targets with regular reviews, targeting of high crime areas, violent crime, crime against tourists and an increase in neighbourhood policing; if he has had discussions with the Commissioner with a view to implementing this new approach; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the interview referred to in the question.</P>
      <P>I am of course in regular contact with the Garda Commissioner on all aspects of crime prevention and detection policy. The Garda authorities continually monitor the crime situation in Dublin and elsewhere and assess and adapt their operational strategies and tactics as the need arises to meet changing crime patterns.Part of their strategy involves the preparation by each district officer in the Dublin Metropolitan Area of programmes of measures designed to reduce the incidence of the types of crime that most affect his district.  Particular attention is given in this connection to crimes of violence.</P>
      <P>The new computerised command and control system for the Dublin Metropolitan Area which will come into operation shortly is a feature of the Garda national communications network and will provide greatly improved management information facilities with data on the frequency and location of particular types of crime.  The system will enable Garda management to deploy resources in the DMA with much greater effectiveness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Garda authorities, following consultation with Bord Fáilte, have also drawn up a strategy specifically designed to deal with the problem of attacks on tourists.  Moreover, additional Garda resources have been devoted to general <Col N="2416" /> crime prevention in the Dublin Metropolitan Area, with the continued expansion of the Neighbourhood Watch Scheme and the planned extension of community policing in the DMA.</P>
    <P>This approach to policing the DMA, with its emphasis on targeting specific serious crime problems and on neighbourhood or community policing, has evolved and been developed with my full support and active encouragement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join with the Minister in expressing support and appreciation of the Assistant Commissioner's plan for the Dublin Metropolitan Area.  Has the Commissioner indicated willingness to transfer personnel to areas where they are needed? As pointed out in the plan, there will be areas in particular need of extra personnel such as high crime areas and those where there is a need for neighbourhood policing.  Has the Commissioner indicated a willingness to back up support with personnel?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite satisfied that the Garda Commissioner, bearing in mind all the demands on manpower, is fully conscious of the need for greater police effort.  He has at all times to my knowledge met that need and I am quite satisfied he will continue to do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14, 34 and 41 together.</P>
      <P>There are two main points arising from the questions, viz. are the Garda enforcing the relevant legislation and is the legislation adequate.</P>
      <P>I have had discussions with the Garda authorities and they have assured me that all allegations of breaches of the Gaming and Lotteries Acts, 1956-1986, that are brought to their attention are investigated in a through manner.  The statistics for detections in the Dublin Metropolitan Area are indicative of that.</P>
      <P>In the period of 12 months ended 30 December last &mdash; the latest period for which the figures are available &mdash; there were 307 detections, and prosecutions are being pursued in the ordinary way. The figure for 1988 is well up on that for 1987, which was nine.  The small number of detections in 1987 was due to the fact that there were court proceedings in relation to a decision by Dublin City Council to rescind their previous adoption of Part III of the Gaming and Lotteries Act, 1956.  While the matter was <i>sub judice</i> there was an amount of ambiguity in relation to the Gaming and Lotteries Acts, 1956. which in turn, inhibited Garda enforcement of the legislation. This ambiguity was removed, and with it the uncertainty on the part of the Garda, when the Supreme Court issued a decision in April 1988 upholding the city council's decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of the adequacy of <Col N="2420" /> the present law I am not at this stage convinced that there is a case for amending legislation.  However, Deputies will remember that I suggested, when answering questions on 22 February last, that a debate be initiated in Private Members' time.  I wish to repeat that suggestion.  On this point I should mention that a debate on the Gaming and Lotteries Acts commenced in the other House last night and will be continued next Wednesday.  I will give careful consideration to the points emerging from the Seanad debate and to points made in any debate taking place in this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have raised this matter on the Adjournment on a number of occasions.  First I want to record my appreciation of the <i>Evening Herald</i> newspaper for highlighting the continued abuses particularly in the Dublin area.  Is the Minister aware that in many Garda stations in the city the response given to people ringing in to complain about the daily abuses of the law in Dublin is that it is a matter for the citizens first to bring the evidence to the Garda and that this advice was conveyed in part to the author of the articles in the <i>Evening Herald</i> when he inquired whether the Garda would act upon the evidence clearly set out in the pages of the <i>Evening Herald?</i> Would the Minister accept that, if accurate, that would not be an encouraging approach by the Garda?  Would the Minister ensure that they appreciate that it is their job in the first instance to see the law is enforced?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I have had a number of discussions with the Commissioner and the Assistant Commissioner in regard to this matter and I am satisfied that the Gaming and Lotteries Acts are being enforced by the Garda in an active and dedicated manner and that they will investigate in a thorough manner any alleged breaches of the law brought to their attention.  It is important to stress that where illegal gaming is alleged all possible evidence should be made available to the Garda.  In 1987, 127 breaches of the Act were detected.  The provisional <Col N="2421" /> numbers of detection for 1988 are 420. The corresponding figures for the Dublin Metropolitan Area were nine in 1987 and 307 in 1988.  The content of the question which Deputy McCartan has posed will be brought to the attention of the Garda authorities.</P>

I know the Minister asked me to leave in details to his office on 22 February.  I did that and I am sure the Minister has passed them on to the Garda Commissioner.  It is acknowledged by the Garda who are based in Store Street, just around the corner from this centre, that this major arcade is operating illegally and making illegal payouts on a daily basis and they want it stopped.  Children in my area, many of whom are on Government job creation schemes, training schemes and so forth, are spending their earnings in this establishment.  Some young people are turning to crime as a result of their craving to involve themselves in gaming. This is one of the cases that the <i>Evening Herald</i> investigated and I, also, congratulate them on their very good investigative journalism.  Why does this establishment still operate, even after the matter has been raised here on two previous occasions and the details have been conveyed to the Garda Commissioner?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>All allegations in this area were conveyed to the Garda Síochána and are being investigated fully by them. I accept that the situation exists.  The Deputy surely understands that the purpose of these examinations is to provide evidence on which prosecutions may be <Col N="2422" /> based.  The Garda can only go to court when they have such evidence and I am sure the Deputy understands that as well as everybody else.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the Minister's saying that he is not yet convinced about the need to amend the law of 1956, is he aware that in rescinding the licences in Dublin city the city councillors called for the law to be amended.  They were left with no choice except to rescind because the law was in such disrepute.  Is the Minister also aware of the growth or existence of gaming machines not alone among those arcades that already operated before this rescinding but in all sorts of other premises since that rescinding? Obviously there is something wrong with a law that allows that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">

      <P>We have discussed this on numerous occasions and I would be only too pleased to assist in any way I could in bringing forward constructive proposals, but it has all been done.  The Gaming and Lotteries Act, 1956, is completely out of date, not just in respect of gaming machines but in many other respects.  What is needed here is an amendment of this Act.  I detest these slot machines, but if we are not going to ban them totally surely we can have a gaming board which would make it particularly difficult for people to operate unless they do it on a proper legal footing. If we can have certificates issued by Bord Fáilte in respect of special restaurant licences, sure we can have certificates issued by a gaming board before somebody can apply for a licence to trade under this Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>This idea of a gaming board has been floated to me on a number of occasions, not just within the last couple of months since this matter has come up as a major item for discussion but in the last couple of years and indeed during my previous term as Minister for Justice.  The idea of a gaming board has been put to me by those who are involved in gambling activities and those who are involved in the trade, if I might use that word.  I have not accepted that principle and I still do not accept it.  That is my personal view but it would be a matter for the Government to decide.  Certainly, having examined the matter not in an indepth fashion but from my knowledge of gambling boards in other jurisdictions, I do not think they have been the success that people make them out to be.  The buck should stop on the desk of the Minister for Justice of the day, whether it be the Deputy himself or anybody else, who has answerability to this Parliament in <Col N="2424" /> such areas.  I am open to be convinced that the gambling laws need to be strengthened.  If I get that recommendation from the Garda Síochána whose function it is to enforce the law and if they feel the law as it is framed is not helpful to them, then I will very gladly do something about it.</P>
      <P>I have discussed this matter in great detail, even as late as last Friday, with Commissioner Crowley, with the Assistant Commissioner in charge of the Dublin Metropolitan Area, and also with some legal advisers who say that the matter is being actively considered with a view to preventing illegal gambling taking place. Part of the problem is that quite a number of the allegations that have been made have not stood up when investigated.  I am not taking away from what any Deputy says in this House or from any newspaper or television programme that gives voice to allegations of this sort. An allegation is one thing but having evidence to present the case to the court is another, I am advised that in some instances a lot of the machines that we are talking about in these centres are not gaming machines as such but are amusement machines &mdash; I am investigating that further &mdash; and that they are highly sophisticated machines that may not be readily classified as gambling machines. That is part of the problem.  Another part of the problem, having regard to some of the allegations that have been made and investigated, is that we can get nobody to give evidence on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am giving this detail to, for once and for all, put to bed the insinuations that the Garda are not actively looking at this particular area.  That would be a very false and misleading suggestion to make, even if their station is only around the corner from the Talbot Street centre mentioned by Deputy Gregory.  The Garda are aware of the concern of this House, as they should be.  They are thoroughly investigating the matter at present, reviewing the legislation and having discussions with the Attorney General and with the senior legal advisers of my Department to see how best all our resources can be pooled together to deal <Col N="2425" /> with this matter which none of us has time for and, I will go further and say, which we are determined to put on the sideline.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister's final remarks.  I would ask him to consider two aspects.  He told us there have been 307 detections in 1988.  There has been one prosecution to date in 1989 in the Dublin area and that was yesterday.Could the Minister seek, through the clerks of the courts, to give priority to bringing forward prosecutions that are in the pipeline so that the courts can deal quickly with these matters.  Secondly, could he convey to the Garda the view of this House that their powers under the 1956 Act to seize, in the first instance, offending machines should be more widely utilised?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to the first part of Deputy McCartan's question, I will examine that area and also the question of giving priority to one prosecution over another.  That would have to be examined in order to deal with the matter as it should be dealt with because it was put forward in a positive and helpful way. With regard to the second part of the question, I saw this matter being highlighted on a recent television programme in which I was unable to participate despite a very gracious invitation from the kind lady who chaired that programme.I would love to have been there.</P>

      <P>If I did the Deputy would be grousing.  In regard to the second part of the Deputy's question, part of the problem with seizing these machines, as I have said, is that they are basically amusement machines and not gambling machines.  I am sure the Deputy knows how they operate.  You buy so many credits and when you finish operating the machine you make your request for payment.It is not the machine that is illegal; it is what happens after you have played the machine that makes it gambling rather than amusement.  As I have said, it is a very difficult matter but we are using all our resources to try to come to grips with it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15 and 26 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not propose the establishment of <Col N="2427" /> a separate Law Reform Commission for the purpose referred to in the questions. My approach to the need for updating the criminal law is to deal with the matter on a systematic basis affording priority to those areas most in need of review.  To attempt a comprehensive review and codification of the entire field of criminal law would necessitate the diversion of resources from such priority areas.</P>
    <P>Since assuming office as Minister in March 1987 I think I can justifiably claim a measure of success in bringing forward legislation.  In the criminal area, I have introduced a number of important Bills &mdash; the Extradition (Amendment) Act, 1987; the Criminal Law (Rape) (Amendment) Bill; the Prevention of Incitement to Racial Hatred Bill; the Firearms and Offensive Weapons Bill and the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence) Bill.  I hope shortly to be in a position to publish a Larceny Bill and, a little later, a Criminal Damage Bill; a Criminal Evidence Bill and a general Criminal Law Bill to abolish the anachronistic distinction between felonies and misdemeanours.</P>
    <P>I think the House will agree that this record is clear evidence of progress on criminal law reform and of the effectiveness of the manner in which it is being tackled.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister in his reply is ignoring the reason the Law Reform Commission exists.  Would he not agree that the criminal code needs to be brought up to date?  He seems to accept that a piecemeal introduction of legislation is satisfactory.  The present criminal code has been in existence since the previous century and most of the Acts were introduced by the British Parliament.Would the Minister not agree that the Law Reform Commission could tackle the problem?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>While I accept that significant areas of our criminal law require review and updating, the resources that we can devote to law reform are limited. The best way we can use these resources is to target those areas where the need for <Col N="2428" /> review and reform is greatest.  I should point out that the work is not finished when a commission report and make recommendations for legislation.  Further considerable work in my Department and in the draftsman's office has to go into the preparation and drafting of Bills to implement recommendations, again with very limited resources.  It has been a problem to keep pace with the demand for new legislation and the Deputy knows that as well as I do.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the Taoiseach gave me an undertaking that he would consider asking the Law Reform Commission to prepare the legislation that they propose?  Much of the additional work involved in the proposal put forward by Deputy Carey could be dealt with by the commission, if they agreed to draft the legislation in accordance with their recommendations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the thrust of what the Deputy has said but he will realise that my Department do not have responsibility for the Law Reform Commission.That is a matter for the Taoiseach's office.  The Deputy will be aware that there have been requests, often demands by Members, for speedier action by the commission in dealing with matters they have before them for what they consider to be long periods.  Perhaps the Taoiseach, when he has considered the matter, will be able to say whether he has any plans for taking the matter further. If the Law Reform Commission become involved in the drafting of legislation they will have to use their entire resources for that purpose.  I cannot speak for the commission except to say that they have an exceptionally heavy workload to deal with.  During Question Time today Deputy Noonan, whom I respect for his knowledge in this area and for the part he played as Minister for Justice, urged that a matter he wanted referred to the Law Reform Commission should be dealt with speedily.  Any issue sent to the Law Reform Commission for examination can be regarded as one of importance.</P>

      <P>I should like to commend the Minister on the amount of legislation he has introduced in the House.  He has set a useful precedent for his successors to follow.  However, the Minister should consider the benefits of the codification of the criminal law which is spread out all over the place.  We had an example of the difficulties encountered because it has not been codified when we dealt with the substitution of community service orders for fines.  It appears that a lot of legislation and statutes might have to be amended to change those orders.  If the criminal law was codified it would be easier to change it and people would be able to understand the changes involved. The Law Reform Commission will have their work cut out to deal with other areas of law which are crying out for proper amendment and codification.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not disagree with the Deputy but I recognise that the commission are stretched to the limit in trying to deal with the work before them.  I should like to assure the House that the legal section of my Department have been working flat out for the last 26 months and, with the programme I have laid out for them, will have to work flat out for the next 26 months.  I readily accept that a lot of work remains to be done and that the ideal would be to have all laws codified and brought up to date. However, having regard to the difficulties we are facing and our economic problems we cannot do much more.  We are doing an excellent job and giving tremendous value to the taxpayers.</P>

They are doing a mighty job of work and the community should be extremely grateful to them.

    <Title>Finance Bill, 1989: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to make a contribution on the Finance Bill.  Finance Bills are probably the most technical Bills that come before the House on an annual basis.  Since they are so technical I regret that the Minister for Finance has not seen fit to take up the promise made to me in the House by his predecessor, former Deputy MacSharry, of introducing a consolidated income tax Act.  For those who have not read my quiz book on Irish politics, I should like to state that the longest piece of legislation passed by Dáil Éireann is the Income Tax Act, 1967.  That is a very detailed Act and has been updated annually by Finance Acts, sometimes twice yearly.  If one was to lie that Act on its side and place each Finance Act since 1967 on top of it we would be talking about a 4 ft. high mound of technical legislation that has not been consolidated for 22 years.  The consolidation of those Acts is overdue and the promise I was given in that regard 18 months ago has not been fulfilled. I recommend to the Minister, and his advisers, that they attend to this matter as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>I welcome the production of the charter of taxpayers' rights by the Revenue Commissioners, something that the Committee of Public Accounts suggested, but there is little point in having that if taxpayers have to wade through 4 ft. of highly technical legislation to find their entitlements.  I regret that the Bill does not include the extension of the PAYE allowance to the children of spouses of self-employed persons or persons who are the sole or main directors of private limited companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2461" /> In a small engineering firm, for example, a fitter who succeeds in winning a small contract or securing some maintenance or service work may want to take on his son as an apprentice.  Indeed, that person's wife may be involved in running the business but the apprentice or his wife are treated differently from any other taxpayer in that they are not given the PAYE allowance even though their income is taxed under the PAYE system.</P>
    <P>That seems to be very unfair because the whole idea of the allowance was to give some improvements to the PAYE taxpayer compared to the self-employed Schedule D, cases 1 and 2, taxpayers who pay on accounts one year in arrears.  I fail to understand why it is not possible to extend that allowance to the children or the spouses of a taxpayer in the circumstances I have outlined.</P>
    <P>Another matter I might draw to the attention of the House, as somebody who at one stage was involved in the tax area as a result of which many constituents come to me about relatively minor tax problems, is that, very often, senior citizens are not aware of the exemption provisions of the Income Tax Acts.  Many of them continue on single or married allowances or others, whereas in most cases probably they would be better off coming within the exemption provisions.</P>
    <P>Even if their income exceeds the exemption provisions there is marginal relief which would be to their benefit.</P>
    <P>I regret very much the publicity given to what I consider to be an intemperate comment by a leader of one of the taxpayers' unions recently in relation to representations by Deputies.  I do not use parliamentary questions in this House for answering tax queries.  I do not want to have to resort to that practice.  In my dealings with inspectors of taxes I have found that when I write in with queries usually within a reasonable period I receive a fair, adequate reply even though I know that the lack of consolidation of the Income Tax Acts presents problems for them.  It makes it difficult for them to keep abreast of that legislation.  However, despite that type of pressure, usually they have been able <Col N="2462" /> to furnish reasonably efficient replies to queries.  I hope we will not experience any change in that procedure.  I do not want to have to resort to taking up the time of this House by way of parliamentary questions, diverting the time of people all over the place to answering them within three days.</P>
    <P>However, the exemption provisions have not been adequately explained to those taxpayers who are entitled to them.</P>
    <P>That gives rise to many of the letters I write to inspectors of taxes.  If I may use the term, the success rate in relation to representations of that kind is quite high.</P>
    <P>A special effort should be made to have these examption provisions more widely publicised, whether by way of advertising, perhaps better still, at centres for senior citizens, so that they are properly acquainted with them.</P>
    <P>Before turning to some of the recommendations of the Committee of Public Accounts recently in relation to the Revenue Commissioners I should like to deal with some of the provisions of the Finance Bill before us.  It appears that, in the Bill as drafted, undoubtedly there is a high degree of retrospection, or a retrospective element, in the section dealing with tax avoidance.  I am very much in favour of everybody paying their taxes as they become due.  I am opposed to any easy ride for people who want to evade paying taxes or who want to bring the wrath of this House and of the Revenue Commissioners on themselves by engaging in rather fanciful avoidance procedures.Nonetheless we should not throw out the baby with the bath water.</P>
    <P>It is going somewhat too far to give retrospective effect to anti-avoidance provisions.It should be remembered that people will have entered into commitments, will have made plans, perhaps five years ago, which is often the case with regard to capital acquisitions tax when one happens to have reached a certain stage in one's life and wants to leave one's property or assets.</P>
    <P>Indeed with present property valuation rates in Dublin, owning a house and holding an insurance policy on one's life, one could very quickly exceed the exemption <Col N="2463" /> limits for capital acquisitions tax purposes through leaving even those assets to, say, a son or daughter, because the thresholds in respect of capital acquisitions tax have not been reviewed for almost 13 years.  It seems to me that somebody making plans to avoid having their home and perhaps relatively minor insurance policy income &mdash; which they might want to leave to a son or daughter &mdash; exempt from taxation is a reasonable objective if one happens to be about to depart this world and wants to ensure that one's children can stand on their own feet.  It is not unreasonable that somebody should want to transfer a reasonable proportion of their assets to a child so that that child would be able to provide for himself or herself.  People will have made plans accordingly, particularly because the thresholds have not been increased since 1976.  Having made those plans, perhaps having saved money over many years, they now find there is a certain retrospective element in the provisions of section 76 of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Whatever about applying this anti-avoidance provision henceforth &mdash; which in itself will present certain problems to which I will refer in a moment; I am not opposed to the idea but rather to the section as drafted &mdash; it is unreasonable to pass legislation with a retrospective effect.  That is the effect the provisions of section 76 would have, particularly with regard to certain capital acquisitions tax cases.  I would suggest to the Minister that the best way to deal with this problem would be to confine the new rules to transactions taking place after 25 January when he introduced this Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 76 (2) refers to the Revenue Commissioners having the right, in reasonable circumstances, to form an opinion that a transaction is a tax avoidance one.  I am advised this gives the Revenue Commissioners very wide powers.  The whole area of what constitutes reasonable opinion is very subjective.Case law in the United States, Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom will bear that out.  There, the courts interpret what is an abuse or a misuse; it is not the Revenue authorities <Col N="2464" /> who do so.  It has led to some uncertainty which has been commented on particularly by United States judges.  For example, the Revenue authorities in the United States, Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom have quite an elaborate system of advance rulings, the aim of which is to reduce that uncertainty.</P>
    <P>Heretofore the law in this country in that respect was quite clear.  But this elaborate anti-avoidance section introduces a certain amount of subjectivity into judgement on the part of the Revenue Commissioners on transactions engaged in by certain taxpayers.  Since it is subjective their judgement can vary from time to time or perhaps even change when somebody retires in the Office of the Revenue Commissioners and is replaced.  For that reason I would urge that the Minister and the Revenue Commissioners take on themselves the practice prevalent in the United States, Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom of giving advance rulings on certain transactions so that taxpayers would know where they stood.</P>
    <P>Where it really bites is in the case of foreign companies wanting to invest here.  They should know for certain what are the tax consequences of their investing here.  It often happens that American companies wanting to set up here approach a firm of accountants seeking advice on what will be the tax rate applicable to them, what tax breaks are available and how provisions here might minimise their tax bill compared with, say, setting up in the Bronx or elsewhere.</P>
    <P>By and large those questions can be answered but under section 76 of this Bill they cannot be explained because there is a certain amount of subjectivity in regard to what is considered to be reasonable in the eyes of the Revenue Commissioners.  If the Revenue Commissioners take on this new role they should adopt the practice of the Revenue authorities in the other countries I have mentioned and give advance rulings.Then if someone asked them what the tax consequences will be of setting <Col N="2465" /> up a company in this country to do X, they should say that their attitude would be Y, and that the company would have the following tax liability.  At present there is no provision for advance ruling.</P>
    <P>I want to repeat that in principle, I am not opposed to removing these elaborate schemes of anti-avoidance and I hold no brief for them, but I do not think we should throw the baby out with the bath water and create problems for ourselves. If we give the Revenue Commissioners these subjective powers at the same time, we should require them to explain in advance how they will interpret certain situations and give advance rulings accordingly, which is the common practice in other countries.</P>
    <P>I want to turn to certain recommendations recently made by the Committee of Public Accounts.  I note that Deputy Foley is anxiously waiting to get in and as the Minister is closing the debate at 4.30 p.m.  I will try to be brief to allow Deputy Foley time to contribute.  I suggest that the Minister should look at the summary of the recommendations made by the committee because they are made with a view to, firstly improving the relationship between the taxpayer and the Revenue officials.  If taxpayers think they are participating in a fair system where all their entitlements are explained to them and they are presumed to be honest &mdash; unless there is some reason to presume otherwise &mdash; they will be more inclined to join the system.  I have been suggesting that if everybody knew exactly where they stood and knew their entitlements, it would probably improve the inflow of revenue to the State because people could not then claim they did not understand what their entitlements were. Secondly, I believe it would improve the situation in relation to tax evasion.  There are many allowances which people do not claim but if they knew they could claim them and everything was explained to them I believe they would feel part of the system and would not feel justified in evading tax.</P>
    <P>I have already gone into the exemption provisions for senior citizens but another <Col N="2466" /> area which is in need of thorough explanation to taxpayers is offsetting medical expenses against tax liabilities.  Taxpayers are entitled to do this provided they do not claim them from some other source as well, such as a health board or the VHI.  The first £50 for an individual and the first £100 for a family is not allowed but any amount after that is allowed in a year, including doctor's expenses and medicines.  All one has to do is get a medical Form 1 and make an application, but how many people do this?  Very few apply because they do not know their entitlements.  Those are two areas I wanted to bring to the attention of the House.</P>
    <P>It is very important that this chapter of taxpayers' rights which we have called for and which has been launched by the Revenue Commissioners be applied fully so that people are informed precisely where they stand.  It would help if simplified forms were used and taxpayers were asked to fill out forms which they could read.  Very often people come to see me with a Form 11 or Form 12 &mdash; I think Form 11 opens into eight pages, which contain a lot of questions &mdash; and sometimes quite literate people who might be well qualified to do so, simply cannot make out how to fill in the forms. I believe that if the forms were simplified it would be a help.</P>
    <P>I want to see the taxpayers' charter implemented and not just announced.  It is reasonable that we should have a review of the success of the implementation of the charter in about six months time.  I also believe strongly &mdash; and this has been recommended by the Committee of Public Accounts &mdash; that the Revenue Commissioners should divert resources, which they are using at present to chase compliant taxpayers, to chasing non-compliant taxpayers.  At a meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts we were told that something like 10,000 profile forms &mdash; I am choosing an arbitrary figure because I cannot remember the exact number &mdash; were issued to farmers in the southern part of the country but only about 3,000 bothered to reply. Instead of chasing the 7,000 farmers or <Col N="2467" /> two-thirds who did not reply the Revenue Commissioners chased the one-third who had replied to get more details, more information, etc.  It seems quite reasonable to suggest that the resources which are available for administering the taxes and ensuring that people meet their tax liability should be targeted at those people who are not complying with their tax liabilities and in many cases &mdash; and perhaps they do it more now &mdash; do not even bother to reply to inquiries from the Revenue authorities.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the recommendation of the committee with regard to the setting up of a technical advisory committee. This advisory committee would comprise tax practitioners and representatives of the general public who would advise not just the Revenue Commissioners but the Minister for Finance, the Department of Finance and the Committee of Public Accounts, on behalf of this House, on how the very technical detailed data we annually pass through this House affects taxpayers.  Many people are working with taxpayers and these people could contribute, and are prepared to contribute, advice and assistance which would make the revenue system work much more smoothly, resulting in a greater inflow of taxes and greater happiness on the part of taxpayers that the system is fair and running smoothly.  I believe the offer from outside groups to participate in such a technical advisory committee, which would be available to the three bodies I have mentioned, should be taken up and proceeded with without delay.</P>
    <P>I have no wish to cast any doubts on the integrity or expertise of the Revenue Commissioners.  By and large they do a very difficult job very well.  No organisation of the size of the Revenue Commissioners could be without fault, but it is wise for the Minister, this House and the Revenue Commissioners to have outside advice and information available to them which would allow them to hear at first hand the problems faced by taxpayers and be influenced along the lines of that advice to try to make the <Col N="2468" /> legislation serve the people and not the people serve the legislation or the system.</P>
    <P>There are many items I should like to have raised here today but I have only touched on some of them in my brief contribution.  I will return to some of these items on Committee Stage.  But I wanted to put down some markers.  I want to state for the record that just because I have not touched on all the recommendations of the Committee of Public Accounts does not mean any of them are of any less importance than others.  In the short time available to me I wanted to highlight certain points.  I hope the Minister will look at all of the recommendations of the Committee of Public Accounts and at the problems I have outlined in a non-controversial way, in particular section 76 and the extension of the PAYE allowance to children and spouses of taxpayers. These are very important points.  I will end my contribution at this stage in order to facilitate Deputy Foley but I will take the opportunity on Committee Stage to return to certain points I have raised.</P>

      <P>At the outset I would like to thank Deputy Mitchell for giving me the opportunity to make a contribution to the debate on the Finance Bill, 1989. The Finance Bill includes changes which will reinforce and continue the commitment of this Government to further the strategy of bringing order to the public finances and to building up the economy.  This is consistent with the broad strategy set out in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>.  This programme, adopted in October 1987 with the full support of the social partners, has achieved considerable success and will continue to do so as it provides the frame-work for further progress in economic and social development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We can see that the national debt has been stabilised and interest rates have been greatly reduced.  We now have an air of confidence in business and investment.Cost and price trends have moderated.One must congratulate the Government on their disciplined management of the public finances and the <Col N="2469" /> national economy.  It is imperative that this discipline be maintained, which is the foundation for sustained economic and employment growth and improved social conditions for all our people.  One can see from the progress achieved to date that potential gains can be made with discipline and sound policies.  As already stated interests rates have fallen, price increases are at a lower level, costs have been contained, the balance of payments is sound and as a result the real economy is improving on many fronts.  Employment prospects are now slowly but surely picking up.  These policies must continue as the strategy is right and on course for further growth.</P>
    <P>I welcome the recent changes announced in our taxation system which will lead to a restructuring and reform of our outmoded tax system.  In co-operation with the Revenue Commissioners the administration and collection processes have greatly improved with further sizeable reductions in personal tax, including a highly significant cut in the actual rates of tax, new development incentives and, at the same time, measures to ensure that earlier incentives are not abused.  Also, there have been further improvements in tax administration and regional measures to counteract transactions which are aimed mainly at tax avoidance and which, if not curbed, could prove costly to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The overall aim of a sound tax system must be to reward initiative and productive investment and further encourage genuine investment.  Further major changes in the budget include greater benefit for the long term unemployed single person who will get an increase of £5 and a married couple will receive £6. All social welfare recipients will receive increases ranging from 2.5 per cent for a widow with four children to 12 per cent for a single long term unemployed person.  The introduction of a social assistance payment for widowers and deserted husbands looking after children equal to that available to widows and deserted wives was long overdue and I commend the Minister on this point.  There was a further step towards <Col N="2470" /> rationalising the child dependant allowance by extending it to 18 year olds in full-time education.  The budget also gave a commitment to create 3,000 jobs in 1989 through development in tourism, fisheries and industry.  Also there was an increase in the capitation grant for national schools from £24 to £26.50. The allocation to emigrant welfare services was increased to £500,000.</P>
    <P>The Finance Bill implements the income tax reliefs announced in the budget.  The full year cost of these reliefs will come to over £200 million.  This is a major programme of reliefs which benefits all taxpayers.  These reliefs include increases in general and age exemption limits and the introduction of an additional £200 per child in conjunction with these.  They include a reduction in the top rate of income tax to 56 per cent and in the standard rate to 32 per cent. This is the first reduction in the standard rate for more than 30 years.  Provision is also included for the extension of the 48 per cent band by £200 for a single person and £400 for a married couple, an extension of the standard rate band by £400 for a single person and £800 for a married couple.  These measures will greatly improve the position of low paid taxpayers, particularly those with children, and will reduce the marginal tax rate faced by over 600,000 taxpayers.  As the Minister for Finance pointed out in his budget speech these changes mark a major improvement for many taxpayers. For example, a single person on PAYE with an income of £10,000 will gain up to £235, a married couple with an income of £16,000 will gain up to £324, a married couple with an income of £20,000 will gain up to £470.  As I have already said, these changes benefit all taxpayers.  In addition to improving the income position of taxpayers the Government are also committed to ending inequities in the system.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to a point made by Deputy G. Mitchell, the Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts. He referred to the recommendations made by the Committee of Public Accounts to the Government with regard to improving the relationship <Col N="2471" /> between taxpayers, the general public and the Revenue Commissioners.  It is also suggested that a charter of taxpayers' rights be publicised.  I understand that this was accepted.  I would like to see progress made on it which I hope will lead to simplified forms being issued and easy access for the ordinary taxpayer, to encourage them to call into the various offices of the Revenue Commissioners throughout the country where facilities should be made available to people with complaints.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the review of the business expansion scheme by the Department of Finance.  A number of significant changes are proposed to ensure that genuine investments are fully safeguarded while non genuine investments are excluded.  I therefore fully endorse the proposal in the Bill to exclude selfcatering accommodation in the areas mentioned from the scope of the scheme. This will ensure that the scheme achieves the type of investment which will be of most benefit to tourism.  That investment will be in projects which, having the potential to increase tourist traffic, also carry high risks for the investor.  It would also copperfasten the spirit of enterprise and risk taken which the scheme is designed to encourage.</P>
    <P>Market estimates for 1988 show an increase of almost 13 per cent on overseas visitors compared with the previous year. For 1989 as a whole it is estimated that the increase in overseas visitor numbers will be close to the growth target of 15 per cent.  Estimates for growth in tourism traffic and revenue in 1989 mean that the sector is on course for meeting the targets set out in <i>The Programme for National Recovery</i>.  In terms of increased tourism, revenue is estimated to create approximately 5,000 new jobs in the Irish economy this year.  The 1989 marketing campaign has been boosted by a special marketing programme funded jointly by the Government and the industry which is now under way to further increase tourism traffic.  As a result of this and other initiatives already in place the target for tourist numbers and revenue should, at <Col N="2472" /> least, be achieved if not succeeded during the current year.</P>
    <P>On the question of direct taxation I welcome the statement of the Minister for Finance in his opening contribution on this Bill in relation to the implications for tax reform of the 1992 indirect tax harmonisation proposals.  The Minister indicated that there are now clear indications, confirmed by the proceedings of the EC Finance Ministers' recent meeting that the earlier set of proposals put forward by the Commission will be revised.  This, as the Minister said, confirms the wisdom of the Government's approach in not rushing to implement the earlier proposals.  At the same time the prospects of some harmonisation cannot be ignored in our management and development of the tax system.</P>
    <P>It is important to realise that this Finance Bill is a key element in the Government's overall strategy for growth and development of the economy.  With leadership and discipline and the continuation of these policies we can look forward with confidence to the future. This is the one way to resolve our pressing unemployment problem and achieve the targets set out.</P>
    <P>Finally, I wish to commend to the Minister for Finance the recent submissions made to him by the Irish Wheelchair Association on behalf of the disabled. This association for the disabled have overcome tremendous hardship and deserve further special tax concessions to encourage them to continue this excellent work.  As a caring Minister for Finance I have every confidence that he will respond to this appeal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the ten minutes available to me I will refer to a number of things that have come to my attention and to the attention of the House in recent times although Members opposite have not been quick to point out some of the problems.  Mortgage interest relief was reduced in last year's budget and in this budget.  In the context of the taxation changes proposed in this Bill it is timely <Col N="2473" /> to say that, while there is general agreement about the removal of certain concessions in taxation and the substitution of a general reduction in taxation, the general feeling is that concessions are being removed but that the general reduction in taxation is not visible to the taxpayer.  It seems that the unfortunate taxpayer is getting the worst end of the deal.  People with ten year old mortgages are experiencing a loss in terms of a reduction in mortgage interest relief and the loss is not being compensated for, particularly in the case of single people, by the alleged reduction in personal taxation in the last two years.  I would not like to see next year a further reduction in mortgage interest relief and similar reliefs with no commensurate worthwhile reduction in personal taxation to compensate for that.</P>
      <P>It is likely that interest rates will increase because inflation will reappear very shortly.  Many people have entered into mortgage commitments over the past five to ten years on the basis of a certain income and certain mortgage interest reliefs.  If these reliefs do not manifest themselves over the next ten years, those individuals will find themselves in a very difficult situation.  While on the one hand a continuation of last year's and this year's fiscal policy could result in pleasing some taxpayers, that is those with small mortgages or mortgages which have almost been redeemed, it will displease another group of taxpayers, those with new mortgages who will find themselves having to meet an increased burden by virtue of inflation fuelled interest rate increases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been interested in the last few days to notice that various Government spokespersons have referred to inflation particularly to property and house building fuelled inflation.  I was probably one of the first people in this House to refer to that issue, some five or six months ago when it became obvious that something was going wrong, particularly when we compared house prices a year ago to present house prices in the city.  One has only to go across the water to see a three <Col N="2474" /> bedroomed semi-detached house fetching approximately £150,000 or £160,000, which bears no relation to the cost of production.  In that sort of situation there is obviously an inflationary problem which must be caused by something else. Either the people with the money to spend have a great deal of it, and that is not generally the situation here, or they have a readily available source of revenue.It would be wise to take account of that trend now rather than have to take account of it next year when perhaps the snowball effect might have taken place.  I am not saying that just to criticise.I know there is a danger from certain developments I have noticed relating to the inflated value of property which has come on the market.  Depending on whether one is selling or buying, many people could be quite happy with that. At any time if a product takes on a value unrelated to the cost of production it creates difficulties which need to be dealt with.</P>
    <P>Various speakers referred to the anti-employment nature of tax in this country. As we move towards 1992 there is a greater need for urgency on the part of the Minister to recognise that we need to create jobs.  While there are many hightech industries with a relatively low labour input, which are easy to encourage into the country, the Minister would do himself, his administration and the country a great deal of good by bending as much as he can towards labour intensive operations.  If we do not do that we will find ourselves in difficulties in the next number of years.</P>
    <P>Another point mentioned by a number of speakers relates to the harmonisation of taxes, excise duties and so on.  Various sounds emanating from various Ministers over the past couple of months seem to indicate that there will be no bonanza there and that we do not intend to move in the direction that is desirable in the shortest possible time by the most direct route.  There is not much sense being in Europe, attempting to utilise the provisions of the Single European Act, the internal market and all that it entails unless the Irish producer and consumer <Col N="2475" /> have reasonable access to the benefits contained therein.  There is no logic in having a taxation system biased against the producer or the consumer in this country given the open marketing and trading that will exist in 1993. Regardless of what the Minister might be told in relation to caution and the &ldquo;Steady as she goes&rdquo; maxim, one can approach things at too tardy a pace.  The Minister and the Government should involve themselves in the spirit of 1992 and in the harmonisation of taxes and various duties.  If barriers are to be removed we should not create others or leave them there in order to trip up our producers and consumers.  The Minister might have a look at that area.</P>
    <P>Another area I want to mention relates to stamp duty on houses.  Various references are made to stamp duty in the Bill.  It has become very obvious to me over the last number of years that stamp duty creates a burden on first time house buyers who are buying the average three bedroomed semi-detached house.  They have this extra burden of stamp duty to carry while they have already gone to a great deal of trouble and effort to save money to put a deposit on a house, to furnish it and so on.  On top of that the extra burden of stamp duty is creating a problem for them.  Could the Minister give some consideration in the not too distant future to improving that position a little more than we have seen so far?  I have not access to any figures or calculations on this, but it should not and could not cost a great deal.  The Minister has a few friends already, but he would win many friends if he had a look at that matter.  A few more would not go astray. I ask him to see if he can give a boost to those who are hampered by this extra cost.  There have been some moves in this direction, but not as many as I would like.</P>

      <P>First, I would like to thank all the Deputies who have contributed to the debate and to respond as best I can in the time available to the major issues which were raised.  The points relating to individual sections of the Bill can be discussed in greater detail on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>To take up briefly one or two points made by the last contributor, Deputy Durkan, it is a rather confused argument that he is trying to put forward, if I follow him correctly.  In the first instance, he argues about mortgage interest relief and at the same time is seriously concerned about the huge increase in house prices. There are many economic commentators out there who would say that the existence of mortgage interest relief is a contributor towards that situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Secondly, he talks about a fictional reduction in taxation as against the reduction in mortgage interest relief.  I do not know what sort of calculator he used to arrive at that conclusion.The change in the mortgage interest relief will bring in between £18 million and £19 million, but the tax reduction in the same budget will cost £200 million, both in a full year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>There are 600,000 odd taxpayers who got taxation relief in that budget and only a section gained mortgage interest relief.  Whether they are on the 35 per cent, 48 per cent or 58 per cent band, they all got relief.  We shall leave it at that.</P>
      <P>Deputy Durkan talks about giving relief on stamp duty.  There are plenty who would argue directly against that and say that if those people have so much money that they can pay these top of the market prices for houses, perhaps the stamp duty should be increased.  It is rather contradictory.</P>

      <P>Let the Deputy not be afraid.  We are fully immersed in the spirit of 1992.  The Deputy would not buy a pig in a poke being the good farmer's man that he is and I have no intention of doing that in relation to the harmonisation which must take place for 1993.  I shall await the revised proposals in relation to this matter which will be put on the table, it is hoped, next month in Brussels.  The previous proposals will not be implemented in the form in which they have existed for the last two years.  I do not think that any reasonable person <Col N="2478" /> would expect me to buy a pig in a poke. I see that Deputy Noonan has joined us and I have a few responses to some of the questions he raised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I was surprised at what much of the Deputy had to say in this debate in response to the economic strategy of the Government.  He has chastised me for &ldquo;failing to use the power at my disposal to cure the problems of the economy&rdquo;.This is the kind of exhortation that I would expect from a man who believes that there are instant solutions.  Why were the instant solutions not applied by the Deputy and his colleagues when they were in office, to turn the tide long before the crisis had emerged in 1986?  I know that Deputy Noonan is not a man for instant solutions but I recognise that in Opposition he must make the best of the material that is available to him.  We all know why that Government did not introduce those instant solutions.  It was because there were no simple easy solutions then and there are none now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Simple solutions were followed in the past and were self-defeating.I have said, frequently, that we need to maintain our sense of realism, and that we must see recent progress as no more than the start of a process.  It will take a long time to make major inroads into the problems of unemployment and emigration.There is no doubt, however, that the policy approach we are following is producing the results.  It provides a coherent basis on which industry and business can increase investment and jobs.  This is why industry welcomed the budget and are increasing their investment on foot of it.  I do not understand how anyone can represent the Government's desire to <Col N="2479" /> stick with a policy approach as one of inactivity.</P>
      <P>The plain fact is that employment has begun to recover, following a long period of decline.  This is borne out by the results of the 1988 labour force survey published last autumn, and by more recent data on building and manufacturing employment.It is also reflected in the falling level of unemployment.  These are the welcome results of the Government's responsible economic and financial approach.</P>
      <P>The Government's overall strategy is now fully set out in the National Development Plan.  The plan spells out the problems facing the economy and the nature of the actions necessary to resolve those problems.  It presents the strategy which this country must follow, if we are to build on the solid progress already made and to fully exploit the opportunities of the future.  It is, with the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>, the blueprint within which budgetary and general economic policy is being, and will be, framed each year.</P>
      <P>To view the plan as &ldquo;proposing solutions which are unreal or inadequate&rdquo; simply because it does not precisely detail each and every action which might be taken right up to 1993, is to misunderstand its purpose and its relationship with annual budgeting.  The measures taken in the 1989 budget are fully consistent with the national plan. The budget had as its underlying objective the promotion of sound economic activity and sustainable employment throughout the economy.  The supplementary development budget was included in the overall budget to make sure that we would lose no time in increasing the level of investment in the economy, with the assistance of the EC Structural Funds.  The budget also made major progress on social welfare and on tax reform, both of which are so closely tied in with unemployment.  The House can be assured that over the period of the National Development Plan the annual budget will continue to implement in detail the policies set out in the plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2480" /> Deputy Noonan further chastised me for &ldquo;giving little lectures on the evils of inflation&rdquo;, saying that I &ldquo;have the solution in my own hands&rdquo;.  This is nonsense.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Inflation is a function of external prices &mdash; which, as a small nation, we can do little to control; and of domestic factors, principally trends in wages, profits and taxes, which we can control.  We have got our inflation down to very low levels and are determined to keep it there.  Close control of domestic costs is the key to this.  Taxation policy, under this Government and within the constraints of prudent budgetary policy, has underpinned low inflation, in marked contrast to the years before.</P>
      <P>I was even more surprised by the way the Deputy put his proposition that &ldquo;there is scarcely an economic or social weakness which could not be remedied to some degree by an appropriate taxation response&rdquo;.  He specifically advocated reduced VAT and excises to cut into transport costs; radical reform of the personal tax system, pointing particularly to high marginal tax rates; and lower VAT and excises to support tourism growth. Of course, these would help, but in the short run only, unless accompanied by measures which offset their adverse budgetary impact.  Did his courage fail him on this score?  He made no mention of offsetting tax increases or expenditure cuts.  The only conclusion I can come to is, then, that he wants to increase borrowing once more.  We cannot solve the problems of this country by giving a new tax incentive each time we have a difficulty, nor can I understand how such an approach could be reconciled with the need to get personal taxes down further. It is a lesson that everybody has learnt &mdash; high borrowing means high taxes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the matter of special pay increases referred to by Deputies McDowell and Desmond this question must be viewed in its correct context.  The public service pay agreement has been a <Col N="2481" /> vital component of the success of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>.  Since 1987, it has enabled special pay claims to be processed through the agreed machinery but has postponed the payment of any awards or settlements for a considerable period of time.  The agreement also provided for discussions to be held if the Government considered that the payment of such increases would put at risk the central objectives underlying the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>.  Talks on the whole question of special increases are currently under way between my officials and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.</P>
    <P>I would like to make two other points on the issue raised.  The figure of £150 million mentioned is the ultimate full year cost and there is no question of this amount being paid in the short term. Furthermore, the processing of claims through the existing industrial relations procedures has preserved peace and order in industrial relations &mdash; a fact which is clearly borne out by the statistics on industrial disputes over the past two years.  I presume that Deputy McDowell is not suggesting that the Government should replace this approach by unilateral and confrontational measures. This Government have always favoured dealing with such matters by way of consensus rather than confrontation.</P>
    <P>Both Deputies Noonan and McDowell were critical of what they saw as the Government's lack of commitment to tax reform particularly in the area of personal taxation.  Here again, however, actions speak louder than words.  The fact is that we are reducing personal taxation in a concrete way, not engaging in theoretical debate about what might or might not be done.</P>
    <P>I want to assure the House that we fully accept that income tax rates are still too high, however, and that the income tax burden is too heavy.  We fully accept that it is acting as a disincentive to effort and enterprise and hampering the drive to increase employment.  We have a very simple plan for income tax: we want to get it down.  But unlike Opposition speakers, we have not got the luxury of talking <Col N="2482" /> about income tax in a vacuum.  We have to take other priorities into account, most notably the overriding necessity for rigorous control of public expenditure and firm management of the economy.  Tax reform is part of the solution needed to our problems but measures to achieve it must be consistent with the overall policy approach.</P>
    <P>I would have to go on to say that, contrary to what Opposition speakers have implied, we have made very considerable progress on income tax in the short period since we came to office &mdash; a period which, I would remind the House, demanded, and got, outstanding management of the public finances.  In the autumn of 1987, the Government negotiated the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> with the social partners.  The programme committed the Government to introduce income tax reductions to the cumulative value, over the three years of the programme, of £225 million, including increases in the PAYE allowance costing £70 million.  In the 1988 budget, my predecessor introduced income tax reliefs costing over £150 million in the 1988-89 tax year.  These included increases in the personal and PAYE allowances and in the general and age exemption limits and a major extension of the standard rate band.  These reliefs more than fulfilled the Government's commitment on the PAYE allowance and increased to nearly 63 per cent the proportion of taxpayers paying tax at no more than fulfilled the Government's commitment on the PAYE allowance and increased to nearly 63 per cent the proportion of taxpayers paying tax at no more than the standard rate.  On a cumulative basis, they are estimated to cost over £400 million over the period of the programme &mdash; or nearly double the £225 million undertaking contained in that programme.  In other words, within a few months of negotiating the programme, the Government had fulfilled &mdash; and far more than fulfilled &mdash; all the commitments on income tax relief contained in it.</P>
    <P>We have not, of course, stopped there. In this year's budget I provided income tax reliefs costing over £200 million.  They were aimed at improving the position of <Col N="2483" /> low-income taxpayers and especially lowincome families at reducing the pro-gressivity of the system and maintaining at nearly 63 per cent the percentage of taxpayers paying tax at no more than the standard rate, and finally, at reducing income tax rates themselves.  On a cumulative basis, over the remaining period of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>, they will provide more than £300 million in income tax reliefs on top of last year's package.  In total then, as I indicated earlier, the Government will have provided more than £700 million worth of income tax relief, compared with the programme commitment of £225 million.  We have, in short, given more than three times the amount we undertook to provide in the programme.  These are not the actions of a Government which has no will to deal with income tax; they are, rather, the actions of a Government which is quite clear about the need to reduce the income tax burden.</P>
    <P>Contrast this with the parties opposite. Deputy Noonan's party last year put forward a document calling for the introduction of a two rate system of income tax which was estimated at the time to cost about £660 million in a full year.  No details were provided in the document to indicate where this money was to be found.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell's party also brought out a document last year which, though very specific on the income tax and PRSI concessions to be in place by year five, was less than specific on what was to happen in years one, two, three and four. It was also vague on how the concessions were to be paid for.  To take just one example, it suggested cuts of £165 million a year in public expenditure to be in place by year five, but it was silent on where exactly the axe was to fall.</P>
    <P>These are luxuries not afforded Governments.  When a Government bring forward their budget and Finance Bill, they must say clearly not only what reliefs they are providing, but also how they will be paid for.  They are not permitted to point to vague generalities &mdash; they must make specific proposals. <Col N="2484" /> Here I should point to another contrast with Opposition Deputies in connection with mortgage interest relief.  This year's Bill provides, as Deputies are aware, for a small reduction &mdash; from 90 per cent to 80 per cent &mdash; in the amount of interest which will qualify for relief.  It is a measure which is estimated to raise £18.3 million in a full year, to help in a minor way to meet the cost of the overall package of income tax reliefs which, as I have said, is over £200 million.  What happens? Are the Government congratulated for extending the tax base and bringing down tax rates, as would be expected by anyone reading Opposition documents on tax reform?  On the contrary, Deputy Noonan signals his intention to put down an amendment to have this small restriction restored if interest rates rise, while Deputy McDowell wants a special concession for fixed rate mortgage holders. In exactly similar vein, Deputy Barry Desmond criticised us for not reducing our three rates of income tax to two, and talked of the imperative need for simplification; but he omitted to mention that his party's recent policy document recommended, not two, not three, but four income tax rates!</P>
    <P>I repeat &mdash; we are the ones who are serious about reducing the burden of income tax.  We have shown this, not by issuing vague and idealistic policy documents but by bringing realistic and costed proposals into this House and by far exceeding our undertaking in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>.  We have made significant progress on income tax reductions already and we will make a lot more in the years to come.</P>

      <P>On the wider question of 1992 and the achievement of a Community-wide indirect tax system, I have already stressed on a number of occasions that it would be premature for me to make substantial changes to our existing régimes when so much uncertainty remains over the final shape of any Community package.  The Commissioner with <Col N="2485" /> responsibility for this area.  Madame Schrivener, has now signalled very clearly and publicly her intention to bring fresh thinking to bear on the earlier proposals, which as we all know have been around for a long time and on which no significant measure of agreement could be wrought She also intends to bring fresh thinking to bear on excise duties.  Deputies will be aware that had the implementation of the earlier excise package gone ahead, it would have resulted in massive annual revenue losses and substantial distortations of existing price relatives on the domestic market.  Concern had also been expressed in medical and social circles about the potential implications of large reductions in the duties on alcoholic beverages and tobacco.  For these reasons both my predecessor and myself expressed forcibly, on numerous occasions at the Council of Finance Ministers in Europe, the need for judicious amendment of the excise proposals.  The indications are that these interventions have had the desired effect.</P>
      <P>As I indicated in my opening address, the revised proposals from the Commission on VAT and excises are due to become available around mid-May &mdash; so much for the hypocritical nonsense of asking me to buy a pig in a poke and take a step into an unknown arena.  I certainly will wait to see the proposals before shaping my response to them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> You will not slide out of that one.  You, Minister, have to make the decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Noonan dwelt on the harmonisation of VAT and excise duties, particularly as they relate to the transport and tourism sectors.  The Deputy should be aware that VAT is a recoverable expense for most businesses, so the effect of VAT rates is of a cash flow nature only.  Excise duty on articulated trucks, to which he specifically referred, is as low as 6.5 per cent.  In regard to tourism services I am glad to say that our rates compare very favourably with those of our European partners.  Hotel accommodation, meals, car, boat and caravan <Col N="2486" /> hire and tour guide services all benefit from our low 10 per cent rate and I know from my own dealings with tourism interests that they fully appreciate this favourable VAT treatment.</P>
      <P>I accept that trade distortions have arisen on either side of the Border, and that these have been due in part to differentials in taxation.  What the Government have been doing on the taxation front is well known to all &mdash; since 1987 increases in indirect taxes have been kept to a bare minimum.  This, as well as the 48-hour rule, have improved the position greatly.  Deputies will have read in recent days of the survey taken on the price differential that now exists between North and South and will have seen that the gap has narrowed right down, as a result of the progress we have made over the last two years.</P>
      <P>The excise licence increases proposed in the Bill with one or two exceptions, are generally in line with inflation, calculated by reference to the last increase some years ago, with a small degree of rounding up to avoid awkward fee levels.  As I have already said, this opportunity is being availed of to create a petrol dealers' licence as an aid to combating the smuggling of petrol from Northern Ireland.  There is already in existence a hydrocarbon dealers' licence which covers auto-diesel.</P>
      <P>In relation to Deputy Noonan's comments on the provisions in the Bill which increase the livestock rate of VAT and the farmers' flat rate refund I would refer the Deputy back to the Taoiseach's statement on this matter on budget night when he explained that, as the farming sector still owe a certain amount of health contributions and levies, the move towards restoration of flat rate refund should only be partial.  Nevertheless, this year's adjustment is significant in that it involves a transfer of £12 million to farmers in 1989 and £17 million in a full year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Noonan asked whether the proposed limit of £2.5 million on the amount a company or companies can raise under the business expansion scheme was an annual or a once-off limit. The limit is in fact a once-off limit &mdash; no <Col N="2487" /> company will be able to raise more than £2.5 million under the scheme.  This figure will take account of amounts raised before the date of publication of the Bill: in other words, where a company has already raised BES funding and is proposing to raise more, it will only be able to raise under the scheme the difference between what it has raised and the £2.5 million limit.  The Deputy also asked about the justification for removing leasing from the coverage of the scheme.  The reason for this exclusion is the fact that the benefit of a substantial proportion of the tax forgone on investment in equity in such companies would flow abroad. In other words, the benefit of our tax foregone would flow elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan had a number of queries about the restrictions in section 19 regarding section 84 loans.  First, he asked about the cost involved to the Exchequer. The cost to the Exchequer of domestic-sourced section 84 loans has greatly increased in recent years.  According to the Revenue Commissioners, the estimated net cost has increased from about £58 million for 1986 to about £80 million for 1988.  This increase in cost is due to two factors, namely, the increase in the volume of these loans and the increasing use of loans in high-interest rate currencies. The total amount of domestic-sourced section 84 loans as of last February was almost £1,300 million, an increase of about 65 per cent over the corresponding figure for February 1986. Also, the high-interest rate type of loan in currencies such as the Greek drachma and the Australian dollar has become much more common in the last two years. These loans are much more expensive to the Exchequer than the normal Irish pound section 84 loans because the bank involved borrows the funds at interest rates of between 14 and 23 per cent as against about 8.25 per cent for an Irish pound loan.  This results in the bank receiving a considerably higher amount of tax-free section 84 interest as well as having much higher funding costs for offsetting against the taxable income from other lending.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2488" /> Secondly, Deputy Noonan referred to the effect of the proposals on Shannon companies.  Manufacturing companies in the Shannon Airport zone will still be allowed to borrow domestic-sourced section 84 loans.  Non-manufacturing companies in the zone, who in fact borrow the bulk of the high-interest rate loans I have spoken about, will not be able to borrow new domestic-sourced section 84 loans from 12 April.  They will, however, have until 31 December 1991 to phase out their existing loans, which is a very generous phasing out period.  In addition, they will still be able to borrow foreign-sourced section 84 loans, of which they already make considerable use.  The leading leasing company in Shannon are reported in the press to have indicated that the changes will not impinge on their business.  The effects on two of the other main leasing companies have been described as minimal and not serious respectively.  The changes in section 19 will put such Shannon financial companies in the same position as companies in the International Financial Services Centre which are already debarred from borrowing domestic-sourced section 84 loans.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, the Deputy asked about the implications of the changes for the IDA and SFADCo incentive packages.  The key taxation element in these packages is the special 10 per cent rate for manufacturing and Shannon services companies and this, of course, is unaffected. In addition, manufacturing companies will still be allowed to borrow domestic and foreign-sourced section 84 loans for manufacturing.  All licensed services companies in the Shannon Airport zone were specifically exempted from the reduction in the 1988 Finance Act &mdash; in the first year 100 per cent capital allowances in plant, machinery and industrial buildings, and this relief is particularly valuable to the leasing companies located there.  Finally, as well as tax reliefs, the IDA and SFADCo packages also contain important grant and other non-tax elements.</P>
    <P>I would like now to turn to the points Deputy Yates made last night about the <Col N="2489" /> disabled drivers' scheme, and about my reply to a parliamentary question about a particular case tabled yesterday by Deputy Yates.  I said in my reply to the Deputy, and I quote:</P>
    <P>I am having the legislation looked at again and will be in touch with Opposition spokesmen with a view to including a possible amendment in the Finance Bill at present before the Dáil. The question of a refund of excise duty in the case in question will be sympathetically reviewed in the context of any resulting amendment to the disabled drivers' scheme.</P>
    <P>As the foregoing reply demonstrates, I am most anxious to reach an amicable solution to this issue.  There is no question of the Government or I wishing to prevent change in unsatisfactory aspects of this scheme.  This is proven by the fact that it was my predecessor who last year initiated a move to have the existing taxbased scheme replaced by a new expenditure-based scheme.  In the event agreement to this move was not forthcoming.</P>
    <P>In any change in a scheme of this kind, it will be necessary to ensure that those who in medical terms require this assistance are properly targeted while avoiding the possibility of abuse.  To this end, and in proof of my good faith in this matter, I have already undertaken to arrange discussions with Opposition spokesmen on possible changes to the existing disabled drivers' scheme and have invited suggestions as to how our objectives can best be achieved.  My aim will be to arrive at an agreed change to the terms of the existing scheme which will make it more humane and effective.</P>
    <P>I welcome the support in principle expressed from all sides for a general anti-avoidance provision.  It is quite clear that, with the ever-increasing sophistication and complexity of schemes to avoid payment of tax, something has to be done to retrieve the balance in favour of the general body of taxpayers.  This is the motivation behind the provision in section 76 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies &mdash; notably Deputy McDowell, Deputy Noonan and <Col N="2490" /> Deputy O'Malley &mdash; raised specific points and worries which they have about the section as drafted.  I will be happy to discuss the issues raised when we go into detail on the Committee Stage.  At this juncture I would just like to underline again some of the procedures and safeguards which are built into the section.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners will be required to act in a reasonable way.  They cannot move to disallow a tax benefit under the provision until they have given the person concerned adequate time to challenge, through an appeal, the Revenue opinion that a transaction is aimed primarily at tax avoidance.</P>
    <P>In hearing an appeal the Appeal Commissioners or the Circuit Court, as the case may be, will be able to look at all the facts relevant to the case, including the form and substance of the transaction and its final outcome and any information not previously made available to Revenue, to see if, on all the facts, the Revenue Commissioners' opinion is correct. Only when this process is concluded, and provided the outcome of the appeal is in their favour, can the Revenue Commissioners take action to follow through on the opinion they had formed.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned in my opening address there are other specific safeguards built into the section for genuine business transactions and the taking up of recognised tax reliefs.  These safeguards would explicitly limit any use of the section by Revenue to interfere with bonafide transactions and would represent a very definite direction from the Oireachtas to the Revenue Commissioners in this regard. The discretion given to the Revenue in this area would extend only to action against tax avoidance based on an abuse of relief provisions.  This degree of discretion is necessary if the whole purpose of the general anti-avoidance section is not to be nullified.</P>
    <P>As regards, the effective date of operation of the section, I would stress that there is no question of going back to reopen tax settled many years ago, as some Deputies have suggested.  Our concern is just to ensure that tax avoidance <Col N="2491" /> schemes entered into before budget day will not affect the Exchequer for many years to come.  This whole section is an important one and I look forward to returning to it and discussing its scope in detail on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies expressed concern about the introduction of the annual accounting option for small-scale employers and traders.  Deputy Noonan was worried about the cash flow effect on traders and Deputy Mac Giolla was concerned about possible abuse by employers.</P>
    <P>I would like to stress that only very small-scale traders and employers will be involved in this scheme and the amount of revenue involved is only a minute fraction of the overall yield from the taxes in question.  In relation to the concerns expressed by the Deputies, I would emphasise again that the scheme is optional and traders can still opt for periodic payments if they wish to preserve their existing cash flow arrangements. Deputies can also rest assured that the Collector-General will closely monitor the scheme to guard against any abuses. In my view Deputies should focus on the positive elements of the scheme, namely, that it will reduce the administrative burden on certain small-scale traders and employers and will release more resources in Revenue to pursue evasion, default and better collection.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Noonan had a few queries on section 16, the new legislation on the taxation of collective investment undertakings.  The first point I want to make in reply is that such undertakings which are located in the International Financial Services Centre and in the Shannon customs-free zone, must be for the exclusive benefit of non-residents. No Irish tax charges will arise in respect of the income and capital gains of these <Col N="2492" /> undertakings.  Undertakings located elsewhere in Ireland will also be free from income and capital gains tax.  In so far as the income and gains of these undertakings are distributed to Irish residents, the Irish residents will be liable to tax on them and the withholding tax provisions will apply at the point of distribution. The withholding tax will also apply to the undistributed income of undertakings outside the financial centre and Shannon.</P>
      <P>Deputy Noonan also referred to section 17, which is an anti-evasion provision in relation to Irish investors in foreign UCITS.  Let me assure the Deputy that this section does not place any impediment in the way of the free movement of capital within the EC.  But there are systems in place to monitor capital movements and we are going to use these &mdash; and any other mechanism available to us &mdash; to prevent tax evasion.  I hope all sides of this House will support our efforts in this regard.</P>
      <P>In regard to the clarification sought by Deputy Noonan on section 13, this is not a new measure.  It is merely a technical amendment to put beyond doubt the intention that the maximum total of first-year capital allowances on farm buildings is to be 50 per cent, with the remaining 50 per cent of expenditure being written off at the rate of 10 per cent per annum. Last year's Finance Act introduced the maximum accelerated allowance of 50 per cent for farmers, as for every other category of taxpayer.</P>
      <P>Deputy Noonan's concerns about the scope of section 20 are unfounded.  The extension is very specific, and is limited to technical or consultancy services which are directly related to software development and data processing services and which have been grant-aided by the IDA. Other types of consultancy will not qualify and there is no difficulty in distinguishing between them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the toll-roads provision in section 15, the previous relief of 50 per cent expired at end March.  In order to encourage private sector investment and participation in toll-road developments, a full write-off of expenditure will now be allowed.  It is intended, when the <Col N="2493" /> National Roads Authority is set up on a statutory basis, that it will be empowered to operate tolls on national roads and to enter into agreements with private interests whereby those interests would be remunerated from tolls on the road in return for their financial contribution to all or part of the construction costs of the road.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I would again like to thank Deputies for their contributions and I look forward to the discussion on the individual sections of the Bill on Committee Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I thank you for giving me the time to raise this matter on the Adjournment here today.  Since my time has already been eaten into by the Vote, I will put the facts as best as I can in the time available to me.</P>
      <P>The circumstances as explained to me by the family of the late Linda Carter, aged 19 years, are as follows.  She was at a 21st birthday party in the Harcourt Hotel, Dublin, on the evening of Saturday 8/ morning of Sunday 9 April.  She collapsed when her legs gave way.  Hotel employees and her friends saw that she was quite unwell and sent for an ambulance.</P>
      <P>She was taken to the Meath Hospital where she was detained.  Her friends, two girls, accompanied her to the hospital.  I am informed she was detained at the casualty department on what has been described to me as a trolley.  Her friends were told to come back for her the next morning.</P>
      <P>During the night she had stomach trouble and her friends were contacted by telephone, I think by the girl herself, and asked to bring clean clothes and underwear.  This, in my view, is relevant since it may well have indicated that there was a brain dysfunction or at least a body dysfunction.  When her friends called she was in the same department.</P>
      <P>The first her parents heard of the trouble was when her friends called to the house looking for clean clothes.  Her mother had understood she was staying the night with another local girl who was also at the party.  When she left the hospital, I am told by taxi, she again had a turn.  When she arrived home at midmorning on Sunday her mother put her to bed and commenced washing her clothes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The mother went to Sunday Mass and when she returned she found the girl <Col N="2495" /> unconscious in bed.  She summoned an ambulance.  It appears that she had a further stomach upset at this stage.  She was taken to St. James's Hospital where she was urgently attended to and, at approximately 5.30 p.m. on that Sunday she was transferred by ambulance in the company of a doctor and other medical staff to Beaumont Hospital and her family were told she was dead at approximately 7.30 p.m.  Her parents were told she had had a brain haemorrhage and it was probably the second seizure.</P>
    <P>The coroner confirmed to me this morning that the lady died from a brain haemorrhage following an aneurism and that she died from natural causes.  The Minister, being a doctor, will understand, but for the record of the House, the coroner described an aneurism to me as being similar to a bicycle tyre that has a hole in it with the tube protruding from it.  This weakness, this bubble in the tube burst and the girl had been bleeding for some time.</P>
    <P>The questions that need to be answered and which the family want answered are:</P>
    <P>1.  Why was the girl left in her own clothes, particularly after her stomach problem, at the casualty department?</P>
    <P>2.  What tests or treatment did she receive?</P>
    <P>3.  Why did the Meath Hospital not contact the family to give an explanation unprompted, which would be at least the decent thing to do in circumstances of this kind, rather than waiting for the family to make an inquiry?</P>
    <P>Mrs. Carter, although in a distraught state, offered the hospital her daughter's kidneys and any other organs that might be used to save the life of another person. Unfortunately, Beaumont Hospital could not take up this offer because the girl had been haemorrhaging for the best part of 24 hours.  I now want to read onto the record of the House a letter received by me, unsolicited, this afternoon.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2496" /> Dear Mr. Mitchell,</P>
    <P>In regard to report in &ldquo;Evening Press&rdquo; of 19th April, where it is reported that you sought Dáil time to enquire into the death of Linda Carter, I had an experience of a similar nature myself in February 1982.</P>
    <P>I left the office here at around 5.30 p.m. and walked to Amiens Street Station to catch the Sligo train (6.15 p.m.) to travel to where I live.  As I was about to board the train I felt my legs getting weak and I collapsed into a state of unconsciousness.  CIE officials contacted the hospital and I was removed by ambulance to the Meath Hospital.  On my arrival at the hospital I was attended to immediately by two young doctors from &ldquo;casualty&rdquo;.  I was given all types of tests but the doctors appeared to believe that I had a heart attack.  I was put into a small room and lay on a bed there overnight (fully dressed).  In this room there were a number of &ldquo;Winos&rdquo; lying on mattresses on the ground and I assure you that smell of stale drink was not pleasant. The hospital got in contact with my home and my daughter collected me at around 9 a.m. when I was discharged. All this time I have a very bad headache and I remember telling the doctors that whatever was wrong that the problem was definitely in my head. When I arrived home I went to bed and had the good fortune to ring my own doctor &mdash; who came out to see me.  He asked me if I had a &ldquo;Lumber Pumpture&rdquo; in the hospital.  I did not know what a &ldquo;Lumber Pumpture&rdquo; was and he explained to me that it was the removal of fluid from the base of the spine for examination.  I told him that I had not got such a test and he rang the hospital immediately.  Later I got a 'phone call from the hospital requesting me to return when on a Lumber Pumpture being performed it showed that I had a brain haemorrhage.  I was then rushed to Vincent's Hospital and put under the care of Mr. Donovan, who diagnosed an Aneurism.  I was <Col N="2497" /> subsequently operated on and recovered.It was explained to me afterwards that when an artery in the brain burst it congealed and the blood started to flow again through the brain and I regained consciousness.  If I had any type of blood pressure it would not have congealed and I would have died.</P>
    <P>If I had not called in my family doctor I am satisfied that the bleeding would have recommenced with movement of the head and I would have died at home.</P>
    <P>My sole purpose in writing you this letter is to bring to your notice that the death of Linda Carter was not an isolated affair.  I cannot say why my trouble was not diagnosed in the &ldquo;Meath&rdquo; but I did think that the doctors in &ldquo;Casualty&rdquo; were grossly overworked.</P>
    <P>Your interest may save a life.  Keep up the good work.  You may use the contents of this letter but do not disclose my name.</P>
    <P>I want to make it very clear that I am not attacking the staff of the Meath Hospital nor the Meath Hospital as an institution. It seems clear that if this man's life had been saved where an aneurism had been the cause of the problem while this lady died from a brain haemorrhage arising from an aneurism which was not diagnosed and was sent home in such a condition, there are very serious questions to be answered.  It is fair and reasonable that when a 19 year old girl died in these circumstances the matter should be explained in a full and frank manner. Furthermore the Minister should give an instruction to every hospital in the country that where this situation arises that the family should be contacted by the hospital, unprompted, given a full and frank explanation and a report on the matter within a given period.  Justice must be done and must be seen to be done.  If there was something wrong in this case we must ensure that there is no repetition.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I want to point out that the family in this case, the Carter family, <Col N="2498" /> have adopted a very reasonable approach to this matter.  They have lost their 19 year old daughter, one of 11 children, in circumstances which none of us in this House would tolerate.  The circumstances need to be explained in detail to that family and that should have been done, unprompted, long before now.  I hope the Minister will have by now carried out an inquiry.  If he does not have the full report of the inquiry with him, I would ask him to forward it to me and to the Carter family as soon as possible so that we can get to the bottom of this matter.</P>

      <P>I would like to sympathise with the family of this lady who died in Beaumont Hospital.  As Deputy Mitchell has said, she was admitted to the Meath Hospital at 3.40 a.m. on 9 April 1989.  I have requested, as a matter of urgency, detailed reports from the three hospitals involved in the treatment of this person. It would be inappropriate for me to comment on this case until such time as the hospitals' reports detailing the medical and nursing care provided have been received and examined in my Department. I can, however, say that the preliminary information available to me clearly indicates that the patient received all appropriate medical and nursing attention during her stay in the Meath Hospital and was kept under constant observation.  I mention this because it might appear from media comment that she was left lying on a trolley without attention.</P>

On the question of aneurisms, because Deputy Mitchell raised the issue and without knowing the facts in this particular case, an aneurism is a bulge in a blood vessel and in all probability it is there for some time before it ruptures.  It <Col N="2499" /> is not something that would be immediately diagnosed without very intensive investigation and that is not the sort of investigation that is carried out as a matter of routine.</P>

      <P>More than 100 tonnes of arms were seized aboard the <i>Eksund</i> by the French authorities in October 1987.  As I informed the House during the debate on security matters on 10 November 1987, there are reasons for believing that four separate cargoes of arms may have been landed here in 1985 and 1986 with a combined tonnage in excess of that amount.  Since that information came to light, the Garda, through a sustained programme of intensive searching, have recovered amounts of arms, ammunition and explosives on a scale not seen before. There have also been very sizeable finds in the North of similar materials thought to have been part of the cargoes referred to.  However, the indications are that a very great amount of the armaments contained in the pre-<i>Eksund</i> shipments have yet to be recovered.  The Garda are continuing to carry out searches as they consider necessary and significant finds are being made on a regular basis.</P>

      <P>The House may recollect that a dispute between my Department and the Prison Officers' Association arose last year out of the engagement of 200 additional prison officers, accompanied by the implementation of new rosters for basic grade staff which had the objective of reducing overtime expenditure by £4 million per annum.</P>
      <P>In October last an independent review of rostering arrangements in the prison service, conducted by the chairman of the Employer-Labour Conference, produced a roster which was unacceptable as it would have involved significant additional expenditure.  Since then, very detailed discussions have been taking place between my Department and the Prison Officers' Association.  Agreement has recently been reached on the introduction of revised attendance rosters, which do not have these cost implications, for basic grade prison officers in the various institutions.</P>
      <P>The principal elements of this agreement are: (1) agreed rosters which achieve a mutually satisfactory balance between the objectives of management and staff and which do not have any on-going additional cost implications will be implemented, and (2) a once-off payment of £1,000 per officer will be made to staff affected by the revised arrangements.</P>
      <P>I am pleased that it has been possible to devise an agreed solution to the rostering problem which enables overtime savings to be achieved on an on-going basis while also providing significantly improved working arrangements from the point of view of staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The revised rostering arrangements have already been implemented in four of the institutions concerned and they <Col N="2434" /> will become operational in the other institutions in the coming weeks.  Their operation will be monitored closely by my Department in conjunction with the on-going review of prison staffing and overtime working.</P>

      <P>However, the Garda authorities have decided to convert to the use of unleaded petrol on a phased basis as vehicles in the fleet which cannot use unleaded petrol are replaced and as the availability of unleaded petrol throughout the State increases.  As a first step, the vehicles assigned to Garda Headquarters, including the Ministerial fleet, will be changed to unleaded petrol towards the end of May, when the current petrol stocks in the storage tank there are used up and are replaced with unleaded petrol.  Garda vehicles assigned to other centres will be changed to unleaded petrol on a phased basis as soon as circumstances allow.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 56, 57, 58 and 59 together.</P>
      <P>Six Irish beef processing companies applied for export credit insurance in respect of beef exports to Iraq in 1987 and 1988.  The first two companies to apply had, at the time of their applications, firm contracts for the supply of beef to Iraq.  At the same time, the total amount of insurance cover sought by these two companies &mdash; when added to existing exposure on the market and allowing for a reasonable level of residual cover for industrial exports &mdash; reached the overall limit set for the market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Accordingly, it was possible to facilitate only the first two applicant companies with export credit insurance in respect of their firm contracts.  To the best of my <Col N="2450" /> knowledge these two companies were not or are not connected.</P>
    <P>As is normal practice since the inception of the scheme it would not be appropriate for me to disclose particulars regarding meat export contracts for any particular market for which export credit insurance was provided.  This is confidential information relating to the commercial operations of individual companies and its public disclosure could be harmful to the interest of the companies concerned.  In any event it is not the contracts themselves which are insured under the export credit scheme but rather the irrecoverable letters of credit which are drawn up pursuant to these contracts for payment purposes.</P>
    <P>There are a variety of reasons why figures for insured exports may differ from official CSO trade statistics such as (a) figures for exports insured under the export credit scheme are based on turnover estimates provided by exporters on an annual basis or at the time of their application to the Insurance Corporation of Ireland Plc (ICI) for cover.  These estimates would not always be on a calendar year basis but would be related to the insurance period under the policy.  CSO figures relate to specific calendar months or years; (b) insurance policies are issued on the basis of exporters' estimated turnover in a particular insurance period.</P>
    <P>The actual amount exported can vary from these estimates and (c) insurance cover can be provided by ICI in respect of onward sales of Irish goods by a subsidiary agency or distribution company based abroad.</P>
    <P>In the case of Iraq the Department are aware of the difference in the figures and have been examining and are continuing to examine the matter in consultation with the Central Statistics Office, the Insurance Corporation of Ireland, the Department of Agriculture and Food and the exporters.</P>

      <P>The necessary inquiries into an application for the provision of educational services in the Portumna area of County Galway for mentally handicapped pupils are in hands.  The investigation is still at an early stage.  Should it be decided that services were required in the area, it is unlikely that services would be available for September 1989. In view of the Deputy's interest, I will arrange to have him informed of developments.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 73, 74 and 75 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a)  In July 1988 the architects engaged by the chairman of the board of management of St. Benedict's National School, Grange Park, Raheny, Dublin 5, informed my Department that when remedial works arising from a fire in one of the classrooms were being undertaken it was discovered that the reinforcement bars to the roof had become exposed.  In October the Chairman's architect submitted quotations for the works necessary to deal with the problem.  My Department are urgently considering the <Col N="2459" /> question of the sanction of a grant in consultation with their professional advisers and will convey a decision to the school authorities at an early date.</P>
    <P>(b) The general scheme of improvements referred to by the Deputy has been completed with grant aid from my Department.  The chairman of the board of management of the school has applied for a supplemental grant in respect of these works and this is being considered in conjunction with the examination of the final account which was submitted to my Department on 30 March 1989.  A decision will be made in this respect at an early date and the appropriate grant payment issued.</P>
    <P>(c) My Department have recently sanctioned a grant in respect of the provision of makralon windows at the school where required and have authorised their professional advisers to advise the school authorities to proceed with the works. The application for grant aid was received in my Department in January 1989.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education the reason a higher education, non-adjacent, grant has been refused to a person (details supplied) in County Kildare when she lives more than 15 miles from the university; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke) Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>In accordance with the provisions of the higher education grants scheme 1988, the lower adjacent rate of the maintenance element of grant where such element is payable, is applied in the case of every candidate whose normal family residence is within 15 miles of the university which he/she is attending, and in the case of a candidate who could reasonably be expected, in the light of distance and local public transport service, to travel daily between his/her home and such university.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is understood from Kildare County Council, who are responsible for the administration of the scheme in this case, <Col N="2460" /> that the applicant's home is within 15 miles of the college he is attending. Accordingly, the maintenance element of grant payable under the provisions of the scheme is the lower/adjacent rate only.</P>
