  </MainHeading>
  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="Shannon Free Airport Development Company" RHead="Limited (Amendment) Bill, 1988: Second Stage">
    <Title>Shannon Free Airport Development Company Limited (Amendment) Bill, 1988: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. R. Burke) Raphael P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to give statutory effect to the Government decision to extend the Shannon Free Airport Development company's industrial development responsibilities to include North Kerry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government decision to bring forward this legislation had its origins in an earlier decision &mdash; taken in July, 1988 &mdash; to divide the country into seven sub regions for the purpose of preparing operational programmes for the national development plan to be submitted in relation to the expanded EC Structural Funds.  Boundaries were drawn up with a view to grouping together countries, or parts of countries, having regard to, among other things, geography, population, common concerns and economic <Col N="573" /> structures.  For this purpose, the mid-west area was deemed to include north Kerry as well as counties Clare, Limerick, Tipperary North Riding and West and South West Offaly.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances, and since SFADCo had already done much of the preliminary work in preparing and integrated development plan for the area, the Government considered it logical to extend the company's operational remit to include that part of north Kerry which is incorporated in the mid-west region for Structural Fund purposes.</P>
    <P>Another logical reason for extending the company's remit is that the Shannon Estuary as a whole is coming increasingly to be recognised as a distinct area and one, moreover, with significant development potential.  The estuary has long been acknowledged as a tremendous natural asset to the region but it also has a number of inbuilt and infrastructural advantages from the industrial and tourism development points of view.  Among the facilities available in the estuary are: a good fresh water supply (up to 90,000 cubic metres, or 20 million gallons per day, can be made available); electricity available from power stations at Tarbert (650 mw) and Moneypoint (900 mw); good harbour facilities, including bulk solid and liquid pipeline loading facilities at Moneypoint and Aughinish; Natural gas (available by pipeline to a point on the estuary between Limerick and Aughinish); large oil storage and handling capacities; and coal handling facilities at the Moneypoint site.</P>
    <P>From the tourism point of view the area boasts considerable scenic appeal, major SFADCo tourism amenities on the north side of the estuary and tremendous water sports potential.</P>
    <P>Up to now the Clare and Limerick portions of the estuary were, for industrial development purposes, in the mid-west region and were the responsibility of Shannon Development, while north Kerry was in the south west region and was handled by IDA.  This division obviously did not help in the development of a fully integrated strategy for the estuary. The new unified region will allow a more <Col N="574" /> comprehensive approach to be taken towards the planning, promotion and development of the estuary.  The estuary will now be promoted and marketed as one unit; economic investigations and other studies will be carried out in relation to it in its entirety and it can be developed in terms of its totality, without the disadvantages of internal demarcation.</P>
    <P>Another example of the Government's commitment to develop the estuary as a coherent unit is the decision to establish a single harbour authority for the river mouth.  The Bill to give effect to that decision is also before the House at present and it is hoped to have it also enacted in the current session.</P>
    <P>Bringing north Kerry into the mid-west region also exploits the link between Limerick and Tralee, and enables this link to be used as a &ldquo;lever&rdquo; for development. The Limerick/Tralee route is a heavy tourist route and bringing it into one region allows the tourist potential along the route to be maximised.</P>
    <P>Tralee's Regional Technical College has a strong tradition of programmes and courses that assist economic development in the area.  This is a tradition similar to that of the education/industry interfaces established by the university-designate in Limerick.  The presence of both colleges in the one region will encourage interaction between the colleges and further develop this type of linkage.</P>
    <P>The food industry is well established in north Kerry, through companies such as the Kerry Co-op group.  The existing mid-west region also has a strong food sector, particularly in Limerick and Tipperary and linking the two regions will, it is felt, encourage an integrated approach to the food sector.</P>
    <P>As the House is aware, the Government assigned from 1 January 1988, responsibility for tourism and industrial development, including medium and large scale industry, in the mid-west region to SFADCo.  Prior to that SFADCo was responsible only for the promotion and development of small <Col N="575" /> industry in the region; IDA had responsibility for medium and large industry. That decision resulted in a rationalisation of the agencies operating within the mid-west region and the creation, in SFADCo, of a single integrated regional development body.  From the beginning of 1988, the company assumed the functions of the IDA, Bord Fáilte Éireann and the relevant county development teams and regional tourism organisations.</P>
    <P>That change was intended primarily to ensure that SFADCo made a creative and pioneering contribution to the integrated development of the region in line with the objectives of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> being spearheaded by the Government and the social partners.  The Government are more than happy with the manner in which the company have fulfilled their expanded role during 1988.</P>
    <P>A target of 20,000 new industrial jobs per year was set under the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> which was agreed between the Government and the social partners just over a year ago.  At the beginning of 1988, the Shannon Development Company set an ambitious job creation target of 2,000 new jobs in the mid-west region as their contribution to the national target.  I am glad to say that that target was comfortably exceeded and that the actual outturn for the year was 2,817 new jobs.  These are new jobs on the ground and are based on a recently completed, detailed survey of the industrial firms in the region.  Perhaps of even greater significance is that the survey shows a net gain in industrial employment of close to 1,000 in the region last year.</P>
    <P>In all a total of 25 new projects were approved for the region during 1988. These projects involve a capital investment of £10.7 million and the promoters envisage that 705 new jobs will be created over the next three to five years.  In addition a total of 17 industrial expansions were approved and publicly announced during 1988.  These expansions are expected to create 510 new jobs over the next three to five years and <Col N="576" /> involve capital investment of £14.0 million.</P>
    <P>In many respects, of course, SFADCo have always been to the forefront in developing initiatives in the industrial and tourism areas.  Their promotion, for example, of small industry in the region in the past has been both effective and imaginative.  Similarly their efforts on the tourism promotion front have proved highly successful.  The development of the &ldquo;Castle Banquet&rdquo; concept at Bunratty, Knappogue and Dunguaire and of the folk park at Bunratty has done much to create a distinctive and readily-identifiable image for the Shannonside region both at home and abroad.</P>
    <P>Another concept which was pioneered in the region and has now been adopted in other areas is the development of links between industry and third level education, most notably in the National Institute for Higher Education in Limerick which, of course, the Government have now decided to upgrade to university status.</P>
    <P>In addition, I had the pleasure before Christmas of laying the foundation stone for a new international science centre in Plassey Technological Park representing another step in the furthering of this two-way flow of information, training and interaction between education and industry. The building of the centre, which will provide facilities for firms to research process testing or the manufacture of prototypes and which will have direct access to the NIHE facilities, is an extremely important initiative.</P>
    <P>The inclusion of north Kerry in Shannon Development's enlarged area of responsibility involves the addition of more than 100 companies employing almost 3,500 people to the region's existing established industry base.  Shannon Development will focus considerable attention on the development of this base in north Kerry.  This will involve the implementation in the county of the strategy successfully implemented in the mid-west region during 1988 and will entail intensive and pro-active efforts in dealing with existing companies.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="577" /> Shannon Development will also continue to promote the enlarged Shannon region as a location for new indigenous and overseas manufacturing and international services investment.</P>
    <P>Shannon Development's principal aim in north Kerry over the next three years will be to maximise employment in manufacturing and international services in the area.  As in 1988 the company will, through their policy of integrated development, strive to ensure that there is a balanced spread of employment growth throughout the enlarged Shannon region.</P>
    <P>SFADCo exercise their powers to assist industry in the mid-west region, exclusive of the Shannon free zone under delegated authority from the IDA in line with national industrial development policy.</P>
    <P>Specifically the new Bill provides for: (a) the amendment of section 2 of the 1970 Act in order to add north Kerry to the mid-west region to enable moneys to be expended by SFADCo to meet their running expenses in relation to industrial development there; and (b) the amendment of section 4 of the 1970 Act in order to add North Kerry to the mid-west region in respect of which the Industrial Development Authority may, at present, delegate their grant-giving powers to SFADCo.</P>
    <P>I am advised that no legislative changes are required to extend the company's tourism remit to north Kerry.  This will be done on an administrative basis.</P>
    <P>I therefore commend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill which gives effect to the increased jurisdiction and expanding development role of Shannon Free Airport Development Company. It is the objective of the company to develop the Shannon region through the integrated promotion and development of industry, tourism and aviation for the benefit of the Irish economy and also to ensure the growth of Shannon Airport in trade, passengers and services. Any extension of the powers available to SFADCo is to be welcomed in that it will <Col N="578" /> strengthen this unique organisation in the public service.  SFADCo are not as constrained as many other State-sponsored bodies.  They have wide powers and can behave like a commercial company; limitations are not imposed by a specific statute and with articles and memorandum of association they have a high degree of flexibility.</P>
      <P>From a regional point of view there is evidence of their involvements and attainments.  In the mid-west there are field officers in the counties as well as other staff and there is a wide distribution of advance factories and novel and innovative schemes have been put forward. The increased remit in all industries including tourism is attributed to this successful company.  I welcome the fact that the company have adopted a partnership approach to their regional development work and I would urge the company to continue to place emphasis and focus on this aspect.  This is a necessity for the company's strategy and proposals for development to continue to be openly discussed with a wide range of bodies and individuals within the region and for reform where appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A key element in the future success of the integrated approach to the development of the region must be unity of purpose among the people of the region and a determination to work for the achievement of well balanced and effective programmes. In this regard I would like to draw attention to the Fine Gael policy document compiled by my colleague, Deputy John Bruton, entitled <i>An Economic Accord for 1992,</i> with particular reference to regional planning under regional development authorities.  Fine Gael believe that there is an untapped resource of commitment and innovation in every part of the country.  The success of SFADCo in the mid-west region shows this.  Manufacturing employment was maintained in the Shannon region in the period 1981-87 whereas it declined by 35,000 in Ireland as a whole.  New development initiatives have been undertaken in the Shannon region such as the National Food Centre, the Innovation <Col N="579" /> Centre and the Plassey Technological Park.  These initiatives derive to a very great extent from local commitment and local ideas.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael believe that similar success can be achieved in other regions and suggest the establishment of a regional development authority in each of the regions chosen by the Government in their announcement on 26 August 1988. The first task of these authorities would be the implementation of the new programme under the European Communities Structural Funds.  Fine Gael propose that the authority in each of the regions would have the following composition: three representatives nominated by the Government from among the relevant Government Departments, the IDA, Córas Tráchtála, Bord Fáilte, Teagasc, Eolas and the Irish Goods Council &mdash; these three persons would jointly represent all of these bodies in a co-ordinated way; one representative selected by the Government from among the three names submitted to them by the county and city managers from the region in question; two representatives chosen by the Government from three names put forward jointly by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the Confederation of Irish Industry, the Federated Union of Employers, the Association of Chambers of Commerce, the Irish Farmers Association and the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association &mdash; with the exception of the Association of the Chambers of Commerce, these are bodies represented on the existing National Economic and Social Council; and four independent persons chosen by the Government, one of whom should be the chairman of the authority, as persons with expertise in economic development. One of these independent persons would represent young people or youth organisations active in the region in question.</P>
    <P>These new regional development authorities should have functions broadly similar to those exercised by SFADCo. These functions should be set out in a detailed statutory from in a new regional <Col N="580" /> development Bill.  In broad terms the Shannon Free Airport Development Company's functions are to develop and test concepts and systems which would lead to a dramatic growth of small indigenous industries, traded services and tourism.  Responsibility for large industry should also be retained by the IDA and Údarás na Gaeltachta should continue to operate in the Gaeltacht parts of each region.  The regional authorities should be financed by grant in aid from the Government and by local contributions from county and city councils. They would take over the regional functions, and the relevant staff of the IDA small industries and regional divisions, and of Bord Fáilte's regional tourism organisations.</P>
    <P>The establishment of regional development authorities on these lines in Ireland has been approved by the European Parliament in its debate on the Hume Report on the Regional Problems of Ireland.  The Hume Report said:</P>
    <P>Devolution of powers to a number of regional authorities and a strengthening of the role of local authorities, based on a rational allocation of functions between levels of Government, would have the effect of releasing local energies and encouraging citizens to participate in realisation of economic objectives for their region.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael agree with this and that is why they made the foregoing proposals.</P>
    <P>It is also noteworthy that the Hume Report expressed its concern at the extreme concentration of the nation's advanced technology in the Dublin region and called for a wider and fairer distribution of technological resources. The regional development authorities proposed by Fine Gael would facilitate a wider diffusion of technological resources to the regions, in line with the Hume Report.  The performance of Shannon Development underlines the importance of regional authorities and the role of regional development as an instrument of economic and social cohesion.  I strongly believe that the experience of this region should be harnessed and availed of to <Col N="581" /> initiate similar regional structures throughout the country.  The key factors for development strategies in peripheral regions are now apparent as a result of the Shannon Development experience to date.  These are: (1) the costs of location; (2) centres of excellence; (3) regional structures; (4) national support; (5) community support; (6) response to 1992 and (7) the need for a co-ordinated vision.</P>
    <P>The first factor relates to overcoming the costs of the location in the periphery. We are on the periphery of Europe.  Not only that, we are on an island, outside another island, off the mainland of Europe.  In terms of access transport and transport costs, the obvious outcome is that firms operating from here must pay a higher premium to service central markets than do producers within those markets. What is important is not just the absolute transport costs.  Equally crucial is the level of transport services, and the level of transport facilities.  Inadequacies in these areas bear more heavily on the exporter from here than the actual rate or charge.  An example will hopefully illustrate what I mean.  Shannon Airport, for example, has excellent direct air connections to the USSR and to North and South America on a year round basis. It does not have direct connections to Brussels, Paris, Frankfurt or the other important European centres.  Business travellers from Shannon to Europe must travel via other airports, such as Dublin or London, to their destinations.  The extra time factor and the inconvenience involved in these services adds substantially to transport costs.  So, overcoming these barriers either through the provision of services or through transport subsidies, or by other measures, must figure largely in any development strategy for a peripheral region.</P>
    <P>Included within the costs of a location in the periphery is the issue of telecommunications. The Regional Development Fund has provided assistance to Ireland in the expansion of its telecommunications network, and the Star Programme has proved particularly <Col N="582" /> important in this area.  Enhancing telecommunications allows access to information without reference to distance and can improve the competitiveness of firms in the perpipheral areas.</P>
    <P>We need also to look at non-material costs.  These include attitudes and skills. For example, we have evidence to show that firms in the periphery tend to have less experience of dealing with export markets than firms in core regions.  This also can extend to poor standards of quality, inferior design and lack of price competitiveness compared with similar firms located in core regions.</P>
    <P>The second key factor is the need to develop centres of excellence in the periphery. If firms in the peripheral regions are to strengthen their competitive positions they need access to centres of technological excellence and to centres of educational excellence.  We need to develop idea centres, centres that will provide research and technology and education that will support the types of enterprises that will effectively compete out of peripheral locations.  For example, there are many types of industries for whom physical location is less important and transport costs relatively less significant. We need to focus on those sectors and to identify how we can develop projects around the leading edge in the development of these sectors.  To do this we need to develop strong linkages between universities and industry and Government agencies.  We need to be able to do this in peripheral regions and not to have to rely on diffusion outwards from core areas for these ideas.</P>
    <P>The third key factor has to do with having the right regional structures in peripheral regions.  Peripheral regions are not just peripheral in the sense of distance &mdash; they are in many cases more so in terms of power and decision making. The location of development decisions within peripheral regions represents a strong impetus towards the promotion of change.  By locating decision making functions within the regions a number of exciting possibilities emerge.  We can, for example, attune the region to international conditions; ensure that decisions <Col N="583" /> about development are consistent with the resources and aspirations of the region and problems or conflicts between programmes can be more readily resolved.  In other words, peripheral regions need a central organisational focus for getting things done.</P>
    <P>The fourth key factor is national support. Central Government support is an essential ingredient in the success of any peripheral area programme.  And the support of central Government is not just that of financing.  It means an active acceptance of the development concepts that are inherent in the programme and support for the organisational structures implied in the programme and the development of an entrepreneurial climate so that other agencies are encouraged to participate in the pursuit of the programme goals.</P>
    <P>The fifth key is the role of Community support.  Up to now, the European Community has been very much a reactive mechanism.  It needs to go to a pro-active mode.  It needs to take a lead in programmes for peripheral area development. It needs to develop ideas and to promote these ideas to the member states.  The Community is also ideally placed to encourage the undertaking of a variety of alternative paths to promoting peripheral area development and to compare and contrast the different approaches in different member states and to advise on the results.</P>
    <P>The sixth key factor is 1992 and the effect of the completion of the internal market on peripheral regions.  The Community has set 1992 as the target for the completion of the internal market and the removal of the non-tariff barriers.</P>
    <P>There are a number of possible consequences for peripheral areas like the Shannon region.  One is that reduction in transport costs or removal of barriers will favour stronger core regions.  Greater freedom of movement will favour the larger enterprises and larger entities that already enjoy economies of scale. Smaller entities that do not enjoy some <Col N="584" /> degree of uniqueness will find their competitiveness weakened when impediments to movement are removed.  On the other hand, there is some evidence to suggest that the removal of non-tariff barriers may benefit a range of activities within peripheral regions.  Non-tariff barriers, such as differences in technical standards used to protect domestic industry, have in the main been used by core regions and by the more developed economies. Consequently, the removal of the technical barriers may well provide Irish industry and Irish regions with new opportunities for trade.</P>
    <P>The Community has recognised to an extent the needs of the peripheral regions to prepare for 1992 through the proposal to double the structural funds.  It is evident that there are two responses that the Shannon region require to make towards 1992.  First, we need to develop the right regional programmes that will effectively attract the increased level of financial support which the Community is making available.  Only by developing the right kind of programmes will we ensure that the opportunity created by the expansion of the structural funds succeeds in enhancing the productive capacity of the Shannon region.  Secondly, we need to work on industrial competitiveness.  We need to upgrade the competitiveness of our industry through more skilful management, more aggressive marketing, better design, higher standards, better technology and appropriate financing. We need help on all of these issues if the Community objective of social and economic cohesion is to be achieved.</P>
    <P>The seventh and final key factor is the need for co-ordinated regional programmes. These programmes would need to focus on three issues &mdash; the policies of the Community, the priorities of the member states and the needs of the region.  In other words, we need to develop strategic partnerships.  Co-ordinated regional programmes are a vital instrument to establish such partnerships. Only in this way will we ensure that the Community policies, the concerns of the member states and the needs of the regions are co-ordinated and effectively <Col N="585" /> articulated to serve the interests of all three.</P>
    <P>The Shannon region is a peripheral region on the edge of Europe, with high dependence on agriculture, high levels of unemployment and growing levels of emigration.  The extended Shannon region has a population of 420,000 persons, some 50 per cent of whom live in urban areas.  The region's labour force is about 28,000 of which about 22 per cent are employed in agriculture and about 18 per cent are unemployed.  The first half of the eighties decade recorded over 7,000 emigrants out of the region.  This is very significant as it follows a period of net immigration that was recorded during the seventies.  One would have to express serious concern about the huge increases in recent years in the level of emigration from the mid-west region and, indeed, from my part of the country.</P>
    <P>The region, however, also has some very special strengths.  For example, numbers employed in manufacturing industry in the region are about 25,000, some 20 per cent of the total labour force. This represents a growth of 15 per cent between 1978 and 1986.  This level of growth in industrial employment in the region over those eight years was relatively exceptional, both in national and European Community terms.</P>
    <P>The industrial structure of the region is relatively strong&mdash;the top ten companies last year exported over IR£1.5 billions in goods and services &mdash; and has shown growth rates in the recent past well ahead of national and European averages.</P>
    <P>The region has other strengths, also. At Limerick City lies the National Institute of Higher Education, Ireland's first technological university.  It is based in Plassey Technological Park.  The park itself provides a business environment attractive to advanced technology enterprises and represents a deliberate attempt to stimulate the fusion of research, education and enterprise on one site.</P>
    <P>Shannon International Free Airport, 25 kms from Limerick, is an international centre of communications.  This is a major benefit to a peripheral region like <Col N="586" /> ours and provides linkages to a number of key metropolitan centres in Europe and North Africa.</P>
    <P>The region has important natural resources of great value, notably its rich agricultural land, its forest and woodlands and its potential for mariculture and aquaculture development.</P>
    <P>The Shannon region has great strengths also as a tourism region.  It has a magnificent coastline fronting the Atlantic, some of the highest sea cliffs in Europe and some of its rarest flora.  It has upland hills of unspoilt rural landscape and lakes and rivers that are under-used, a paradise for the visiting fishermen or sailor.  Let us hope that the problem in this regard will be solved next week.  It has ancient monuments dating back to the dawn of history, medieval castles, folk parks, museums and a wealth of visitor attractions.  It also has a plentiful supply of all kinds of accommodation from top grade hotels and farm guest-houses to self-catering facilities.</P>
    <P>In summary, the Shannon region has all the weaknesses of peripheral areas, but it has some special strengths as well which could provide a major resource and driving force for development into the future.</P>
    <P>Our ability to address our problems and build on our strengths will depend to a great extent on our ability to call down EC finance from the Structural Funds. Last year the Government announced that regional programmes would be prepared as a basis for future applications for assistance from the Structural Funds. At that time Shannon Development had discussions with the appropriate authorities in Dublin.  Following those discussions they commenced preparation of a plan for the development of the Shannon region.  The plan was developed in partnership with almost 20 other agencies whose activities, one way or another, affect development in the region.  Successive drafts of this plan have been discussed on an informal basis with officials of Government Departments in Dublin and with officials of the European Commission in Brussels.  Both the national <Col N="587" /> and the Commission officials have confirmed that the direction is most acceptable and Brussels in particular has been highly complimentary of the effort.</P>
    <P>A key assumption in the plan is that regional development is a positive process, that the purpose of regional development is to enhance the contribution of peripheral regions to national betterment, exploiting the unique assets of particular regions in the national and European interest and enlarging the ability of each region to do something for the good of the national and European Community.  Regional development is not about handouts, but rather about positively tapping latent potential.</P>
    <P>The plan prepared includes proposals for industry, tourism, agriculture, infrastructure and development related education. The thrust of the plan is to enlarge the productive capacity of the region through action based on three central themes: (a) generating knowledge based enterprises &mdash; economic activity that has a strong content of knowledge such as research, new technology and the creation of an information rich environment; (b) developing resource-based enterprise &mdash; economic activity that taps human creativity and exploits the economic and physical resources of the region, focussing on sectors where market possibilities are strongest; and (c) improvement of infrastructure and the physical environment to create a region that is highly acceptable to the people of the region and to potential investors as an investment location, and to tourists as a desirable destination.</P>
    <P>Reaction to the plan has been very positive.  It is clearly obvious that the Shannon region is the only region which has advanced to this stage, and I must place on record my concern that we will lose out while waiting for others to complete their brief.  I call on the Government to recognise our progress in this regard and request priority for the Shannon Development submission on behalf of the region.  The submission is in line with Commission guidelines and it has been warmly welcomed in Brussels.  The <Col N="588" /> funding is available, so why wait and jeopardise the very sound, progressive and viable projects put forward?</P>
    <P>I have stressed the positive aspects of the Shannon Development role.  Nevertheless, I am mindful of the fact that the company will have serious difficulties in that they are being asked to undertake extra duties and an enlarged area with reduced resources.  I fear that this can only result in their giving a diminished service to the original area and render them incapable of exploiting the full potential of the total area.  This is a shortsighted approach by the Government and must be altered.</P>
    <P>Shannon Development have much success to their credit.  However, counties such as north Tipperary would have to express the view that this success was not evenly spread around the region.  Many new industries and services in Limerick city, Shannon and Ennis will not do much for places like Thurles, Roscrea, Templemore or Nenagh.  The success built on technology in Limerick University and services for industries in major centres at the core of the region must be used to the benefit of peripheral areas like Thurles.</P>
    <P>North Tipperary, and particularly Thurles, are being devastated by closures, rationalisation programmes, redundancies, unemployment and emigration. I have had a number of discussions in recent times with Shannon Development executives, highlighting our problems and suggesting areas for advancement.  I intend to pursue them vigorously to ensure that we get our just share of the benefits accruing from development and expansion plans within the region.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>At first look this Bill seems to be fairly straightforward, but the brevity of the Minister's speech this morning says a lot.  It highlights serious questions which are not addressed by the Bill with regard to lines of demarcation and responsibility in the Shannon region.  I believe strongly in the importance of regional development.  What is occurring in the mid-west Shannon area could be a very important role model for the rest of the country.  However, there is much <Col N="589" /> uncertainty as to who is really in charge in that region.  One wonders whether the executives in the IDA, CTT and SFADCo. are happy at the way the operation is structured and about where their areas of responsibility begin and end. There does not seem to be any absolute authority</P>
      <P>SFADCo were given extra responsibility last year and took over from the IDA responsibility for industrial development within the region.  That is probably not a bad thing.  SFADCo have been very successful in creating small indigenous industries which are important to the region.  The Shannon area has, however, potential for heavy industrial development, due to the Shannon Estuary.</P>
      <P>The IDA map of Ireland has two areas blocked out, the mid-west region and Northern Ireland.  There is much pressure on the IDA to produce jobs and reach targets and they are making announcements day after day.  Since responsibility for the mid-west region has effectively been removed from them, why should they give as much attention to that area when SFADCo are the authority in charge?  If I were in that position I would be inclined to develop the areas where my real responsibility unequivocally lay, not an area where there was uncertainty. That is a great shame because the IDA are probably the only organisation with the ability to seek and find the heavy industrialised type of industry necessary for the Shannon region.  It is not an indigenous industry, that sort of heavy industrial development must come from abroad.  The Shannon region has all the advantages because of port and harbour developments, the deep water berths and many other things which put it at an advantage in the heavy industrial area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The IDA and CTT because of blocking out the Shannon region are at a serious disadvantage.  If SFADCo is to be the model in the regional sense, what will be the future role of the IDA and CTT?  A role model of SFADCo is the way to go and I am not trying to knock the set-up; I am trying to explore beyond it.  Why not create a new enterprise organisation whereby CTT and the IDA would be <Col N="590" /> amalgamated?  They would then be the superstructure over the regional organisation and there would be clear channels through these offices worldwide. SFADCo do not have a worldwide structure similar to the IDA so how can they, as a regional organisation, seek access and gain the type of potential market which the IDA could gain worldwide? The Bill points out that there is a complete lack of clarity in this industrial area and how it will be developed because, as it stands at the moment, there are certain things in place but there is too much overlapping and no one seems to be in charge.</P>
    <P>The Bill dealing with the harbour estuary for the Shannon region has not yet been debated but there are serious contradictions in that Bill compared to the one we are now discussing.  Who will be the Authority for tourism and industrial development in the mid-west region? Will it be SFADCo?  Will it be the IDA? Will it be CTT, Bord Fáilte or the new harbour authority?  Where do the corporation come into it?  There is a nucleus of a very good idea in the changes the Department are trying to bring about but there seems to be no plan as to where it is supposed to go.</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte have a tremendous worldwide structure <i>in situ,</i> unlike SFADCo. Bord Fáilte do not now have responsibility for tourism development in the mid-west region.  It has been said by every party in this House that tourism development is one of the most significant job creating areas.  It also affords us an opportunity to increase in great numbers the people travelling in and out of the country. SFADCo do not have the worldwide network to be active in the tourism market, they simply are not capable of operating in that arena.  Yet they are given responsibility in this area.</P>
    <P>The mid-west region is probably one of the most important tourist areas in the country.  Over the years they have developed their tourism and have probably been more successful than many other regions, particularly in the development of Kerry, west Cork and the Shannon area itself.  That whole coastline has <Col N="591" /> been much better developed in a regional sense than any other area.  The potential is there for a leap forward in how we operate our regional structures.  The correct procedure is not in train at the moment and I would bet money that the Minister cannot guarantee that we will not see major changes at senior level in some of the State agencies within the next five to six months.  That will be brought about by dissatisfaction and low morale caused by putting people in a very uncertain position and not giving them a clear and precise outline of what they are supposed to be doing, to whom they are responsible and who are responsible to them.  There is an urgent need for that to happen.</P>
    <P>We are dealing with the Shannon mid-west area today but every other area is also affected.  Who is responsible for deciding on the regional plan and the approach made to the EC?  Because of the regional structures there is an opportunity here of putting forward significant proposals for approval within the EC.  I believe that the EC has told the Government that it is dissatisfied with the way they are handling the applications for Structural Funds.  The EC want to see a regionalised approach as happens in every other country.  However, the Government are still insisting on keeping bureaucratic and central control on the approach to Brussels in seeking Regional and Structural Funds.  This is seriously harming the country and the Department of Industry and Commerce are well aware that this is the case.</P>
    <P>Plans are submitted by various bodies at present; nobody seems to be in charge. Those plans then go to individual Departments. If it is a marine project it goes to the Department of the Marine who to-and-fro with the harbour commissioners in the local areas.  After they have seen fit to discuss it, it then goes to the Department of Finance and, after their stamp of approval, the plans will find their way to Brussels.  Brussels has told the Government that it does not want everything fitted into a national plan.  Of course there are certain areas where you must have a <Col N="592" /> national structure: roads, for instance, are an obvious one.  You could not have each region deciding independently of others how to develop their own road network.  Obviously there must be an overall plan.  However, all plans should not involve this long, bureaucratic and unnecessary approach to various Departments. That is why this country is falling behind the likes of Spain and Portugal and, in four years' time, when we see the developments that have taken place in those countries we will know why we do not have them here.  There will certainly be a difference unless there is a major change of attitude.</P>
    <P>The key to Brussels is a regional approach.  Brussels want a regional approach.  Just because the country is small does not mean that the regions are less important than those in other countries. To my way of thinking they are of equal importance, and in some ways more important.  We must decide how the Government will carry out these functions.</P>
    <P>Reference has already been made to education.  I am glad the problems surrounding the qualifications issued by the NIHEs have been resolved by raising the NIHEs in Limerick and Dublin to university status.  While I wish these colleges every success and good fortune, I regret that the south-east region has been ignored in terms of providing a third level institute with university status.</P>
    <P>How does one promote national and international industrial development and tourism?  These questions have been left in the air because of the lack of overall direction.  I suspect the Government will come to the conclusion, sooner rather than later, that changes are needed in the way the IDA and CTT operate.  What we need are regional structures feeding into one organisation.  After all, the people on the ground know what is happening in their areas and what needs to be developed there.  If the Government were to clarify that position, then the development of the regions, not only the mid-west region, would accelerate at a much greater pace with tremendous benefits to be gained over the next three to <Col N="593" /> five years, simply because we would be able to shake off our problems and get ahead of the posse.  Everyone is seeking a slice of the same cake and if we are hampered by a lack of structures and clear lines of responsibility, then the morale of those on whom we are depending falls and things move backwards.</P>
    <P>There is a danger that this could happen in the mid-west region if many of the executives in the State agencies do not know where they stand.  This is not satisfactory.  No organisation seems to have overall responsibility.  As I understand it, many applications have been received not only from this region but from all around the country for the construction of marinas.  This type of development would attract yachts from the UK in the winter&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe there are too many authorities deciding what is needed in each area and it is not clear who should make the final decisions &mdash; whether it is the Department of the Marine, or the Department of Finance, and whether Bord Fáilte should be consulted, if they think if a marina is needed within a region, and so on.  These are just some of the problems in those areas.  However, I am confident that these problems can be solved.  All that needs to be done is to modernise the structures of CTT and the IDA.  If the Government are considering regional development and what the future role of CTT and the IDA should <Col N="594" /> be, the model of SFADCo would be more important not alone for the region in which they operate but for other regional developments throughout the country.  I hope the Government consider this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisFoley" hpid="Mr. Foley Mr. Foley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill which is to give statutory effect to the Government's decision to extend the Shannon Free Airport Development Company's industrial development responsibilities to include the constituency of Kerry North. I believe this is long overdue.  Under this Bill, north Kerry will be incorporated into the mid-west region for the purpose of structural funding.  We in north Kerry would be looking to the expertise of SFADCo in promoting the land bank between Tarbert and Ballylongford for industrial development.  Since this Bill was first mooted prior to Christmas, that north Kerry was to come under the ambit of SFADCo, a lot of movement has taken place in north of north Kerry and hopefully worthwhile development will take place, thus creating much needed jobs as emigration from the area is well above the national average.</P>
      <P>Shannon Development recently issued a report entitled <i>Framework for the Development of the Shannon Region,</i> an excellent discussion document.  I wish to thank them for including north Kerry. They have shown tremendous foresight in this paper.  As a contribution to the programme, this framework has been prepared in partnership with 26 other agencies.  Shannon Development have compiled a framework following the Government's decision to give this agency a more integrated and creative role in contributing towards recovery in the region.  One has to accept that regional development is a positive process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The mid-west region, with the inclusion of north Kerry, will now become a major tourist region as it has vast scenic appeal, and with the further development of tourist amenities all along the estuary &mdash; particularly water sports.  As chairman of the Cork/Kerry Tourism Board, I have had meetings with SFADCo personnel.  They welcome the <Col N="595" /> Government's decision to extend their responsibilities for tourism development into north Kerry.  The company feel that north Kerry can become a major part of the Shannon region from a tourism point of view.  As soon as essential arrangements have been made with Cork/Kerry Tourism Board, the company will take steps to integrate north Kerry into their tourism promotion material, including literature and videos.  The area will also be included in the company's on-going promotion of the Shannon region to the travel trade and the consumer for the remainder of the current year.  I am confident that north Kerry will benefit from the growth in the anticipated growth in overseas tourism in the current year.</P>
    <P>The company have also confirmed that they would take responsibility for the tourist information offices and tourist points throughout north Kerry.  They would also ensure that visitors to these information centres receive the best possible advice about the tourism product in the Shannon region and throughout the country.  At this point, I would like to compliment the manager and staff of Cork/Kerry Tourism on the very high standard of efficiency of the tourism product in the region over many years. At all times they were the outstanding region in the promotion and marketing of tourism.  It is sad for north Kerry to have to part from such a top class group. However, I am satisfied that it would be in our best interest to become part of the mid-west region from a tourism and industrial point of view.</P>
    <P>The Government's decision to establish a single harbour authority for the estuary is another boost for the region and I look forward to this Bill coming before the House in the current session. This was promised for many years especially during the term of the Coalition Government.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Burke, referred this morning to the creation of 2,000 new jobs which SFADCo set in 1988 as their contribution to the national target and they exceeded it by 817, making a total <Col N="596" /> of 2,817 jobs for the year with a net gain of almost 1,000 for industrial employment in the region.</P>
    <P>North Kerry's remit under the IDA was not successful over the years with regard to the land bank in Ballylongford where close on 700 acres of land has been lying idle for many years.  I welcome the commitment of the personnel within SFADCo that this area will be given priority for industrial development by way of special promotion.  They have confirmed that their principal aim in north Kerry in the next three years will be to maximise employment in manufacturing and other services in the area.  They will work to improve the tourist product base of north Kerry, building on those strong products already in place and seeking out new opportunites for development. North Kerry already has a good mix of tourist attractions ranging from Ballybunion and Tralee golf clubs, both championship courses, race meetings in Listowel and Killarney, the Festival of Kerry, golden beaches at Ballybunion, Ballyheigue, Banna and Fenit and Listowel Writers' Week.  Tralee has a new, modern conference centre in the Mount Brandon Hotel catering for groups of up to 1,500 people.  The hotel also has modern recreation facilities and will become the conference centre for the mid west region.  By maximising the returns from these attractions and working on new tourist products SFADCo can build up north Kerry tourism assets to the highest standards.</P>
    <P>As one involved in tourism for a long time I have listened to complaints of lack of support for many years.  The present Government have gone a long way in dealing with these complaints but they can only go so far, and the trade will have to respond.  This is happening now and as a result we can approach the coming years with great confidence.  We have tremendous opportunities within tourism for job creation.  At this time new investment is coming into tourism and north Kerry with SFADCo will play its part. We must be careful to monitor and keep abreast of the changing market environment and in so doing become more <Col N="597" /> professional and commercial in our approach to tourism and industrial development.</P>
    <P>I welcome the legislation and commend the Minister for introducing it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimKemmy" hpid="Mr. Kemmy Mr. Kemmy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kemmy</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome this Bill. As previous speakers have said, north Kerry is very much on the Shannon estuary and very much part of the mid-west region.  This legislation is long overdue and its introduction is a good thing for the entire region because it is important for all of us to think in regional terms now and get away from the old parochialism and parish pump politics that for long bedevilled politics and public life.  That type of rivalry between counties and areas is unnecessary; we have had too much of it.  It is wasteful and sometimes embarrassing.  Therefore, it is good that this Bill is before the House today. SFADCo are to extend their remit to north Kerry, and let us hope north Kerry will be able to share in the work experience and benefits of SFADCo because it is entitled to that at the very least.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, having praised the Government for bringing forward this Bill let me say I see a great deal of inconsistency regarding equality by the Government in relation to Shannon estuary.  Another Bill is to be brought before this House today which is different altogether from the Bill we are discussing now, the Shannon Free Airport Development Company Limited (Amendment) Bill, 1988.  The Bill which will be before the House this afternoon is the Harbours (Shannon Estuary Development Corporation) Bill, 1988. The Bill we are discussing now is a good Bill and I welcome it, but the harbours Bill is flawed legislation and I hope during is passage through this House today that will be remedied.  The two Bills should be complementary.  There should be a central role for SFADCo in the Harbours Bill.  It makes no sense whatever to have SFADCo given this new authority and being excluded from their central role in the development of the Shannon estuary, one of our natural amenities.  I do not see the logic of that.  I see no co-ordination of Government policy in that regard.  We <Col N="598" /> cannot afford to throw away the expertise and professionalism of the staff of SFADCo in the development of the estuary and the harbours.  The Minister might look at that.  There is a glaring omission in the legislation.  I see no link between the two Bills.  On the one hand we are promoting SFADCo in this Bill before us and in the second Bill we are pushing them out entirely and ignoring them.  I do not see how that can be possible.</P>
    <P>We are talking about regional development. Other Deputies have said kind words about Limerick city and the University of Limerick, but the proposal is to put the headquarters of the new harbour authority in the Shannon estuary, transferring them from Limerick to Foynes.  I do not see what good that can do.  It is a downgrading of the city, the capital of the region, and of its people and a turning of backs on the history of the port authority who have been there since 1815. That makes no sense.  The Minister might address that point.  I am not going to belabour that, but if the Minister is thinking in logical terms, as he does, he will realise Limerick city straddles the Shannon estuary, linking the Kerry side and the Clare side.  What could be a more natural place for a new harbour authority headquarters than Limerick city?  It is like proposing to move Cork harbour authority from Cork city to Ringaskiddy or to move Dublin harbour authority out to Howth or Skerries.</P>
    <P>I support this legislation because if you are to have industrial development and tourist promotion and somebody wants to speak to an authority in an area, instead of having a babble of voices in different authorities speaking to a person, it is better to have them in co-operation under the one authority. SFADCo have a track record of experience and can speak with authority to anybody coming in here to develop industry. They have the record of experience and competence in that regard.  I am happy about all that, but in the Harbours Bill we will not be doing that.  That Bill should be in tandem with the Bill before us now, and if the Government cannot grasp this point we are in difficulty.  I see <Col N="599" /> no point in pursuing this further but I hope this matter will be rectified in the passage of the second Bill through the Dáil.</P>
    <P>There is no reason the Shannon estuary should not be able to avail of the full support, assistance, backup, skill and competence of SFADCo in the development of this natural amenity.  Good work has been done by SFADCo in Limerick city in conjunction with Limerick Corporation. Much has been done in recent times in terms of the road programme, development of the city, elimination of urban blight, ruins, damaged buildings and derelict sites.  I applaud that and I see no reason that work cannot be extended into north Kerry very soon. SFADCo have also co-operated with private enterprise in this regard.  Some notable buildings in Limerick such as the Granary are examples of monuments to what can be done in this area with an enlightened approach by local authorities and private enterprise.  There is no reason why SFADCo cannot go down that road in north Kerry.  SFADCo have their track record and I hope such ventures will spread very soon to north Kerry and other areas.</P>
    <P>I am especially interested in food processing. In that regard the Golden Vale has the most lush pastures not only in Ireland but in Europe and there is no reason we cannot have further development in north Kerry, Limerick, Clare and Tipperary.  That is a natural area for such development and with some probing and prodding from the Minister through SFADCo there is no reason we cannot have a large leap ahead in expansion in that area.</P>
    <P>We are only scratching the surface of tourism in the mid-west region and the country generally.  We could expand our tourism industry tenfold if we adopted a positive and enlightened approach.  We have seen the benefits in the Shannon region to our neighbouring county of Clare from tourist amenities like Bunratty Folk Park and Bunratty Castle. There is no reason the work carried out in that region cannot be spread to <Col N="600" /> north Kerry and adjoining areas.  It should be spread to towns like Miltown Malbay, Ennistymon, Kilkee, Adare and other towns and villages that have their own unique attractions.  We should capitalise on those attractions.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cullen referred to the uneasy relationship between the IDA and SFADCo.  I do not intend to take up the time of the House probing that today and, as the Chair pointed out, this is not the time to do so.  However, I should like to give a brief reply to some of the points he made.  We need to co-ordinate our industrial promotion efforts or otherwise we will be duplicating services and wasting scarce resources.  I do not see the need for wasteful competition in the area of industrial promotion.  That is not logical and it does not do anything for the promotion of our country.  There is no need for bitter rivalry because both organisations are working towards the same end, the attraction of industry to Ireland.  A competitive attitude by them will not do us any good and will damage our image abroad.  There is a need for greater co-operation, more frequent meetings and closer links between them. I do not like to see any literature, maps or documentation produced by the IDA having the mid-west region blacked out. To me that represents an insult to the region.  Such literature should not be published by any organisation, particularly a public one.  It does not make economic sense to produce it and it has no place in our world.  The sooner that attitude is dropped the better.  We must join together in our industrial promotion efforts because the future of the country is at stake.  We have a lot to offer but our resources are limited.  We must use them in an efficient way and pool our efforts to achieve our aims.</P>
    <P>Limerick city has been mentioned in complimentary terms and there has been reference to the new university. However, it is no harm to point out that the city is being strangled because of the failure to expand its boundary.  The city joins Limerick county and Clare county and for the past 25 years we have been <Col N="601" /> seeking an extension of our boundary. We have been unsuccessful and the failure to agree to an extension of the boundary has strangled the city and more is the pity.  I see Limerick city as being the capital of the region and there is no doubt that if we have a good capital the entire region will benefit.  It will not take from Kerry, Clare or Tipperary if Limerick city is declared capital of the region.  It is unfortunate that there is a dog in the manager attitude about the request to extend the city boundary.  The last Government shied away from that but I hope this Government will look at that request sympathetically.  We need an extension of the boundary in Limerick because without it we cannot develop the city in an orderly and progressive way.  It is not right to strangle the development of any city.  All cities must be allowed to expand and develop and Limerick is no different from other cities.  I do not see why neighbouring authorities should be unco-operative in this regard.  The capital of a region is entitled to expect support from neighbouring authorities.  We should get away from the narrow parochial attitude that has been adopted in regard to requests for an extension of the boundary.</P>
    <P>There has been a lot of talk about NIHE Limerick and its new status of a university.  We all welcome that, as do the people of Limerick.  While I am not a typical admirer of the director of that institution, Dr. Walsh, I accept that he has worked hard for it.  He is a man of single-minded opinions although sometimes he appears to be selective in his morality about big business.  He does not see much wrong with them and he sees wrongs elsewhere.</P>

      <P>I do not intend to make a meal out of this but I was expressing my opinion about the individual.  It is very hard to divorce Dr. Walsh from NIHE.  I understand the good points about the man and I accept that he has had an impressive record over the years. While NIHE have an impressive record in finding employment abroad for graduates of that institution we must consider the other dimension in regard to that institution.  NIHE must work to solve some of our problems.  I am referring to staff and graduates.  Unless the graduates help us find solutions to our problems that institution will be only partly successful. There is little point in having a technological university if our people cannot benefit from it through employment and a development of the food processing sector and so on.  It should be working towards more integration in our economy. It is one thing to find employment for graduates with multinational companies but it is another thing to have them helping to find solutions to our problems. I hope NIHE will go down that road in the years ahead.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that my constituency is far removed from Shannon and north Kerry but over the years we have looked with admiration at the achievements of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company.  The company also proved very successful when they took tourism under their umbrella. On a number of occasions, during the course of debates, and by way of parliamentary question, I suggested that a similar body should be established to cater for Border regions.  We have regional development organisations which cover the counties but the ideal would be a company like SFADCo, which could be responsible for distributing the Border fund and examining the potential of the area.  I should like to point out that the director of SFADCo, Mr. Hugh Quigley, is a native of my district.  I have admired his achievements with SFADCo over the years.</P>
      <P>It is important that we should have a structure such as SFADCo for Border areas to examine the problems and make the best use of available resources. Grants under the Border fund are not allocated in accordance with any plan. They are primarily spent on small projects. This means that, ultimately, there is no infrastructure remaining.  The same applies with regard to the international fund established which, after three years, has proven to be a major disappointment on both sides of the Border.  Certainly it is a major disappointment to me.  I have brought my disappointment to the notice of the chairman and other members of the committee charged with managing the fund.  An examination of the report of the allocations of the fund would show that there has been a 25 per cent cut south of the Border and a 75 per cent cut north of the Border.  Also an examination of the list of projects for which they provided funding would lead one to think there is need for serious investigation.  Only today I heard a news flash to the effect that projects now in mind in the North would create 400 jobs.</P>

      <P>I believe that international fund constituted the ideal vehicle for the examination of areas warranting funding, especially bearing in mind future integrated regional development with the promise of a substantial transfer of EC funds to the regions.  The transfer of such funds will amount to a useless exercise unless there is an organisation such as SFADCo who can suggest what projects should be financed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the extension of the SFADCo region to include north Kerry about which I have been campaigning since I entered politics.  I might thank the Government on having effected this extension.</P>
      <P>Always north Kerry has had a close affinity with Limerick.  The ferry has also had a close affinity with west Clare.  Historically there was a thriving trade between such small ports as Tarbert, Ballylongford, Foynes and Limerick, Foynes having been one of the busiest harbours in Europe in the 19th century. Hopefully the provisions of this Bill will revive those prosperous times to the Shannon region.</P>
      <P>In the past also north Kerry suffered from having been included in the Cork region in respect of which I do not lay any blame on the Cork people.  But physically and geographically north Kerry was too far removed from the IDA centre in Cork, from the main tourist promotion centre in Kerry which was located in Killarney, Naturally that led to efforts being concentrated on the south Kerry region to the detriment of the north Kerry region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people of north Kerry tend to go to school in Limerick.  For example, they will choose to attend the NIHE in Limerick rather than other higher education establishments.  It has also been the tendency of north Kerry business people to conduct their business in Limerick, generally to look to Limerick for most services, especially those people from the northern part of north Kerry.  For that <Col N="605" /> reason the provision of this Bill will be much welcomed by most people in north Kerry.  It is also true that the people of north Kerry use Shannon Airport more frequently than Cork Airport.  Access roads to Shannon Airport are better and more convenient from north Kerry than those to Cork Airport.  Therefore it will be seen that there is much more affinity between the north Kerry area and Limerick than with Cork.</P>
    <P>Probably the south Kerry region would have more affinity with south west Cork than north Kerry even though in the same county.  Although I do not particularly like to see the county divided the north and south regions are now encompassed in regions with which they can easily identify.  I shall refer to some problems I envisage later through such division.</P>
    <P>The mid-west region has now emerged as an autonomous entity which has been an innovator in industrial, commercial, cultural and social development over the past 20 years, the Shannon estuary being the focal point of the region.  It is one of the most spectacular, safe, deep water harbours in Europe with considerable potential.  The development of maritime industry in the estuary has been spectacular since 1965.  For example, that year the oil terminal to accommodate 60,000 tonne vesels came on stream at Foynes Island for Irish Cement Limited.  That was followed, in 1969, by the opening of the Tarbert power station with a jetty that can accommodate vessels of up to 80,000 tonnes.  In 1973 the oil jetty at Dervish Island to serve the aviation needs of Shannon Airport was completed.  The availablity of that facility resulted in the decision of Aeroflot to locate their aviation fuel tank near the jetty resulting in employment at the airport and on the jetty itself.  The construction of the Aughinish Alumina Plant, which was commenced in 1978 and completed in 1983, was a major boost to the area, providing much needed employment, now employing in the order of 800 people.  Indeed the success of the Aughinish Alumnia plant has been spectacular.  It is most encouraging to note that there may be future extensions to that plant.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="606" /> In 1979 the ESB commenced construction of the Moneypoint power station which was completed in 1987 now providing in the region of 350 jobs.  I might thank the Government for having extended the role of the Moneypoint power station last year enabling them to import coal on a commercial basis.  That was a welcome move in the sense that a jetty which cost in the region of £40 million should not be allowed to remain idle and unused.  There should be as much use as possible made of it for the benefit of the area generally.  There are also very advanced port facilities on the jetty at Moneypoint.  It is only right that maximum use be made of these facilities because of the investment made in them.</P>
    <P>The development of Foynes Harbour has been spectacular over the past ten years.  Deputy Kemmy referred to the Harbours (Shannon Estuary Development Corporation) Bill 1988.  I agree with some of the points he made in that respect.  I hope later to relate SFADCo to proposed developments for SEDCo.  I pity industrialists endeavouring to differentiate between the two.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Jim Tunney">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Kemmy, in referring to it, more or less criticised Deputy Martin Cullen who on this proposal had sought to deal with that matter.  We take it that your references will be peripheral.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to Foynes there is a very good harbour commission there who work very effectively.  One could safely say that outside of Dublin they have probably been the most successful harbour commisison in the country, turning over massive tonnage at present and that is on the increase.  They compete with all other ports including Greenore in County Down and they are winning a lot of business.  Any attempt to break up that dynamism in Foynes would not be welcome.  As I have said, I will have another opportunity when the SFADCo Bill comes before the House to point out the flaws in relation to Foynes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like briefly to mention the <Col N="607" /> background to the setting up of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company. In 1958 Shannon Airport was about to lose its strategic relevance to world aviation.  The new long haul jets no longer needed to stop over at Shannon for refuelling and the airport was in danger of losing its significance or indeed becoming insignificant.  The Shannon Development Company was established in 1958-59 to ensure that the airport continued to be used.  The main means of doing this was the development of industry near the airport and the development of tourism through the airport.  From 1958 to 1968 the company's industrial development activities were limited to the development and promotion of the Shannon industrial free zone and indeed many more countries copied this model of Shannon.</P>
    <P>In 1968 the Government requested the company to undertake the promotion of foreign industrial investment in the Shannon region which it did successfully until 1978.  At that time the Minister for Industry and Commerce changed the regional industrial focus of the company from foreign medium to large industries to indigenous small industry.  They asked the company to initiate and test various programmes for small industry promotion and development which, if successful, could be applied nationally.  I am sure the Minister would agree that they carried out this function very effectively. Many of the programmes for small industry that they put into practice have proven very successful for the rest of the country and indeed are used as examples.</P>
    <P>In 1987 the company were given the extended brief for the promotion and development of all industry and tourism in the Shannon region and I would like to compliment the Government for their foresight in doing this.  It is in keeping with the recommendations of the Hume Report and certainly with the recent publication by Deputy John Bruton on how he sees regional structures developing. He pointed out the advantages of SFADCo in maximising our income from Europe.  That certainly seems to be the <Col N="608" /> right type of structure.  The decision by the Government to extend the role of SFADCo in 1987 was a major development. For the first time in the history of the Republic it brought the major strands of economic activity, including industry and tourism, within the ambit of one development agency.  As I have said, this is in keeping with both John Hume's and Deputy John Bruton's thinking on the matter.</P>
    <P>The southern region now has an organisational framework for integrated regional development and as a result should benefit considerably from European funding.  The region will also benefit from a more co-ordinated approach to development.  It will certainly avoid much unnecessary overlapping and waste of very scarce resources.  There has been rapid growth in the Shannon area in the past 20 years.  The population of Limerick city has grown by almost 15,000 people in that period.  However, there is a warning here for a peripheral area like Kerry. Places like north Tipperary, west Clare and, to a lesser extent, west Limerick did not benefit to the same extent as the area along the axis from Shannon to Limerick. This is something that we in north Kerry will have to be very wary of because we could suffer just as places like west Clare and north Tipperary did.</P>
    <P>When I was trying to promote this idea in 1986 I carried out a survey for <i>The Kerryman</i> which I will not go into here. I came up with figures which showed that south Tipperary, with a population about one-third higher than north Tipperary, was in receipt of more than twice the State grant payments over a five year period as north Tipperary were receiving. As Deputies know, south Tipperary is in the IDA region, the south west region, and north Tipperary is in the SFADCo region.  I will be telling the people in north Kerry to be wary and not to be over enthusiastic about this deveopment, to recognise the advantages for us but not to take everything at face value.</P>
    <P>The same study revealed that west Clare and indeed west Limerick did not fare too well although considerable progress has been made in the last three or <Col N="609" /> four years in places like Abbeyfeale and Newcastle West.  The study also revealed that Kerry, in particular north Kerry, fared very well from 1982 to 1986 compared with places like Mayo.  In Listowel, for example, the trend was totally different from the rest of the country.  The number of people in manufacturing employment at that time increased by 100.  I heard Deputy Foley criticising the IDA for their performance in north Kerry but they have also had their successes in that region.  There are reasons north Kerry did not benefit to the same extent as other areas in the south west region, one of which is that it is a peripheral area.</P>
    <P>Much of the growth in the Limerick area has been attributable to the dynamism of Shannon with its industrial estate, airport, duty free shop and financial centre.  Again, the IDA have made a major contribution to the city by developing industrial estates at Raheen and Plassey which are now home to such successful industries as Wang, How-medica, Verbatim and Analog.  It was the IDA, in consultation and co-operation with SFADCo, who brought those industries to Limerick and that must be acknowledged.  The NIHE have also had a profound influence on the local community. They have been the source of inspiration for the National Microelectronics Centre which is located on the campus and is a very fine innovation.  This should lead to the development of the electronics industry in the region.  In Kerry there is already a good base for electronics industries.  There is one of the largest PCB producers in Listowel &mdash; Melchert Electronics Limited &mdash; and there are very positive developments in electronics in Tralee.  NIHE works very closely with the industries on the nearby Plassey Technological Park and no doubt provides much of the expertise and the workforce for the industry.  It has contributed in no small way to the success of Wang, Verbatim and Analog because most of their personnel came from NIHE.  I welcome the announcement that NIHE will now become the University of Limerick.  NIHE was originally proposed <Col N="610" /> in the sixties.  Much of the credit should go to the former Minister for Education, Deputy Hussey, who set up the commission to examine the feasibility of declaring NIHE both in Dublin and in Limerick as universities.  A matter which has escaped the media is that it was Deputy Hussey who set up the Hardiman committee which recommended that this should happen.</P>
    <P>The University of Limerick will now become the focal point for turning out the right type of person to encourage various industries into the region and will certainly provide the required expertise. The back-up services should be a major attraction for foreign industrialists coming into the region.  Within the new region there are great possibilities for more definite lines of communication between the RTC in Tralee, which has considerable resources, and NIHE in Limerick.  There should be some connection between the courses and much consultation for the benefit of both areas. Tralee is the second biggest centre in the region.  Therefore many of the resources of SFADCo which I will mention later, will be concentrated in the Tralee area.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer briefly to the development of small industries.  Shannon Development have been very successful in promoting small indigenous industry and have set in train a number of very effective support systems.  These include enterprise promotion, field officers and business centres which provide valuable work space units.  We have lost out in north Kerry because of the absence of these facilities.  Work space units provide a means for small enterprises to combine to share premises and services.  A large range of support services is provided, such as secretarial assistance, maintenance, power, lighting and specialist business advice.  These units are ideally suited to light manufacture, assembly, craft work design and locally related services.  The innovation centre provides a comprehensive product development service for small firms and &mdash; as I mentioned previously &mdash; the <Col N="611" /> National Microelectronic Centre promotes the use of micro electronics technology by all sectors of Irish industry.</P>
    <P>Shannon Development took on board over two years ago the promotion of food processing.  This has major implications in North Kerry.  With one of the biggest food processors now located in Kerry this will extend the whole base of food processing in the area.  In relation to food processing Shannon Development have devised and implemented a number of new initiatives some of which have already been adopted nationally.  The most successful of these has been the Raheen Food Centre where food processing units are available to entrepreneurs. The centre has been built to stringent international standards designed to meet US food and drug administration and EC standards.  Incubation units for small food processing firms are also available which provide facilities to develop and test new food products.</P>
    <P>Another ongoing support programme for small food firms is the alternative farm enterprise scheme.  The aim is to encourage producers of raw materials to establish small scale on-farm enterprises and process the materials into high value products.  These developments and initiatives in the food sector have enormous relevance to north Kerry.  Farming is our most important industry with recent problems surrounding milk quotas we will have to examine other ventures for processing our products.  Recent developments in producing farm cheeses have been very successful.  The Traditional Cheese Company has had outstanding success in developing and marketing premium Irish farmhouse cheeses.  These cheeses are being sold into restaurants and supermarkets all over Europe.  Two years ago the National Development Corporation took a 33 per cent investment in this company and is now looking at the whole export market potential for further expansion.</P>
    <P>Farm activities will become more diverse in the future and will incorporate such ventures as organic gardening, fresh farm chickens, home produced pate, <Col N="612" /> honey production, mushroom growing, tree harvesting and farm holidays.  Shannon Development has had a direct involvement in tourist attractions, especially its medieval banquets at Bunratty and Knappogue.</P>
    <P>With increasing pressure being put on milk quotas the encouragement and development of alternative farm enterprises is most welcome.  I look forward to working closely with Shannon Development in north Kerry towards encouraging as many farmers as possible to diversify into other alternative enterprises.  With the new emphasis on fresh food, wholesome food, health foods and so forth there is obviously a major niche in the market for this type of activity.  There has been a tradition in north Kerry of cheesemaking, bacon production and so on, but many of these old occupations are now extinct.  It is time to rekindle an awareness within our community of the vast potential we have to develop activities along these lines.</P>
    <P>I mentioned also the direct involvement in tourism activities of SFADCo, especially in relation to Bunratty and Knappogue.  In 1986, over 150,000 people attended such banquets.  The Bunratty Folk Park has also been an outstanding success.  Other projects such as the restoration of the Granary in Limerick, the proposal to develop King John's Castle into a major tourist centre including an emigration centre, the development of Lough Gur and the reconstruction there of medieval houses and other artefacts from that time are welcome.  I would like also to welcome the development of a tourist innovation centre similar to the small industry innovation centre.  This centre should encourage people to look at various aspects of tourism and train people to become involved in tourism.  It is a welcome development.</P>
    <P>I would like to mention the development of a monastic park in Roscrea and the development of the Foynes aviation and maritime museum.  SFADCo have been very successful in promoting this type of development.  They have not rested on their laurels since their remit was extended to include promotion of <Col N="613" /> tourism in the area.  I was glad to hear my colleague from north Kerry mention the great potential in north Kerry for golf.  SFADCo are promoting through the recent establishment of South West Golf Limited the various golf courses in the region.  We expect to have a major spin off from this in north Kerry with one of the finest golf courses in the world located in Ballybunion.  In time, the new golf course will probably become even more famous than the existing one.  With a golf course in Lahinch, a new course in Tralee, and two courses in Ballybunion I expect that we will attract an increasing number of golfing tourists because of the increased availability of facilities and the aggressive marketing of these facilities abroad, especially in America.  Last year approximately 15,000 people used Ballybunion golf course and this figure could probably be doubled and the season extended by proper marketing.  Counties Kerry and Clare have the natural advantage that golf can be played all year around, whereas in many inland courses, especially in North America the season is curtailed by weather conditions.  There is great potential in golf promotion and I look forward to seeing progress in this area.</P>
    <P>Deputy Foley referred to Cork-Kerry Tourism.  I agree that Cork-Kerry Tourism played a very prominent role in the development of tourism in the area. However, we in the north Kerry area did not benefit to the same extent as south Kerry, as I think Cork-Kerry Tourism were trying to promote a different type of tourism and were trying to attract a different market segment.  South Kerry is probably one of the most scenic spots in the country if not in the world whereas north Kerry is mainly farmland.  Nevertheless, there is a very rich cultural heritage in north Kerry.  I would refer especially to areas like Lislaughlin Abbey, Carrigfoyle Castle, Ardfert Monastery and Cathedral, Blennerville Windmill and many other historical sites which will be developed now by SFADCo. Cork-Kerry Tourism did not promote cultural tourism and did not set out to attract the type of tourists who would be <Col N="614" /> interested in heritage, culture and archaeology.  North Kerry has a very rich cultural heritage and I hope we will be able to develop its potential to benefit the area.</P>
    <P>I might add that tourism in north Kerry was not organised but I am now glad to say that a new north Kerry tourist federation has been set up and has drawn all the various villages and development associations together.  When the federation is working in co-operation with SFADCo, this should lead to greater development of tourism.  There will be a more vigorous promotion of the entertainment and activities available in the area.  For example, Listowel Writers Week is probably one of the best kept secrets in the country but is recognised in some circles as being one of the best cultural events in Europe.  The event is not promoted vigorously enough.</P>
    <P>As I have mentioned previously, north Kerry did not fare too badly because of its involvement with the IDA.  Before I leave this point, I would like to thank the IDA representatives, Mr. Michael Friel and his predecessor Mr. Brendan O'Sullivan for their efforts in promoting industry in the north Kerry region.  I am sure that they were not at fault when we did not get the industries we had hoped for from the IDA.</P>
    <P>North Kerry is within the Shannon region and it is only right that I should refer to the great development prospects of the River Shannon.  The Shannon Estuary is a major under-utilised resource for industrial development.  It has the best deep water berthage in Europe.  The surrounding terrain is accessible and will need very little adjustment work.  Nevertheless, this resource has never been developed to the extent that it should have been.  I will refer briefly to a major study carried out by An Foras Forbartha in 1983.  While I have no intention of going through the study in detail, I will comment on some points in it.  I will quote from <i>The Shannon Estuary Industrial Location Study</i> by An Foras Forbartha, 1983:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="615" /> The Shannon Estuary, with its sheltered, deep water, is considered to be a prime natural resource of the Mid-West Planning Region of Ireland, with considerable potential for the siting of manufacturing industries requiring a maritime location.  However, like many locations favourable for industrial development on the periphery of Europe, the Shannon Estuary has considerable ecological, scenic and tourism value.  It is important, therefore, to ensure that any development strategy in such areas is based on a compatible relationship between the operational characteristics of industry and the social and ecological environment.</P>
    <P>That spells out the importance of developing the Shannon estuary both as an industrial location and as a potential area for tourism activities, such as water sports, marinas, et cetera.  The study also refers to sea access to the estuary.  A 1982 report on the dredging of a navigational channel concludes that:</P>
    <P>current depth available as far as the Fergus estuary can cater for vessels of 170,000-200,000 d.w.t. at mean high water.  Dredging to cater for vessels of 250,000 d.w.t. at high water only, would cost IR£3 million, and for vessels of 400,000 d.w.t. would cost IR£5 million.</P>
    <P>No other port in Europe, apart from Rotterdam, has this natural advantage.  For the very small sum of £3 million some of the biggest vessels in the world at present could navigate the Shannon.  There must be considerable potential for transhipment alone.  The study also identified major sites on the estuary and Ardmore Point and Ballylongford sites were identified jointly as the most suitable for all industrial types that it examined, including oil related heavy industry, shipbuilding, et cetera.  I ask the Minister and indeed SFADCo to promote vigorously the Shannon estuary as an industrial location.  The Shannon estuary suffered because of competition with Ringaskiddy <Col N="616" /> where there had been massive investment in infrastructure.  Certainly the same type of investment was not put into the Shannon Bank area.  An industrialist looking for a deep sea berth comparing Ringaskiddy with the Shannon estuary will see that Ringaskiddy has all the infrastructural advantages and the Shannon estuary has all the natural advantages.  I appeal to the Government and to SFADCo to plough the necessary resources into the Shannon estuary at least to make the place suitable for the setting up of an industry.  At the moment there are no access roads to the area, which is just a green field site.  All it has is the availability of power for the development of industry and the natural advantage of the river.  I look forward to much more activity in the Shannon estuary.</P>
    <P>North Kerry has been devastated by emigration.  It is sickening for our young emigrants to know that this vast resource which cost about £5 million of taxpayers' money is being under-utilised.  In the past, people in the area were misled.  I remember a Fianna Fáil Minister going to turn the sod in Ballylongford for a smelter.  That was just two weeks before an election and that was all we heard about the smelter.  Even now there is speculation about the development of a smelter on the estuary.  This type of rumour should be scotched as it is most unfair to raise the hopes and aspirations of the people only to dash them again. A programme should be devised for the development of the area which could be promoted vigorously in Japan, America and Europe among people with resources to invest in the Shannon estuary.  The Government and SFADCo should make the necessary investment to make this region attractive for intending developers.</P>
    <P>Up to now the Clare and Limerick portions of the estuary were in the Shannon region and north Kerry was in the south west region.  The new unified region will allow a comprehensive approach to be taken towards the planning, promotion and development of the estuary.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="617" /> The estuary will be promoted and marketed as one unit.  Economic investigations and other studies on the estuary will be done and the estuary will be developed as a whole.  Within the framework of SFADCo and with the new regional structural funding, far more structured development can take place in the area and the area will benefit as a result.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the Limerick/Tralee route.  I hope the Minister has not forgotten Listowel.  The Limerick/Tralee access must include Listowel.  The national primary route leading from west Limerick to north Kerry by-passes the major part of north Kerry.  It is important that north Kerry is not forgotten.  The only stretch of national primary road in north Kerry is between Headley Bridge and Feale Bridge in Tralee via Castleisland.  That is a very small stretch of road.  I hope the Minister does not see that road as the main access to Kerry.  The main access from Limerick to Kerry, indeed from Clare to the ferry, is through Tarbert, Listowel, Tralee.  That area must be developed.  I mentioned the possibilities for Tralee Regional College.  Hopefully there will be strong links between it and NIHE.</P>
    <P>I enthusistically welcome this Bill which I have been calling for since I came into politics.  I would like the Minister and SFADCo to ensure that there will be a SFADCo presence in all of the north Kerry area.  It is proposed that the main office should be in Tralee.  That is appropriate as Tralee is the biggest centre of population outside of Limerick but there should be a presence in Listowel also.  In order to get the people of north Kerry behind it, SFADCo must have a presence in Listowel, even on a once a week basis.</P>
    <P>SFADCo have been upgrading tourist offices throughout Limerick and Clare.  I would ask them to ensure that there will be tourist offices in Tralee, Listowel and Ballybunion.  Apart from the success of the golf club, Ballybunion has died over the past ten years.  I appeal to SFADCo to use the natural advantages in Ballybunion to reverse the downward trend of <Col N="618" /> the resort which is due to the small amount of investment in Ballybunion. The resort has no proper sewage treatment facility, so that last year a survey carried out showed that Ballybunion has the dirtiest beach in the country.  I appeal to the Government to give the go ahead to the scheme that has been ready for the past two years which would give Ballybunion a proper sewage treatment plant which would help to raise environmental standards.</P>
    <P>When SFADCo come into north Kerry they should harness the goodwill and dynamism of the people who are very hard working people.  If SFADCo can harness their enthusiasm we will see major improvements in the area.</P>
    <P>The difference between the IDA and SFADCo is that SFADCo have people out on the ground whereas the IDA are office oriented because of lack of manpower. I hope SFADCo utilise their great advantage in north Kerry.</P>
    <P>I have a few reservations about this Bill, one being that Kerry will be a divided county.  There are enough divisions in the country.  I hope Kerry will not suffer from the division.  Development within the county should not become fragmented or unco-ordinated. The county development team or the county council should ensure balanced development of the county.  Funds will come to the Limerick and Cork regions and, for example, there could be major road improvements in north Kerry and there may not be corresponding improvements in south Kerry so that a good road would run into a narrow, badly repaired road.  It is very important that there is co-operation between the mid-west region and the south-west region and that Kerry County Council will have a pivotal role to play in the future development of that area.  Otherwise there could be unbalanced development of the county and the people in Kerry who oppose this Bill, because the county is being divided, are afraid this will happen.</P>
    <P>I should like to point out &mdash; and I have mentioned this already in the Estimates &mdash; that this year the allocation for <Col N="619" /> SFADCo has been reduced.  Can the Minister tell me how he expects the same number of staff or even fewer staff, to do more with less money?  This does not make sense.  The case has to be made for a supplementary estimate for SFADCo because of the extension of their remit. Perhaps the Estimates were prepared before the Government decided to extend the remit of SFADCo to north Kerry.  I believe the physical and financial resources of SFADCo will be stretched too much and the company will be less effective if they are not given more resources.  It seems a contradiction to decrease the funding for SFADCo on the one hand and increase their remit on the other.  Something has to suffer, and I am afraid it will be the peripheral areas, such as west Clare, north Tipperary and north Kerry.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the new SEDCo Bill.  This will lead to much confusion. SEDCo will be the Shannon Estuary Development Corporation as opposed to SFADCo, the Shannon Free Airport Development Company.  A proposed new authority will be set up in the SFADCo region but there is no need for this.  There is a need for a ports authority for the Shannon Estuary but this new Bill as proposed by the Minister for the Marine, Deputy Brendan Daly, is irrelevant and is not practical.  The Government should accept the Fine Gael Bill which was prepared after four years of background work by Deputy Jim Mitchell, then Minister for Communications, who consulted groups in Kilrush, Foynes, Kerry and Limerick and got universal approval for his Bill.  Then, out of the blue, this Government brought forward their Bill, which I believe has very little local input and seems to be very shallow. This Bill will cause enormous problems for port users in Foynes and other ports and it will also do a great deal of damage to Foynes itself.  What is needed in the estuary is a harbours Bill, not a development Bill.</P>

      <P>The Minister referred to the Bill in his speech.  This is very important because if this Bill goes ahead it will take away from the role of SFADCo in the region and will make a farce of the whole thing.  The only reason the SEDCo Bill was put forward is because Fine Gael had a ports Bill.  As the Chair said, I will have an opportunity of speaking on the SEDCo Bill later.</P>
      <P>I welcome this Bill even though I have some reservations about it because of the inherent dangers I see in it for north Kerry.  However, we cannot be any worse off than we are at present.  There has been very little activity there for the past two years, very few jobs were created, although we had promises of jobs over the next three years.  All we have are mass unemployment and mass emigration. There is some hope that SFADCo will reverse that trend and I look forward to working with them.  They can be guaranteed my total support and I will encourage all the development associations in north Kerry and the various community groups to support the company and to give them every opportunity to put their plans in motion in the north Kerry region.</P>

      <P>Like Deputy O'Malley I have an interest in the Shannon Free Airport Development Company and their operations.  Having read the Minister's speech and listened to Deputy Deenihan, I believe the Shannon Free Airport Development Company are admired nationally, and I suppose in north Kerry too, for some of the good things they have done.  In my area, the company have been the hub of much industrial activity for which my constituents and the mid-west region are most grateful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>SFADCo is a public limited company set up in 1959 and has been reviewed under several Acts of the Oireachtas &mdash; the last in 1986.  At that time, the company were being examined by the Committee of Public Accounts, and Members were very critical of some aspects of the company's performance, particularly the cost per job.  Since then this matter seems to have receded into the background. Today this new Bill extends the remit of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company to include north Kerry.  For the reasons outlined by Deputy Deenihan, I welcome that provision in the Bill that will include north Kerry but I am not too happy about the performance of the company since 1986.  In particular, I am not impressed by the latest announcement by Ministers that 2,800 jobs were created in the mid-west region.  The impression being given is that SFADCo have been very successful in promoting new jobs and creating employment in my area.  However, of those 2,800 jobs 2,300 were in companies which existed already. <Col N="622" /> While I appreciate that companies may need assistance to create new jobs, I object to the excessive hype attached to this so-called success.  When we look at the figures we see that 500 jobs were created in about 80 projects, six jobs per project.  That must be measured against the huge unemployment.  In the town of Shannon alone there are nearly 600 people unemployed, and that is a new town.  The Minister issues a script to the national newspapers about the great success in job creation in our area but is that genuine at all?  There are huge sums of taxpayers' money being poured into Shannon development.  There is no lack of employment in SFADCo.</P>
    <P>When the last Bill came before the House the topics at that time were the cost per job and how effective the development was.  SFADCo were going to take a new role in producing an annual target, an annual programme, and we would all see where the progress came from.  They said that there would be an in-depth analysis of the workings of the company, whether too many were employed on the estate side or on the promotion side, or whether there was any duplication on the tourism side.  Since this Government came to power they have given a new remit to the tourism side. They said there was duplication between Shannonside and SFADCo.  They did not say, however, that Shannonside were almost self-sufficient, that their work in the promotion of tourism in Limerick and the mid-west was more or less paid for by activities in which they were themselves involved in the craft area and which were supplementing employment</P>
    <P>The Government, in their wisdom, decided that that company should be subsumed into a semi-State company funded by the taxpayer.  I do not know who will get a judgment on whether this has been cost-effective.  Certainly, the Public Expenditure Committee found great difficulty in establishing the real cost per job in SFADCo.  The executives of that company and the board would be better employed in finally establishing the cost basis and publishing the figures.  When we had the announcement of the 2,800 <Col N="623" /> new jobs, we should also have been given the cost per job and when the jobs would come on stream.  That should be very easy.  They have the expertise.  Deputy Deenihan pointed out that SFADCo have the benefit of high technology.  All they have to do is hook into some reasonable computer system and they will get all this information.</P>
    <P>In my constituency and in the mid-west in general there is much cynicism.  The Minister may feel very important when announcing new jobs, as he did recently in south Kerry.  A number of projects were announced by the IDA.  It was no coincidence that the Minister for Industry and Commerce should come into the House today and announce that north Kerry would be taken over by SFADCo. That only results in a degree of competition. It provokes one promotion body into competing with the other&mdash;the IDA and SFADCo.  That is what is really giving cause for much concern in that whole area.  If these two bodies want to promote foreign investment in this country they must compete with bodies from the UK and Europe.  They seem to spend more time competing against each other for space in the national press.  The Minister, rather than promoting his own image, should be examining the real value that the taxpayer is getting from the promotion agencies.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deenihan has lauded all the activities of SFADCo, but companies that I know of on the Shannon industrial estate were involved in the 2,300 new industrial jobs.  There is a great headline about the success of industrial promotion in the region, but it is new players that we want.  SFADCo are a good originating company.  They spent five or six years trying to promote the financial services area as one for location of new jobs here. At every hand's turn they were blocked by the moguls in Merrion Street, in the Department of Finance.  If these were not satisfied, the Central Bank people said that it could not be done at all.  But financial services were included in the remit of SFADCo and, lo and behold, we have a new Taoiseach who will set up a new <Col N="624" /> financial services area in the Custom House Dock site.  He just hijacked the idea from SFADCo.  In order to show how biased he was in favour of the Custom House Docks site, he sent all these important retired people from the Central Bank and the Departments of State to the other principal banking people and financial institutions abroad.</P>
    <P>We in the mid-west must rely on SFADCo executives falling in with this high-powered committee to compete for the same financial services.  Is the Minister behaving responsibly at all, or does anybody in the Government represent the mid-west?  The Taoiseach announced recently that there would be a zero tax rate for the financial services in the docks site.  When asked by either Deputy Noonan or Deputy O'Malley when the amending legislation would be brought in for SFADCo, he said that that would fall to the Department of Industry and Commerce.  There is a Bill before us today amending the Shannon Free Airport Development Company Acts but it says nothing about zero rating for Shannon for financial services.  I appreciate that the purpose of the Bill is to extend the remit into north Kerry.  The docks site will have a running advantage with the zero tax rate.  The players that have been attracted to SFADCo, GPA and others, would like a zero tax rate, too. Is it the Taoiseach's intention that any serious-minded fund manager who goes to SFADCo will be told that there are better services in the Custom House Docks site in Dublin?  SFADCo were not looking for the huge number of jobs that the Taoiseach wants for the docks site. His monument will be built down there eventually, I am sure.  Meanwhile there are huge numbers of young people emigrating from the mid-west region, skilled people with second level education second to none.  There are also the NIHE providing third level education.  SFADCo have some good aspects.  They are integrating third level education and industrial promotion and I commend them for that.  However, I am most disappointed with the performance of the Government in relation to financial services and the <Col N="625" /> way in which they have treated SFADCo. They are being given this new role and the executives in the development company are giving the impression that the great challenge represented by the extension to Kerry will change matters.  Sooner or later some Minister for Industry and Commerce will ask how much job promotion is costing the taxpayer and whether the taxpayer will continue to bear it.  The IDA and SFADCo are masters at marketing their own product.  If all these factors were taken into account, what would be the true cost per job?</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the valuable natural attributes of the Shannon estuary. He referred to the fresh water supply and natural gas.  I would point out that natural gas is available on the southern side but not on the northern side.  Will the Clare gas link be forgotten about, with the inclusion of Kerry in the region?  The Minister for the Marine is to bring in another Bill relating to the same estuary. This will involve a further diffusion of funds which are badly needed for all sides of the estuary.  It is not desirable that the new company proposed by the Minister for the Marine should have to compete with Shannon Development for funds from Brussels.  Surely we should be trying to consolidate our resources in the mid-west in order to compete effectively.  We have to compete not only economically but politically.  It is a sad day when original ideas are unashamedly hijacked by the Taoiseach, as in the case of the Financial Services Centre.  He has never denied it, although I have asked him about it several times.</P>
    <P>This is an opportunity to examine the role of SFADCo.  The former general manager, Mr. Quigley, was quick to point out to the Oireachtas Committee on Public Expenditure that real opportunities were presented when Acts were introduced in 1961, 1963, 1965, 1970, 1974, 1978, 1983 and 1986.  That illustrates the attention which has been given to this promotion agency.  In the new competitive scene after 1992 SFADCo will have to slim down their operations somewhat.  If not, they will have to show value for money.  They have an extensive <Col N="626" /> role in tourism.  Deputy Deenihan has pointed out the many tourist attractions which exist in north Kerry and all over the mid-west.  These are being well packaged.</P>
    <P>The development of terminal traffic at Shannon Airport should be included in the remit of the company.  There has been dissension from time to time between the two agencies promoting the airport, Aer Rianta and SFADCo.  The Government might give further examination to their respective roles in the promotion of terminal traffic.  A greater effort by Aer Rianta might yield greater results.  We have also suffered from claims by people in a regional airport in County Mayo about greater advantages being given to the mid-west region because of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company. The people who want to promote Knock are quite entitled to make their claims but Ministers for Transport and Tourism in this and previous Governments have indicated that Shannon should be the sole trans-Atlantic airport for Ireland.  While the people in Knock want to expand the facilities at their own airport, they are actually making a case for direct flights from the United States to Dublin Airport.  It is noticeable that during the past few weeks nobody has said anything about the intentions of airlines flying into Dublin Airport.  It would be a disaster to change the status of Shannon as the sole trans-Atlantic airport. The national airline, Aer Lingus, must give a commitment that for the foreseeable future they will support Shannon's status.</P>
    <P>Shannon Free Airport Development Company should promote the facilities at Shannon Airport.  I was glad to read today that GPA are to become involved with a company refurbishing aircraft at Shannon.  This is a welcome move.  Are SFADCo encouraging companies like GPA with regard to the overhaul and servicing of aircraft?  We have the necessary facilities, although Aer Lingus have abandoned them.  Now that GPA have put their toe into the water, SFADCo should ask them to approach other airlines with a view to having their servicing <Col N="627" /> carried out at Shannon.  Apart from the facilities, we have a skilled workforce. In view of current suspicion about the quality of workmanship in new aircraft coming from Boeing and other manufacturers, it would be beneficial to GPA to use the facilities at Shannon and thereby reassure the people to whom they lease aircraft as to their safety.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deenihan referred to the food processing mandate of SFADCo.  He also spoke about the quality of the units on the Raheen Industrial Estate.  As far as I am aware, two major concerns in that promotion have failed.  The State had a substantial investment in the Limerick Bacon Company and while I understand it may be taken over by another company, it is not the Irish company which originally operated there.  I am not impressed by the progress made by SFADCo in the food area although the management of the company indicated it would be a major job-creating sector in the future.  Certainly they were impressive and some of the small industry products shown there had quality and value written all over them.  Since then the promotion of the food sector seems to have died.  SFADCo had also been talking about bio-technology in food and other areas, which does not seem to have been followed up.  Part of the problem emanated from the flush of new roles conferred on them by the Government.  This led to the demise of Shannonside which could have almost paid for itself if it had been allowed to continue.  I am glad that Kerry is now involved, as SFADCo may make a greater impact in this area. However, there should be an internal examination of their activities because, in the long run, the executives will be the losers unless they pursue this course.</P>
    <P>There does not seem to be great liaison between Departments in dealing with the problems of SFADCo.  I have already referred to the Department of the Marine taking over the promotional aspects of the Department of Industry and Commerce. The Department of Industry and Commerce want SFADCo, and the Department of the Marine want SEDCo. <Col N="628" /> It also seems that the Department of the Environment do not want to finalise the changeover of town houses to Clare County Council.  I do not know what is going on but a former Minister for Industry and Commerce set the deadline for the transfer of the houses in Shannon to Clare County Council.  When will this changeover take place?  Will it be finalised in 1989?  Will the Department of Industry and Commerce allow the development company to play their real role of creating jobs?</P>
    <P>By the incorporation of north Kerry into Shannon Development, the company are now increasing their scope in the food processing area because the people in north Kerry are very good farmers. Kerry Co-operative plc should be involved in joint ventures and in researching and developing products for export.  It is time that SFADCo were more involved directly with the farmers, producers, co-operatives and milk companies. SFADCo have a huge task ahead of them and I hope they will not be impeded by other problems arising in this Bill.  They need time to promote all the aspects of the Shannon mid-west region, the estuary and all the other natural resources in the area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. D. O'Malley Mr. D. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill, I would have thought, gave the Minister for Industry and Commerce an opportunity to deal with some very important policy matters at present with industrial promotion and development policy generally which need to be debated with the regional promotional policy which should be undertaken, not least in the context of the changes and increases now proposed in the Structural Funds.  I thought, before I came in here this morning, that these matters would be dealt with appropriately. Instead of that we got eight pages of minor Departmental clichés. One would think that industrial policy, the changes that must necessarily take place and the development of our regional organisation and of regions generally within this country and the Community were of no consequence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We got a load of facile and ridiculous <Col N="629" /> information like telling us that there are 20 million gallons of fresh water available per day in the Shannon Estuary and that there are two power stations there.  We were also told about the good harbour, natural gas and so on.  That sort of thing, unfortunately, does not add to our knowledge nor does it solve any of the many problems that exist in relation to these matters.</P>
    <P>For anyone looking at the industrial and general economic promotional scene at present, the factor above all others that would strike him is the proliferation of agencies and the overlapping of those agencies.  That matter of course was not adverted to in the mini-script which the Minister read but it lies at the kernel of our difficulties.  These promotional State agencies are going through a period of crisis.  Their morale is low, their results are poor and they are a bit mystified. particularly by comparison with the relative success they had approximately ten years ago, that they should be in the difficulties in which they find themselves today.  As some Members said, particularly Deputy Carey, one of the principal concerns of all these agencies is their own institutional welfare.  If they, as an institution, seem to be getting on all right, the task they were originally established to fulfil seems in some strange way to be overlooked.</P>
    <P>I have plenty of experience of speaking on Bills such as this and I have found that if one rises to speak on a Bill such as this and talks in glowing terms of the agency concerned, they will meet you a week or two later and out of the sides of their mouths they thank you profoundly for having said &ldquo;the right thing&rdquo;.  If one is in any sense critical of the policies they are pursuing, or the manner in which they are pursuing them, this would be regarded as the wrong thing no matter how logical or compelling your arguments may be.</P>
    <P>I have found in a way that is relevant to this Bill that even though they profoundly disagee with what they are being asked to do, they still want you to support them in doing something they know, and you know, is wrong.  Their reasons for asking for that support is that otherwise it will <Col N="630" /> affect the institutional morale of the agency concerned.  Quite frankly, I think we should be able to grow above that type of personalised institutional welfare and we should look at the needs and tasks involved rather than the personal or corporate future of some of the individuals who work in some of these agencies.</P>
    <P>I am afraid these agencies are in a state of some disarray.  They do not know where they are going.  It occurred to me as long ago as seven, eight or nine years, that it was becoming increasingly difficult to justify the separate existence of CTT and the IDA.  If that was the case seven, eight or nine years ago, it is even more so today, but none of those questions have been raised or discussed here, let alone answered.  The reasons for the continuous institutional autonomy of some of these agencies at times escape me. When one argues it with them, one finds that in some way they would regard it as a reflection on themselves if the existing institutional arrangements were changed and that, in a sense, is the bottom line. This is not good enough.  It is quite clear from the speech made by the Minister today that at Government level where there should be, and has to be, an overview of the situation, there is no such overview, that they are all going along in their narrow tunnels trying to find a bit of light from their own point of view at the end of each little tunnel and that the Government is an institution who vaguely presides on top but does nothing to bring together the various institutional and other strands of development or promotion in the way in which it should be done.</P>
    <P>If one wants a perfect example of what I am talking about, one only has to take a look at today's Order Paper, and at the legislation ordered for discussion by this House today.  The first item is the Bill we are discussing now &mdash; the Shannon Free Airport Development Company Limited (Amendment) Bill, 1988, which states, among other things, that the IDA shall not operate in the mid-west region, that Bord Fáilte shall not operate in the mid-west region.  The third item on the list for <Col N="631" /> discussion later today is the Bill entitled the Harbours (Shannon Estuary Development Corporation) Bill, 1988. Section 4 of that Bill sets out the functions of the corporation.  The first is to promote, co-ordinate and develop, in conjunction with Bord Fáilte Éireann, the Industrial Development Authority, the Shannon Free Airport Development Company Limited and the appropriate local authority, investment in industrial, projects and so on.  The two are totally incompatible.</P>
    <P>Where is the overview on the programme of legislation ordered in this House today?  What coherence is there in the business ordered?  Each of these items reached the particular point they are at because all sorts of agencies were fighting their own battles within their Departments. That is the course of public administration. I have often said both inside and outside of this House that these jurisdictional rows which go on all the time between Departments and agencies under Departments are the curse of public administration.  If they attacked the problems of the country with the same vigour as they defend their own respective departmental and agency jurisdictions this country would have little to fear.</P>
    <P>I speak from personal experience on these matters because I think I was the second longest serving Minister for Industry and Commerce in this country, second only to Seán Lemass.  I know something of these matters.  The vigour with which these jurisdictional boundaries are defended is one of the big drawbacks in promotion and development.  On today's Order of Business we have a classic example of this.  Today we are being asked to pass two Bills, each of which contradicts the other.  Where is the sense in that?  Where is the overview?  Where is the Cabinet responsibility in relation to this matter?  Where are we going and, in particular, where are the people of the mid-west region going?  The Minister in his mini address this morning said this would rationalise things within the region and would make it easier to draw it all <Col N="632" /> together, to use his own phrase.  Why on the very day does one of his colleagues create another agency to perform the functions that are already being performed by the Industrial Development Authority, Bord Fáilte and the Shannon Free Airport Development Company? How can we rationalise and draw them together if at the same time we create another agency which would add a further layer which would overlap what for some years has been an unacceptable level of overlap that would not be tolerated in any other country, and which would not be tolerated in this country if someone was prepared to take an overview and say that these people should come together and stop this nonsense?</P>
    <P>The principal purpose of this Bill, as outlined by the Minister this morning, is to add north Kerry to the mid-west region.  I want to make it pefectly clear that I do not have the slightest objection to this proposal.  It makes sense to me, and I said this perhaps ten years ago.  It could and should have been done then.  I recall that about ten or 11 years ago I added in south and west Offaly to the region and I should have brought in north Kerry too because it is quite illogical not to have one of the most important shores along the estuary included.  I welcome the Bill from that point of view.</P>
    <P>What is of consequence now is whether north Kerry will be any better off.  One of the reasons I ask this question is that the greatest asset of north Kerry is its shoreline along the Shannon estuary.  It is unique, particularly at a point near Ballylongford, in having 80 feet of water at low tide within 30 or 40 metres of a level shore.  Nowhere else in the continent of Europe, other than in northern Norway, has God put those advantages. That is what is valuable about it &mdash; 80 feet of water at low tide within a stone's throw of a level shore.</P>
    <P>What has been happening in relation to this land which in industrial development and infrastructural terms is possibly the most valuable land in Europe today?  The IDA have it up for sale.  They want to get rid of it.  They spent thousands of pounds advertising it, auctioning it, putting it out <Col N="633" /> to tender and all the rest of it, and the only people they could get to buy it were local farmers who were offering agricultural rates for it, who themselves were the original vendors and were hoping to buy it back for about one tenth or one twentieth of what they got for it ten years ago.</P>
    <P>I intervened and asked the managing director of the IDA to have sense and not sell this land.  The IDA's reply was that they were under instructions from the Government to get rid of it.  I think the Government were right to tell the IDA to get rid of much of their land because they have thousands of acres all over the country which is of no particular value.  If they ever need land again in an area they can go out and buy it, probably much more cheaply today than it would have been ten years ago, but the one bit of land they have in Ireland that should not be sold is the bit they made the greatest fuss and the effort and spent the most money trying to sell.  That was potentially the most valuable piece of land in Europe, the jewel in north Kerry's crown.  SFADCo as a local regional organisation, a very good one of its kind, will never be able to develop that piece of land in the way they need to because it is land that is ideally suited to heavy industrial development, and of its nature most heavy industrial development will not be indigenous; it will come from abroad.  That land will have to be promoted abroad and the investment in relation to it more than likely will predominantly have to come from abroad.</P>
    <P>The Government decided in July 1987, for reasons they have never explained satisfactorily and in respect of which I and others have some theories, to banish the IDA and Bord Fáilte from the mid-west region.  There is an inherent and basic conflict there as well as conflict between this Bill and the Shannon Estuary Bill we are supposed to debate later today.  There is a conflict in relation to the decision of July 1987, which has no rational basis.  You cannot take a small region out of a small country and tell it to go out into the world and promote itself against its own country and every <Col N="634" /> other country for the apparently declining amount of mobile international investment available.  That is what they are expected to do, and the IDA confirmed to me, I suppose much to their anger and embarrassment, though they need not feel embarrassed because it was not their own choice &mdash; that they have circulated abroad in their offices and elsewhere in the course of their promotional work in the past year a map of Ireland on which two parts of this island are blanked out.  The two parts blanked out are Northern Ireland about which the IDA, the Government nor anybody else can do nothing at the moment or for the foreseeable future.  The other part of Ireland blanked out on the same basis is the midwestern region.  Both of these areas are non-existent so far as the promotion of this country abroad is concerned.</P>
    <P>That is not good enough.  I am not blaming the IDA.  When I remonstrated with them they asked what option they had and what they could do.  They are not allowed even to retain an office in Limerick.  They cannot promote this place.  They cannot say it exists.  They cannot say to people abroad it is some one else's job to sell it but they can help them out if they decide they want to come there.  That makes absolutely no sense in respect of a tiny country like this.  If the mid-west region were an American state with a population of ten or 15 million and very considerable resources the Government in Washington could well tell them to promote their own affairs, they have the resources, ability and everything else to do it.  You cannot say to a little region in the middle of a little country when the whole country has a population of only 3.5 million and the region only a few hundred thousand, &ldquo;Go off and promote yourself against your own country abroad and take on Ireland and see who is going to prevail&rdquo;.  It does not make sense and all involved know that, although they cannot say it publicly.  They do not want to take on the IDA and they cannot do so.  They have no facilities.  They have no overseas offices through which they can do it.  If they are to build them up it means a total duplication of the IDA's facility.  It is mad <Col N="635" /> from this country's point of view that they should have to do so.</P>
    <P>Similarly they cannot take on Bord Fáilte because if they were to do so we would have three promotional bodies trying to sell this island in tourism terms, the Northern Ireland Tourist Board trying to sell the Six Counties, Bord Fáilte trying to sell 22.4 counties or whatever it is and SFADCo trying to sell three counties plus two bits of two others. Everyone knows that makes no sense. The agencies who more than anyone else know it makes no sense meekly kowtow. I have no doubt they kick up murder within the Department; I heard they did so and asked what in God's name was going on in the Department and the Department shrugged their shoulders and said &ldquo;we do not understand it any more than you do, it is a Government decision, you and I have to implement it and that is it&rdquo;.  After that none of them pursued it because they felt it was not in the institutional welfare of their own agency to pursue the illogicality and, one might be entitled to say, the lunacy of it all.  That is the way things work.  You have to look after your own institution and you do not query things and you do not contribute to any debate on them. Everything is to be done behind closed doors and if you cannot prevail behind closed doors you do not prevail at all because you do not have a public debate. That is wrong and it is one reason we are declining so seriously in terms of industrial promotion not just in the mid-west region but in the country as a whole where the figures are so disastrous and have been so for quite a number of years.</P>
    <P>I was trying to think back in the past week or two of when a major industry came to Limerick.  I cannot remember the exact date but it was 1981 or 1982. Limerick and its immediately surrounding area have done relatively well by comparison with many other areas because much of what was put in there in the late seventies has prospered and continues to expand and to employ increasing numbers of people to this very day.  Some of the finest factories in this <Col N="636" /> country and in some respects in the world are in and around the city of Limerick, but that is just fortuitous.  Nothing has gone in there and the same could be said of many other areas.</P>
    <P>I watched a television programme about two weeks ago on the Limerick Unemployed Centre and the very good work that is being done there for the large number of persons who are unemployed. Persons interviewed on the programme quoted vast numbers of unemployed in and around that city.  The figures are so bad that I question their accuracy.  I accept that the position is bad but I do not think it is quite as bad as some of the figures quoted on that programme would suggest.  However, I do accept that the position is pretty disastrous.  It is unfortunate that there has been no examination of the employment situation in the region by the Minister.  For example, we have not been told how many hundreds of thousands of square feet of empty factory space there is in the region. I would have thought that that was a very relevant factor.  I am afraid that the figure is not just hundreds of thousands of square feet but runs to more than one million square feet.  I would have thought that that was a relevant point to bring out in the course of this debate but it has been ignored.  We were told that there is plenty of fresh water in the region and that there are two power stations there. One of the power stations has closed down because there is no demand for electricity.  It is a great disappointment that power which is readily available for the development of heavy industry in that region, and on the estuary banks, is only available at a price which is perhaps one of the highest in Europe.  If it were available at a reasonable price a great degree of development could take place.</P>
    <P>In the last eight or nine years the most significant thing that happened in Shannon airport, and in the estate attached to it, was without question GPA.  That company was not referred to by the Minister. From literally nothing in 1974 it has become a world leader.  It is one of the very few Irish companies with a turnover <Col N="637" /> in excess of $1 billion.  That company has had enormous success and has brought huge benefit to this country and, in particular, to the mid-west region.  What it has done, how it has done it and the various legal and institutional arrangements that underpinned it are of crucial importance and should be discussed in any debate on the future of industrial development in that region but it was not mentioned by the Minister.  It is more important than perhaps 100 or 150 companies that were brought in by the IDA. That is the measure of its importance.</P>
    <P>The original taxation or fiscal arrangements relating to Shannon trading licences expire in July 1990 &mdash; I do not think they go to December of that year. What will happen after that expiry date next year in relation to existing companies and those that may come in?  The answer to that question is absolutely crucial to the future development of the region and, in particular, the airport and surrounding facilities.  One hears all sorts of conflicting rumours as to what will happen and one hears that quiet little deals are being done behind the scenes and so on, that assurances, nods and winks are being given to X, Y and Z and that there is no need to worry.  I do not think that is enough.</P>
    <P>That issue should be discussed openly in the House.  We should be told what the arrangements are and, if legislative changes are needed, if they will be introduced here and, if so, when and the nature of them.  It is unreal to be talking about this region in the terms that the Minister for Industry and Commerce used this morning.  It is a great disappointment that he would not avail of the opportunity to comment on some of the real problems and the real opportunities that exist in that region.</P>
    <P>I remember making the suggestion ten years ago that the Shannon Free Airport Development Company was the body most suited to take over the development of the estuary as a whole and that that might be seen in the context of the difficulties that obtain in relation to a single estuarial harbour authority there.  Various efforts were made by successive <Col N="638" /> Governments in relation to that and various Bills were produced.  I had reservations about the Bills we saw earlier but, to some extent, they were reservations of detail.  I have more than reservations about what faces us on today's Order Paper and which we are supposed to discuss this afternoon.  What they are now proposing is absolutely lunatic.  It will totally undermine the position of SFADCo, the IDA and Bord Fáilte. Where do Bord Fáilte stand in relation to this?  I have already examined the position of the IDA and I should like to know if Bord Fáilte are supposed to produce maps, as the IDA have, with Northern Ireland and the mid-west region blanked out?</P>

      <P>My understanding of a Second Reading of a Bill is that Members can discuss not just what is in the Bill but what one thinks should be in it.  Deputy Carey quoted the former general manager of the company concerned as saying, before an Oireachtas committee, that the opportunity which the Dáil had to discuss the affairs of his company and the policy it was pursuing came in the form of the various Bills that were introduced every two or three years in relation to them.  If we are to be deprived of that opportunity it will be unsatisfactory.</P>
      <P>I do not want to indulge in repetition although I wanted to deal with the tourism aspect of this issue.  It is important and Shannon Development have some responsibility for it.  It is utterly unclear what that responsibility is but they have some of responsibility.  What appears to have happened since July 1987 is that Shannon Development have taken over the functions of the former Shannonside, which was the local or regional tourist organisation.  The latter has been dissolved. Outside of that, as far as I know and in spite of the Government decision, they do not do anything else because, they say, it would be futile to do so.  They are not going to waste their money, and the taxpayers' money, trying to do it. That is fair enough; it makes sense.  If they could do the same in relation to industrial development it would make equal sense.  Certainly, their reaction to this other Bill is one of incredulity, as it must be, because a further layer of overlap is added to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would love to see that region, the most regionally developed in institutional terms, held up as a headline to the remainder of the country but one cannot hold up the legislative mess we have here as a headline to anybody.  We cannot hold it up and suggest that other regions copy it.  Why should there be four or five agencies all responsible for the same thing in the same place?  One cannot say to any other region or to anybody else in the <Col N="640" /> community for that matter that that is the way things should be done.  The mid-west is a geographic coherent unit by virtue of the fact that it is located all around the estuary and the estuary is the focal point. It is easier to bring about regional development, first, through the institutions and, second, on the ground in that region than it is in any other region of the country.  It is the place we should start.  What has happened over the last two years was that the regional development organisation there &mdash; which was perhaps the only one nationwide which had any pretentions to effectiveness at all &mdash; was dissolved by the Government.  It does not seem to me to make sense that that one, which tried to bring them all together, should have been dissolved on the grounds that it was costing of the order of £20,000, £30,000 or £40,000 annually to run.  The Government should stand back from this plethora of legislation, competing agencies and so on and say: down there we have an ideal regional area that could be held up as a model for sensible and rational development; the way things are at present that is not happening, nor will it happen.  They should stand back from it, try to plan as if none of these various agencies and so on existed, and ask themselves what they would do if they were starting from scratch.  Perhaps they should put something in there to enable that be done sensibly and logically. They should then introduce a Bill in the House and proceed from there.</P>
    <P>The potential there is enormous.  What is killing it are all these local, jurisdictional, agency, departmental rivalries. I find there quite a high degree of cohesion between all the people concerned. Everybody now realises that if that estuary as a unit and region prospers, everybody who lives within a radius of 30 or 40 miles will prosper also.  Hopefully they do not see it any longer in the very parochial terms some of them might have done in the past.  They see this as being a time of opportunity.  I wish that the legislative arrangements being made in that connection reflected and grasped that opportunity.</P>

      <P>As Deputy O'Malley said, the main provision of the Bill is the extension of the geographical mandate of SFADCo.  It would be indeed difficult to contribute to this debate if one were to be confined to dealing with the various townlands mentioned in the Bill. I take it that some comment must be allowed on the value of merely extending the remit of the company or advocating whether something more should be done.</P>
      <P>I am not opposing the Bill.  Regional organisations are absolutely necessary. Rather my criticism would be of the lack of planning in regionalised development. There is one point on which I would seek clarification from the Minister.  I understand it is the intention also to alter the remit of the company and this does not appear to be referred to in the Bill.  I understand the present responsibility of SFADCo to be the promotion of small industry in the region.  The general understanding would appear to be that henceforth the company will promote the development of medium and large industry in the mid-west region and the other areas referred to.  All that is referred to in the Bill is the extension of their mandate.  Therefore it would appear to me that, within their extended boundaries, they would simply continue to promote small industries.  I do not know whether it is the Minister's intention to introduce another Bill altering the mandate of SFADCo, in turn withdrawing the mandate from the IDA.  There is no provision in this Bill to the effect that the IDA will no longer be responsible.  It appears to me that henceforth SFADCo will deal with all matters formerly dealt with by the IDA.  The whole point is that SFADCo henceforth will be taking over a region from the IDA and will deal with all matters formerly dealt with by the IDA in addition to tourism formerly dealt with by Bord Fáilte.  That is not at all clear from a reading of the Bill; it is not clear to me and I believe would not be to the general public.  Perhaps that is not the case but, from everything I have heard, that would appear to be the general understanding of the intent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If that is the case the first question that <Col N="642" /> springs to mind is whether there is a plan for the remainder of the country.  It must be acknowledged that SFADCo have done a fastastic job within their area of remit.  There is the danger that the extension of their remit boundaries will lead to the whole operation falling apart, their efficiency being lost in the wider region. I presume that is dependent on the staff and funding to be provided for the purpose. That leads me to ask why not have a Knock Airport development company dealing similarly with Mayo, Galway, Roscommon, Leitrim and the Sligo regions responsible for industrial development, tourism and everything else there?  Have the Government any plans for regionalising the development formerly undertaken by the IDA on a national basis?  If not, then this type of exercise is meaningless, resulting in what Deputy O'Malley described as constituting merely maps with portions of the country missing.  That is the end result of that type of so-called planning.  Otherwise it means that IDA representatives are travelling worldwide endeavouring to attract industrialists to a country, large portions of which are missing.</P>
    <P>Are we to understand that henceforth SFADCo will be in direct competition with the IDA, approaching the same industrialists, advocating that they come to the Limerick, North Tipperary, Clare or part of Kerry areas but not the remainder? Are SFADCo to advocate that industrialists be confined to those areas rather than those recommended by the IDA, such as south Kerry, east Offaly, South Tipperary or wherever?  It renders this nation and the whole exercise ridiculous internationally if this is to be the kind of silly competition that is to be engaged in.  There has been no indication that the Minister has any planned redevelopment in mind for the IDA, for the manner in which industry and tourism should be attracted here on a nationwide basis, or to some areas in particular, depending on Government priorities at any given time.  For example, the disadvantages obtaining in the various <Col N="643" /> regions vary from time to time.  The question of providing tax incentives or whatever to attract industry to a region with high unemployment or a high incidence of emigration has arisen frequently in this House.</P>
    <P>The major problem confronting the Government is that at present every area has high unemployment and massive emigration.  Indeed the latest figures for emigration furnished in the House show that 32,000 emigrated last year and 116,000 over the past five years.  That figure of 116,000 constitutes 25,000 more than the whole population of Clare and gives some indication of the enormous scale of development required by way of job creation to halt emigration and create jobs for those already unemployed in the regions.  This is an enormous task and whether SFADCo are capable of carrying it out I do not know.  Particular emphasis will be placed on the region as regards the creation of jobs and there is no doubt jobs are required in that region.  The first thing the company should do in their new remit is to ensure that these new jobs are created in Thurles as soon as the Sugar Company close down.</P>
    <P>Another point raised by Deputy O'Malley relates to Ballylongford and the huge tracts of territory that are owned by the IDA and are being sold off.  That land was purchased a number of years ago for the purpose of building a lead and zinc smelter to deal with the huge quantities of lead and zinc ore produced here every year.  We export 350,000 tonnes of raw ore to Belgium, France, Spain and Italy each year.  The intention was that we would have a smelter in Ireland and Ballylongford was chosen as the site.  At that time there were ore mines in Galway but now the only one in operation is in Tara.  It was intended that all the ore from the lead and zinc mines would be smelted in Ballylongford and that there would be subsidiary industries which would manufacture parts for cars, washing machines, cookers, fridges and all sorts of household goods.  A whole new industry with various spin-offs would have been created in Ireland and based <Col N="644" /> in Ballylongford where there is a harbour from where the goods could be exported.</P>
    <P>That was a great idea but it came to nothing because Rio Tinto Zinc told the Government they would not agree to it as they had smelters already in Europe and they needed our raw ore to keep the smelters in operation.  The new SFADCo should look again at the possibility of having a lead and zinc smelter in Ballylongford because all the ore in Tara mines will be used up in the next 15 to 20 years.  There are prospects of ore being found in the Galmoy area and that could be equally as successful as the Tara mines.  There is no end to supplies.  I suggest that the board consider that area for development and make sure that the land in Ballylongford is not sold off.</P>
    <P>The other industrial development authority which is normally completely excluded from discussion is Údarás na Gaeltachta who proved themselves highly efficient in the development of new jobs and who are being starved of funds.  If the funds are not available for Údarás na Gaeltacha to develop industry and tourism in the Gaeltacht regions in the west and south-west, how are we to provide the funds for the new pepped-up SFADCo which will have responsibility for the region from north Kerry to the Galway border, across to the middle of Offaly and down to Tipperary North Riding?  It would be quite easy to provide the money when one considers the amount that has been wasted by the IDA in recent years.  They have indicated that £177 million in grants was paid to firms which went bust in a period of nine years. In that nine years IDA-attracted industries created 117,422 jobs.  One may say that is not bad but 36,438 of those &mdash; three out of every ten &mdash; were lost.  That information is contained in the IDA annual reports.</P>
    <P>Another report indicates that despite spending £1,077 million in a six year period, from 1981 to 1986 inclusive, 28,000 jobs were lost.  That is quoted in <i>Determinants of Profit Outflows from Ireland,</i> an ESRI report by Eoin O'Malley and Sue Scott in December 1987.  That report pointed out that the profit outflows <Col N="645" /> from Ireland increased from £258 million in 1981 to £1,346 million in 1986.  Profit outflows increased at a huge rate but jobs were still being lost and the IDA were still spending money on industries that were going bust.  I suggest to the Minister that serious consideration needs to be given to the structure of the new company. They must look at what the IDA have been doing wrong as well as what they have been doing right in the past number of years to ensure that there will not be the same level of jobs losses and firm closures in the mid-west region in future.</P>
    <P>I would also suggest that the new company examine the IDA record in another area.  SFADCo attract companies to Ireland and decide what companies get grants and how much they will get.  The Government should ensure that what happened with the IDA does not happen with this company.  That organisation were in touch with a group called W and E Products who were in the mercury soap manufacturing business.  They called their company The Soap Company of Ireland.  At that time Ms. Heather MacSharry was a business analyst in the IDA who gave a grant of £1 million to that company, 45 per cent of their investment in Ireland.  Six months later Ms. MacSharry joined the board of that company and became marketing officer.  Before people opt to leave companies like the IDA, SFADCo or Údarás na Gaeltachta, who deal with taxpayers' money and decide on allocations to different industries, there should be a stay period of at least five years to ensure that conflicts of interest would not arise in such matters.</P>
    <P>While I cannot say I welcome the Bill I am not opposing it.  I am not sure that it will be great for the region but it has prospects of doing much good for the region.  What I am opposed to is the piecemeal attitude of this Government.  I do not know whether this is being done in some spiteful way for some reason or other through the IDA or whether it is being done as part of a plan.  If it is being done as part of a plan we would all like to see a similar regionalised development plan for the whole country which would <Col N="646" /> be structured and which we could all understand.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Minister for Energy (Mr. Smith) Minister for Energy (Mr. Smith)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1, 15, 23, 32, 33, 67 and 68 together.</P>
      <P>I can tell the Deputies who have put down these questions that the Government are open to proposals which would lead to any or all of the following: (1) reactivation of the 1 million tonne storage and trans-shipment facility at Whiddy Island, and (2) continued operations and refinery upgrade at Whitegate.  To this end, my Department have prepared a document to facilitate discussion with Governments or companies who intend to make such proposals.  A significant level of interest has been generated but I do not intend, for reasons of commercial propriety and confidentiality, to identify, at this stage, the contacts which have been initiated.</P>
      <P>I can say that discussions have taken place recently between officials of my Department and the Nigerian National Oil Corporation and associates including French, Italian and Japanese interests. The discussions were of a preliminary nature and considerable further detail is required before any comprehensive negotiation with this group is possible.</P>
      <P>There are ongoing contacts with a European company related to a development at Whitegate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like to make it quite clear that, first, I am not, at present, in receipt of any definite proposal from any source in relation to the oil facilities <Col N="648" /> and, secondly, no exclusivity arrangement is currently in place with respect to discussions in relation to these facilities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOMalley" hpid="Mr. P. O'Malley Mr. P. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to hear that there is no exclusivity arrangement involved in the discussions which are taking place and that it will not be confirmed to Nigerian interests.  In principle it is good that we should make these facilities available to producer countries. May I ask the Minister if the discussions are taking place on a Government to Government basis or is he dealing through intermediaries?  What level of control does the Minister think the State should exercise over the facilities in the event of some deal being done and what further criteria would he lay down to ensure that our strategic interests are protected in the event of a deal coming to fruition?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have indicated in my reply we are only having very preliminary discussions and to go any further in relation to that matter would be imprudent. The fuels order which requires oil importers to purchase 35 per cent of petrol and gas oil requirements from the refinery was introduced to ensure the continued operation of the refinery.  It is seen as an integral part of Ireland's oil supply security.  It was recognised as such by the European Court of Justice and a change in ownership would not alter this position.  It would be fair also to say that as far as the strategic national interest is concerned the Government would be very anxious to ensure that whatever final negotiations take place, the security of supply and the balance between ensuring that that happens and the proposals are kept in proper context.  The Deputy can be assured that every effort, so far as I and the Government are concerned, will be aimed at safeguarding the national strategic interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOMalley" hpid="Mr. P. O'Malley Mr. P. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister <Col N="649" /> not agree that for any producer country that might be interested in doing a deal along the lines he has described, the major carrot would be the compulsory 35 per cent off-take regime that exists in Whitegate at present?  If that is now going to be made available to an incoming producer country it obviously would be very attractive for them.  Would the Minister see any implications for controlling the price of the product which would be coming on to the Irish market given that a producer country would have a captive market and to some extent could ignore the prices that prevail on the world market, knowing that the product he produces at Whitegate has to be taken by the Irish consumer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I explained to the Deputy in my reply that as far as any potential change of ownership was concerned the mandatory régime as presently operated is not up for grabs.  We would have to take the totality of the proposals in context into account and make our own decisions in the light of these proposals. By taking a stab at one particular aspect without discussing the totality of whatever proposals might be presented to the Government I could not concede at this stage, at the point of preliminary discussions, what I might do.  The Deputy who represents a reasonable share of commercial interests would not be inclined to go down that road and I have no intention of doing that either.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOMalley" hpid="Mr. P. O'Malley Mr. P. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief, a Cheann Comhairle.  I take it from what the Minister has said that the 35 per cent compulsory off-take may not necessarily be available to somebody who might come in to do a deal in the Whitegate area.  May I finally ask the Minister if he would be open to considering proposals for disposal individually of both the storage facility and the refining facility or <Col N="650" /> does he want to have a situation whereby both of those would be taken together?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>In most cases from the point of view of completing a satisfactory arrangement one could see a scenario where the use of the joint facilities in one composite proposal would have certain attractions.  If separate proposals were to emerge in relation to either, these would be considered on the basis of their merits. I would have no hang-up about pressing for negotiations which would only be concerned with a development involving the two areas.  I would be happy to take separate proposals provided these are satisfactory.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Energy (Mr. Alyward)</NameTxt>
      <P>The primary responsibility in this area rests with the Department of Social Welfare and the Revenue Commissioners.  I will, however, expect Coillte Teoranta to ensure as far as possible that their contractors comply fully with the requirements of the Social Welfare and Revenue codes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="651" />
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept the private estimates which are currently being circulated which state that there are at least 1,000 people operating in the black economy in forestry and that it is costing the Exchequer £7 million?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamAylward" hpid="Mr. Alyward Mr. Alyward">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alyward</NameTxt>
      <P>While it is impossible to assess the actual numbers, the Department of Social Welfare last year initiated a campaign to track down workers operating in the black economy.  Those in the forest service, the people in management and so on, co-operated fully and as a result there was a significant improvement. There are three categories of workers employed directly in the timber trade.  First, there are the direct employees of Coillte Teoranta and they are all above board; secondly, there are the contractors who are operating under contract for service and who are generally not so bad and, thirdly, there are the operators who work for private companies and individuals to harvest timber. I think that is where the difficulty lies. However, as I have said, significant improvements have been made in that regard and our management staff are working in total co-operation with the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not the case that some of these contractors whom the Minister describes as not so bad are in the direct employ of Coillte Teoranta and were formerly employed by the Department of Forestry?  In that context does the Minister not feel that more can be done?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamAylward" hpid="Mr. Aylward Mr. Aylward">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aylward</NameTxt>
      <P>All the contractors must have a tax clearance certificate for any works carried out in excess of £10,000 per year.  I think this is a safeguard for that category.  There is also a new form of contract being used by the company which includes a provision whereby contractors are required to comply with all legal responsibilities of employers relating to tax, PRSI, et cetera.  There has been a significant improvement in that category.  Indeed we will endeavour <Col N="652" /> through the vigilance of the management and our own inspectors in co-operation with the Department of Social Welfare to improve on the situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Energy the profit or loss of each of the energy companies in 1988; the prospects for 1989; and the expected dividends payable to the Exchequer in each year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Bord na Móna reported a loss of £3.39 million in its accounts for the year ended 31 March 1988.  The accounts of Irish National Petroleum Corporation, the Electricity Supply Board and Bord Gais Éireann for the calendar year 1988 are not yet available and will be published and laid before the Oireachtas during the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I am not in a position to quantify the prospects for 1989 I expect that in accordance with the Government's <Col N="654" /> financial policy, each company will aim to improve its financial position.</P>
    <P>No dividends or other distributions were paid to the Exchequer in 1988. Neither the ESB nor Bord na Móna are required to pay dividends &mdash; as distinct from interest on loans.  INPC, while now trading profitably, has accumulated losses from earlier years and any profits will, in the first instance, be retained to reduce losses brought forward.  BGE has in earlier years paid substantial profits to the Exchequer, and the position in 1988 and 1989 will be reviewed in the light of its financial outturn, investment needs and obligations to repay borrowings.</P>

      <P>I think we would all wish to have this information available more readily.  The practice has been, as far as I know in this House, to receive these reports on a statutory basis six to 12 months after the end of the accounting year.  I would be anxious to expedite the matter as much as possible but this depends on the volume of work and activities involved in producing accounts of major companies just a couple of months after the completion of the accounting year.  There are difficulties involved and these have been taken into account in many discussions in this House on Committee Stages of Bills where the same demands are made.  It is not practical to get all of this together with the speed that the Deputy wants.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The grant of a mining lease by my Department would be a prerequisite to the commencement of a gypsum mine development at Glangevlin, County Cavan.  Before the question of grant of a lease can be fully considered by my Department it will be necessary for the company concerned to show that an adequate body of economically mineable ore reserves has been delineated and to provide further information on the nature and extent of the mining and processing operations planned and on the arrangements envisaged <Col N="656" /> for implementation of those plans.  Certain information in this regard has been sought from the company.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply.  I am glad that he appreciates that the discovery is of vital importance to the area that has suffered drastically from unemployment and emigration.  To allay the fears of the local people, can the Minister give an assurance that a plant will be established in this area to carry out the processing of the ore reserves?  If the product were manufactured elsewhere this would have a negative effect on the area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It is somewhat premature to give that kind of guarantee.  The matter is being examined at present. There are certain powers which the Minister for Energy has in the granting of leases which could take into account the factors which the Deputy is worried about but indeed there are many other factors also and I would prefer to await the outcome.  However, I wish to indicate to the Deputy that it would be my desire that these resources would be processed in the area in which they had been located.  It will be some time before I will be in a position to make a decision.  I am not at liberty to say whether one or more companies are involved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 36 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I expect at least four wells to be drilled in 1989 involving three exploration companies. I am hopeful that additional exploration wells may also be undertaken but the drilling of any of these will depend <Col N="658" /> in the first instance on the evaluation of seismic surveys completed by certain companies.  The drilling of any appraisal wells will depend on the results of exploration drilling.</P>
    <P>No commercial oil or gas discovery has been made to date apart from the Kinsale Head gas field.  While accumulations of oil and deposits of gas have since been identified by offshore exploration activities these have not been regarded as commercial because of insufficient reserves and low oil price.</P>
    <P>I have no plans to revise the offshore licensing terms announced by my predecessor in September 1987.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister say where the four wells are expected to be drilled?  The Minister in his reply said that no viable discovery had been made. Is the Minister satisfied that no economically viable discovery has already been made?  Is the Minister taking into account current oil prices?  What reason has the Minister for being so clear in his statement that no viable discovery of oil has occurred?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The four wells will be in the Celtic Sea and Porcupine &mdash; 49.9, 48.20 and I do not recall offhand the reference for the other.  They may well depend on certain seismic operations. The evidence available to me and to the Deputy indicates that while there was one fairly major find of oil, its discovery in such deep waters made it less than a commercial find in the context of present oil prices and in the context of current technology.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that the level of drilling in the early eighties was 50 per cent higher than he now projects for 1989, given the major change that the former Minister made in the terms, which effectively rule the Irish public out of any royalty or stake in an oil find?  In view of all that, is the Minister happy with that level of drilling?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, the terms which have been agreed by the <Col N="659" /> Government on this matter are not harsh but they also have some significant strengths.  When the Deputy refers to 1980, it would be scarcely judicious&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to take 1980 as a comparison. The change in oil prices since the early eighties has obviously changed the whole face of exploration.  Without the change which was made in 1987 it is extremely unlikely that the level of drilling which is now considerably better than it was, but which is not anything like we would want it to be, would be taking place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister must be very disappointed at the very small number of wells planned for this year. The Minister mentioned the Celtic Sea. There are three wells there which I presume are gas wells arising from the recent deal with Marathon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am presuming that that is what is happening and that the only exploration for oil that might take place is in the Porcupine.  The Minister mentioned that even though the terms that were revised in September 1987 were generous, the level of exploration has fallen off considerably and he indicated that that had to do with the low world prices for oil.  As the Minister is using that as a reason for the lack of activity, will the Minister say what price a barrel of oil would have to go to, before exploration activity is likely to pick up and a commercially viable exploration is likely to take place?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave as one reason the current oil prices which would have to be a factor.  Of course, there are other factors, for instance, the level of expenditure so far in exploration and the results of that exploration.  There are quite a number of factors that would have to be taken into account.  We have four positive developments and we will do all we can to encourage others.

      <P>I think every Member of this House would like more money to be spent in research and development but <Col N="663" /> these decisions were taken in the context of budgetary constraints and there is very little scope at present for increasing investment.

      <P>The aim in selecting projects for inclusion in Ireland's Intervention Programme under the Council Regulation 3301/86 (Valoren) was to take full advantage of the £19.3 million grant aid allocation to this country under this scheme.  The Government decided, that this objective could best be achieved by channelling the available funds into public sector areas of activity.  Implementation of the programme, which was approved by the EC Commission in November 1987, is now well underway in upwards of 13 counties in all four provinces with a direct employment effect of about 600 jobs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the success of the private scheme under the Turf Development Act, 1981, I should like to ask the Minister to consider giving some of this special allocation under the Valoren scheme to private development.  In view of the success of that scheme &mdash; 1,192 schemes were approved nationally under the scheme in 1981 and 115 schemes were approved in Kerry, amounting to grants of £700,000 &mdash; would the Minister consider extending Valoren aid to the private sector and making application for EC funding for the private sector under the scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no objection in principle to Valoren funds or other EC funds being diverted to support private sector development in peat activities.  In relation to the decision which was taken on the current Valoren fund, this decision was based on the fact that it would be the best way to have the maximum drawdown on EC funds.  I think the Deputy would admit, in the light of experience, the developments which have taken place as a result of that programme and the additional jobs which have been created, that it was a very successful effort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the Deputy's question on private fund development, as the Deputy knows, that scheme has been terminated.  This scheme was very successful &mdash; I do not have the exact figures off the top of my head &mdash; and brought about a very significant increase in sod <Col N="665" /> peat development throughout the country and could be largely instrumental in having a number of changes made in the way small and medium sized bogs are operated in the future.  It is not possible to find resources at present to give further support to that development.</P>

As the Deputy knows, part of the Valoren grant was dedicated to the ESB for this purpose and a number of projects are in the process of going ahead. There is a limit to the resources available and I do not think there is any question in anybody's mind that the way in which these funds were used by the ESB and Bord na Móna both created and sustained employment.</P>

In view of the emphasis placed on smokeless fuel especially, does the Minister not agree that we should be encouraging more private developers to get involved?  There are vast acres of virgin bog in County Kerry which would be developed if these grants were available. I should like to point out to the Minister that this scheme was very popular in County Kerry where over 5,000 acres were developed under 117 schemes. I should like the Minister seriously to consider &mdash; this would be a very popular decision &mdash; reintroducing some form of grant aid.

      <P>The remit of the current scheme will go on for about two or three years more in the sense that those applications which were submitted and approved prior to the abandonment of the grant in 1987 still have a considerable way to run.  A considerable amount of peatland throughout the country still benefits from the old scheme.  The decision to terminate the scheme was taken both <Col N="667" /> in the context of budgetary constraints and because the range of activities which had been created and developed throughout the country appear in the light of success, to be almost self-sustaining at this stage.</P>

      <P>Has the Minister looked at the cost of sod peat coming from these privately developed bogs and the cost from Bord na Móna and at whether the advantage in cost from the privately developed bogs would justify another look at this scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>If you examine the figures in relation to Bord na Móna's involvement in sod peat prior to the introduction of that scheme and the current figures, Bord na Móna's sod peat activities would probably have reduced by close to two-thirds and the private sod development would have grown by six, eight, or perhaps even ten times what it was five to six years ago.  Market forces alone have dealt fairly adequately with the tenor of the question.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11, 24 and 29 together.</P>
      <P>The question of what legal options are available to us on nuclear issues is an extremely complex one.  The questions which arise range from establishing the legal basis for a case, in what court, against which defendant, how best to mount a case and how to measure our chances of success.  It would be a serious mistake to take on a case which proves to be unsuccessful and it behoves us therefore to press all options which do not amount to court action but which may lead to successful results.  It is not in our interest to take hurried decisions in this area, but if circumstances present themselves which make it advisable to press legal options, I will not hesitate to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the record, various aspects of the nuclear issue have been under active discussion with the Attorney General since the beginning of 1988.  It is difficult to segregate the consultations into separate parts, but in relation to specific situations which arose we reached timely conclusions which were vindicated by events in relation to Trawsfynydd and the Cattenom case in particular.  In regard to other options, it is also a matter of public record and borne out by NEB sampling, the discharges from Sellafield have declined in recent years and this is due almost exclusively to international pressure on the UK.  We will continue to exert pressure until discharges and accidental <Col N="669" /> releases are entirely eliminated, preferably by closure of the plant.</P>
    <P>The Government are aware of the proposal to build a second power station in Anglesea.  The UK Government have already been made aware of Ireland's opposition to this proposal, and to any expansion of the UK nuclear industry which would increase risks to the Irish people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOMalley" hpid="Mr. P. O'Malley Mr. P. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I can accept that the Minister would like to improve the position that exists in terms of the dangers posed to us by the British nuclear industry through means other than taking legal action.  However, he will have to accept that the actions we have taken so far have achieved nothing.  In fact, they have been a bit of a joke.  The Minister will have to accept that.  I am interested to hear him say that he will take legal action if all other actions fail.  From his reply I understand him to have said that the Attorney General has been considering this matter since early 1988, which is over a year now.  Has the Minister clearcut information, or a decision from the Attorney General, as to what way he could proceed in court to have these matters redressed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The definite answer to that question is no.  We would have only one shot in the context of a court case and it does require very considerable examination. We are not in a position to take that course of action at this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOMalley" hpid="Mr. P. O'Malley Mr. P. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Why is it that on a similar issue Luxembourg was able to take action against France in the Cattenom case under Articles 37 and 38 of the EURATOM Treaty?  Why can we not use those Articles to pursue the British authorities into bringing their nuclear industry into a condition that would be acceptable to us in terms of safety?  We also have available to us court action at the International Court of Justice in The Hague on an established international principle that one State cannot do something that will be injurious to another State within its jurisdiction.  Why do we not take action under that heading, or <Col N="670" /> under Articles 37 and 38 of the EURATOM Treaty?</P>

      <P>Is it not the case that the former Minister stated quite clearly that if there was not progress by the British on their Magnox reactors and on their discharges he would take legal action?  Does the Minister consider as he now seems to be suggesting, that such a statement was premature because they had not explored what such legal action meant?

      <P>asked the Minister for Energy if he has any plans to change the licensing terms for mineral exploration in order that the terms of any subsequent mining lease could be agreed in advance; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It is long established Government policy to settle lease terms on an individual mine basis by reference to the particular physical features of the deposit concerned and to an assessment of projected profitability.  The existing system is one of flexibility which affords the opportunity of mining companies to negotiate fair and reasonable mine development terms with the State on a basis specific to each new mine.</P>
      <P>In the current buoyant state of minerals exploration activity I do not propose to introduce standard pre-defined lease terms for new finds but I will keep the matter under periodic review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOMalley" hpid="Mr. P. O'Malley Mr. P. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The position at the moment, as I understand it, is that the terms of mining leases are not agreed with mining companies until after they have completed their exploration activities. Unlike the oil terms introduced in September 1987 whereby an oil exploration company know exactly what they will be involved in with the State <i>vis-à-vis</i> participation, royalties and the tax regime, does the Minister consider that <Col N="681" /> it would be right for a mining company to know the terms of an ultimate mining lease that might be granted when it is at the stage of taking out an exploration licence?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that but if you set terms in advance without having any real knowledge as to what the find or discovery might be, very often, as the Deputy will appreciate, you would have to set your terms too low from a State point of view to encourage the exploration in the first place.  There can be a yawning gap in the terms available in different cases but the practice has been to concentrate on what is considered to be the best approach at the time of the granting of a mining lease.  Even though I have only been in the Department a short time I am quite satisfied, on the basis of current information, that this is the best approach to adopt.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Going on the experience of recent years when the number of applications for exploration licences has been very much greater than in early years, it would appear that the system does not act as a deterent.  Should the position change and I am convinced that a review is necessary I will have such a review undertaken immediately.  However it appears that there is no need for such a review at present.  In fact there is every good and sound reason why it should remain the same.</P>

      <P>Deputies will be aware that I recently met ESB senior management when I raised the handling by the ESB of the disposal of asbetos waste at Portarlington. I expressed my concern at the apparently serious lapse in the very high standards expected of the ESB.  I asked the ESB what steps they now intend to take to strengthen controls to avoid a recurrence of this type of incident and I have been assured that the disposal of asbestos waste by the ESB will in future conform to the highest international standards.

    <Title>Shannon Free Airport Development Company Limited (Amendment) Bill 1988: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill proposes to extend the responsibilities of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company to include the north Kerry area.  I welcome the inclusion of this area in the mid-west region, as it forms a natural part of that region.  There also have been close links between the counties of Kerry, Clare and Limerick in the agricultural sector for many years.  Since the establishment of the Tarbert-Killimer ferry there have been close links between the Counties of Kerry and Clare.  Therefore, I welcome the inclusion of the north Kerry area into the mid-west region. Having said that I am concerned that no provision has been made in the Bill for the making available of additional finance to SFADCo so as to enable them to fulfil their responsibilities in respect of this area.  It appears that SFADCo would be expected to carry out these additional duties on the same budget despite the fact that they would have responsibility for an area which has a considerable industrial, agricultural and tourism capacity.  I hope the Minister responding to this debate will indicate how he expects SFADCo to extend their budget, to work a miracle and provide a service to an area for which no additional moneys are being delivered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am somewhat puzzled by the overall Government strategy on the mid-west region.  As previous speakers have said, <Col N="703" /> the mid-west region is a very natural geographic unit.  All the counties surrounding the Shannon Estuary &mdash; Clare, Limerick, North Tipperary and Kerry &mdash; focus on the estuary.  At this stage it would do this House good to examine what is going on in that area and around the estuary and which development agencies have responsibility for the development of the mid-west region.</P>
    <P>Many people in mid-west are extremely perplexed by the bureaucracy that is being laid on layer by layer. Deputy O'Malley said in his address to the House that we are talking about another Bill coming before the House this evening &mdash; the Harbours (Shannon Estuary Development Corporation) Bill concerning another development corporation. It is not clear exactly what they are supposed to be doing.  There is an overlapping of responsibilities and areas of jurisdiction and control.</P>
    <P>At the beginning of 1988 the present Government thought fit to give responsibility to SFADCo for tourism and for large industry.  That process in effect eliminated the IDA and Bord Fáilte from the mid-west region, but let us examine the situation closely.  From various discussions I have had with representatives of these various agencies, it seems that SFADCo's responsibility for tourism in the mid-west region is primarily for the product within the region and the promotion of the product within that region, but the responsibility for the overseas promotion for that region lies with Bord Fáilte.  If you speak to Bord Fáilte you will get a contrary view &mdash; they say they have no responsibility for tourism promotion in the mid-west.</P>
    <P>As a result, the tourist industry in the mid-west are extremely concerned that one of the most effective regional tourism boards in the country, Shannonside, were disbanded and scrapped and semi-incorporated into the structure of SFADCo. SFADCo have done a good job promoting their own tourist product in years gone by &mdash; the various castles they developed as banquet centres and the <Col N="704" /> folk park in Bunratty &mdash; and they operated a very effective tourist attraction in the region.  They are now expected to involve themselves in the broader promotion of tourism.  A year on, there is still total confusion in the mid-west and within Board Fáilte and SFADCo as to what the respective bodies are about and what their various responsibilities are.</P>
    <P>My concern and the concern of the people involved in tourism in the mid-west region is that we will be the losers in the long run, particularly in overseas tourism promotion.  I hope the Minister will be able to clear that aspect of SFADCo's responsibility once and for all before this debate is completed.  As everybody knows, tourism is a major employer and one of the biggest industries in the mid-west region.  We are talking about an extremely attractive tourist region in County Clare, Limerick, North Tipperary and parts of south Offaly. Again there is confusion.  I am not clear from the Minister's speech or from the Bill whether this Bill is giving SFADCo responsibility for tourism in north Kerry. As I read it, it does not and the Minister's speech does not suggest SFADCo are getting responsibility for tourism development in north Kerry either. Maybe we could have clarification on that point.</P>
    <P>The Government introduced regionalisation in their announcement of seven regions.  Because by its very nature the mid-west region is very much a natural region and has been bureaucratically administered for quite a number of years under the auspices of SFADCo.  In one sense we are very fortunate to have a structure in place in SFADCo, but we need clarification on many of the issues that arise.</P>
    <P>This Bill proposes that responsibility be given for industrial development in north Kerry to SFADCo.  Last year the Government gave responsibility for all industries in the mid-west region to SFADCo, thus excluding the IDA from the mid-west region.  A great deal of concern was expressed about that at the time, and people are still quite concerned, but not because SFADCo as a body would <Col N="705" /> not be able to do the job.  SFADCo have done a very good job in the mid-west and they should be congratulated for the way they developed the Shannon Industrial estate.  They have been particularly successful there and they were particularly successful in the development of small industries surrounding the industrial estate and providing ancillary services in the smaller industrial areas to the larger centres in Shannon.</P>
    <P>Regarding overall major industry in the rest of the region, let me be parochial and talk about County Clare.  One has to question the effectiveness of SFADCo in the peripheral areas of the mid-west region.  In the peripheral areas of County Clare, areas outside the Ennis-Shannon-Limerick axis, there is a great deal left to be desired.  In the entire periphery of County Clare &mdash; Kilrush to Lahinch to Ballyvaughan over to Tulla, Scarriff and down to Killaloe &mdash; very little in the line of new jobs has been created in recent times.  The Minister and his predecessor have on many occasions gone public with fantastic figures in relation to the jobs sanctioned, but on closer examination one will find that the number of jobs on the ground and the number of jobs sanctioned vary enormously.  The number of jobs cleared by SFADCo and the number of jobs eventually created leave much to be desired.  We are told that jobs will be phased in over three, four or five years, but at the end of that time nothing like the number of jobs projected have been created and in some cases there is a stalemate.</P>
    <P>Recently I decided to do a spot check. An announcement was made that 65 new jobs were created in a certain factory. These figures were part of an overall figure presented by the Minister of jobs created in the region.  In real terms, on the floor of that factory ten jobs were created, but the official figure was 65 jobs. That is just one instance of the propaganda that is emanating from this Government.  Recently officials from SFADCo and Clare County Council were unable to announce where the jobs they created were.  I do not blame them personally, although they must take some <Col N="706" /> responsibility for it.  They were unable to say where on the periphery of County Clare any additional jobs had been created. That is unfortunate.  It is more unfortunate that those with responsibility to the House saw fit to go public and produce bogus figures in an effort to con the people into believing that jobs were being created when, in effect, they were not.  If one compares the number of jobs supposedly created with the number of redundancies one will see how difficult the argument becomes.</P>
    <P>We have been told that last year 73,000 people emigrated.  I have no doubt that a substantial number of that figure left the midwest region, and County Clare in particular.  In one week alone in a parish not too far away from my home 22 people between the ages of 18 and 23 emigrated. Such occurrences are quite common in rural Ireland.  I do not think the Government are facing up to the problem of emigration.  The legislation before us will not co-ordinate the work in that region. The Government have divided the country into seven regions for the purpose of gaining from the EC Structural Funds. The Shannon region is an ideal model for the rest of the country but the Government have not given any thought to it. Fianna Fáil Ministers, when in Opposition, complained about layers of bureaucracy being created but they appear to be very anxious now to add further layers of bureaucracy to the system.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that where different State agencies are competing in a region the attitude of divide and conquer will prevail thus weakening existing structures. That is unfortunate and it is happening in our region.  Deputy O'Malley drew our attention to advertisements in industrial magazines circulating in North America which were inserted by the IDA and show a map of Ireland with two areas blanked out, Northern Ireland, for which we do not have any industrial responsibility, and the midwest region.  Magazines containing those damaging advertisements have been circulating in North America in the last two years.  It is <Col N="707" /> time that the Government insisted on them being withdrawn.</P>
    <P>It appears that the IDA and SFADCo are competing for industries abroad. While there is that type of competition we do not have much hope of attracting industries here.  Other countries with more resources at their disposal and more political clout are competing with us on the world market for industries while we have two agencies fighting against each other.  There is a duty on the Government to clear this up.  There is no doubt that in the long term competition between the IDA and SFADCo will be to the detriment of the midwest region.  I wonder if north Kerry will benefit from the decision to incorporate it in the SFADCo region.</P>
    <P>I should like to compliment SFADCo on the tremendous preparatory work they carried out in an effort to establish a financial services centre at Shannon. That work was carried out at the request of the last Government and many commitments were received from interested clients to set up business in such a centre. However, when Fianna Fáil took office there was an announcement that a financial services centre would be established in Dublin and that it would receive full Government backing.  The Government have betrayed Shannon and SFADCo. Their action was despicable particularly when one considers the location of Shannon. Some of our finest education institutions are located between Galway and Limerick.  It is unfortunate that the Government denied Shannon the opportunity to establish such a centre.</P>
    <P>A more serious problem has arisen in recent times and I hope the Minister is in a position to give us details in regard to it when replying.  What is the position in regard to the promotion of traffic through Shannon Airport?  Originally SFADCo was established to promote greater use of Shannon Airport but it appears that the Government have agreed to permit trans-Atlantic flights to Knock Airport direct.  Are they doing a con job on Shannon by saying that such flights going through Iceland is an inter-European <Col N="708" /> affair and not trans-Atlantic?  The Government should come clean on this. I do not see much hope for Shannon in the future if the Government continue along that course.  I am concerned about the future status of Shannon Airport as the sole trans-Atlantic airport in Irealnd. If that status is taken from Shannon it will be the beginning of the demise of the region.  It is not sufficient to say that Iceland is a signatory of the European Aviation Convention.  The people of Clare and the midwest want a positive answer from the Government on that question.</P>
    <P>The Government should give urgent consideration to the expiry of the tax concessions for the tax-free zone in Shannon in 1990.  I have been urging the Government to clarify the position in the interests of industries in that area but they have failed to do so.  Many companies are concerned about their future. It is important that companies are made aware of the tax conditions well in advance of the expiry date so that they can take them into account in their forward planning programmes.  Industries must plan in advance if they are to survive. If the Government do not outline their proposals in regard to the tax free zone at Shannon shortly I am afraid that a number of industries will move from Shannon and, perhaps, leave the country. I should like to ask the Minister to press the Government for a decision on that.</P>
    <P>SFADCo have done a good job in the Shannon industrial zone and have been reasonably successful in the small industries area.  However, the people in the peripheral areas of the region are not happy with what is taking place there. North Kerry will now come within the remit of SFADCo, with a highly developed food industry, many tourist facilities and many companies located there, the extent of which the Minister outlined in the course of his remarks today.  In recent years SFADCo have been attempting to become more involved in the development of the food processing industry. Despite their attempts on numerous occasions to attract people and companies into the <Col N="709" /> food processing industry in the mid-west they have not been very successful to date.  Are the Minister and the Department of Industry and Commerce prepared to give SFADCo any additional assistance in this respect?  Despite the fact that the area is largely agricultural, it does afford room for development.  It warrants more than attention from the region; perhaps an extra boost from the Department of Industry and Commerce is needed.  The Department of Industry and Commerce should devote attention to marketing, research into the types of projects saleable abroad and the development of food processing.  The region has potential but, for one reason or another, has not seemed to have grasped the opportunity.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that in 1988 SFADCo set themselves an ambitious job creation target of 2,000 new jobs in the mid-west region.  He continued to say:</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that that target was comfortably exceeded and that the actual outturn for the year was 2,817 new jobs.</P>
    <P>The reality is that those are not real jobs on the ground in the mid-west.  SFADCo may have sanctioned jobs but they are not available on the ground.  I challenge the Minister to say exactly where such jobs are to be found, to state how many people are employed throughout the mid-west region in order to substantiate that figure.  This game of engaging in figures concerns me.  For example, again in the course of the Minister's remarks, there was reference to 25 new projects having been approved for the region during 1988 and 17 industrial expansions having been approved in the same year.  One can justify one's existence by playing around with figures but what is needed are jobs on the ground.  There is a tendency in bureaucratic institutions to justify one's existence by throwing around such figures, contending that is all that is required.  However, to the public at large, the taxpayer, the unemployed person, the young student or person boarding a 'plane at Shannon such figures wear very <Col N="710" /> thin, knowing there are no jobs to be found on the ground.  It is unfortunate that people continue to use these bogus figures.</P>
    <P>In turn this inevitably leads to another Minister coming into the House and giving the increased numbers of travellers through airports and seaports in justification of increased tourism facilities. When such figures are analysed one discovers that they represent additional people emigrating.  Their relatives travel abroad to visit them because many of their sons, daughters, sisters and brothers are abroad illegally and cannot afford to return.  These figures are being used in a most unfair, callous manner.</P>
    <P>This Bill will mean that the north Kerry region will now be encompassed within the mid-west.  I do not know how fortunate that will be for the north Kerry region.  I can be quite emphatic that what is needed in the mid-west region is more jobs on the ground and fewer layers of bureaucracy.  I would ask the Minister for Tourism and Transport and the Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce &mdash; with responsibility for marketing &mdash; present, who expounds some very sound views at times &mdash; seriously to consider the various layers of bureaucracy obtaining in the mid-west. One must realise that the provisions of this Bill involve SFADCo, the IDA and Bord Fáilte being eliminated and henceforth, the IDA and Bord Fáilte being in competition abroad with SFADCo in attracting industrialists and tourists to the region.  It must be realised that one is talking about another layer of bureaucracy being created under the provisions of the Harbours (Shannon Estuary Development Corporation) Bill, 1988 stipulating similar responsibilities to those contained in this Bill.  This will mean there will be a range of competing agencies, which does not augur well for the future.  I predict that this will lead to internal jealousies between the personnel of the various agencies involved, one endeavouring to out-manoeuvre the other.  In addition, there will be competition between the various Government Departments, senior civil servants <Col N="711" /> and their responsibilities for the region. I predict that the overall effect will be a loss of industrial development and tourism in the region.  While these Bills provide a framework, they also carry an inherent danger which is something the Minister should address urgently.</P>
    <P>We regularly appear to have some legislative provision with regard to SFADCo before the House.  The Harbours (Shannon Estuary Development Corporation) Bill, 1988 will provide an opportunity to devolve responsibility on SFADCo for the overall development of the estuary.  I would ask the Minister to discuss this prospect with his colleague, the Minister for the Marine to ascertain how the whole operation can be rationalised with one development agency being responsible for the entire region.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister, in replying, will address these questions which are being continually addressed by the people of the region.  Indeed, people are expressing concern about the future of the region being dependent on the Government decision to be taken on this issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. G. FitzGerald Dr. G. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. G. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am anxious to contribute briefly to this debate as someone who, 30 years ago, was a part-time executive of SFADCo and who has followed the developments of the company since then with great interest.  Also, although it will not be relevant to anything I say in this debate, I must declare my interest as a director of a company which is a Shannon company.  However, I will not be dealing with that aspect in the course of my remarks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The impact SFADCo have had over that period in the mid-west has not been insignificant.  Even at the time when they were responsible only for the development of the airport itself there were certain overflow effects &mdash; perhaps not as great in the last ten years &mdash; in terms of industries developing in the hinterland of Shannon, in areas like Ennis.  As Deputy Taylor-Quinn has said the impact on the hinterland has been less in recent times than it was then, but it did have that effect even when SFADCo was not <Col N="712" /> responsible for anything beyond the airport itself.</P>
    <P>The extension of their functions beyond the airport to the mid-west was a good decision.  The effect of it has been such as to justify consideration of a similar procedure in relation to other areas. I have favoured all along the development of similar structures in other regions.  What is being done today in terms of extending their responsibility to north Kerry and perhaps some other marginal areas is a useful step as, on any reasonable basis of developing a regional structure in Ireland, the hinterland of Shannon and Limerick extends to north Kerry as well as, of course, to Clare, North Tipperary and, as is provided in the Bill, also to south Offaly.  The question that arises and which should be addressed in the context of Second Stage of this Bill is whether what is being done here in terms of making SFADCo the regional development organisation for a coherent region, fleshed out to a full genuine hinterland area, should not be repeated elsewhere in the country.</P>
    <P>On the question of regional authorities there have been hesitations about such a development for several reasons.  One has been an understandable reluctance to see a proliferation of bodies, even bodies which have justified themselves in the pilot case and I would regard Shannon as a pilot case; secondly since our admission to the European Community and adherence to the Rome Treaty, there has been a further argument that the development of a sub-regional structure might, as was felt at the time of our entry and shortly afterwards, prejudice in some way the possibility of our securing and maintaining an adequate share of the Regional Fund.  That argument was put quite strongly at the time and it had validity because the original share out of the Regional Fund as it was constituted in 1973-74 was based in an extremely crude way on the population of the areas included.  The proposals put forward by Commissioner Thompson at the time, which seemed to be designed to secure maximum benefit for the United Kingdom and in particular for Scotland, <Col N="713" /> were couched in a form which made the population content of a region a crucial factor.  Had sub regions been created and had we put forward a claim for four regions in the country like the four Euro constituencies it is possible that, depending on the criterion chosen, Dublin might have been outside that criterion and the total take from the fund would have been less.  There was therefore a strong argument for working on the basis of a single region at the time.</P>
    <P>It has been argued until quite recently on a different basis that the new structure of the fund is such that, because of the way it will be furnished to us in relation to actual projects, if the country was broken down into regions perhaps projects in Dublin might not benefit.  For these reasons there has been a strong tendency to oppose the development of regional structures.  Those arguments are no longer valid.  The first argument ceased to be valid once the fund was settled in its original form in 1973-74.  The other argument that the fund might develop in a different way &mdash; quite apart from the population basis of distribution the fund might actually be applied to new projects instead of being simply a transfer of money based on a list of things being done anyway &mdash; and that any attempt to break down the country into different regions might lead to the exclusion of Dublin from it never had much validity but perhaps there was some reason for that fear.  The fact that that matter is now in the process of being resolved means that argument does not apply either.</P>
    <P>However, it is time to look again at the role of SFADCo and the manner in which the company operate and to consider seriously whether, if they have been successful in that region &mdash; to an extent that is so &mdash; we should not seek to replicate them elsewhere.  The argument about proliferation of bodies is of course a strong one but I do not know if it holds up in this instance.  If SFADCo in an individual case have proved worthwhile despite some problems of overlapping of functions to which Deputy Madeline Taylor-Quinn has made some reference, it is difficult to see why proliferation is a <Col N="714" /> ground for not having such bodies elsewhere. Either they are an example of an undesirable proliferation in which case we should get rid of them or if that is not the case &mdash; I think it is not &mdash; and we accept they are doing a useful job, unless there is some compelling argument that no-one has ever produced the argument for having similar bodies elsewhere is very strong and this ought to be considered.</P>
    <P>As can be seen in this area it is possible, through a company of this kind who have a local identity and a local role, to develop an area in a coherent way and to provide a focus and a means for development which is quite different from and much more effective than that provided by normal local authorities.  Local authorities, for several reasons, in the Irish context are not in a position to do what SFADCo have done.  First of all, there are far too many of them and the county is too small a unit for this purpose.  The sub-county bodies, district councils and so on, have their own job to do.  It is very important that they should be maintained and perhaps more of them created to develop areas which have not got a sufficient structure but they are not on a scale nor are they equipped to undertake the regional development functions. Quite apart from their numbers and their small size and scale their actual structure is not developmental.  We have talked for many years about making them developmental and about removing the inhibitions to their carrying out developmental functions but that has not even been done at local level.  They are certainly not capable in their present form, or any form we can envisage for some time to come, of carrying out this function at a regional level.</P>
    <P>By contract SFADCo have carried out this function.  By common agreement, whatever individual criticisms there may be on particular points, people who live in that region feel there is a benefit from the existence of SFADCo.  Sometimes they may feel that the way in which they have been constrained or the way they have been interacted with or overlapped with by other bodies may have limited <Col N="715" /> their capacity to be as beneficial to the region as might be desirable.  Deputy Quinn has suggested that that may be the case.  Nonetheless, I do not think anybody in the region would feel that the company should be done away with.  The feeling that they are a valuable body with an important developmental role is general and therefore there is a strong case for considering, if they are successful, their replication elsewhere.</P>
    <P>As to how many such bodies there should be and what areas they would cover, one could argue that for ever and I have no intention of getting involved in that area.  I simply want to make the point that this Bill is before us because the Government feel that SFADCo are doing a useful enough job for it to be worthwhile extending their functions to new areas like north Kerry.  If that is the case why should north Kerry have the benefit of such a body and south Kerry not have it or why should one part of Tipperary have the benefit of it and another part not have it?  If this is the right kind of body for the development of this region, in the absence of any argument to the contrary &mdash; I have never heard any argument to the contrary arising from the experience of SFADCo &mdash; the case for considering an extension of this concept to other areas should be looked at.</P>
    <P>In any event we ought to look, in the context of such thinking, at the whole question of the structure of regions and the overlapping of regions.  Having different regions for different purposes makes no sense whatever.  We should once and for all decide what regions we want. There is virtually no reason why they should be different.  Of course there might be a case for a health board region being a slightly different shape from a tourist board region because there might be a hospital at the fringe of it and therefore it should be included in the region. You could always argue for one shape of a region against another for a particular purpose but the utility of having a specific structure of regions for all purposes is so great that those arguments do not stand against that.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="716" /> It is time the Government faced this issue.  It has come up in a very acute form because of the question of the Structural Funds.  It is obvious that the present arrangement under which the preparation of proposals for this matter is carried out centrally by the Department of Finance, with a very limited input from the regions, is unsatisfactory.  I can see that with the existing structure it would have been perhaps difficult to allow for such an input without complications of one kind of other.  I can understand arguments of quite a cogent kind being put forward by the Department of Finance stating; &ldquo;Leave it to us because if you bring in the other bodies there will be a frightful mess there will be an endless number of urban district councils, county councils and so on who will all want more for themselves and there will be no coherent overall view&rdquo;.  I do not think that argument is strong enough to water down this regional element in the input into the structural plans to the extent that has been done.  That is a matter of particular debate and is not appropriate to this question. The fact that we have had to present our case in this way and prepare it nationally in the Department of Finance because we had not got a regional stucture is a powerful reason for having such a structure.</P>
    <P>The existence of SFADCo and the work they have done over more than 30 years demonstrates the kind of structure that can work well.  No radical change has been made in the structure over that period.  A radical change has been made in the area of their competence and the region they serve but not in the structure of the organisation itself.  The fact that successive governments have felt that no radical change was needed suggests very strongly that it is a good structure.  It is a body which could have been changed easily.  I do not say the argument that Governments do not do something is an argument that nothing ought to be done. Governments suffer from inertia and governments faced with existing structures whether it is county councils or whatever may be very reluctant to make a change.  Where there are bodies like <Col N="717" /> SFADCo where the structure could be changed without any great difficulty or any great controversy the fact that it has not been changed does suggest that it has worked pretty well.  If it has worked well there and if, as I suggest, similar structures are necessary nationally, then the question of extending this type of concept to other areas ought to be considered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the many Deputies who contributed so forthrightly and excellently to this debate today.  As has already been indicated, the primary purpose of the legislation is to enable the mid west region and more particularly the Shannon estuary area, to be developed as an integrated whole.  It is clear that the estuary area is a primary natural resource with potential for the siting of major manufacturing industries requiring maritime locations.  The area is capable of accommodating heavy industries such as oil refining, steel melting, pharmaceutical and chemical projects.  I am happy that the area could meet the infrastructural and service requirements of such industry without any difficulty.  I want to have a quick look at the various points made by Deputies.  The region will receive added stimulus from the doubling of the EC Structural Funds which is due to occur over the next five years.  In the plan which is being drawn up for the mid-west region the target focus will be on knowledge-based enterprise, resource-based enterprise and the environmental supports necessary for development.  I should remind the House that a four-pronged approach is being adopted.  Strategies for industry, tourism, rural development and for environmental considerations are being pursued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to north Kerry specifically SFADCo's immediate plan is to establish a county development centre in Tralee to be staffed by three executives.  The role of these executives will be to accelerate the flow of entrepreneurs into the very small firm sectors of manufacturing industry, to support the creation and <Col N="718" /> maintenance of viable jobs in the domestically traded sector of small industry, to promote the establishment of a number of sharply focussed and, I hope, highly visible new tourist products, to develop a number of new projects in the natural resources area based on local raw materials and skills, to improve the urban and rural environment through promoting and participating in specific renewal projects and to develop a cohesive county development plan.  They are the broad tasks of the new team for SFADCo in the north Kerry region.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lowry spoke of his proposals to establish a number of regional development bodies throughout the country on similar lines to SFADCo.  This is a more general issue than the subject matter of today's Bill.  Obviously any such decision or strategy would have to be carefully considered because of the very complex if not overlapping nature of that direction.  We would have to be very careful about rushing into that kind of structure.</P>
    <P>The Shannon mid-west area is unique given the estuary and the well established position of SFADCo.  As Deputies are aware, the company has been operating the new remit only since the beginning of 1988.  It would be very important to assess the company's performance and experience before we take decisions on any further regional development bodies.</P>
    <P>In his contribution Deputy Lowry welcomed the Bill and I appreciate his support for it.  I agree with him that the region has many advantages and has great potential.  Most Deputies referred to that fact.  It is clear that they are extremely proud of the region and are well aware of its many advantages.  SFADCo will be working over the next few years to promote the overall economic development of the area which will be supported through the use of the EC Structural Funds.  The board of SFADCo are particularly conscious of the need to promote the peripheral areas of the region.  That was one of the concerns of Deputy Lowry.  SFADCo are also well aware of Deputy Lowry's concern in relation to <Col N="719" /> Tipperary and I have no doubt they will take note of his comments in that regard.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lowry also spoke of the necessity to have a submission from Shannon for Structural Funds lodged immediately. I should like to inform the Deputy that all the sub-regional plans dealing with operational programmes will be submitted by the Government together with the national plan in relation to the expanded Structural Funds.  We propose to lodge the operational programmes at the same time as the national plan, although strictly speaking it is not necessary for us to submit them at the same time as the national plan.  Nevertheless, the Government have decided that the operational programmes should be prepared in order to maximise our uptake of moneys from the fund.  These programmes are now being finalised and it is the Government's intention to submit them at the same time as the national plan by the end of March 1989.  We are well within that target.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lowry referred to the problem of resources for SFADCo.  As part of the extension of SFADCo's remit to north Kerry, SFADCo will now control former IDA lands and factories in north Kerry. As a result of this the company will gain additional income of about £60,000 per year.  He was concerned about tightening resources while giving SFADCo additional work.  I do not think he should be unduly concerned about that.  The net reduction in SFADCo's budget in 1989 over 1988 on the operating administrative expenses side was 4 per cent.  In previous years SFADCo did extremely well while most other agencies were looking at deeper cutbacks.  I do not accept that SFADCo are short of resources in any way to carry out either their existing work or the new work which is being requested of them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cullen spoke of the necessity to avoid overlap or duplication of State agencies.  This is something that all of us would want to avoid.  I would inform the Deputy that Córas Tráchtála operate in the mid-west region on the same basis as in every other region.  That work is not <Col N="720" /> undertaken for them by any other agency.  The relationship between the IDA and SFADCo is a matter that came up.  There are clear demarcation lines and these have been agreed between SFADCo and the IDA in relation to operational activities.  It is important to say that both the IDA and SFADCo have got together and worked out their operational lines of control.  If we are tripping over ourselves in this House about the matter &mdash; I do not think we are but from listening to some Deputies today I would have got that impression &mdash; I can assure the House that SFADCo and the IDA are not finding any difficulty in their day-to-day operations.  They are working very closely together.</P>

      <P>If there is any place in the world where the Deputies feel SFADCo can make more use of IDA's facilities I will certainly draw it to their attention.  The day-to-day co-operation is working well.  Bord Fáilte will continue to retain responsibility for promoting Ireland overseas and for inspection and registration of tourist accommodation. Deputy Taylor-Quinn inquired about the tourist remit of SFADCo in north Kerry. SFADCo will assume responsibility for visitor information services, product development and promotion of north Kerry in the domestic market.  However, in order to avoid the overlap which the Deputies are concerned about, Bord Fáilte will continue to promote Ireland overseas.  The agencies have worked out <Col N="721" /> their day-to-day operating arrangements and I have had no formal information from SFADCo or the IDA to suggest that they are unhappy with these relationships.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kemmy raised the question of the potential for the food industry in the expanded mid-west region.  I agree with him that there is substantial and increasing scope for developing the food industry in that area.  Other Deputies also raised this point.  For example, I hope to see links being explored between Kerry Co-Op Plc and SFADCo's pilot food development programme in the Raheen Road Centre in Limerick.  I think Deputy Deenihan also mentioned that facility and I join with him in reminding the public that this is an excellent facility, comprising of modern factory units, and is designed to meet the highest international standards.  A link up of the Kerry Co-Op with this excellent research and development facility would be very useful, and I urge that we move in that direction.</P>
      <P>I thank Deputy Deenihan for his very generous welcome for the Bill and compliment him on his work in this area in the past.  He has taken a very positive attitude.  Mind you, he did list all the advantages of north Kerry, except perhaps a long list of All Ireland medals that are in the region.  Deputy Deenihan also asked for a SFADCo presence in Listowel as well as in Tralee, and he wanted the tourist offices in the area upgraded.  I will certainly bring Deputy Deenihan's views to the attention of the company.  As far as Counties Offaly and Tipperary are concerned, there is one regional office in each of these counties and I have already spoken about the placing of an office in Tralee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Carey referred to the cost per job.  There is an official measure of cost per job sustained, and this is calculated by referring new jobs created and still in existence during the period 1980-87 to all grants paid over a similar period.  The cost per job was £26,483 for Shannon free zone companies.  The IDA's figure for medium and large industries is £25,111. In the case of small industries the cost <Col N="722" /> per job for SFADCo is £6,552 and the corresponding IDA figure is £11,129.</P>
    <P>Deputy Carey asked about the legislation regarding the percentage tax rate for international financial services centres. I presume that the Deputy is referring to legislation promised to give effect to the EC Directive on UCITS.  Regulations are now being prepared to give effect to this directive which as Deputies know, must be implemented before October, and this is being handled by the Department of Industry and Commerce. I want to make it clear, because this point has come up again and again in the debate, that the incentives applying to the financial services centre and Shannon are broadly the same.  Both apply a basic régime of 10 per cent tax for projects setting up in their areas.  Moreover, the Dublin financial services centre is confined to attracting only companies providing financial services as defined in the 1987 Finance Act.  In the case of Shannon, both manufacturing and service companies qualify for the 10 per cent tax rate, and of course Shannon can offer a 10 per cent tax rate for all services of an international nature.</P>
    <P>Virtually every Deputy who spoke today raised this point and it is important that I reiterate the Government's policy to ensure that Shannon is not placed at any competitive disadvantage, <i>vis-à-vis</i> the new financial services centre, for promoting financial services projects.  The Government's commitment to Shannon remains as strong as it always has been.</P>
    <P>Deputy Carey referred to the need to reduce staffing.  Perhaps I am being unfair to him but I understood him to feel strongly about what he regarded as excess staff in SFADCo.  If I misunderstood, I am sure he will understand.  However, the figures show that staffing levels have been reduced as follows, notwithstanding additional functions &mdash; at the end of 1986 225 to the present level of 204.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deenihan and Deputy O'Malley went into some detail about the Ballylongford site.  As part of the decision to give responsibility for north Kerry to SFADCo, all IDA lands and factories in <Col N="723" /> the area will be transferred to SFADCo. The Ballylongford site, which is over 604 acres, will now transfer to SFADCo and it will be up to SFADCo to decide what to do with those lands.  I should tell the House that contrary to what has been said by Deputy O'Malley, I understand they intend keeping it.  The IDA originally put up for sale 500 of the 604 acres, and I understand they intended to retain the best site of over 100 acres.  They believed this was enough to accommodate two petro-chemical refinery developments.  I am glad to have this opportunity to clear up this point.</P>
    <P>Deputy Taylor-Quinn and other Deputies referred to the tax position post-1990.  The Government have already secured the agreement of the EC Commission for service companies operating in the Shannon free zone which are currently zero tax rated to transfer to the 10 per cent rate in 1990.  There is a difficulty for service companies employing more than 50 people, as the agreement of the EC Commission is at present restricted to companies employing fewer than 50 people.  While this affects a very small number of companies, I accept that it has a strategic effect on a number of significant companies.  The Government are very much aware of this problem and we are exploring possible solutions with the Commission.  I thank the Deputies for raising this matter and I fully understand their concern.  The Government fully understand the problem and are exploring possible solutions.  Deputies will be aware that this is a complex area and not given to ready solutions.</P>
    <P>Deputy Taylor-Quinn questioned the validity of the figure of 2,817 jobs announced by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy R. Burke, as being the outturn for the mid-west region in 1988.  I understand that Deputy Taylor-Quinn complimented SFADCo on their peformance and stood behind their work. These figures came from them.  I take it that they are equally good at figures as they are at providing the other services which the Deputy lauds.</P>

      <P>SFADCo's figures are based on the results of a detailed survey undertaken by telephone at the end of 1988.  The figure of 2,817 does not refer to jobs promised but specifically to jobs actually on the ground.  SFADCo executives picked up the telephone, conducted a survey with firms in the region at the end of 1988, and when they did their sums it came to 2,817.  After jobs lost were taken into account there was a net addition of 1,000 industrial jobs in the region in 1988.  If the Deputy has any further concern about those figures I will explain them, but I reject completely the Deputy's suggestion that the figures are bogus.  They were arrived at quite reputably. On reflection the Deputy might not apply that terminology to those figures.</P>

This is not a matter for the Department of Industry and Commerce but I will refer her concern and that of other Deputies to the Minister for Tourism and Transport, who will no doubt deal with it when he has an opportunity to do so.  The Deputy need have no fear about the future of Shannon Airport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley castigated the <Col N="725" /> Government and the Bill.  The Government were castigated for not having a major industrial debate arising from this Bill and for not addressing major issues of industrial policy.  We cannot have a major industrial policy debate when all we are trying to do is to include an area of north Kerry in the SFADCo region. We are not in any way reluctant to discuss industrial policy.  We have done so on many occasions in this House and will do so again.  Our industrial policy and strategy has been clearly set out by the Minister for Industry and Commerce and it is a pragmatic and sensible policy.</P>

      <P>North Kerry is being taken into the SFADCo region.  If Deputies feel that that should not be done they will say so.  Deputies have not said that. My point in responding to Deputy O'Malley is that there are other times for major debates on industrial policy.  This is a very specific Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley spoke about a crisis in State agencies.  I do not accept that there is a crisis.  The Deputy is right in that there is always a certain amount of rivalry between agencies.  No doubt many future Ministers will experience institutional rivalry.  There are two choices in relation to overlap, one either manages it or merges everything into a mega agency for everything, which does away with overlap in that one has a nice neat organisation which deals with everything. In this instance we chose to try to manage overlap.  I rebut the suggestion that there is any crisis of morale in State agencies. It might have been better had Deputy O'Malley said that there is intense competiton for international projects.  That has increased significantly over the past <Col N="726" /> number of years.  Many countries are vying for a small number of international projects.  The agencies find that in competing for these projects when they occasionally do not get what they have perhaps set their heart on, morale suffers but that is certainly not a crisis or anything near a crisis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I reject the suggestion that there is any crisis in State agencies. The agencies are working to a programme and they are getting results.  The agencies have to operate in the international environment.  They have to go after the the projects and they are quite good at that.  Ordinary day-to-day rivalries are sometimes not that unhealthy. Certainly rivalries in politics often means that the little extra competition can bring out the best in people.</P>

      <P>I rebut the suggestion made by Deputy Taylor-Quinn that the Government were betraying Shannon with the new financial centre.  The same arrangements are there and I reiterated the Government's commitment to the Shannon region and to the various concessions that we can have there on a practical basis.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mac Giolla worried about people leaving State agencies.  That is not objectionable as there are arrangments to ensure the proper handling of all proposals for financial assistance from the IDA.  All proposals have to meet certain specified criteria set out in legislation and detailed guidelines laid down by the authority. Each proposal has to be approved by an independent board or a committee in the case of projects involving a significant amount of financial support requiring Government approval.</P>

      <P>I had made most of my points on the last day.  In general I welcome the Bill.  I am particularly glad of sections 12 and 13 which provide specific enforcement powers in relation to the general obligation established by sections 10 and 11, requiring the local authority to give special notification of specific remedial works to be undertaken by an individual.  That is extremely important.  In many cases local authorities did not have the clout to get that type of work done so that we had resultiong major dereliction.  The additional power also in relation to private dwellings is a welcome improvement.  Will the Minister outline exactly what he meant when he said that all remedial works would be exempted developments for planning purposes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="729" /> Section 13 gives the Minister power in relation to the proper enforcement of the Bill.  This provision must be welcomed particularly in cases where the local authorities fail to enforce sections of the Bill or to comply with the provisions in relation to their functions.  As I stated the last day, local authorities and statutory bodies are in many cases the worst offenders in not enforcing or complying with the legislation but are very active in insisting that other parties under their jurisdiction should comply with the legislation. I welcome this section.</P>
    <P>Section 14 gives the Minister power to require a statutory body to dispose of their interest in any derelict site.  This must be regarded as a welcome development. As everybody in this House knows local authorities own properties in very high amenity areas in towns and villages and particularly in the city of Dublin and by retaining those properties they increase the value of other properties and distort the current economic value of properties.  They are interfering with the whole nature of supply and demand and this is affecting the market forces.  I believe this section will be welcomed in particular by people in Dublin because property in Dublin is very valuable and depending on the area where a local authority have property it can affect the market value of the property of private individuals.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned the last day, the problem with this legislation is that it does not apply to any other Government Department. The Minister did not outline very satisfactorily in his speech the reasons this legislation will not apply to other Government Departments.  I believe it is very important that all Government Departments, State bodies and local authorities should be subject to this legislation. In his speech the Minister said this matter would be dealt with by consulting with his fellow Minister or, in the case of failure to sort it out with that Minister, he would bring it before the Cabinet.  I do not think this would be possible or desirable from a practical point of view. Government Departments own so much <Col N="730" /> property all over the country that if these issues became matters for discussion at the Cabinet table so much time would be spent on higgledy-piggledy discussions with regard to the different properties that the value of a Cabinet and what should be discussed at Cabinet level would be undermined.  The simple way of dealing with this matter is to ensure that all Ministers and Government Departments are subject to the legislation. Perhaps the Minister will consider this point either on Committee Stage or Report Stage because there is an impracticality involved there.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill deals with the derelict sites levy in relation to urban dereliction. This is an extremely welcome provision.  It is an important development and one that must be appreciated. However, the Minister could use the urban renewal scheme to far greater effect with regard to dereliction.  There are a number of applications in his Department at present seeking inclusion in the urban renewal scheme which to date have not been cleared.  This scheme could be extended to centre city areas and the centres of large rural towns and the Minister should at this stage put a greater impetus into the urban renewal scheme within the Department of the Environment and include more towns in the scheme.  I know that in my constituency Ennis has applied for inclusion in the urban renewal scheme but to date this application has not been cleared by the Department of the Environment.  The result is that major dereliction is taking place in certain parts of the town and people are not prepared to invest money in the development of properties in that area partly because they believe the town will be included in the scheme and partly because they believe that due to general dereliction it would not be economically viable to develop their property when other properties in the region are not being developed.  Great impetus should be given to the promotion of the urban renewal scheme and I hope the Minister will consider this proposal in conjunction with the Bill before the House because I believe one works hand in hand with the <Col N="731" /> other.  With an overall cohesive policy on urban development and renewal one could get rid of much of the dereliction which exists in the country.  Not alone that, but the attractiveness of cities and towns would be enhanced by getting rid of dereliction.  The attractiveness of cities and towns can be increased both from a tourism, investment and commercial point of view and character point of view. This is particularly desirable when one compares some of our cities with cities in Europe.  Many of our cities and towns have more history than their counterparts in Europe but when the cities are compared ours leave much to be desired. There is great room for improvement and it is possible to do this successfully but it needs a co-ordinated direction from the Department of the Environment.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that a developer will be able to tender a bond for five years of the levy instead of actually paying the levy and that the levy will be waived if the development is completed within five years.  I would urge caution in this area. It is important that this legislation is not used entirely by major developers and large contractors.  It is important that individuals would also be encouraged to develop their property and that the levy will not be used in a foolhardy way against private individuals.  I note that provision is made for the waiver of the levy by local authorities in cases of hardship.  This is an extremely important provision and must be highlighted.  While major developments and the coming together of major development companies are desirable the entire character of an area can be lost if there is no local involvement in a development.</P>
    <P>When I spoke on this matter previously, I referred to the reintroduction of the home improvements scheme.  This scheme would be important in relation to rural areas where old traditional homesteads could be retained.  I know the scheme has been done away with but it could be re-examined with a view to reintroducing it in order to retain some of the more traditional characteristics of houses in rural areas and towns.  If people <Col N="732" /> are forced under this legislation to get rid of derelict sites or to bring about improvements to their property, some encouragement should be given to them to bring back the old traditional type of shop fronts, old stone work and character that existed in our towns in the past.  That would be a valuable move.  I hope the Minister will seriously consider that aspect on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>This Bill is to a large extent a jar of smoke.  It applies only to derelict sites. Derelict sites do not mean what the average person thinks the expression means. Derelict sites as defined in section 4 of this Bill have the following meaning:</P>
      <P>In this section &ldquo;derelict site&rdquo; means any land (in this section referred to as &ldquo;the land in question&rdquo;) which detracts, or is likely to detract, to a material degree from the amenity, character or appearance of land in the neighbourhood of the land in question because of&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) the existence on the land in question of structures which are in a ruinous, derelict or dangerous condition, or</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="733" /> (b) the neglected, unsightly or objectionable condition of the land or any structures on the land in question, or</P>
    <P>(c) the presence, deposit or collection on the land in question of any litter, rubbish, debris or waste, except where the presence, deposit or collection of such litter, rubbish, debris or waste results from the exercise of a right conferred by statute or by common law.</P>
    <P>A derelict site does not consist of a nice, well regulated, well looked after flat area in the middle of a town or city.  This is the kernel of what is wrong with this Bill.  A derelict site as defined under section 4 does not include a perfectly well run, tarmacadamed parking lot.  Derelict sites do not include flat areas of undeveloped land in cities.  In order to be a derelict site, it must either have a neglected, unsightly or objectionable condition or, secondly, have on it ruinuous buildings in a derelict or dangerous condition.  If somebody buys up half of a street, levels it, makes it as clean as a billiard ball and keeps that site tidy, it is no derelict site as far as this Bill is concerned.  The sad fact about the Bill is that it does not deal with what are in many cases very serious problems.</P>
    <P>Car parking lots are proliferating in central Dublin which are not derelict sites within the meaning of the Bill.  What is obnoxious about them is that you can see from them the innards of neighbouring houses and the remains of walls which are not on the land in question.  What is derelict about these sites is that they are not developed.  In any particular street they mean that there is no structure, that there are no houses, or shops to complement other shops and houses in the neighbourhood</P>
    <P>If I knock down one side of Merrion Square and keep it in a perfect state, tarmacadamed and in use for car parking, that is not a derelict site.  The big problem with this Bill is that it does not address itself to curing what in many cases are very serious obstacles to orderly redevelopment of a city.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="734" /> This Bill is a tiny piece of gestural politics on the part of the Government and will not be successful.  The previous derelict sites code did not succeed.  I accept that the Minister is giving greater powers to and imposing more strict obligations on local authorities.  It goes one stage further than the simple rights the local authorities had under the old legislation. I do not believe for one moment that this measure, by itself, will have a dramatic effect on derelict sites.  The duties imposed on people not to let their lands go derelict will not have any effect. People will hold on to land in land banks or whatever and try to keep it tidy.  When somebody tries to prosecute them and serves a notice on them, they will say that they will tarmacadam the area, put a fence around it, do whatever is wanted. Nobody under this Bill is obliged to build anything on the site and that is the fundamental problem with the Bill.</P>
    <P>Notice served under section 7, with which it is an offence not to comply, cannot require somebody to build on, say, a site in an important urban thoroughfare, a building four storeys high to match the other buildings.  Nothing of that kind can be done.  It cannot redress the issue where somebody decides to knock down the three top storeys of a four storey building and have a one storey shop on the ground floor of a street like Capel Street or Camden Street in Dublin. This would make the street look horrible, like something out of a wartime film, but leaving it in that condition does not amount to having it derelict.  That is a totally wrong feature of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Another strange feature is the levy on derelict sites.  I am fully in favour of taxation on land as a resource.  I cannot imagine how, by removing the roof of a house or demolishing the structure, you can avoid local taxation, thus doing tremendous damage to the local community. I cannot see how there ever was any logic in that.  Rates based on a theoretical letting value should always have been charged on a penal multiple in respect of dereliction.  I do not think anybody would object to that procedure. The Minister here is providing that local <Col N="735" /> authorities are obliged to register every derelict site in this area, to put a market value beside it on the register and the Minister can then authorise a charge to be levied on those sites called a derelict sites levy, but the amount of that can multiply tenfold at the discretion of the Minister.  A 1 per cent site value tax could be quite serious if you own half of O'Connell Street; so would a 2 per cent site value tax.  But if the Minister can, by regulation, multiply the levy payable by ten, to 10 per cent of the annual value of the site, that is expropriation.  I am not against a penal rate of taxation in these cases &mdash; I want to make that clear &mdash; but on constitutional grounds I have grave doubts as to whether the courts will uphold the right of a Minister, at his choosing, to decide whether a tax can be levied at 1 per cent or 10 per cent of the value of property.  Is it constitutional for this House to delegate to a Minister and to the Executive the right to determine whether a tax is multiplied tenfold on a particular piece of land?  I would say that there is a doubt about that.  I am not suggesting that it is a cast iron constitutional case, but somebody who is badly hurt by it will undoubtedly argue that if the Minister charges 10 per cent in one area and 1 per cent in another area this is an unlawful delegation to the Executive of a power to impose a tax on the land.  It is not just a penalty, it is a levy.  The wording of section 24 is not that of a penal statute imposing a penalty for failing to do something.  It is in the form of a tax because it relates to the value of the land.  There is a strong case to be made for the proposition that if it is a taxation measure, even with specific social purposes in mind, it is not right for this House to give to a Minister the right to multiply a tax at his discretion without any control by this House.  Section 24(3) states:</P>
    <P>The amount of the derelict sites levy shall be a proportion of the market value of the urban land which shall be prescribed for each urban area, from time to time, by the Minister, but it <Col N="736" /> shall not exceed 10 per cent of the market value of the land.</P>
    <P>Is it really possible to provide that the Minister for the Environment can say that in Dublin the derelict sites levy will be 10 per cent but in Castlebar it will be 0.1 per cent?  I do not give this example caustically.  Is it right that he should be enabled to vary the levy from year to year without reference to this House?  It seems an extraordinary power to give a Minister. It is strange legislation for this House to contemplate.  He might reduce or relax the levy depending on the representations made to him.</P>
    <P>My main misgivings with the way in which this Bill seeks to tackle the problem are first that &ldquo;dereliction&rdquo; does not mean what the average person thinks it means. Dereliction can be avoided by somebody just tarmacadaming a piece of land in a priority area as far as urban renewal is concerned and leaving it clean and tidy. Secondly, the method of imposing a levy seems to be arbitrary and seems to delegate extraordinary powers to the Minister, allowing him to vary across the country at his own discretion the amount of the levy from place to place.  He would be entitled to vary it every year upwards or downwards.  There could be a very strong argument for the unconstitutionality of the delegation to the Minister and of the inequality which would flow from different rates being imposed in different parts of the country. Doubtless those two points could be addressed by amendments, but they are fundamental points of principle.  The principle of dereliction is not what the layman would think it is.  The principle on which the levy is to be imposed is left on a discretionary basis, which in my view makes it infirm.  Those are two points which I notice particularly.</P>
    <P>I should like to make some comments on the objects of the Bill and its capacity to achieve them.  In order to address dereliction as a social evil in urban areas one has to take a long hard look at its causes, which are complex.  The Institute of Chartered Surveyors produced a very good paper a number of years ago on <Col N="737" /> the causes of dereliction.  In places like Dublin the causes are quite complicated. There are social pressures arising from the sheer growth of the city which lead inevitably to some process of change, but change does not automatically entail dereliction, except on a purely temporary basis from time to time.</P>
    <P>The Rent Restrictions Act in many cases encouraged landlords, especially in centre city areas, to keep the ground floor portions of their premises in good repair but to allow the residential quarters upstairs to fall into disrepair.  Then there is the whole question of urban blight. The most important point is the absurd pretence that we should have a code of local government planning and development law which tries to regulate the manner in which cities and rural areas are developed and planned on a uniform basis.</P>
    <P>The 1963 Local Government (Planning and Development) Act represents a watershed in planning control and a major codification of pre-existing controls on development, but it is an Act which could not achieve what it set out to do.  The process is a fundamentally negative process of planning control. Certain things are prohibited and certain things are exempt.  In a rural area the process of prohibition coupled with permission is probably sufficient to ensure orderly development.  Philosophically it is inapplicable to towns.</P>
    <P>If we look to any areas of Dublin which are now admired, be they the areas built by the Gardiner or Pembroke estates or some of the other large estates or the areas planned and laid out by the Wide Street Commissioners, the method by which those areas were built in general terms consisted of the person who had the ownership of the land setting out a scheme of development and ensuring by means of building leases and the like that the model in his mind of how the street should finally emerge would materialise. Places like Talbot Street, which are not architectural marvels at this stage, were laid out by the Wide Street Commissioners. They took into ownership the land in question and granted building <Col N="738" /> leases on strict conditions.  The Pembroke estate did much of the same work on a private enterprise basis in the southeastern area of the city.  Gardiner and others did the same kind of work in the north city centre.  The <i>modus operandi</i> was to grant building leases which had to conform with an overall uniform plan for the development of the area.</P>
    <P>None of those areas would have merged if it had been left to speculative free enterprise to develop those areas as they saw fit in accordance with a patchwork pattern of land ownership.  Orderly development in an urban area requires the power to acquire land compulsorily, to extinguish intermediate interests in land and the power to direct, at least in general terms, the nature of the development that occurs on the land.</P>
    <P>Most Deputies will be aware of the controversy that surrounded, for instance, the building of the highway from Clanbrassil Street to Christ Church Cathedral in recent times.  It runs along one edge of the constituency represented by Deputy Garret FitzGerald and me. That enterprise caused in its execution about 35 years of urban blight in terms of the non-repair, disrepair and dereliction which the road plan entailed by reason of the manner in which it was carried out. Dublin Corporation are a huge bureaucracy but, if you look at the worst features of Dublin, on about eight occasions out of ten it is the direct responsibility of Dublin Corporation that such dereliction exists.</P>
    <P>This Bill, which is supposed to give local authorities further powers in relation to dereliction, ignores the fundamental fact that local authorities probably by their actions cause the vast majority of dereliction by operating the Planning Act and by carrying out their functions in relation to road widening.  To take the example of that road, whatever your views about how wide it should be, whether it should be a dual carriageway or a narrower road and whatever your views about whether the buildings should have been at a particular distance from one another &mdash; and I had strong views in regard to this &mdash; I object most of all to <Col N="739" /> the fact that there is a section of Dublin Corporation which can run a road along that line but there is no section of Dublin Corporation which has the power and the duty to rebuild the streetscape and, so to speak, heal the scar.  Local authorities simply do not have the function, as the Wide Street Commissioners had, of making sure, not simply that a roadway was built, but that a street and a living community were restored to the area. Therefore, in so many cases in Dublin &mdash; the same applies although happily to a lesser extent in some of our other cities &mdash; there are examples of local authority created dereliction and devastation in the city centre with no corresponding duty on the authority to do anything about repairing the social, environmental and historical damage that has been done to a city as a living organism.</P>
    <P>Dublin Corporation are a vast bureaucracy whose headquarters are happily in a building which sums them up in many respects because it is a building which has turned its face on urban renewal and against any concept of city existence and a sense of importance of the city as an historical place where people exist.  Those two monumental piles down on Wood Quay are a great monument to the thinking of the corporation and however unpleasant they are to look at from the outside it is a just sentence on many of the people in Dublin Corporation that they must work in them because many of those people have created a sense of ugliness everywhere which those buildings symbolise for many Dublin citizens.</P>
    <P>Dublin Corporation are not the body who can bring about urban renewal in Dublin and all their efforts have shown us just how unsuited they are to that end. If anyone has any doubts about whether one roadway or another will recover and become part of the urban landscape, let them go a few hundred yards from here to Cuffe Street to see the sheer devastation that Dublin Corporation not only allowed but created.  It is the worst jumble of corporation created dereliction on a corner site, gable ends of sad buildings sticking out on to the street and totally <Col N="740" /> inappropriate corporation tower blocks of flats sited in positions which are totally unsuitable.  Private developers have been allowed to build office blocks at angles to one another without any relation to the streetscape &mdash; I am thinking in particular of the Telecom office block.  Another large building, Greenside House, was flung up without any regard to the facade. These things happened on a street which was widened by Dublin Corporation, turned into a dual carriageway and supposed to be of proportions which I am sure were explained to people at the time as being proportions which were likely to give rise to a beautiful street.  However, they did not because nobody was given the function of rebuilding that street.  As long as any urban local authority have to labour under the local government planning and development code in its present form, they are not only incapable of conserving their cities, they are likely to do more and more damage to them the more activities they carry out.  They simply do not have the powers to do what is necessary to conserve beautiful streets.</P>
    <P>O'Connell Street was devastated in the 1916-1922 period but it was rebuilt according to a plan.  There was an architect who had views about the materials to be used and nobody was allowed &mdash; as they are now &mdash; to erect a one storey building on O'Connell Street and put amusement machines into it.  That is the order of the day in most of the north inner city in Dublin, you can remove the top storey of any premises on the basis that it is old and infirm and carry on a trade on the ground floor, reducing the character of the street to that of a wild west town.  There is no control, nobody can force you to come to heel.  That is dereliction; and it is why this Bill is grossly inadequate.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies have recently been approached by people involved in the south eastern portion of the city around the Grand Canal basin.  There is a project in being to make use of the basin as a recreational and amenity facility to generate employment in an unemployment black spot.  They want to bring about renewal based on a new sense of pride <Col N="741" /> an the huge opportunity that the Grand Canal structure and basins left over from the operation of the Grand Canal Company offer in terms of potential amenity facilities.  One of the sad things about that is that the Mount Street Club was established as an unemployment exchange in the days when social welfare was not as sophisticated as it is now and it was thought to be a good thing that people who had the resources, time and capacity to organise work for others, should do so on a voluntary basis.  They put people who were willing to work in touch with people who were willing to offer them work in order to reduce the scourge of unemployment in the inner city.  The Mount Street Club has now teamed up with local community organisations to try to develop the Grand Canal complex in terms of the canal itself and the harbours and basins in the south inner city as an employment and recreational facility.</P>
    <P>As a group of volunteers they deserve huge credit for what they have done because they are trying to take on dereliction on a vast scale, on a voluntary basis.  They face, curiously enough, not in general terms the hostility of their community &mdash; they have the full backing of the community and their local representatives &mdash; but that of Bord Gáis which is the successor to the Gas Company and various other semi-State agencies who occupy or have control over most of the land which is near where they want to carry out their scheme.  Presumably Bord Gáis, CIE and Bord Telecom who own some of these lands and the Office of Public Works who own the canal, its banks and basins, have their own different economic and constitutional reasons for holding on to land or disposing of it in one form or another. Some of them are under pressure to make commercial gain by disposing of the land.</P>
    <P>I am sure Deputy FitzGerald would agree that there is no single co-ordinating body which possibly could take advantage of this opportunity to cure dereliction in that area of Dublin.  If one stands near Mount Street and looks towards Boland's Mills and towards the <Col N="742" /> Liffey, one would see that most of the land is derelict; yet there appears to be no visible impetus for its redevelopment. The reason is that Dublin Corporation do not have the resources, the will or the inclination to bring about a change in the way that part of the city looks.</P>
    <P>An Bord Gáis have no motivation to do anything with it either.  CIE have different plans for it to anybody else.  The sad fact is that the opportunity to carry out redevelopment on a large scale, which could form the nucleus of a complete wave of urban renewal in that area, cannot be taken.  Although we have created a proliferation of semi-State bodies we have done very little in terms of establishing mechanisms to bring about urban renewal and carry on the business of conservation in urban areas.</P>
    <P>The Minister should bring before this Dáil a Bill which would enable urban development corporations to be established by order with particular purposes in mind.  These corporations should have the power &mdash; they need not be overblown bodies, they could be simple bodies &mdash; to draw up a plan, to compulsorily acquire interests in land in their areas and to seek tenders for widespread redevelopment within the area for which they have special responsibility.  They should also have power to acquire derelict land on a street which runs through their area &mdash; most of which is in an unobjectionable state &mdash; or to require people to back up the extra floors above a premises so as to recreate the streetscape or to carry out infill developments which are necessary to prevent dereliction.  To stop the rot powers will be required to force people to use their land in a way that is consistent with the character of the area.</P>
    <P>One of the big obstacles to any form of interference with property rights is the much vaunted constitutional protection for private property rights.  In a book by K. C. Wheare entitled <i>Modern Constitutions</i> the constitutions of European countries are compared.  This is a classic text in comparative constitutional law. The author points out that the Irish provisions in relation to private property are virtually indistinguishable from those set <Col N="743" /> out in the Yugoslav Constitution and that we do not have, at least as far as the written word of the Constitution is concerned, any Draconian pro-private property code which prevents the social dimension of property from being controlled and regulated in the public interest.  One of the chief obstacles facing the Minister &mdash; I am afraid he is part of the problem by virtue of his recent behaviour in this House &mdash; in trying to make progress in relation to private property, its rights and obligations, lies in the Attorney General's Office who seem to give the most conservative advice to successive Governments.  Nobody seems to be willing to take any real risks of introducing legislation to see how far the courts will go in turning the tide against ultra-conservative views in respect of property rights.</P>
    <P>The other chief problem arises from the legal advice available in the Department of the Environment.  I will not go any further than this at this stage as I intend to comment on it at a later stage in relation to the Bill presented by the Minister to amend the local government planning and development code.  I was shocked by the way the Minister failed to tackle the issue of planning compensation and sought to entrench compensation rights <i>ad infinitium</i> for the present owners of property.  I cannot believe that if there were 30 senior counsel, more than one of them would advise his Department that the particular provisions in those Bills were required by the Constitution.  If the Supreme Court suggests as it did recently, that the present compensation code is unconstitutional because it is far too generous to property owners, then surely it would be remisss of the House not to listen to the clear message coming from the Four Courts, and to act upon it by taking a bit of courage in our hands to change our views on property rights.</P>
    <P>The time has come, especially in relation to urban planning law, to take seriously the suggestion that property does have obligations in an urban context &mdash; I think it was Drummond who said that property has its obligations and its <Col N="744" /> duties as well as its rights &mdash; and that a person cannot claim the right to leave land unused, if he leaves land unused or fallow he cannot as of right demand to be accorded immunity from extra taxation or from having the land taken from him to be put to use.  I do not believe anyone has the right to allow land become derelict, to leave it unoccupied or unused or to leave buildings boarded up, blocked up or in a state which would detract from the environment.  The municipality has a right to demand that its streets work, that there are living streets and that the available space, which is a scarce resource &mdash; although one would not think so looking around Dublin where there are at least 100 acres of derelict land &mdash; be used to give the city life.</P>
    <P>Every shopkeepr in a street has a right to demand that the remainder of his street is not walled up.  I do not want to be too hard on the fellows in Trinity College, but you cannot do what they did in Pearse Street, and block up all the ground floor shops on the one side of the street and say it is a matter of complete indifference as far as the city and the ordinary citizen is concerned.  A property owner does not have rights to use land as he will, to close it or to change it as he likes.  I think the Supreme Court would take the view that there are obligations on property owners in urban areas to use and maintain property in good repair, and to permit it to be integrated into urban life rather than allow it to become derelict and effectively a source of urban rot.</P>
    <P>If the Supreme Court were to take that view, it would be incumbent on this House to at least pass legislation which would go some way towards altering the balance of property rights against the individual owner who seeks to abuse his rights and in favour of the community who have to put up with the consequences of dereliction.  In that process, firstly, as long as you have a negative planning code like the 1963 planning code you will never make progress in urban renewal.  The planning permission system, the draft plans, the development plans will never make one beautiful street.  They create <Col N="745" /> Cuffe Street.  The Pembroke Estate created Merrion Square.  That is the difference. As long as there is not some element of positive planning you will always have ugliness, dereliction, confusion and blight.  Those are the wages of the sin this House committed when in 1963 it decided urban planning should be governed by a negative planning code such as we have.  We need something more.</P>
    <P>In Britain they have seen this is the case.  There are urban renewal corporations working on docksides in London rebuilding the core of the inner city, but in Ireland we do not accept that. In a sense we are afraid of the local authorities.  We are afraid to be accused of being undemocratic, and people are worried that local authorities might take offence if their powers were restricted even to the small extent the Metropolitan Streets Commission did that in Dublin. People were afraid that was in some sense treading on their corns and being undemocratic.  There is no likelihood of real urban renewal as long as we rely on the present statutory framework.  I despair of measures such as this which are just window dressing when it comes to the size of the problem.  If, as I think is the case, a huge car park is not even a derelict site for this purpose, what hope has this Bill, if it becomes law in its present form, of remedying the situation? We need different solutions.  We need positive powers to acquire land, to extinguish intermediate interest in land, to simplify title to land; we need all those things if we are to make any progress in urban renewal.  None of those solutions is to be found here.</P>
    <P>Instead we have a defective definition of derelection which does not really deal with the problem.  We have a defective system of control and a defective and probably unconstitutional levy to be imposed at the arbitrary discretion of the Minister at different rates in different parts of the country.  That is a recipe for another three to four years of failure to confront the real problems of urban decay.  I ask every Member of this House <Col N="746" /> to look carefully at the document prepared by the Institute of Chartered Surveyors about urban decay and its causes. There is no point in fooling ourselves that this kind of measure is an adequate remedy when we have not even analysed the causes of decay and addressed our minds to remedying those causes.</P>
    <P>This is a rather miserable legislative response to a huge problem.  It will not have the effect contended by the Minister. The last Derelict Sites Act was a failure and so was the one before it and, with the greatest respect, this one is going to be a failure.  The sooner this House faces up comprehensively to urban decay and realises that the planning laws and these kinds of small remedies are not sufficient, the better.</P>
    <P>Until this House faces up to a positive duty to conserve we will achieve nothing in terms of overall urban conservation.  It is amazing that I can buy a house which is supposed to be conserved in a development plan, allow the slates fall off the roof, sometimes take a saw to the joists and cause the decay myself, board it up and allow dry rot, wet rot, damp and so on to infest that house.  I can do what happened in Clare Street so near to us here: remove the top few storeys of a building on the pretext that my own carelessness in allowing them collapse and decay should entitle me to destroy something the preservation of which was an object of the development plan.  Unless we decide we are going to put in place positive conservation powers there will be no chance of saving what is left of our architectural heritage.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats brought in a Bill which contained the innovation of a conservation receiver, somebody entitled to intervene with the backing of a court where a building the preservation of which was the object of a development plan was endangered, someone entitled to get powers to go in and do whatever was necessary to conserve that building, to bill the owners or the person who failed to conserve with the cost of so doing and to ensure that the cost of so doing remained a charge on that property so <Col N="747" /> that merely by a multiple chain of ownership the obligation could not be avoided. That has not been done and I do not believe it is the Minister's planning and our Bill was voted down by the Minister.</P>
    <P>I do not believe there is any adequate remedy to save Georgian Dublin from people determined to knock it down if they want to do so.  We are relying only on goodwill now and that is not good enough.  In this House we have an obligation to go one stage further and create a duty, where conservation is deemed necessary by the planning authority in their plan, by An Taisce or some State conservation body, to conserve that property and keep it in good repair.  Until we do things like that, until we adopt radical proposals in relation to the environment, this kind of piecemeal legislation will serve perhaps as a palliative.  Perhaps it will allow this Minister at his forthcoming Ard Fheis to try to create the illusion he is doing something to stop urban decay when he is doing no such thing.  However, I guarantee there will be as many derelict sites in five years' time as there are now and the difficulties the Minister is running into on a legal front with his levy and his definition of dereliction will have all efforts heavily bogged down in the courts within months of this Bill coming into effect.  This Bill, although a gesture in the right direction, is doomed to failure.  I know Deputy Keating, on behalf of my party, welcomed it in principle.  I welcome its principle too, but it is so abject a measure and so inadequate in the face of what is needed that really one can only despair of the evil it purports to confront ever being remedied as long as Bills like this are tossed in this state before the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. G. FitzGerald Dr. G. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. G. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>If I had read the Minister's speech but not the Bill I might have welcomed this measure.  I do not want to reject it; something is better than nothing, but having read the Bill my welcome will be very muted, in part for some of the reasons mentioned by the previous speaker, in part for other reasons. <Col N="748" /> The Bill has to be seen against the background of the general question of property rights.  In this country there has been a very strong movement over the period of independence towards the protection, indeed over protection, of property rights.  In the first Constitution as drafted there were Articles at the very outset which set out certain principles with regard to property rights and duties. In a very complex process at the end of May 1922, the full nature of which remains obscure to me at least, when other issues between the Irish and British Governments came to be discussed at that time, these Articles were dropped. The fact that they were contemplated and included in the first draft and even in the draft that was discussed with the British Government at that time suggests they represented something of the consensus of the founders of the State, but I do not think at that stage that this part of the Constitution could have evoked any disagreement between the two sides who at that time were in conflict, or about to be in conflict.  When they were dropped the constitutional provisions came in which were then re-enacted and possibly &mdash; I do not wish to be dogmatic on this point &mdash; strengthened in the 1937 Constitution. The traditional interpretations over the years were of such a character as to give rise to a belief, certainly among the legal advisers to the Government, not merely the Attorney General's office but in the Department of Local Government, later the Department of the Environment, that the entrenchment of property rights was such that anything that did not pay the utmost respect to them, that seemed to in any way challenge the existence of rights and the absence of duties, would be shot down by the Supreme Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have always thought, since I first became interested in politics, that the views of the Supreme Court were over-interpreted by the legal advisers.  Of course, it is the duty of the legal advisers to a Government, whether in a Department or the Attorney General's Office, to advise if a proposed course of action might be unconstitutional.  If there is a <Col N="749" /> strong presumption of unconstitutionality it could be regarded as improper for a Government to attempt to legislate in that way.  However, I am not sure on how far that should be pushed.  I have always thought that there was a case for a certain measure of imprudence in this area designed to test the Supreme Court to the limit and that if at a certain point a decision was obtained from the Supreme Court so much opposed to the community's interests in regard to property as to give rise to genuine political issues than the Government who had brought things to that point could legitimately, perhaps, not necessarily successfully, take the matter to the people.  I regret that no Government have ever been willing to pursue that policy without, I think, any constitutional impropriety, by just pushing it to the limit of what the existing advice would seem to tolerate and seeing how far things could be taken.</P>
    <P>It is now clear, in the light of recent Supreme Court <i>obiter dicta</i> that either the Supreme Court's views have indeed been over-interpreted by the legal advisers to the Government or that the Supreme Court's position has, as happens, and very properly, over a period of time in recognition of changes in the balance of public opinion, been modified in a direction less protective of private interests and showing more concern for the public interest.  It is against the background of an evolution initially away from the public interest and towards the protection of private interests but latterly it would appear from the Supreme Court decisions or <i>obiter dicta</i> back towards the public interest, that we should see this legislation.  We should measure it, and its adequacy for the purposes for which it is intended, by reference to this shift in opinion.  Does it go as far in the direction of the public interest as could prudently be done in the light of what has been said by the Supreme Court in recent times?  I would think not and in that respect I would agree with Deputy McDowell.  Not being a practising lawyer I would express my opinion more strongly than he would <Col N="750" /> being properly cautious in matters of constitutional law in view of the fact that he might get caught up in some case by overstating the position.  I do not have those fears and, perhaps, I can be a little less prudent.  Undoubtedly, more could be done in this Bill than is done in this respect.  I say that by way of general comment before dealing with the details of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Looking at the Bill from another aspect in terms of a climate of political opinion I think it is a response, an inadequate one but a response nevertheless, to the manner in which public opinion has over the last two decades reacted to &mdash; to put at its politest &mdash; the uncaring attitude of the Government in office at that time towards the preservation and conservation of the city of Dublin but also of parts of other cities.  It is unlikely that today any Minister would think that he could without serious damage to his own position, and to that of his party, make the kind of statements that former Deputy Boland made when he as Minister denigrated the architectural and historic value of large parts of the city of Dublin on the grounds that they were built by a foreign regime.  In fact, the logic of what he said would require the entire city to be demolished but he limited himself to suggesting that buildings of particular distinction should be demolished. He was quite happy that undistinguished buildings should remain for some reason.  His remarks about belted Earls in Georgian Dublin still echo in our ears but I do not think any Minister today could speak in those iconoclastic terms and terms denigratory of an extraordinary part of our architectural heritage and get away with it.</P>
    <P>The Bill reflects a shift in opinion of a modest kind towards trying to do something in a small way to protect us from the depredations of time, of neglect, of our corporation in Dublin, depredations going far beyond anything required by the ordinary exercise of business acumen to carry out entrepreneurial activities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I was referring to a Fianna Fáil Minister and while I did not want to be too pointed about that I thought that was clear from my remarks. I certainly was not referring to Deputy Kevin Boland's father for whom I have great respect.  I was referring to former Deputy Kevin Boland.  Examples of the consequences of dereliction are all round us.  Deputy McDowell, and other Members, have rightly pointed to the appalling damage inflicted on our city by the roads policies of the officials of Dublin Corporation who have brought along in their train very often, I am afraid, although with reluctance in many cases, the members of the corporation. So much of the city has been destroyed for the purpose of building roads.  A lot of dereliction around the place as a result of those happenings over decades has been an extraordinary consequence of the inactions of civic authorities.  Even today we have places such as Clare Street.  In fact, wherever we go we can see derelict sites, in the ordinary meaning of the word, and buildings which are in a state of neglect on sites which, apparently under this Bill, are to be declared derelict sites rather, I fear, against the ordinary meaning of those words.  I have some qualms as to the possible legal contests that might arise from the manner in which the Bill seeks to deal with the question of dwellings even though what it seeks to do in respect of them is very limited indeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am wondering what exactly the Minister thinks the Bill will do in this respect. In respect of Clare Street will it put a roof on the house?  In respect of the houses in <Col N="752" /> Belgrave Square that an entrepreneur has been seeking to turn into a hotel, the panes of glass are broken in the windows, the houses are unpainted and are already becoming an eyesore <i>vis-à-vis</i> the neighbouring buildings.  Will the Bill require him to restore the panes of glass or to paint up the building?  That is far from clear.  The Minister has nodded and I am glad he has done so but I wonder whether somebody contesting what is required might not at the margin end up with a court decision somewhat different from what I and the Minister would hope would be the decision.  There is a certain lack of clarity.</P>
    <P>The fact is that dwellings are included in the Bill only by implication.  It is a curious manner of legislation and one can understand why because the Bill is the Derelict Sites Bill which repeals a previous Derelict Sites Act.  It is seeking to use the derelict site concept to go beyond that and do a little more than one would have thought a derelict sites Bill might do.  It is good that it should attempt to do that but I am afraid that by only going a little distance along the road, and being less than specific, it is doubtful whether it will achieve what perhaps are the intentions of its authors.</P>
    <P>The nearest thing to a reference to a dwelling in the Bill is &ldquo;a structure&rdquo;.  In section 4 there is a reference to the amenity, character or appearance of land in the neighbourhood of the land in question being detracted from because of the existence on the land in question of structures which are in a ruinous, derelict or dangeorus condition.  I think that in the original Act it was &ldquo;walls&rdquo; but we have gone beyond walls to &ldquo;structures&rdquo;.  There is an extraordinary hesitation about saying &ldquo;buildings&rdquo; or &ldquo;dwellings&rdquo;.  It is not clear exactly what has happened the structures under the provisions of this Bill.  The Minister nodded when I asked if it would involve repainting them and amending panes of glass.  He did not nod when I asked if the damage to, for example, Clare Street, would be restored.  What is specified in section 12 (2) (a) is as follows:</P>
    <P>A notice under this section shall&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="753" /> (a) specify the measures which the local authority or the Minister, as the case may be, consider to be necessary in order to prevent the land from becoming or continuing to be a derelict site,</P>
    <P>That is all; there is nothing else that I can find although it may be that I am missing some point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says clear the whole site.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. G. FitzGerald Dr. G. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. G. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>How is that to be interpreted? If the Minister nods when I asked if the houses could be repainted and the panes of glass restored does it not seem doubtful, to say the least, that that is how that is to be interpreted?  Would a court, in the ordinary meaning of the words &mdash; and I suppose the ordinary meaning of the words are what the courts are about unless the definition is very specifically other than that, and we are talking now about what is defined in section 4 &mdash; hold that mending panes of glass and painting a building is an appropriate way of preventing land from becoming or continuing to be a derelict site?  Is it a derelict site, in the ordinary meaning of the words, if that is what is wrong with it? Would not allowing the panes of glass to be replaced and not painting the building allow it become a derelict site?</P>
      <P>I will revert to section 4 (a) which reads:</P>
      <P>the existence on the land in structures which are in a ruinous, derelict or dangerous condition,....</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wondered a bit about the word &ldquo;ruinous&rdquo;. Does that mean, for example, that Saint Kevin's Church in Camden Street will be knocked down because it is a ruin? There is such a thing as discretion on the part of Dublin Corporation.  Perhaps that is one building they would not knock down; they have not so far; they appear to have missed it.  The words used are &ldquo;in a ruinous, derelict or dangerous condition&rdquo;. For example, panes of glass missing is not in itself dangerous; if they are loose it is dangerous; if they are missing <Col N="754" /> it is not.  I do not think one could contend that panes of glass being missing renders a house ruinous but, is it derelict, or a derelict structure?  In any event section 12 (2) (a) specifies what is to be done. The point is that we are talking about structures that are derelict.  The definition in section 4 refers to structures becoming ruinous, derelict or in a dangerous condition.  But what is done to put them right is to prevent the land from becoming derelict, not the structures.  Is that not a curious way of tackling the problem?  If, in section 4, the definition of &ldquo;derelict site&rdquo; relates to structures and it does specifically because it says:</P>
    <P>(a) the existence on the land in question of structures which are in a ruinous, derelict or dangerous condition,...</P>
    <P>How would a court interpret a requirement that the land, not the structures, be prevented from becoming or continuing to be a derelict site?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Knock down the rest of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. G. FitzGerald Dr. G. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. G. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The logical thing to do is knock down the building, put in a car park, tarmacadam it and then it ceases to be a derelict site.  But would a court, in the ordinary meaning of the words, hold that a Bill in which, though the definitions section refers to structures but the section dealing with the remedy for dereliction refers only to land, hold that land means structures?  It cannot because it is &ldquo;the existence on the land in question of structures&rdquo;, which is the wording contained in section 4 (a).  Therefore land cannot mean structures because the definition of &ldquo;derelict site&rdquo; in section 4 clearly distinguishes land from structures and says they are different, that the structures are something on the land, that the remedy is to prevent the land from becoming or continuing to be a derelict site.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister might re-examine the drafting here.  I understand how the drafting could have arisen although I am not sure the reason for things being drafted are always obscure until they are <Col N="755" /> explained to one by the experts.  Even then they often remain obscure to us mere mortal Deputies or Ministers.  I think I understand a possible reason for the wording, that the Bill in its provenance is a Bill on derelict land.  The attempt &mdash; a worthy one which I fully support &mdash; to import into it the concept of conserving structures is one which is attempting to do something rather difficult. It may be that it has not been done as well and fully as it ought.  I would ask the Minister particularly to look at that point and indeed at the whole question Deputy McDowell raised as well about the adequacy of this as a method of dealing with the problem of derelict structures as distinct from derelict land.  The issue is a fairly important one because we all hope &mdash; I suspect this is what the Minister hopes, too &mdash; that its provisions will be effective in preventing the kind of dereliction that we might otherwise be faced with.</P>
    <P>Some of the dereliction relates to sites. There are unsightly sites.  There are sites on which there are bushes and grass that has not been mown.  In some instances perhaps a site could be thought to be more attractive with its attendant flora and fauna &mdash; rats, too, of course &mdash; than it would be if it were tarmacademed. Take the example of the site at Charlemont Street where another road is to be built in due course.  Indeed I wish they would get on with it because that road does seem worthwhile; I would support that all right.  I presume Dublin Corporation own that site but if the Minister directed that something be done about it to prevent it becoming derelict, what would be done?  Would the shrubs and trees that have grown amidst the wilderness there be torn down, the place flattened and tarmacadamed?  Or would the shrubs and trees be torn down, grass sown on it and maintained?  What exactly is the process for dealing with this?  It is fairly vague.  The Bill does relate to derelict sites and the measures to be taken are those to prevent the land from becoming or continuing to be a derelict site.  There are unsolved questions here. <Col N="756" /> Certainly the Bill if viewed as a means of dealing with &mdash; as clearly the Minister, from his nod, hoped it would do &mdash; the question of painting, or restoring windows in dwellings waiting to have their usage changed, will mean that the Ministers hopes might not be fulfilled unless some modification is made to the relevant sections.</P>
    <P>If we are to tackle the question of buildings being derelict it may be necessary to approach the matter somewhat differently.  The Bill does not require in any specific way, or in any way that one can identify, anybody to restore a building. The Minister may think and hope, as I do, that the windows will be mended, the roof put on although he did not say that; the Minister agrees with painting and having panes of glass restored.  I would hope it means putting roofs on again but there is nothing in the Bill to say so.  A court could very easily hold that the absence of anything specific in the Bill does raise a serious question as to whether that is the intention.  If in fact Dublin Corporation required, for example, in the case of Belgrave Square or Clare Street, that action be taken to have the buildings restored and that were contested as not being, in any ordinary meaning of the words, a measure to prevent the land becoming or continuing to be a derelict site, there is a fair chance the Minister would win the action and the Bill would turn out to be useless for that purpose.  Possibly it would be useful for dealing with actual sites that are semi-cleared, with rubbish on them or something of that kind, but not for dealing with the problem with which the Minister clearly intends it to deal.</P>
    <P>I do not think a court would hold that unless the Bill contains some such provision. It would need to make provision &mdash; under section 12 (2) (a) &mdash; that could require not merely the land from becoming or continuing to be a derelict site but the structure to be restored.  Those words have to go in if this Bill is to have any real chance of doing what the Minister clearly wishes it to do, those words or words like them.  It seems to me they must be inserted in section 12 (2) (a).</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="757" /> Would such a requirement stand up?  I think and hope it would.  It may be that if there are any constitutional doubts about it one would have to make some provision, that if the requirement were to be grossly unreasonable in some way the court might have some say in the matter, or perhaps some remedy of an owner asking the court to declare that the requirement is unreasonable.  I hope that is not necessary.  I certainly think that a requirement to restore structures in fairly specific terms is necessary, with whatever qualifications may have to accompany that.  If that is not inserted the Minister will not achieve his intentions.  I would urge him to look at that again.  I hope he will receive appropriate advice that some action of that kind can be undertaken and that it would be useful to do so.</P>
    <P>In section 9 there is a requirement that a register should be established within one year after the commencement of the Act.  I would like the Minister to give some indication when the Act will commence. This House has an unhappy experience with all Governments &mdash; when I was in Government the problem also arose from time to time &mdash; of leaving it to the Minister to decide when an Act commences.  The House thinks things are going to happen when it passes the Act but a long time elapses before it is brought into effect.  There are good reasons for that from time to time.  If there was not some good reason the Minister would not put in the requirement and the Act would take effect when it is passed.  Could the Minister tell us what leads him to think that a commencement date is required and that the Act should not come into effect immediately it is passed?  In so far as he has some reason &mdash; and I am sure he has &mdash; could he indicate what interval he expects to occur before the Act will come into effect?</P>
    <P>I would suspect that some local authorities, if not all, would say to the Minister: &ldquo;With our limited resources and all the cutbacks we could not possibly produce a register within one year.  Do not commence the Act for the time being because we will never get the job done. <Col N="758" /> Give us time to get things in order.&rdquo;  With the National Archives Bill a period of two years was allowed for the papers to be handed over.  Problems sometimes arise in Government Departments but I intend to put down questions shortly to find out what progress has been made with that Act.  It has come into effect but there is a requirement to have the papers lodged in about 18 months time and I would be interested to know what progress has been made in that regard.  I would not be a bit surprised if during the course of this year the Taoiseach's Department will say they will not have all the papers ready and that they need more time.  That sometimes happens and in this instance there is a strong likelihood of it happening.  We have been told that Dublin Corporation will register 600 derelict sites.  Perhaps they are far enough advanced to have them registered in time but are all the other local authorities in the same position or will they seek a period before the Act commences?  In any event could the Minister tell us when the Act is to commence?</P>
    <P>The second question I want to ask &mdash; I do not see any answer to it in the Bill &mdash; is suppose it happens that a local authority compile a register that the Minister thinks is inadequate, that when the register is produced and inspected by members of the public the point is made that it does not include many derelict sites and that the job has not been done properly, what is the remedy?  I do not see one in the Bill but that does not mean there is not one.  Any Deputy's reading of Bills can be often inadequate.  Perhaps there is a provision whereby the Minister can require that the register be recompiled if it is not adequate but I do not see it here.  Maybe the Minister could explain, if there is such a provision, where it is.  If not he should consider taking some powers in the matter.  I am always reluctant to ask Ministers to take powers but I think this is the kind of power that might be useful in this case.</P>
    <P>In regard to the question of ownership, I have read through the provisions in the different sections of the Bill which relate to giving notice to require action to be <Col N="759" /> taken to end dereliction.  Notice, as provided for under section 7, has to be given under section 12.  The action to be taken must be specified.  The owner has to be told what measure is to be taken within a month and he can object within 14 days.</P>
    <P>Under section 16 the local authority may compulsorily acquire a derelict site and section 17 allows for objections to be made.  Section 18 provides for the making of a vesting order.  Compensation is dealt with under section 20.  We have been told that in the city of Dublin the local authority are faced with 600 derelict sites. Many of these are controlled by the corporation but there are a large number which are not under their control.  In these cases the corporation have to make reasonable inquiries to seek out the owners but in some cases they may not find them.  From problems which I have experienced from time to time in my constituency it is clear that the ownership of land is often unknown in Dublin, and perhaps in rural areas also.</P>
    <P>In cases where the owner cannot be found what happens?  The corporation have the power to go in and do the work. I suspect that in many cases the owner will not be found and the local authority then have the right to take the necessary steps.  If the Minister is right in regard to repairs to buildings, although he did not mention roofs, windows, painting and so on, the cost of carrying out the work to put right dereliction, not merely to clean out a place, put down tarmacadam and make a car park out of it, could be quite considerable for local authorities if the number of sites the ownership of which cannot be established is considerable. Local authorities may be loath to undertake extensive works at considerable expense when they are not very well endowed at present for reasons we all know.</P>
    <P>If I were involved in a local authority and was required to clean up all the sites the owners of which nobody knew I would be inclined to sell them and get the money back.  There is a provision in the Bill for compulsory acquisition but that is a complicated procedure.  I do not <Col N="760" /> know how much the legislation has been improved or streamlined in this area but I hope it has been improved.  I do not know enough about compulsory acquisition law to know at a glance whether that is the case.  That is the procedure that has to be gone through and then vesting takes place.  We are talking about cases where the owner of the site is unknown.  One would think the corporation could acquire the property, do the work, sell it and get the money for it, but that is not so.  If within one year the owner comes along and says he owns that site the local authority have to compensate him.  The man who would not admit to owning the site when it was derelict can look for compensation from the local authority who took over the site and paid for putting it right.  When the local authority start this procedure they do not know what is going to happen.</P>
    <P>We all know that many problems in the conservation area arise because local authorities have a problem with regard to compensation.  If they try to stop something happening under all kinds of circumstances they may have to pay compensation.  We all know that many of them have had to agree to things they did not want done at all because they had not the money to pay compensation and they could not stop these things being done. This is the biggest single problem that arises in regard to compensation in urban areas.</P>
    <P>In this instance where we want these sites cleaned up we are telling the local authorities that they have to clean them up if they cannot find the owners.  If they try to acquire the sites so that something useful can be done with them and they can get some money back on them, they may find themselves having to pay compensation, but they will not know until they acquire them.  Twelve months afterwards the Sword of Damocles may hang over them and they may end up having to fork out a substantial sum.  Will local authorities in those circumstances acquire sites in respect of which ownership is unknown, when they do not know whether they will have to pay? <Col N="761" /> They have to pay very large compensation; somebody might come along and say this is a most valuable site intended for the development of some office block and demand so much money for it.  So far as I can see from the Bill they will not know that until up to a year afterwards.</P>
    <P>The Bill should be looked at again in this respect.  Given that local authorities will be required to deal with derelict sites, I suggest that where the ownership cannot be established after reasonable inquiries and they are going to incur costs which they cannot get refunded because the owner will not admit to being the owner, they should be allowed to acquire compulsorily on a basis that when vesting takes place in a site the ownership of which cannot be established by reasonable inquiries it vests in them without compensation at that point.  I do not think that an owner of a site who is not willing to own up to owning it when it is derelict and is required to be put right should have the right to come along afterwards and demand compensation when the site has been acquired, having trapped the local authority into that.  That is a very undesirable provision in the Bill and I would like the Minister to look at it.</P>
    <P>I hope I will not be told that what I suggest would be unconstitutional.  I cannot see that anybody has the right to refuse to acknowledge ownership of something where there is a penalty and claim ownership when there is a benefit. Whatever the rights of property, they cannot go that far in any reasonable society.  Even if our society is a bit unreasonable, they cannot be that unreasonable.</P>
    <P>I hope, therefore, that there can be a linkage established and that in fact the act of entering upon a property, the ownership of which has not been established after reasonable inquiry, with a view to dealing with dereliction which the owner is not willing to deal with, should be deemed to be an act of acquisition so that by virtue of doing the work a right to the property accrues to the local authority. There are various precedents in law for that where, when somebody has to <Col N="762" /> act because of a failure on the part of another person, certain rights are acquired.  I do not see how there could be any constitutional objection to acquiring a right in such circumstances.  I would hope that that will be looked at and a linkage established so that the local authorities, for once in their lives, will be able to go ahead without having to worry that they will have to pay out a vast sum if they take the sensible action when there is no owner or no apparent owner of a site.  In this way there could be some public benefit by the local authority doing what the owner is not willing to cope with himself.  That then is an area I would like examined.  It involves a number of sections in the Bill.  I hope something will be done about them.</P>
    <P>I have a point to make in relation to the working of the Minister's speech and the explanatory memorandum.  On Page 13 of the Minister's speech he says:</P>
    <P>In all urban areas, or in such county council areas as the Minister may prescribe, an annual derelict sites levy will be imposed by local authorities on so-called urban land.</P>
    <P>The explanatory memorandum says at Part III:</P>
    <P>This Part provides for an annual levy by local authorities on all urban land.</P>
    <P>That is not what the Bill says.  I think it is unusual and not particularly desirable that, whatever about the Minister's speech where a certain latitude is allowed, there should be something in the explanatory memorandum that is not what is in the Bill.  On the question of the levy section 24 (1) provides anomalously for the levy.  It reads:</P>
    <P>There shall be charged, levied and paid for each local financial year beginning with such year as may be prescribed, in respect of all urban land in relation to which a market value has been determined and stands entered on the register on the first day of January of that local financial year, a levy to be called the derelict sites levy.</P>
    <P>It does not say who levies it.  It says it <Col N="763" /> shall be levied.  We will go on to find out who is actually doing the job.  It says at subsections (2), (3) and (4):</P>
    <P>(2)  The derelict sites levy shall be paid by the owner of urban land to the local authority...</P>
    <P>(3)  The amount of the derelict sites levy shall be a proportion of the market value of the urban land which shall be prescribed for each urban area, from time to time, by the Minister...</P>
    <P>(4)  Subject to subsection (5), the derelict sites levy shall be payable on a demand being made by the local authority in that behalf...</P>
    <P>The levy is not determined, as the speech and the explanatory memorandum say, by local authorities; it is a levy by the Minister which accrues to local authorities, and it is not really quite equivalent. There is a fairly substantial point involved.  Deputy McDowell raised an aspect of that point which I will come back to in a moment.  The wording in the explanatory memorandum and in the speech are loose and that looseness should not be allowed to obscure the fact that the procedure provided for here is that the Minister shall decide the levy but the proceeds will go to the local authority.</P>
    <P>What about Deputy McDowell's point about the Minister prescribing the levy? It is a very serious point and I am surprised that, in the light of the recent Supreme Court decision in regard to the expenditure tax legislation, a Bill should come before the House which purports to give to a Minister the right to vary a levy which is a tax &mdash; what else can one call it; a levy is another word for tax &mdash; up and down as he wishes, and apparently to vary it at different levels for different local authority areas.  That is a power of taxation which certainly should be vested in the Dáil.  Deputy McDowell expressed some hestitation at this point.  I have no hesitation in expressing it.  I think it is highly improbable that the Supreme Court would ever uphold the power of the Minister to tax by varying from <Col N="764" /> .01 per cent to 10 per cent a levy of this kind, for different parts of the country at different rates without the approval of Dáil Éireann.  It is not that I do not want the Minister to do it.  I want him to do it. I fear however that if this is not remedied by providing for such decisions to be approved by Dáil Éireann, there will be a problem.  I was going to suggest that this be done by way of order but here we have to be careful.  I think the Supreme Court decision made it clear that it has to be by way of legislation.  There is a problem here, and I hope the Minister will address it because it would be disastrous, with all the hopes the people have that something useful will be done by introducing this levy, if the levy were challenged and it were found, that the Minister had no power to tax without the approval of the Dáil, if that failed and we had to start all over again.  It would be a great pity.  I do think in this case constitutional advice should be sought and regard should be had to it.</P>
    <P>I hope, by the way, that the Attorney General's advice has been sought on the Bill.  I know it has gone through the parliamentary draftsman but I would hope that on the constitutionality of it the advice solely of the Department would not be relied on.  It is not that I doubt the Department particularly but I found in Government a strong tendency on the part of Departments to offer the advice that something was not unconstitutional and not to seek the Attorney-General's view and they were sometimes wrong, to put it mildly.  Government Departments do not always seem to be aware, even with the advice of their own legal advisers, of the possible full implications of what they are doing and do not always seem willing to seek and get the Attorney General's advice.  On a number of occasions in Government I had to insist that the Attorney-General's advice be sought and in several instances my suspicions were vindicated and the Attorney General's advice was needed.  This legislation has probably been vetted by the Attorney General but I think there should be another look at it especially in the light of the Supreme Court decision. <Col N="765" /> Is it possible that the Bill was drafted before the Supreme Court decision or that full account was not taken of it? Certainly I would be very unhappy about a provision that might fail.  It is not that I do not want the Minister to have the power if in fact the Constitution allowed it, but I feel it is important that this process of levying this tax is put on a secure footing that could not be challenged in the courts.  I am sure the Opposition parties would go along with whatever is the simplest way to secure this result.  I do not think anyone would want to stand in the way of the Minister by opposing the levy, but we would like to be able to play whatever role, as a Legislature, is necesary to ensure that the Minister's view of what levy is required is given the authority of the Dáil.  I doubt if we would be quarrelling much with the figures but even if some carping critics would quarrel with them, by and large we would prefer that the thing was made secure by being put under the authority of the Dáil in whatever way seems to the Minister most convenient and least troublesome.</P>
    <P>I notice that the Minister says that unoccupied property cannot be rated. That is the existing arrangement.  Perhaps it is the law, I do not know; but if it is we are here to change it.  Why should we not apply the ordinary rates, whatever they are, as well as the levy?  Why should people, by virtue of taking the roof off a house so that it becomes derelict and they can develop it and make money, be exempted from rates?  Leaving aside the levy altogether I do not think the action of causing dereliction should exempt one from a normal tax.  I would like to think that the ordinary rates would apply and that whatever levy is appropriate on top of the rates could then be imposed.  I do not know what action is required for that. The Minister says that unoccupied property cannot be rated.  It is certainly not a constitutional point.  It must be either a legal point or an administrative point. Whatever it is it is something that we have the power to remedy.  I suggest that he consider the question of applying rates in these cases and, indeed, in the case <Col N="766" /> of domestic property, applying the rates also.  There is a domestic rate which is suspended for the present but is still there in embryonic form and could be applied. Exemption from rates in these instances is a mistake and should be looked at.</P>
    <P>I come now to deal with penalties. Others have made the point, with which I agree, that the penalties are ludicrously low in certain cases.  I see the Minister's justification for this.  In order for the matter to be dealt with in the District Court penalties have to be limited to appropriate penalties for minor offences. We know that provision exists.  The penalties bear so little relationship to the benefits that a developer can secure by deliberately causing and permitting dereliction with a view to evading some requirements of the law, the planning code or whatever it may be, with a view to making a large profit, that I do not think these provisions for penalties could be accepted by this House in this way.</P>
    <P>I recall other legislation where there was provision for penalties at a certain level if the charge was taken to a District Court, but on indictment to the appropriate court &mdash; the High Court or the Circuit Court &mdash; different penalties could be levied.  It may be that that is a practice only in criminal law I am not a practising lawyer and so, therefore, I cannot recall. I have suggested in this case that two levels of penalties, as in such other legislation, should be applied so that in any case where the prosecuting authority takes the view that what is involved is not merely an act of neglect &mdash; somebody not noticing something becoming derelict or not being alert or concerned about it &mdash; but a deliberate act designed to secure a large profit far beyond the fine that could be imposed in the District Court, in such cases the matter could be taken to the Circuit Court, or whatever is the appropriate court, with penalties of a penal kind.</P>
    <P>Such penalties for developers have to be very large indeed given the kinds of profits that can and have been made in a number of instances about which we all know of deliberate dereliction.  If that <Col N="767" /> process of having a dual system of charging people in the District Court or on indictment in a higher court for some reason cannot apply in this case but can apply more strictly in criminal cases, maybe another offence could be created. I am reluctant to suggest this because the other offence would have to impute some particular kind of inordinate blame, that there was deliberate dereliction for something of that kind for the purpose of profit and, of course, that could be very difficult to prove.  I would hope that this matter of adequate penalties can be dealt with by a dual system, such as I have proposed, rather than by having to have a different offence which might be difficult to prove in a particular case.  It is a very important point and I think public opinion would be very concerned if the Bill proves in this respect inadequate and if there are flagrant cases of people allowing dereliction to continue and refusing to obey the law in order to derive a profit from it.  In a case like that we need far greater penalties than are provided for here.</P>
    <P>We are dealing with cases where in some instances there is the strongest possible suspicion, to put it mildly, that dereliction was positively caused by the action of the owner and in other cases it is quite clear that he encouraged others to cause dereliction, for example, by encouraging people to come and strip the lead from the roof so that the roof would eventually fall in.  We know of such cases. Perhaps it would be difficult to prove that he gave the nod or the wink for the purpose of a particular instance, but no one is in doubt or is lacking in moral certainties that in some cases that is what happened.  In those cases the penalty that should be imposed for dereliction being allowed should be on a far larger scale. Unless it is on a scale that makes it not worthwhile to carry out such a practice then the Bill will not, in respect of the cases, be worth the paper it is written on. The profits are very large.  In a particular case an existing building may have a limited value in the view of the developer but if he can get rid of it he may be able to build a supermarket, a shopping centre <Col N="768" /> or an office block and the property may be worth millions.  That simply is not tolerable because he should be dealt penalties of £1,000 or £100 per day. Whatever reasons have been suggested for limiting actions of the District Court, another way round them must be found to deal with these cases.  I do not think public opinion would accept that the Bill would <i>ab initio</i> be so obviously flagrantly inadequate to deal with these kinds of cases.  In all parties people would be concerned that this would be put right. Exactly how it should be done is a technical matter for the Minister and his advisers but I hope they will examine that.</P>
    <P>I hope these comments have been helpful. The Bill is a potentially valuable one. I am worried though about that aspect of it which seems most difficult to remedy &mdash; I hope it will not be impossible; that is the aspect I dealt with earlier about structures and sites and the clearing of sites but in a way that does not seem to require that any type of action is necessary.  I do not know what can be done about that.  It is a very fundamental point.  The Minister gave a small nod and I hope that is a sign of encouragement. I hope that out of this debate, in which people have tried to be constructive, will emerge a number of amendments that will turn it into the kind of Bill which the Minister will be proud of.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill warmly.  It is effective legislation.  It has been well drafted and as such it is long overdue.  For many years now in this House I have been advocating the introduction of such legislation and in particular the introduction of a levy on definable derelict sites.  There has, indeed, been great lethargy and not an inconsiderable amount of quiet opposition to the introduction of this urgently needed legislation.  On that basis I commend the Minister and the parliamentary draftsman for bringing it before us in this month of February.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make one broad observation about the implementation of the Bill.  We have seen a growing number of powers <Col N="769" /> of local authorities in recent years, new statutory provisions relating to pollution. We have new building regulations which are being implemented and which are due to be implemented and in some instances have not been implemented.  We have a need for more extensive control and enforcement measures in relation to fire prevention.  A whole range of pollution control measures have been introduced at local level.  We have further very necessary developments in the public interest relating to planning and development.  To add to all that social obligations are being imposed on the local authorities such as the necessary social provision for homeless persons, the control and general policing of dogs.  The impact of environmental legislation on local authorities has grown and the local authorities are obliged to implement the statutes. This brings me to the nub of my point. The growing body of legislation has to be policed and imposed on very sharp, clever, well financed individuals who, for example, may own derelict sites and want to avoid doing anything except when it benefits their own bank account.</P>
    <P>I cannot see how the local authorities can discharge those functions in the current climate of reduced budgets and very substantially reduced staff.  Quite recently the Minister for Finance told me in a written reply that in 1989 there would be 500 fewer staff employed at national level by the local authorities.  The public service numbers are due to drop this year by 3,000.  How are the local authorities going to implement this Bill when we know there has been a virtual exodus from the local authorities of senior staff, from engineering level down to the rank and file clerical officer grade?  By virtue of the major cuts in the rate support grant, the local authorities will not be in a position to effectively implement the complex provisions of this legislation together with all the other requirements imposed on them each year.  To that extent I have the greatest reservations about seeing the Derelict Sites Bill impacting on the local scene.  There is an absolute requirement on the Minister to ensure that the moneys will be provided. <Col N="770" /> Admittedly, the Minister states that there should be some moneys accruing to local authorities from the levy, but as the Minister well knows, the general development levies which the local authorities impose go into the generality of their income. Any increase in staffing or any departure from the embargo or from the promotional rigours laid down by the Department of Finance are carried through to the Department of the Environment and the local authorities.  The levy of itself would not be sufficient to offset the effects of such decisions.  In the greater Dublin area several hundred staff have left the local authority, ranging from engineers, building inspectors right down to clerical staff in the various offices and on that basis I cannot see how this Bill will be rigorously implemented.  That is the essential point I wish to make.</P>
    <P>Indeed, as one travels not only throughout the greater Dublin area but throughout the country one finds a new version of the derelict site, the derelict site is now under the springs of one's car as one meets pothole after pothole on the county roads.  Many of the non-primary routes are now in an appalling condition and there are patches of pure dereliction. In an ironic sort of way, I think the Minister is providing for a widening of the definition of derelict sites.</P>
    <P>I would now like to refer to the waiver of the levy.  I can appreciate that, constitutionally, there must be provision for hardship, otherwise one could find oneself in considerable difficulty, but section 27 provides that the levy may be waived by a local authority in cases of hardship. Frankly, I would have preferred if this was a reserved power of the Minister and that it would be obligatory on the local authority to insist that the levy be paid but that the individual concerned would have the right of appeal to the Minister of the day to have the levy waived.  If this were so there would at least be some prospect that the local authority members would not bow to the invariable pressures to waive the levies on subjective grounds of hardship.  Any developer for multiple reasons can advance all sorts of reasons that he should not be <Col N="771" /> obliged to pay the levy and invariably the local authority members are beseeched and canvassed and then give way and do not impose the levy.</P>
    <P>A great ingredient of the Bill is that it imposes a levy on those who can well afford to pay but who are sitting on property, allowing it to go into general dereliction with the hope that sometime they can obtain a substantial capital gain from the disposal of a site or even a building. I put it to the Minister that the hardship clause is too broad and open-ended and presents an opportunity to mitigate the necessary constraints in the Bill.  This could result in a substantial feature of the Bill being unduly watered down.</P>
    <P>My next point relates to the timescales involved.  I think the Minister may well and should look at the period of understanding afforded by the local authority to the person on whom the strictures of the Bill are being imposed.  I can well appreciate that renewal dates and extension provisions are necessary.</P>
    <P>In my constituency I am sick and tired of walking or driving past derelict sites. I am sick of being contacted by constituents who want to know if anything is being done about a particular derelict site.  The Salthill Hotel site in Dún Laoghaire has lain dormant for years now.  For years there was a very big crane on the site but nothing at all happened.  It became a feature of the landscape for five or six years.</P>
    <P>In down town Dún Laoghaire there is another major shopping centre site only part of which has been developed and the rest has been lying idle for the best part of a decade and even now it is not being fully utilised.  Developers should be compelled to complete developments.  Many undeveloped sites are neglected, unsightly, objectionably half finished and have become simply deposits for the debris and all sorts of rubbish.  The Minister should consider making very rigorous regulations under section 4 and under the general regulations in section 5.  That would strengthen the overall provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="772" /> Another aspect we have to be particularly careful about and which has worried me and a number of other people is that now there is substantial purchasing of inner city sites for prospective shopping centre developments.  I am afraid that in the greater Dublin area there will be too many major shopping developments, as is manifestly evident already in south Dublin, and that in ten to 15 years those major developments will become semi-derelict because the piecemeal unco-ordinated highly individualistic developments which are taking place at a very substantial pace will not be economically viable and because there is not the population to support them, particularly on the retail side.  That, in future, will bring about further decline and ultimately dereliction.  This pinpoints the need for considerable co-ordination in the local authority in their development plans to ensure that in future we will not be faced with the prospect of dereliction inadvertently brought about by a whole series of planning permissions for commercial developments which cannot be guaranteed to pay their way even within a decade or 15 years.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that in the broadest sense we have been badly served by a good deal of what has passed for town planning and development, particularly in the greater Dublin area but also in many parts of our urban conurbations throughout the country.  Part of Dublin, the newest parts of Dublin, are semi-derelict in terms of planning.  One only has to drive through County Dublin into the newer housing estates, into the newer areas which contain populations bigger than many counties in many instances, to see the appalling planning of the local authorities.  Although there is rhythm after rhythm of housing development; one may well describe it as dereliction of the planning process as there are no community centres, educational structures have been belatedly built, shopping centres are miles away and transport facilities are often totally inadequate even in terms of basic car parking within the housing estates for those who live and work and rear their families there.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="773" /> Admittedly there have been some substantial improvements in planning in the past five or six years but a lot of what passed in the sixties and seventies was shameful.  We should be ashamed of it because it has added a dimension of environmental dereliction which today one finds difficult to understand as one visits those areas and as people desperately try to turn them into a living environment.</P>
    <P>Unless the Minister for Finance brings pressure to bear on the Department this Bill will only be an interesting piece of legislation, a very valuable piece of legislation. Unless there are staff in the local authorities who will go out and face down the developers and the owners of derelict sites, and unless the local authorities are prepared not to contribute to dereliction, the real impact of this Bill will be substantially reduced.</P>
    <P>That would be a pity because I strongly commend the Bill as excellent legislation in many respects.  The Bill is long overdue. My party placed this legislation in their manifestos at every election for the past 12 to 15 years.  We are pleased to give the Bill our support and to co-operate on Committee Stage in the further improvement of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Minister for the Marine (Mr. Daly) Brendan Daly">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Daly)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister had to leave to attend an urgent meeting and he asked me to reply to the debate on his behalf.  The Minister has left me his notes to refer in detail to some of the issues that had been raised in the Second Stage debate.  The Minister thanks all the Deputies who contributed to the debate.  The issues raised covered a wide variety of important aspects and emphasised the complexity of the questions and the variety of measures necessary to deal with the problem.  The Minister expressed his deep appreciation for the constructive Second Stage debate and wished to refer in some detail to some of the points raised by Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Farrelly made a number of sensible points about the need for local authorities to get their houses in order in this area and about the value of taking early preventive action to prevent problems of dereliction.  Deputy Farrelly as well as Deputy Keating spoke about the need for <Col N="774" /> simpler CPO procedures and the Minister supports this aspiration but would point out that derelict sites legislation has traditionally embodied straightforward procedures for land acquisition by local authorities.  These relatively simple procedures are contained in sections 15 to 20 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keating spoke of certain problems which could affect the administration of the derelict sites levy.  He objected to the inclusion of a waiver provision in Part III of the Bill.  I should like to point out that waiver provisions are a standard and routine feature of local authority taxation and charging systems and they are not, as far as the Minister is aware, a concession to the perceived rights of property but rather a flexible instrument of administration commonly embodied in local government legislation. Deputy Keating also spoke about the difficulties of establishing ownership given the limitations of our system of land registration.  Section 25 of the Bill, however, makes a derelict sites levy a charge on the land involved.  In other words, however covert an owner may be, he or she will still have to reckon with the levy in the context of disposing in any way of his or her interest in the land.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quinn spoke convincingly of the need for an overall urban strategy within which the Bill would need to be administered in urban areas.  The Minister would fully endorse this point having already emphasised in his opening speech the inter-connection of planning, urban renewal and derelict sites policies.  He would agree with Deputy Quinn that we must take care to avoid over-supplying the market with public lands at any given time.  These, of course, are matters of administrative judgment rather than of the present draft legislation.  It is unlikely that much of the land awarded by statutory bodies in urban areas would have been acquired compulsorily in any event provided the acquisition had taken place some time ago and compensation paid to the previous owner.  The Minister's advice is that the courts would be most unlikely to question the bona fides of a CPO because its earlier purpose was no longer extant.  Deputy Quinn spoke also about the dereliction of isolated older <Col N="775" /> dwellings in rural areas.  The Minister believes that this kind of situation is suitable for intervention under the Bill by the county councils concerned and he will highlight this when instructing the local authorities as to the implementation of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sherlock raised many interesting questions of detail on the interpretation of the Bill which by and large would be more appropriate to be teased out on Committee Stage.  Briefly, dereliction is a somewhat relative concept in the sense that the condition of dereliction relates to the surroundings in which a structure is situated and its impact on a neighbourhood.  A tasteful hoarding around a site might, therefore, in some circumstances be sufficient to render a site non-derelict but in other circumstances it might not.</P>
    <P>Deputy Stafford spoke about the problems of dereliction in the north inner city of Dublin.  The Minister shares the Deputy's confidence that the Bill will help us better to address these and similar problems in the future.  Deputy O'Brien raised a number of interesting suggestions, including the encouragement of private property owners to undertake regular redecoration and refurbishment of their properties.  He also spoke knowledgeably about the blighting effects of road proposals which are not implemented within a reasonable period. Deputy Wright emphasised that restoration rather than demolition was the preferred strategy in relation to many older buildings.  These buildings can be of a heritage and tourism interest even on a minor scale and enlightened administration of the new Bill should operate to enhance these aspects.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kemmy rightly stressed that first impressions of our towns and streetscapes can be lasting ones.  He argued that we need to overcome our visual laziness and to realise the potential of many buildings of character and style.  Deputy Mary Mooney drew on her experience of Dublin to illustrate the relevance of the Bill to the inner city problems.  Deputy L. Burke spoke interestingly about the approach of Cork Corporation to problems of urban decay and particularly <Col N="776" /> about their urban renewal programme. Deputy Batt O'Keeffe raised a number of interesting points and the Minister will consider these carefully between now and Committee Stage.  Deputy Boylan spoke sensibly about the need for reasonably orderly colour schemes in housing estates and smaller towns.  He rightly stressed that the proper management of dumps and roadside activities is most important to rural amenities.  Deputy Flood stressed the central role of local authorities in the successful administration of the Bill and the Minister is pleased to have his endorsement, as a local government practitioner, of most of the proposals in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deenihan spoke of the importance of tidy streetscapes and landscapes for tourism.  Both he and Deputy Sheehan spoke about the relevance of the urban renewal scheme in combatting dereliction. Deputy Sheehan spoke also of the dereliction problems as they affect rural Ireland.  Deputy Higgins spoke of the credibility problems for some local authorities in the matter of land dereliction given the considerably derelict lands in their ownership.  The Bill faces up honestly to this difficulty and it contains new powers which will allow the Minister to direct local authorities to remedy the condition of these sites or to sell the land.  Deputy Taylor-Quinn asked if the definition of &ldquo;derelict site&rdquo; confined it to land in cities, town and villages.  The answer is no, although part of the concept of dereliction involves detraction from surrounding properties or land.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking the Minister was very encouraged with the positive and constructive contributions made by all Deputies.  He welcomes the consensus that has emerged in the approach to dereliction which should enable all of us to construct a most worthwhile Bill between now and the remaining Stages.</P>

    <Title>Harbours (Shannon Estuary Development Corporation) Bill, 1988: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Minister for the Marine (Mr. Daly) Brendan Daly">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Daly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am very pleased as Minister for the Marine to have the opportunity to initiate this Bill to set up a single development authority for the Shannon estuary which, for obvious reasons, is of special interest to me.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to establish a new body to be known as the Shannon Estuary Development Corporation and to define their functions, powers and jurisdiction.  The corporation will have a mandate to promote, co-ordinate and develop investment in marine-related industrial, tourist, recreational and amenity facilities and to encourage activities likely to contribute to the realisation of the marine potential of the Shannon estuary.  They will also take over, manage and operate the existing harbours at Limerick, Foynes and Kilrush.  The corporation will have jurisdiction over the entire waters of the Shannon estuary from Sarsfield Bridge in Limerick to the sea at Kerry Head - Loop Head.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principal provisions of the Bill are to be found in the following sections: section 3 which provides for the establishment of the proposed Shannon Estuary Development Corporation; section 4 which sets out the functions of the proposed corporation and the parameters of their spending and borrowing as a development agency; and section 5 which defines the area within which the proposed corporation will have responsibility. This area, as I have said, covers <Col N="778" /> the estuarial waters of the river Shannon and includes Limerick harbour, Foynes harbour and Cappa pier.  Section 6 provides for the location of the corporation's headquarters at Foynes. Section 8 sets out the membership of the corporation and the method of appointment of members and provides that members other than local authority members must have expertise in finance, commerce, shipping, law or management, Sections 14 and 15 provide for the transfer of staff from the present authorities for Limerick, Foynes and Kilrush harbours to the new corporation and for the preservation of their terms and conditions of service and pension rights.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are no doubt aware, this is not the first occasion on which proposals for the setting up of a single authority for the Shannon estuary have been put before this House.  The concept of a single estuarial authority has been under discussion for a period in excess of twenty years and has received the support of almost all Ministers who have been responsible for commercial harbours during that time.  Successive Ministers have had extensive negotiations with the various interests involved over the last ten to twelve years.  Bills providing for a single harbour authority for the estuary were introduced in 1977 and 1986, but lapsed on the dissolution of the Dáil in those years.</P>
    <P>I consider the establishment of a single estuarial authority as vital to the development of the unique potential of the estuary. The estuary is a large natural resource and it should be managed and marketed as such.  It has not been developed to its full potential to date; such development as has taken place has been as a piecemeal operation in different places and by different organisations with no overall co-ordinated approach. Despite this, developments, particularly those in more recent years, have confirmed the enormous potential of the estuary for industry and services requiring deepwater facilities.  These developments, which include the ESB coal burning station at Moneypoint, the alumina project at Aughinish, as well as the oil jetty near Shannon Airport, have <Col N="779" /> resulted in the total tonnage of goods through the Shannon estuary increasing from 1.467 million in 1982 to 5.219 million in 1987.</P>
    <P>The estuary has outstanding advantages. Its unique maritime capability provides opportunities for industrial development almost without equal in Europe.  It has the capacity with minimal dredging to handle bulk cargo vessels of 400,000 dwt. which only three other sheltered harbours in Europe can accommodate. It is not affected by congested or shallow approaches, shortage of land or labour or the environmental constraints imposed by the proximity of large centres of population.</P>
    <P>The thinking behind the setting up of the Department of the Marine in relation to harbour development was to bring all harbour works under the one administrative and planning umbrella, whether commercial, fishery or recreational. Since my appointment as first Minister for the Marine, I have been reviewing strategies with a view to more rational and integrated planning of harbour development.  Among the ideas considered was extension of the composition, brief and responsibility of traditional harbour authorities.  I see the role of a harbour authority as extending beyond the mere management and operation of their harbour to the extent that it should complement the work of other development agencies in an area.  The Bill you now have before you is a product of this review and will, I hope, be the base from which further industrial and commercial activities will be attracted to the Shannon estuary area in the future.  I see this Authority in the constitutional and functional sense as providing a model for the establishment of similar authorities for other portal areas.</P>
    <P>The main advantages that can be expected from the establishment of the development corporation for the Shannon estuary are that it will bring about a more cohesive approach to the future planning, development and promotion of the estuary; facilitate further development of the estuary's already illustrated advantages through the pooling of the <Col N="780" /> capital resources and planning of its harbours; help to avoid costly duplication of facilities and services leading to better deployment of financial resources; and enhance the case for EC and Exchequer grants for infrastructural development.</P>
    <P>Since becoming Minister, I have had prolonged and detailed discussions with the various interests in the region.  Special efforts have been made by me to get a consensus among the parties in favour of a single authority.  Time will prove that being part of a single authority, having access to a larger pool of resources, including financial resources to aid further development, will provide all regions on the estuary with more opportunities than handicaps.  I am convinced that a Shannon Authority without Foynes would be meaningless and I am accordingly proposing to include Foynes harbour within the scope of the new Bill from the outset.</P>
    <P>I have decided that the headquarters of the new corporation should be located at Foynes.  I have done this partly in recognition of the achievements of Foynes harbour to date, partly to indicate that the setting up of the corporation is not intended to deprive Foynes of its present status as a progressive port, but mainly because I consider Foynes an ideal central location on the estuary from which the corporation can become a dynamic instrument for maritime economic development in the area.</P>
    <P>I am aware that certain aspects of this Bill have aroused controversy, particularly the question of the size and composition of the proposed corporation. Various reasons have been advanced to me, for instance, why one region should be given greater representation than another.  To work efficiently and effectively, the corporation need a significantly smaller membership than existing major harbour authorities which have a membership of up to 27.  It is for this reason that in section 8 of the Bill I am setting the total membership of the board at 13, which I consider the most efficient sized board consistent with adequate provision being made for a wide variety of interests along the estuary.  In order to ensure that the right calibre of person is appointed, I have also included <Col N="781" /> a provision that members will be required to have wide experience of, or capacity in, finance, commerce, shipping, law or management.</P>
    <P>Provision is made for one member each from Kerry, Clare and Limerick County Councils and from Limerick Corporation. SFADCo will have one member, port users two members and Foynes interests two members in recognition of that harbour's importance for the successful operation of the corporation. I will appoint all members of the board and will also appoint one of the 13 as chairman.</P>
    <P>Reference has also been made to the fact that all the small piers on the estuary are not being brought under the control of the corporation, that overlapping between the corporation and other development agencies in the region will result and that the future of existing staff is not adequately protected.</P>
    <P>The Harbours Bill, 1986 provided for the transfer of a number of small public piers in the estuary to the proposed new authority.  The piers in question were Clarecastle, Saleen, Kilteery and Tarbert. Other small public piers on the estuary e.g. Kildysart, Killimer, Glin were not, however, being transferred.  None of the small piers in question has any commercial importance, save that the Shannon car ferry operates between Killimer and Tarbert.  It was a condition of Exchequer assistance that the ferry terminal facilities would be under the control of the respective county councils. There is provision under section 134 of the Harbours Act, 1946 whereby they could be transferred to the corporation at a later date should circumstances so warrant.  For the present, I have excluded them from the Bill.</P>
    <P>The development powers being conferred on the new corporation are expressed to apply only to the area within its jurisdiction where such development would be considered a normal function. Marine-related facilities cover a wide area such as shipbuilding, yacht or boat chartering, operation of marinas, aquaculture, fishing and water sports, not all of which would affect trade through the ports of the estuary.  The corporation will <Col N="782" /> be primarily concerned with the promotion of the estuary in relation to its suitability for certain activities.  If their promotional efforts succeed in attracting a prospective developer, the relevant State agency would then become involved.  The presence of a SFADCo member on the board will ensure that promotional activity will be undertaken without diffusion of effort.  My colleagues, the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Finance, agree with me on this.  Furthermore, to ensure that port users' money is not used for activities other than commercial harbour activities, the Bill includes a provision that any investment in other marine related facilities will require my consent which will only be given if the proposed investment is capable of achieving a commercially acceptable rate of return.</P>
    <P>With regard to the fears of existing staff of the harbour authorities about their future, let me state that the normal policy in regard to a reorganisation involving employees is to ensure that the status and conditions of the employees concerned suffers no diminution in consequence of the implementation of reorganisation plans.  There is provision for this in the Bill.  Accordingly there is no reason for Deputies to be concerned about the existing staff of the harbour authorities being transferred to the corporation.</P>
    <P>I consider the corporation, as proposed, to be the appropriate type of body to manage the estuary into the next century. I have no doubt that in due course local interests in the estuary will appreciate that sensible compromises have to be made in establishing a body like the Shannon Estuary Development Corporation and that the new corporation will eventually attract the full support of all local bodies.  I hope this Bill will command the support of this House and that the launching of the corporation will give further impetus to the already impressive growth of the estuary.</P>
    <P>Since the Bill was first circulated to Deputies amendments mainly of a techincal nature have been proposed and I will be introducing these at Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I see the establishment <Col N="783" /> of the proposed corporation as the first step in a rational and integrated planning of harbour development to ensure that resources available are used in a way which will ensure maximum return to the State and I am confident that it will serve as a catalyst to generate employment and increase the general prosperity of the area.</P>
    <P>In the context of the Harbours Act, 1946 &mdash; the legislative code under which commercial harbours operate &mdash; I consider that the initiative I am taking is innovative both in the constitutional and functional aspects of harbours.  I have realised for some time that harbours which tended in the past to be seen only as locations for commercial port activity in the strict sense have potential of another kind in the areas of tourist attraction and job creation.  I have for this reason taken the unusual step of broadening the remit of the Shannon Estuary Development Corporation to include the promotion and development of marine related industrial, tourism, recreational and amenity facilities.</P>
    <P>I must be certain that our ports are properly geared in physical and in financial terms to face the challenges of 1992 and Ireland's relative isolation from the rest of the European Community arising from the expected completion of the Channel Tunnel in 1993.  Where ancillary activities such as marine recreation add to the assets of the Shannon Estuary Development Corporation they will help to ensure is financial prepartions for the challenges of the 1990s.</P>
    <P>While the purpose of this Bill is related to the Shannon Estuary, it reflects my thinking in relation to the constitutional and functional roles of commercial harbours generally.  I have already set in train a review of the Harbours Act, 1946, and the practical application of what is proposed in the present Bill before the House will be invaluable in farming the new blueprint for commercial harbours generally,</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>Today is an historic day in this House in that we are dealing with a second Bill relating to the <Col N="784" /> mid-west region.  Earlier we discussed the extension of SFADCo's responsibilities to include north Kerry.  There is a great deal of confusion between SFADCo and SEDCo.  People do not understand why another layer of bureaucracy is being established in an area where there is already a development corporation, namely SFADCo.  I am not sure the title of this Bill is suitable.</P>
      <P>We are dealing with one of the finest estuaries in Europe which has tremendous potential for commercial and industrial development.  SFADCo are responsible for the promotion and development of the entire region and the responsibilities of the body which will be established under this Bill will overlap those of SFADCo.  I hope the Minister will amend the Bill in order to give a clearer definition of these responsibilities. The Minister, in his capacity as a public representative for the mid-west during the past 15 years, has a particular interest in the development of the estuary, which this Bill is designed to promote. However, I am not sure that the Bill represents the perfect solution in terms of estuarial development.</P>
      <P>With the evolution of the free market in 1992 we will have access to more than 320 million people in the European Community, but we will be the only country without land access to continental Europe.  It is extremely important that we, as an island nation, should have a well thought out ports policy for the whole country.  Sea transport cannot operate effectively without efficient and cost effective port facilities.  This Bill is supposed to be a prototype for all our other ports.  Certainly we need a cohesive policy in regard to port development. The European Community has policies in relation to air, road and rail transport but unfortunately there is a deficiency in relation to sea transport, which is regarded as a poor relation.  That is why we need to give sea transport a high priority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland is basically an exporting nation. About 75 per cent of our goods are exported, mainly to Britain.  Only 0.5 per cent of our exports are sent by air.  These are high value commodity goods which <Col N="785" /> need speedy transportation.  The remainder of our exports travel by sea.  In 1980 our exports were valued at £3.9 billion and that figure has risen by 1987 to £10.5 billion.  If the Government are serious about creating 20,000 jobs per annum, as stated in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> it is important that we should be competitive.  We need good, well developed ports which can compete with those in Northern Ireland.  It is vitally important to create jobs and produce goods which will be competitive in the European market.</P>
    <P>We are in a vulnerable position.  Time is now an important factor in transportation. Storage is costly and producers are trying to reduce the cost of storage in the countries to which they export.  For that reason the transporter in many instances becomes the manufacturer's storage facility.  Therefore, it is essential to have an efficient port facility where carriers can get to their destinations as quickly as possible, which is extremely important.</P>
    <P>Investment in the port industry is the key to greater economy, efficiency and lower operating costs.  In continental countries there has been great investment in national and local courts.  By comparison, there has been very little investment in Ireland.  In Europe there is a hard-nosed business realisation that trade brings prosperity and that investment in port infrastructure is a major element for the potential development of these countries.  It is unfortunate that this is not true of Ireland and that is why I had hoped this Bill would produce a formula for major port development.  Over the years any assistance we have been given has been on a socio-economic basis rather than on a commercial one.  We have reacted to situations instead of planning in a structured, coherent fashion.</P>
    <P>A major concern, particularly to the ports of Dublin and the east coast, is that there is strong competition from Northern Ireland in whose ports the British Government have invested generously. The result is that, in many instances, they are able to provide a service at a far lower cost than in the South.  That is extremely serious and the Minister and his Department should address this problem <Col N="786" /> because there is a leakage of revenue from the South to the North and the Government have not addressed the problem.  The Bill will not address the problem either.</P>
    <P>Various studies have been done on various ports in Ireland and many recommendations have been made.  The Minister for finance, when he was Minister for Industry and Commerce, announced that he was having a study done on ports in Ireland and he particularly specified the Shannon Estuary and its potential.  That announcement was reiterated by his successor, Minister Burke, over the weekend.  Why did the Government not wait for the results of that study before they introduced this Bill?  I know there are various strands of opinion within Government in relation to the Bill and a certain amount of playacting even within Cabinet in relation to it.  The situation in west Limerick of Collins versus Noonan versus Daly is an interesting saga.</P>

      <P>My remarks were relevant to the Bill.  I am sure you understand the intrigues although it must be irritating to have to maintain a certain aloofness.  The present legislative framework within which each harbour authority operates is based on the Harbours Act, 1946, which in turn was based on the investigations that took place between 1926 and 1928.  Unquestionably, the legislation is totally outdated and there is a need for its revision.  I can appreciate that the Minister is anxious to have this Bill passed.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil, in their <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> said that they wanted to create 20,000 new jobs and being an island nation, an efficient port service is an integral part of that achievement because it means cost-effectiveness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also wish to refer to pilots and pilotage in the Shannon Estuary and their position as a result of this legislation.  As the Minister is aware, there is a loose arrangement between the pilots on the Shannon, the Limerick Harbour Commissioners and the Foynes Commissioners which has operated very effectively over the years.  The Bill does not clearly elucidate the position of the pilots in the new structure.  I am extremely concerned about traditional pilot families in the mid-west region who have a tremendous knowledge and experience of the river and who have been involved in it for generations.  What is their future under this new authority? Will they be employed or pensioned off? Will they work on a contract basis?  How secure is their position?  This is very important because there is a tendency for many people to believe that piloting a boat on a waterway is the same as driving a car.  The reality is that one has to be familiar with the various currents in the river and the movements of the water which can vary from time to time and from season to season.  It is a very skilled job which needs highly qualified people. Their job is often under estimated by people in administration who ignore the importance of these skills in relation to <Col N="788" /> waterways.  I should like the Minister to assure the House that the people with those very fine skills, who have been involved in the Shannon Estuary for generations, will be accommodated in the new structure.  That is vitally important.</P>
    <P>The Bill changes the overall structure of harbours and responsibility for them. He proposes to give responsibilities to this Authority not normally given to a harbour authority.  Here we are talking about responsibilities in respect of marina developments, marine recreational facilities and aquaculture developments.  I am not sure whether this would be a wise move as it is my belief that the ports along the estuary should be developed so as to accommodate very large ships.  As the Minister is aware, the size of ships entering the estuary has increased from a tonnage of 10,000 tonnes to 15,000, a 15 fold increase while the volume of goods passing through the estuary has increased 12 fold during the past 25 years.</P>
    <P>Much development has taken place along the estuary, the most significant being the development at Moneypoint. The jetty at Moneypoint is able to accommodate the largest of the ships entering the estuary.  In addition much activity takes place at the jetty at Shannon Airport, the port at Limerick and the harbour at Foynes.  It is important that these be developed, along with others, so as to accommodate very large ships.  The Shannon estuary is the second largest in Europe.  Not alone are we speaking about accommodating very large vessels but also about accommodating heavy industry. Therefore, it would be advisable to make a major effort to promote such development and to leave the other details to the Department of the Marine or to SFADCo.  We should push very hard for the development of deep water harbours and try to attract heavy industry into the region.  While the minor activities are important, in order to create jobs we need to look at the possibility of attracting heavy industry into the region.  This Bill proposes to give the new Authority much wider responsibilities and because of this their attention may be diverted away from such an objective.  This would be unfortunate.</P>

      <P>That is a special case and can be catered for very adequately by the Department of the Marine.  I hope the Minister will establish an aquacultural industry there for which this Authority would not have responsibility.</P>
      <P>Some of the Minister's colleagues expressed serious concern when in Opposition about adding further layers to the layers of bureaucracy that already existed.  The leader article in the 17 May 1986 edition of the <i>Limerick Leader</i> pointed out that the present Minister for Justice warned the then Minister for Communications, Deputy Mitchell, against having too many layers of bureaucracy; that a Bill which Deputy Mitchell was introducing would add another layer of bureaucracy to the already top heavy bureaucracy which existed; that the Harbours Bill would be in dry dock before along; that it had no financial element contained within it and would further complicate the promotion of the Shannon estuary.  He further added that if the then Government were serious about developing this great estuary there were already sufficient agencies in place to carry out the work needed without establishing another.  I wonder how Deputy Collins managed to change his stance within two years.  Those comments were an indication of what his views were.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government propose to add another layer of bureaucracy in the form of a corporation.  Deputy Mitchell introduced a harbours Bill and did not intend to establish a corporation. This corporation would have similar responsibilities to those of SFADCo. Earlier today I referred to that matter in the course of the debate on the Shannon Free Airport Development Company Limited (Amendment) Bill.  It is time that a look was taken to see what exactly is required.  What is required in my view is the introduction of a harbours Bill with <Col N="790" /> the specific objectives of developing deep water facilities in the Shannon estuary and the improvement of the existing port facilities.  If this were done we would then be able to attract, through the existing agencies, heavy industries into the region.</P>
      <P>It is not quite clear as to what this Bill aims to achieve.  I intend to table amendments to the Bill on Committee Stage, as it is not clear what is going to happen on a whole range of issues.  There is no reference to Clarecastle in the Bill and I wonder why this is so.</P>

The interesting nigger among the woodpile, and this may answer some of your political dilemmas, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, would be the commissioners at Foynes who have been working very successfully for many years. Under this legislation the headquarters of this new corporation would be based at Foynes along with giving specific responsibility to the harbour master and the secretary of the board there.  The reality is that the Foynes authority do not want to cut, shuffle or deal with this <Col N="791" /> legislation.  They were to remain and operate as they have been operating over the years and not be included in this, but for some strange reason when the Minister, Deputy Noonan, was in Australia and the Minister, Deputy Daly, was about to publish the Bill, the Minister for Justice ran ahead a few days of the Minister for the Marine and made an announcement&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing this matter to be raised on the Adjournment tonight.  It is a matter of the utmost importance and needs to be dealt with urgently in this House and by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The current behaviour of Dunnes Stores in selling bread at 39p and below this price is a clear case of predatory pricing and an absolute abuse of their dominant position in the marketplace. Their intention in doing this is to put as many bakeries as possible out of business and to gain control of the retailing of <Col N="792" /> bread.  This is not in the interests of the consumer or the bakery industry as a whole.</P>
    <P>In some way this pricing problem that has arisen, which is being serious, is being called a price war, perhaps for want of a better word, but we need to be very careful to distinguish between price wars that spring up over time in all sectors of industry, many of which are as a result of real competition in the marketplace and a desire by one company or another to increase their market share, thereby increasing their profit and hoping to expand their business and increase employment.  The distinction should be made between what I have just outlined as a price war and what we are seeing here in the last few weeks.  In this instance we are seeing a very clear and absolute abuse of a dominant position by a company in the marketplace.  That is the kernel of the issue.  It is not what it appears to be in simplistic terms, some kind of price war happening out there.</P>
    <P>The average price of bread in Dunnes Stores in 1987 through 1988 was 58p to 59p.  This was on their own St. Bernard brand.  When the price of an 800 gramme loaf fell to 35p the Minister for Industry and Commerce made an order which restored the price of bread to 55p.  At that time he stated he felt 55p was a fair price that represented the cost of producing a loaf of bread and allowed a reasonable margin at retail level.  Very quickly he removed this order, somehow satisfied that 55p was a reasonable price. The immediate response from Dunnes Stores, however, was to reduce the price of bread to 49p.  To my amazement and that of the Progressive Democrats there were some mumblings or ramblings that suddenly 45p was a reasonable price in the marketplace.  This represented a 10p difference over a few weeks and a 25 per cent difference on the original price set by the Minister.  After this the immediate response, quite interestingly, from Dunnes Stores, was to reduce the price of bread to 35p.  The company were flying totally and utterly in the face of the Minister and the Department of Industry and Commerce.  Obviously they feel under no constraint to pay any attention to what the Department and the Minister have to <Col N="793" /> say.  That is a very serious course of action for this company to adopt and it behoves us here to look very closely at the matter.</P>
    <P>Serious inconsistencies emanate from the Minister himself in that he has in the space of four to five weeks made contradictory statements and now his response is to await a report from the Director of Consumer Affairs.  This is certainly not a satisfactory course of action.  If the Minister is to wait for some indefinite time and hide behind the report from the Director of Consumer Affairs he is in a sense abdicating his responsibility in this matter.  I do not believe any Minister in a Government should behave in this manner.</P>
    <P>The bakery industry in now being brought to its knees and the Government seem to be standing by and somehow allowing this to happen.  The object of the exercise, I believe the Minister is fully aware, is to ride roughshod over the whole industry to its total detriment with no concern for the jobs involved, the livelihood of the people employed in that industry and the general consequences of such a course of action.  The Minister must bear in mind that a huge range of bakeries operate throughout the country. Many small towns and villages are very dependent on them for their livelihood. In the context of what we are talking about it is not acceptable for any Minister to allow this course of action to continue. This type of short-term price is most certainly not in the interest of the consumer. If Dunnes Stores are successful in gaining control of the market the price of bread could easily rocket up to as much as 90p and of course the consumer at this point will have nowhere to turn because the competition will effectively have been eliminated from the marketplace.  I cannot believe this is the course of action this Government and this Minister want to see pursued.</P>
    <P>I accept there is a need for rationalisation in the bakery industry.  The Minister knows well it is happening at present and a large number of bakeries have already closed their doors.  Companies such as O'Rourkes, Bolands, M &amp; B, Brennans of Arklow, Downes Bakery in Finglas, one of the largest with 300 jobs, have gone, and I am sure further <Col N="794" /> rationalisation will take place within the industry.  I do not believe that what Dunnes Stores are about is to become the role model for rationalisation within an industry.  The whole process is to be telescoped into two or three weeks for the benefit of one company, not for the benefit of the consumer or the industry either at retail, milling or wholesale levels.  One company have sought to abuse totally their position in the marketplace.</P>
    <P>As regards the rationalisation of the industry, it is worth bearing in mind how and why this course of action occurred. Between 1975 and 1986 the cost of the Government's subsidy to the bakery industry totalled £247 million.  This brought about huge growth in the industry. I am surprised to find in some counties &mdash; I do not want to pick on any county in particular &mdash; there were more bakeries than are in the whole city and county of Dublin.  That is extraordinary.  This was brought about by the subsidy that was in operation.  The tragedy is that the consumer never benefited from the subsidy. That is one reason why rationalisation is necessary and is taking place.  Rationalisation has some distance to go but it must take place in an orderly fashion.</P>
    <P>Dunnes Stores are at present selling bread in Northern Ireland at the equivalent of IR67p and if that is a reasonable price there there must be something wrong with the price of IR39p in the Republic.  I am sure the Minister is aware that large quantities of flour are purchased in the UK.  It is surplus to requirements and amounts to a form of dumping on the Irish market.  That is undermining the Irish milling industry.  I do not want to be accused of being a person who is not prepared to accept that companies have the right to purchase their raw materials at the best price because that is not the idea behind purchasing flour in the UK.  The intention is to gain total control of the market without any regard for consumers or the Irish milling industry which has gone through some difficult times and has had to adopt a programme of rationalisation.  It would be wrong of us if we did not ask why they should be put under further unfair pressure as a result of anti-competitive behaviour and <Col N="795" /> an abuse of a dominant position.  It is important to stress those facts tonight.  I do not want the Minister to describe this as a type of price war in competitive areas because I will not accept that view. Consumers and retailers will not accept it because it is not the case.  An attempt is being made to gain control of the market and the Minister cannot close his eyes to that.  He must take immediate action.</P>
    <P>What is most regretable about this is that the Minister in the last two weeks vehemently opposed the Enterprise (Competition and Consumer Protection) Bill, 1989 which was introduced by the Progressive Democrats.  If the House had passed that Bill, and its provisions were passed into law, we would not be discussing these problems.  Dunnes Stores would be deterred from these practices because they could be prosecuted and, if found guilty, forced to pay substantial damages to injured parties.  They would have been liable to prosecution under that Bill for an abuse of their dominant position and disregard for normal competitive practices.  The pro-competitive elements must outweigh all anti-competitive practices and our Bill would have done that, If it had been adopted we would have been rid of this behaviour once and for all.  Unfortunately, the Minister and the Government, for pretty reasons and without putting up one solid argument &mdash; they only pointed to some drafting errors &mdash; opposed what was a worthwhile piece of legislation.</P>
    <P>It is with great regret that I must call on the Minister to look at the system of pricing bread.  It is because of the blatant disregard for the Minister's attempts to permit the companies involved to regulate the price of bread that he must, as a short term measure, introduce a minimum price.  I do not see that as a long term solution.  The Minister should take a proper course of action at a later stage based on what the Director of Consumer Affairs has to say in regard to the price of bread.  In my view, and I believe it is a view that is shared by the Minister and those involved in the business the only solution to this problem is for the Minister to introduce legislation along the <Col N="796" /> lines of our Bill which was defeated in the Dáil last night.  He will have to introduce into domestic law a general ban on anti-competitive practices and abuses of dominant positions.  There is no other course of action open to him.  I could spend the next hour expanding on the needs for such action.  The Minister is aware of why it is necessary but we have another example of the Government failing to face reality.  The people who are suffering as a result of Government inaction are those who are trying to run small businesses.  The Government are refusing to produce clear competition laws covering all sectors of the economy and why they refuse to do that is something I cannot understand.  I hope the Minister will respond positively to what I have said and will take action to benefit retailers, producers, whesalers and millers who are waiting for it.  It behoves him, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, to take appropriate action.</P>

      <P>We have heard the ultimate in hypocrisy from Deputy Cullen, representing I presume, his party.  For the last two weeks we have listened to the bleeding hearts of the Progressive Democrats for the consumer.  They called for competition but tonight they want me to introduce ministerial orders in regard to the price of bread.  The Deputy referred to abuse of a dominant position but I should like to know how anybody can say that a business in the retail trade has a dominant position when there are so many operators, including various multiples.  They are not the characteristics of a market that is dominated by one undertaking.</P>
      <P>There have been positive developments in recent years in the bakery industry. New technology, working methods and marketing approaches have brought about improvements.  The benefits of these improvements need to be shared with consumers.  The high retail price of bread at the top of the range does not appear to reflect any real sharing of benefits with the consumer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not part of Government policy to interfere in the day to day operation of the market place.  Our policy is to provide <Col N="797" /> the legislative and economic framework that will allow competition in the market place to operate in a free and fair manner. The Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order, 1987, which bans below cost selling, among other things, provides such a framework in the retail grocery trade.</P>
    <P>Where an undertaking avails of the opportunities to produce and market commodities according to the most efficient methods it cannot be argued that the consumer should be deprived of any benefits.  So long as the undertaking does not operate in an unfair manner its use of new methods, where it results in a price or quality advantage in the market, will act as a legitimate spur to others in the industry to match its efforts.  A policy that stifles legitimate competition will result in continued stagnation in the economic sector concerned.  Such competition cannot be held back in the long term. The more it is held back the greater the shock when free and fair market forces are allowed to operate.</P>
    <P>Attention has been drawn to the alleged below-cost selling of bread by some of the major multiples and to the possibility of job losses in the bakery industry resulting from this practice. These complaints centred on the sale of the 800 gramme white and brown sliced pans by some of the major multiples at prices which might be in breach of the Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order, 1987.</P>
    <P>As the House will be aware this order, which came into effect on 11 December 1987, prohibits the selling, or advertising for sale, of grocery goods &mdash; including alcoholic beverages &mdash; below cost price. The order also prohibits payment or receipt of &ldquo;hello money&rdquo;.  Grocery goods are defined in the order as meaning grocery goods for human consumption &mdash; excluding fresh fruit, fresh vegetables, fresh and frozen meat, fresh fish and frozen fish which has undergone no processing other than freezing with or without the addition of preservatives &mdash; and intoxicating liquors not for consumption on the premises and such household necessities &mdash; other than foodstuffs &mdash; as are ordinarily sold in grocery shops.  The order includes grocery goods designated <Col N="798" /> as &ldquo;own label&rdquo;, &ldquo;generic&rdquo; or other similar descriptions.</P>
    <P>When this matter was first brought to our attention in early January, the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade, who has responsibility for the investigation of such complaints under the order and for its enforcement, was immediately requested by me to undertake an investigation into the matter.</P>
    <P>I would like to inform the House that the director's investigation produced no evidence of a breach of the groceries order by the multiples concerned and therefore there was no basis for him to institute a prosecution.  The director did, however, consider it appropriate to undertake an investigation into the true production costs of an 800 gramme sliced pan.  This would enable him to establish the prices at which an economic return can be made from the production of bread.  It will be some weeks before this complex exercise can be completed.  Preliminary indications are, however, that modern methods can lead to the production of bread and its retail sale at levels below those which have obtained in the marketplace before this.</P>
    <P>Because the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade was still investigating whether there was a breach of the Groceries Order, I considered it desirable &mdash; because of the fears expressed of considerable jobs losses in the bakery industry and the failure to achieve a voluntary pause &mdash; to introduce the Retail Prices (Bread) Order, 1989. The effect of this order was to restore the price of the 800 gramme sliced pan to the level obtaining before Christmas and to bring about a pause in the apparent instability in the market.  The order brought about a degree of stability and enabled the situation to be further investigated by the Director.</P>
    <P>By order dated 3 February 1989 I revoked the Retail Prices (Bread) Order, 1989.  I considered that the order, in the particular circumstances in which it had been introduced, had produced the degree of stability that was necessary to ensure that while the matter was being investigated there would not be undesirable and uncontrolled developments. The long term continuation of such an <Col N="799" /> order would produce a degree of rigidity in the marketplace which would be inappropriate and unfair to the consumer whose interests we have heard defended here at great length over the past couple of weeks and rightly so.  The order was not, as has been asserted by some, a minimum price order.  What it did was to freeze prices so that there could be no upward or downward movement in relation to the prices charged on 20 December last.</P>
    <P>This type of order is necessarily inflexible. Deputies will appreciate that on 20 December the actual prices being charged varied as between outlets.  This meant that where one outlet was charging a lower price than another it was not possible for the competitor to adjust his price.</P>
    <P>By so revoking the order the forces of competition were allowed to operate and I understood that the Progressive Democrats were in favour of the forces of competition.  I am aware that under these market conditions the price of the 800 gramme sliced pan has since been reduced to 39p by some multiples.  I must point out that there is no evidence that there is any breach of the below-cost selling order at this price.</P>
    <P>Indeed, I would ask why any manufacturer should be restricted from placing his product, whether it be the sliced pan or any other product, on the market at the most competitive price consistent with an efficient operation.  I do not believe that he should, nor do I accept that it would be a healthy state of affairs, for any requirement on a manufacturer to have to sell a product at a particular price as a result of State intervention, except in the highly unusual circumstances that prevailed in early January. This Government believe in the minimum level of interference in the marketplace. Efficiency of production is central to this issue.</P>

      <P>It is my belief that many of the present difficulties have been brought about by a failure of some firms in the industry to make use of the most efficient means of production.  I strongly urge those in the industry to modernise in their own long term interests and that of their employees.  It may also reflect that excessive margins were being enjoyed at the production or distribution level.  If this means that the consumer has failed to benefit I do not consider that a continuation of this situation should be encouraged.</P>
      <P>I am amazed that a party who would portray themselves as the saviours of free enterprise would endeavour to defend such a situation, as was done by Deputy Cullen in his contribution here this evening.

      <P>The enrolment of any child in school is a matter, in the first instance, for the parents and the relevant school authorities.  There is documentary evidence that this boy has learning disabilities which necessitate special schooling at present.  Arrangments were made, with the agreement of the parents, for the body's enrolment in a school, which would meet his special needs.  It was thought that such an enrolment had been effected on 7 November 1988. However, it is now understood that the boy was withdrawn from the school, without notice, after two weeks.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is advised that the best educational interest of the boy would be served by his return to the school in question. In this connection the parents cannot be compelled to send the boy back to school because the school attendance Act does not apply to pupils with disabilities.</P>

      <P>The refinery improved its yield performance during 1988.  Given the constraints on its volume throughput and the refinery's technology this was a creditable performance.</P>
