      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 9, before section 7, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;7.&mdash;Whenever it is proposed to make a regulation or order under this Act, a draft of each such order or regulation shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas, and the order or regulation shall not come into effect, until a motion approving of the draft has been passed by each such House.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="10" /> The Workers' Party have proposed a similar amendment to other Bills.  The Bill states that the draft of every such regulation and order made under this Bill shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.  According to the Bill it would be regarded as having been passed by each House of the Oireachtas unless an order annulling it has been introduced and passed by each House.  The purpose of this amendment is to reverse that process and to require a positive decision to be made in each case, in other words, every regulation or order made by the Minister would have to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and a positive decision would be required before it could come into effect.  A positive decision would be required to be made by the House in each case.</P>
    <P>The present position is that regulations or orders can slip through if Members are not vigilant enough.  One needs to be very vigilant to be aware of all the regulations and orders laid before the House.  Under the provisions of this legislation, if an order annulling it is not brought in, it automatically becomes part of the legislation.</P>
    <P>Regulations can slip through without the notice of the House in such cases, so where a positive motion is required to pass it, it becomes a decision of the House in each case.  As was pointed out, the effect of my amendment would be to remove section 7 and replace it by the amendment I have put down, that the order or regulation shall not come into effect until a motion approving it has been passed by each House of the Oireachtas.  Therefore I am proposing that amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 7 is a general provision relating to the laying before the House of the Oireachtas of any orders made under Part II of this Bill.  In general an order made must be laid before each House within 21 days of its making and is subject to annulment by resolution of the House.  The amendment put down by Deputy Mac Giolla would, in effect, mean the deletion of section 7 of the Bill. This amendment would require that both <Col N="11" /> Houses of the Oireachtas would have to positively adopt any orders or regulations made under this Part of the Bill.  This is proposed because it could cause undue delay in making orders and regulations. Since the Dáil and Seanad break for some months each year, this would effectively freeze the Minister's power to alter certain matters.</P>
      <P>Some of the orders and regulations covered are minor.  For example, section 21 (3) (b) allows the Minister for Finance to make regulations amending statutes which mention the legal tender note fund. That fund is being abolished as it is no longer considered necessary.  This is an administrative provision and the necessity for a positive resolution in both Houses on such a provision would seem to me extreme.</P>
      <P>In certain cases the orders and regulations made by the Minister are appropriate to his role in having overall responsibility for the financial system. Consequently, he should be in a position to decide under section 22 (2) the level of the appropriations the Central Bank makes to its reserves.  This is a long standing provision first used in the Central Bank Act, 1942 and is a matter appropriate for the Minister for Finance.  In addition it is proper for a Minister for Finance to amend under section 68 (2) the deposit protection account, to change the percentage paid to the deposit protection account under section 51 (2) or to change the definition of eligible deposits under section 58 (1) (b) (vi).</P>

      <P>The Minister says that since both Houses of the Oireachtas may not be sitting for three months of the year my amendment would prevent the Minister from making necessary regulations in that period.  This is extraordinary. As I understand it, even under the section in the Bill the Minister cannot do that.  Whatever order he makes can be annulled in the 21 day period.  If the Minister thinks the Bill as it stands is allowing the Minister to slip through regulations with no reference to the House in the three months in which the <Col N="12" /> House is not sitting, then it is time for Deputies to sit up and take notice and ask where the democracy is in this and what democratic rights we have.  We think we have some rights but obviously we have not when the Minister can fire out regulations in this three months period when we are not sitting, regulations all becoming legally binding, with the attitude, &ldquo;we are all on holidays, this is the time to do it&rdquo;.  It seems to be letting the cat out of the bag and making it absolutely necessary that the amendment I am proposing here be accepted, in other words that ministerial regulations do not become legislation unless approved by the House.  In the normal course of events there will be no problem under the Bill. When the Bill is passed the Minister may make regulations.  It will be a formality bringing them before the House, having agreed them and that is it.  There should be no problem but the House must have the opportunity of agreeing.  The Minister has clearly made known now that the purpose of section 7 as it is in the Bill is that he can just introduce regulations without having any authority from the House.  That worries me very much.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> There <Col N="13" /> are obviously two ways of dealing with regulations which are laid before the House.  One is to allow the House the power of veto which in effect is what the Minister's proposal is.  The second is to require the House to approve the motion positively after debate, which is what Deputy Mac Giolla requires.</P>
      <P>It is more usual in the regulatory powers which derive from a whole Bill like this that it be done in the manner the Minister proposes.  On the other hand, I can see merit in what Deputy Mac Giolla is saying, and if on certain sections of the Bill it is thought the power of regulation requires positive approval in the House it might be better if this type of amendment proposed by Deputy Mac Giolla would apply to particular sections.  I am thinking of a couple of sections in this Bill where that might apply, but the general rule should be as the Minister has proposed. However, there is a case that certain things should not be done by regulation without debate which derives from certain sections of this Bill.  I will be accepting the Minister's draft here but I may bring in amendments on Report Stage to cover certain sections of the Bill so that they would be debated here in the House. As the Minister has rightly pointed out, many of the regulations deal with routine matters and there is no need for an affirmative motion, but on other sections it is worth coming back to the issue again.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 9, paragraph (a), line 34, to delete &ldquo;£1,000&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;£1,500&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides that fines up to a maximum of &ldquo;£1,000&rdquo; could be imposed by a court if certain transgressions under this Bill were proved.  I am suggesting we should increase the maximum from £1,000 to £1,500.  Not that there is anything special about the figures of £1,000 or £1,500, but we are not, in the Bill, deciding the level of penalty, we are deciding the maximum of any penalty which might be imposed by a court.  The last Central Bank Act, which is quoted extensively in the text of this Bill, is the Central Bank Act, 1971.  That is 18 years ago.  I suggest what we put in today in terms of maximum penalties will quickly move out of date in the normal course of inflation.</P>
      <P>It is unlikely that in the short or even medium term a further Central Bank Bill will come before the House. In terms of imposing penalties which are maxima rather than actual, I want to give the Minister the opportunity to comment against the background of what I have said and ask him to consider whether a higher ceiling would be more appropriate to allow more discretion to the courts.  I believe they will have discretion immediately up to £1,000 which is sufficient, but as the years roll by these penalties will become completely out of date and will not be amended in any other legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I sympathise with what Deputy Noonan is saying.  These are penalties on summary conviction without trial and there is the constitutional argument that it is a minor offence and the <Col N="15" /> penalty imposed must be commensurate with its minor nature.  In all the Bills passed since I have been elected to this House, the sum of £1,000 has been conceived of as the upper limit of the penalty of a monetary kind which can be imposed by the court on summary conviction.  It is all a matter of degree and there is a presumption of constitutionality. Whether the High Court or the Supreme Court would knock down a Bill because it specified fines of £1,500 rather than £1,000 is very problematical.  We should not lightly exceed the established criteria as to what is a minor penalty.  In this section and the next we are dealing with cases where an alternative penalty is provided on conviction on indictment. People who are to have serious punishments inflicted on them should be given the right of trial by jury.</P>
      <P>I suggest that the Minister should talk to his colleague, the Minister for Justice, about remedying the problem raised by Deputy Noonan by providing a uniform system of summary penalties which could be varied by order of this House from time to time.  This would obviate the necessity of going through this routine of trying to fix penalties in a given year which over the passage of time become absurd.  Recently the Minister for Justice introduced legislation which set down a uniform trade-off rate between terms of imprisonment in default of payment of fines and the level of fines themselves. This House, instead of going through this contortion, should simply be able to provide for a summary penalty and there should be another statute which provides what the summary penalty is under any Act at any given time.  There should be a uniform power of sentencing.  It would make life much easier for the Judiciary in the District Court in that they would know that in any summary case, subject to whatever exceptions this House would choose to make, the penalties would be of a certain amount.  They would know that such penalties would be constitutional.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would be against raising the amount to £1,500 on the basis that over time <Col N="16" /> it will become the same as £1,000.  We cannot really indulge in inflation accounting. If the High Court has to consider this penalty tomorrow, it cannot consider the point that it may be 18 years before there is another Central Bank Act.  That will not be accepted as a legal argument.  It will be struck down if it is more than minor.</P>

      <P>I have listened with interest to what the Deputies have said. This figure was arrived at in consultation with the Attorney General and for many of the reasons Deputy McDowell has just mentioned.  I suggest to both Deputies that I should have discussions with the Attorney General and the Minister for Justice and we can come back to it on Report Stage.  The £1,000 has been inserted because it is a fine on summary conviction in the District Court.  The going rate was about £1,000 in the sixties and it is now about £1,000.  Deputy Noonan has a reasonable point in that by the time we have another Central Bank Bill a fine of £1,000 could be well out of date.  I am prepared to consider the suggestions and talk to the Attorney General and the Minister for Justice to see if there is an appropriate way to meet the wishes of both Deputies.  I do not have any hang-ups on £1,000 as against £1,500, apart from the reasons I have stated.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> What the Minister and Deputy McDowell have said is very reasonable.  I am putting this forward simply to raise the issue once more.  I appreciate that a certain level of penalty is appropriate for a summary conviction and that if one exceeds that level it might be struck down as unconstitutional. If I remember correctly, in the Bankruptcy Bill as presented last year the penalties on summary conviction were £500.  The Minister for Justice accepted a series of amendments which raised all the penalties to £1,000.  Similar type offences in the financial area were also in that Bill.  When we are legislating for penalties we are almost into &ldquo;top of the head&rdquo; predictions of inflation or what <Col N="17" /> is appropriate.  I think the penalty on summary conviction was £100 until only a few years ago.  Regulations do not work unless sanctions can be applied and if sanctions over the passage of time become absurd then there are no regulations which can effectively be implemented.</P>
      <P>Deputy McDowell's suggestion is a very good one.  We could provide here simply that a summary penalty will apply and there could be another Act under which by regulation the Minister for Justice could update all penalties on a summary nature.  There is certainly a problem and I am simply proposing to increase the fines as the easiest way to initiate a debate.  I accept the Minister's assurances and I am prepared to withdraw my amendments.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This is simply to overcome a practical difficulty which occurs on occasions when prosecutions are instituted by people other than the DPP.  Under the Prosecution of Offences Act, 1974, the fact that the DPP has ordered a prosecution can be stated by the barrister or solicitor appearing for him or the garda conducting the prosecution in court.  That is sufficient proof of that fact.  In cases involving the Revenue Commissioners <Col N="18" /> sometimes one has to produce a certificate of a minute of an order by the Revenue Commissioners to the effect that there is authority for the case to be commenced.  The amendment is designed to provide that whoever is conducting the prosecution for the Central Bank is in the same position as somebody under the 1974 Act acting for the DPP.  If he says to the court that the Central Bank have directed that this prosecution be brought, that is sufficient evidence.  It is not necessary to produce a certificate, a minute or any evidence that the Central Bank, or the board of the Central Bank, have decided to institute the proceedings.</P>

      <P>In page 11, before section 11, to insert the following new section:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;11.&mdash;Where an offence under the Central Bank Acts, 1942 to 1989, is committed by a body corporate or by a person purporting to act on behalf of a body corporate or an unincorporated body of persons and is proved to have been so committed with the consent or approval of, or to have been facilitated <Col N="19" /> by any wilful neglect on the part of, another person (being a director, manager, secretary, member of any committee of management or other controlling authority of such body or official of such body) that other person shall, as well as the body corporate or the person so purporting to act, be guilty of an offence and shall be liable to be proceeded against and punished accordingly.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This is a technical drafting amendment suggested by the draftsman to align the terms of section 11 with similar provisions in other Acts.  No substantive change is involved.  Section 11 in the Bill speaks of a director, manager, secretary and so on being liable in certain cases to the same punishment as the body corporate of which they are the responsible officials. In fact, section 11 refers not only to offences committed by a corporate body but also to offences committed by an unincorporated body.  It is technically incorrect to word section 11 as it is now drafted, and the revised section 11 corrects this defect.</P>

Supposing the committee of an unincorporated body are told by the manager that he or she proposes doing &ldquo;X&rdquo; or &ldquo;Y&rdquo; and they approve of that on a vote, will they commit an offence?  As I see it, they will, because it can be proven that the offence has been committed with the consent or approval of any of those members of the committee.  In my view, the word &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; should be added. To say to a layperson who is a member of the board that he or she is guilty of an offence even though they do not know the law and have followed what the managing director proposed doing, seems a little draconian.  In my view, it will be necessary to state that the person knew it was an offence.  Members of the House give assent to propositions even though their minds do not go with the act, but to find them all guilty, as they are in public, is not being fair in terms of a criminal offence.</P>

      <Col N="21" /> The phrase &ldquo;wilful neglect&rdquo; does not seem to apply to consent or approval.  It may be that the Attorney General will advise the Minister that unless there is a guilty knowledge on the part of a person, the prosecution should not be brought but I would like it stitched into the record that that is what we are providing for.  If the legal advice available is that some guilty knowledge has to be imputed to a person before that person can be prosecuted, that is fine, but I would be worried about creating a strict liability, that a member of a committee or a council would commit an offence without having the remotest idea of what was going on, without knowing that the Central Bank Act exists let alone that that person was contravening it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 12, before section 13, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>"13.&mdash;(1)  The Minister may, after consulting the Bank, by regulation prescribe the fee to be paid to the Bank by any person supervised by it under any enactment and different fees may be prescribed for different classes of persons.</P>
      <P>(2)  Regulations under this section may provide for such incidental or related matters as are, in the opinion of the Minister, necessary to give effect to such fees.</P>
      <P>(3)  In this section `person' includes a financial futures and options exchange within the meaning assigned to it for the purposes of Chapter VIII.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 13 is new and empowers the Minister by regulation to permit the bank to charge fees for supervision.  This is important given the extended areas of supervision being undertaken by the bank under the Bill and the Building Societies Bill.  It is only reasonable that financial institutions which are supervised by the bank should contribute to the cost of supervision.  The Minister will have the determining role in setting such fees and will listen to representations from interested bodies before a fee is specified. That should allay concerns that excessive fees will be charged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsection (1) is self-explanatory and subsection (2) is a catch-all provision to cover incidental matters such as, how, when and to whom the fees shall be paid. Subsection (3) is a declaratory provision to clarify that &ldquo;person&rdquo; includes a future exchange under Chapter VII of the Bill. Amendment No. 46 is consequential and <Col N="23" /> seeks to delete paragraphs (c) and (d) in section 30.  Those paragraphs relate to the powers of the bank of charge a fee for the granting of a licence.  These provisions are no longer needed if the more general powers in the new section 13 are accepted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not happy at all about this section because it is too vague. I am fully in favour of people who absorb public resources being required to pay the cost of the additional burden they put on the community.  I am quite happy with the principle that in general terms the cost of supervision should be borne by the financial services sector generally and the individual component parts of it but this section goes very far.  In order to prevent it becoming like taxation there should be some yardstick in regard to this power of the Minister to impose fees on various institutions.  Section 30 of the Bill as originally brought in requires people who get licences to pay such fees as the Minister may from time to time prescribe. This is different.  It means that every year a levy can be put on an institution for the supervision it gets during the year.  Every year a moneybroker, perhaps, will have to pay a fee for the supervision in respect of the moneybroking operation.  Every year building societies will have to pay fees, and the structure of the fees is something this House does not know.  We do not know, whether small societies and big societies will have different levels of fees or if there will be a single capitation fee for being a society at all.  The upshot of it all is that we are giving the Minister power to give the Central Bank a fee collecting function without any statement that the fee has to be equivalent to the cost of providing the supervision.  That would be a most straightforward proposition.  If the Minister put in something to the effect that the Minister may determine a fee which in his opinion reflects the cost of supervising that institution, that would be one thing, but I am wary of giving the Minister a power to tax by a back-door method under the general label of just imposing <Col N="24" /> a fee on an institution.  Look at planning applications.  People are now paying large sums of money based on square footage to planning authorities as fees, and they are indistinguishable from stamp duty on the sale of buildings in their effect.  Very serious charges are now paid by people who want to build houses or offices or whatever.  If the Minister proposes to charge fees by order or by regulation, I would prefer that this House would be asked to concur on the levels which are laid down.  This is one of the exceptions Deputy Noonan spoke about earlier.  I would not be happy if the Minister could double or treble the fee for a building society just on his own view of the revenue requirements of the Central Bank.</P>
      <P>The other thing that worries me is that the Central Bank is a highly profitable institution, and not by virtue of the deployment of its own initial capital; it has these people's money and deposits, makes money from them and uses that money to finance itself, and the cost of supervision is paid out of that.  Now we will have a separate layer.  In addition to taking people's money and putting it on deposit, it is going to charge for that privilege as well on some other notional basis.  I am not happy that that is a proper amendment to make in the circumstances.</P>

    <P>I am also unhappy about the wording of subsection (2) of the proposed section. I do not know what the phrase &ldquo;necessary to give effect to such fees&rdquo; actually means.  Are those regulations to do with payment, manner of payment, time of payment, obligations to pay?  What is to happen if people do not pay the fees? This section has a cobbled together look about it.  I would much prefer to see the Minister come in on Report Stage with a worked out basis for an amendment to the Act which specified what kind of fees he is going to charge.  For instance, why should a licensed bank pay a fee to the Central Bank for being supervised, when at the same time the bank has many tens of millions of pounds belonging to it by way of deposit on which it is taking the interest?  Is the interest on compulsory deposits not a much more sensible way <Col N="25" /> of paying for the cost of supervision?  I am quite convinced that if we give a power of that kind, within three to five years we will be hearing all the chairmen of the associated banks saying that they are being hammered quietly by little orders doubling and trebling the fees which nobody ever hears about.  The other thing we must bear in mind is that the Central Bank determine their own staff size, determine what degree of supervision and the intensity of supervision they are going to give under this Act.  To give them the right to decide the level of supervision and its quality and then to say they can collect it seems wrong in principle.  The Central Bank who are making such huge profits should be quite happy to deal with their surplus income on deposits rather than try to get money in through the back door in this way.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I have listened to Deputy McDowell with interest.  The first question is whether there should be a fee at all.  If people are being regulated it seems a bit harsh to charge them for it.</P>
      <P>The second issue is if we are to have a fee what kind of control will be on the Minister and his successors when he consults the bank and could increase fees on an annual basis along the lines that Deputy McDowell suggests?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two possibilities.  First, the section could be amended to ensure that the totality of the fees is proportionate to the economic cost of the supervision. However, this might not work.  That is the kind of general procedure which governs the fees in land registry, and the fees that apply in land registry are, in their totality, in excess of the cost of providing the service.  There is revenue accruing to the State now from the imposition of fees on land registry because a very wide interpretation of economic cost has been applied on land registry to take in things like the capital cost of the offices in which the people who operate land registry are housed.  By taking a very wide view of cost it was possible to put land registry fees up very significantly.  I would suggest they are now sailing very close to the <Col N="26" /> wind on the relationship between economic cost of the service and level of fees, and I am not too sure that the same would not apply here.  Who is to say anyway how many employees of the Central Bank are involved in regulation?  Who is to say how many salaries would be appropriately set off against the cost of regulation here? Who is to say what equipment would be used, what travelling expenses might arise, what legal fees might arise in the final analysis?  It is certainly not an exact science to seek to regulate the level of fees by relating them to an economic cost of a service in circumstances where the institution involved in imposing the fees are involved in a multiplicity of other activities also.  It seems to me that an amendment along the lines Deputy Mac Giolla proposed as appropriate to the whole Act might be appropriate to this section, so that the House would be the final regulator of fees.  That would allay the fears we might have on this section.</P>
    <P>I would have no objection to the amendment that Deputy Noonan was talking about.  Generally speaking, I cannot see any reason for an objection to the Central Bank charging fees for what can be quite a costly operation.  As anybody in the accountancy area, knows, the cost of an investigation in the banking area can be very expensive.  Certainly if the Central Bank were to supervise, monitor and control the operations of Allied Irish Banks in the ICI affair, which apparently they did not do and I do not know why, it would be a very costly exercise indeed and I see no reason the Central Bank should not charge Allied Irish Banks a fee for that.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell's argument is an extraordinary one, that the Central Bank are getting money from the other banks and making a huge profit and therefore they should not charge a fee for anything. What about the commercial banks?  They are using everybody's money.  They charge huge rates of interest and make enormous profits.  If you have a current account, while that account is in the black you will not get one penny interest on that money but if it goes into the red the bank will charge you interest on the <Col N="27" /> amount you are indebted.  Furthermore, after using your current account money without giving you any interest on it &mdash; the bank are making money from the interest &mdash; they charge you a fee for their services.</P>
    <P>I see nothing whatsoever wrong in the Central Bank charging a fee for what can be a very costly service in regulating the financial affairs of banks and other financial institutions who very much need financial regulation.  That has been proved in the past few years in the insurance and the banking area.  Quite a lot of shady dealing is going on and if the Central Bank are not in a position to regulate that and to charge fees for it the shady dealing will increase at an enormous rate.  That is what central banks are all about and in my view they do not do enough of that kind of work.  I would have no objection to the Minister, following consultation with the bank, bringing regulations before the House for approval.  I see nothing wrong with this section or with the fact that the banks should charge for the cost of their investigations into the banking area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to get into an ideological argument with Deputy Mac Giolla.  I totally agree with him that what happens in the ordinary banks in relation to current accounts is quite unacceptable. I note that in Britain people are now getting interest on their current accounts.  That is as a result of competition between banks, which apparently is absent in this jurisdiction.  The point I am making is that the Central Bank is a statutory body which has supervisory functions which are effectively policemen's functions.  We are now getting to the position that the police in the financial world are being given the right to charge people for their investigations. The fees to be paid by persons supervised are to be either flat fees for people of different classes such as building societies of certain sizes or banks with certain amounts or fees which reflect the actual bother that any individual bank causes and the amount of supervision it requires.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="28" /> If they are flat fees the inevitable result will be that the well behaved bank will end up subsidising the supervision of the badly behaved bank.  If Deputy Mac Giolla's example was taken, for example, the Bank of Ireland would end up paying the cost of an extensive investigation of the particular incident he referred to. That seems to be an extraordinary proposition.</P>
    <P>I fully accept the proposition and I do not cavil with it for one minute.  As Deputy Mac Giolla has said, those who cause the burden of supervising them should in some way pay for that.  I fully accept that but if the structural fees are to reflect the actual cost of supervision in respect of any individual bank, what would happen if an extensive investigation of a supervisory kind is commenced in relation to one institution and it transpires at the end of that period that there was no need for it?  Who will bear the cost of that supervisory activity &mdash; the innocent party that was supervised or the whole banking industry?  The Central Bank have a huge income &mdash; I am not saying they are unique in this &mdash; arising from their management of other people's money.  They have a huge surplus every year and I do not believe the principle is correct that they should then start charging everybody else for the policemen's work they do.  It is equivalent to charging householders for a neighbourhood watch scheme or whatever.</P>

At least then I would know I was not just passing a tax measure disguised as a fee structure. If the Minister indicates he is willing to do that I would be happy but I do not see why a whole sector should pay an institution which is highly profitable for the added pleasure of being policed by that institution.</P>

      <P>It is reasonable that financial institutions which are supervised by the Central Bank should contribute to the cost of that supervision.  That principle has been already established and accepted in the area of supervision of insurance companies and I do not see anything wrong with it.  As Deputy McDowell has said, it is a question of how to arrive at the cost.  At the end of the day the Minister of the day, in consultation with the banks concerned and the Central Bank, will have to make a reasoned judgment and that is fair and reasonable.  I have listened to the arguments about trying to approach the matter in a different manner and to what Deputy Noonan said about the Land Registry office.

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> We have been debating this on the basis that the licence holder will pay a fee to the Central Bank and the matter stops there.  Whatever about having a Deputy Mac Giolla amendment we could have a Reynolds law, a Noonan law or a McDowell law which would suggest that the speed at which particular fees are passed from institutions back to their customers is proportionate to the size of the fee.  They would move back very quickly.  Ultimately it is the account holder in the commercial banks or the building societies who would have to pick up the tab at the end of the day.  There could be circumstances in tight budgetary situations where, when the cutting had been done, Ministers would be asked to look at charges.  That has happened before and I am sure it will happen again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="30" /> In looking at the charges, the Minister for Finance in his own Department might have the choice between not computerising the office or increasing charges. The Minister will say that this will not accrue to the Department of Finance or to the Exchequer, that it will be money which will go to the Central Bank, but it will come back down the line when surplus profits are sent back to the Exchequer.  Effectively it is money for the Exchequer that one is talking about. There should be some control other than the Minister simply having the power to regulate.</P>
    <P>If we had some more information about the nature of the fee I might be able to accept the section as it stands.  I have been very interested in the points made by Deputy McDowell about whether it would be a flat fee proportionate to the size of institutions or one which would vary dependent on the amount of supervisory control required. The Minister should express a view on that at least before we agree the section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened carefully to what Deputy Noonan has said.  I do not disagree in principle with what he says, that one does not give a blank cheque to everybody to charge what they like, that ultimately it is the consumer who pays.  That is the reality in every walk of life today.  No matter where one adds a charge it finds its way back to the consumer.  I do not think there is disagreement with the principle of recouping supervisory costs.  It is a question of determining how to put a ceiling on them, so that they do not run wild or constitute the giving of a blank cheque. I do not have a clear view how we can ensure come control over that but I will have a look at it between now and Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think the way to proceed is to insert some criterion in the Bill but I will examine some way of reflecting the concerns expressed in the House so that there is not a blank cheque given to the Central Bank enabling them to charge what they like.  Taking into account the wider operations of the Central Bank, <Col N="31" /> taking in building societies and so on, I do not think there is disagreement with the principle of charging a supervisory fee.  It is a question of ascertaining whether we can control that fee in a manner better than is provided for in the section at present.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
      <P>In page 12, subsection (1) (a), to delete lines 36 to 40 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(b) such number of other Directors (not exceeding nine, of whom two shall be elected by the staff of the Bank, and not including at any time more than two service Directors) as the Minister shall from time to time determine.';&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our amendment agrees with the number of directors being nine as against eight but specifies that two should be elected by the staff of the bank, in other words, that worker/directors be elected in the same way as is done in other State companies. For some reason the financial world is regarded as highly sensitive as far as personnel are concerned it being held that certain groups of people only <Col N="32" /> are entitled to be privy to the type of information that would be available to them as directors of, say, the Central Bank.  Of course it is all right for certain groups of people in the commercial world to be privy to the type of information available to them as directors of the Central Bank; it is expected that they will be involved in the financial world, in stockbroking, banking insurance business and so on but for some reason or other it would appear that they are entitled to serve on the board of the Central Bank and have that information available to them, and them only.</P>
    <P>The question of conflict of interests &mdash; which has been such a major political issue in recent weeks &mdash; is never taken into consideration <i>vis-á-vis</i> directorships of the Central Bank.  We should remember that we are dealing with the Central Bank, the supervisory authority of banks, whose mandate is now being extended to other financial institutions.  Yet the directors of the Central Bank can be directors of commercial banks being supervised by the former, thereby ensuring they can oversee their supervision in that area.  Nobody has seen any conflict of interest in that arrangement over the past 50 years.  I contend there is a major conflict of interest.</P>
    <P>The overriding argument advanced in the appointment of worker directors of various companies is that workers should not be entitled to know what is taking place at the top.  Yet where such worker directors have been appointed they have proved to be highly responsible and have contributed to a co-ordinated approach on the part of staff and management to the overall business, thereby bringing about better industrial relations in the operations concerned.  In no case have the commercial interests of a company been affected by the worker directors. Therefore that argument has been killed <i>vis-á-vis</i> other companies.  To advance that argument in the case of the Central Bank&mdash;contending that worker directors would not be appropriate there&mdash;is without any substance whatsoever.  This is certainly the case when one examines the type of directors who have served on <Col N="33" /> the board of the Central Bank, whose commercial and personal interests are all vested in other banking areas, who are privy to information to which they should not be privy since they are being supervised in those other operations by the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>Any argument the Minister may advance in regard to this amendment should be one of more substance than merely saying it is not appropriate that worker directors serve on the boards of financial institutions, which is the type of inference that has prevailed in the past, that for some reason that type of information should not be available to ordinary working people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The Workers' Party suggestion is that two board members of the Central Bank be members of the staff.  Given that the role of the Central Bank is to reflect the financial business community and the bank's central role in the financial system, the curtailing of the powers of selection of an appropriately qualified board by the Minister for Finance is not acceptable.  The Minister for Finance should be able to select the board as he sees fit.</P>
      <P>The amendment proposed by the same Deputies on section 14 should prevent a director of any financial body supervised by the Central Bank serving on the board of the Central Bank.  Indeed it could be argued that it would be hard to select a board of sufficient expertise if all directors of financial institutions were automatically forbidden to be members of the board of the Central Bank.  I might remind Deputies that the directors of the Central Bank are subject to an oath of secrecy.  Under the provisions of section 13 the two posts reserved for directors from the banks will be abolished.</P>
      <P>Therefore, I cannot accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>At present there is an obligation on the Minister to appoint banking directors.  While the provisions of the Bill remove that obligation they certainly do not remove the power of the Minister to have banking directors, or <Col N="34" /> directors of other banks, serve on the board of the Central Bank.  As I understand it, the provisions of the Bill do not prevent any Minister from having directors of other banks serve on the board of the Central Bank.</P>
      <P>I agree the provisions remove the obligation that obtained heretofore, that the Minister had to appoint banking directors. I see nothing wrong with banking directors serving on the board if it means that these directors know their banking and have expertise and knowledge of banking.  There is nothing wrong with banking directors being on the board of the Central Bank.  However, if they come from the commercial banks they certainly should not continue in positions of management or directorships of the commercial banks when they are appointed to the board of the Central Bank.  I do not think the Minister's last comment is relevant at all.  There is nothing in the Bill stopping the Minister from appointing directors of banks to the board of the Central Bank.  Indeed, I have a later amendment to section 14 covering that point.  In fact, it is very important to have the expertise of the staff of the Central Bank available to the board of the Central Bank.  The Minister seems to imply that the worker directors appointed by the staff will not be people of expertise; in fact they will be people of the highest expertise in that area.  They would also be very aware of what staff and management in other financial institutions are doing and how they operate.  The amount of information in regard to operations available to staff in all the financial institutions, banks, building societies, insurance companies etc. is amazing. There is a huge mine of expertise and knowledge lying around in those areas. Therefore, it would not be true for the Minister to say that the appointment of worker directors to the board of the Central Bank would reduce the expertise available.  I would not accept that argument.</P>

    <P>The amendment put down in my name is similar to amendment No. 11 put down in Deputy Noonan's name.  All I want to achieve is that there be some basic requirement on the Minister for Finance to appoint a minority percentage of the board of the Central Bank from those who, by virtue of their experience and knowledge of the practices of commercial banking, were in the opinion of the Minister qualified for appointment.  That does not mean that they would have to be a director of a bank, a bank employee could be just as eligible for appointment. The idea is that some specified section of the board should be composed of people <Col N="36" /> who have knowledge and experience of commercial banking.  I would be worried about getting rid of the banking directors. Apparently nobody laments their departure as a class.  I think it was wrong that they were there as of right but on the other hand it would be better to provide that some minimum fraction of the board of directors would have to have experience by virtue of their knowledge and experience of practice in commercial banking.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The intention of my amendment is exactly the same as that of Deputy McDowell's, even though I have drafted mine differently. The net point is that the Minister would be required to appoint two directors with commercial banking experience.  They need not be directors of commercial banks, indeed they could be employees or former employees of banks.  I think this is a reasonable request and there are no profound arguments other than that that one can put forward.</P>

      <P>The terms of section 13 abolish the provision that directors of banks be appointed to the board as of right.  The reason is that it is necessary to reflect the future role of the Central Bank as supervisor to many diverse institutions. The Deputy's amendment seeks to give the banks more weight on the board by reserving posts for those with banking experience.  To give any special provision to banking is not justified.  If the amendments were accepted, the case could be made that the Minister should also have regard to persons with experience of building societies or financial exchanges.  I believe the best course is to leave the Minister for Finance the option to select the board as he thinks appropriate. In the course of the Second Stage debate, I assure the Deputies that while the requirement to have two bank directors on the board was being abolished, the Minister would have the option of appointing directors with banking experience. However, the aim of the Bill is to leave the Minister with a free hand in the <Col N="37" /> futre, given the Central Bank's new and expanding role.  I think that is reasonable.</P>
      <P>With new and wider territories opening up, to try to give any special area to bank directors or bankers as against those in financial institutions and other financial houses that the Central Bank will deal with, could give the wrong impression.  I am more inclined to leave it open to the Minister of the day to appoint whom he wishes and this does not exclude putting people with the proper experience on the board.</P>

I think it is appropriate that a specification such as this should be in the Bill.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that if we examine other financial institutions, which in the future will become licence holders, and indeed building societies will become licence holders, we will find that many of their personnel have commercial banking experience.  The amendment is not necessarily skewed towards the commercial banks.  The amount of expertise available in the country is not that great. The talent pool in any small country is limited enough and I think there should be a requirement as to expertise in the Bill.</P>

      <P>The question of the appointment of directors to the board of the Central Bank is a very important area of the Bill.  I certainly have no objection whatsoever to what the Deputies have in mind, although Deputy Noonan may be a little too specific.  It is certainly important to have people with experience of commercial banks, financial institutions, building societies, insurance companies and so on on the board of the Central Bank.  I am sure the Minister is aware of <Col N="38" /> the needs for the board although there is no obligation any more on the Minister.</P>
      <P>It is good to have directors from the commercial banks.  The commercial banks have always had representatives on the board of the Central Bank.  It seemed extraordinary to me and to members of the general public that people could hold both directorships.  If the Minister appoints a person with expertise in the commercial banking area, a person who might hold a directorship in a commercial bank, that person when appointed to the Central Bank should break all ties with the commercial bank.  It is important to have their expertise but there must be no conflict of interest.</P>
      <P>The appointee is now a public servant not just a commercial banking person following up his interests in the Central Bank.  The appointee will hold the major Government supervisory role in the major financial institution of the State, an institution which is gaining enormous importance in relation to the structures of companies, the commercial banks, insurance companies, finance houses and so on.  The Central Bank have controlling interests in relation to everything from the distribution of trade to manufacturing and so on.  The Central Bank play a vital role in the economy and the Government must know what is happening.  I have no objection to employing the expertise available for the Central Bank, but they should not retain their interests in other commercial areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is aware of the need for expertise on the board of the Central Bank and over the years there has been evidence that Ministers have put people from the financial services area on to the board of the Central Bank.  Even when this obligation on the Minister is removed, the Minister will include representatives from the commercial banking area, the building societies, the insurance companies, the farmers and industry on the board.  A farmer representative has always been on the board of the Central Bank.  Farming, industry and finance will continue to be represented on the board.  The Government <Col N="39" /> of the day will choose industrialists and so on to pursue Government interests.  I am sure the current Minister will do no different.</P>

I do not want to tie the hands of any future Minister for Finance who might decide that in certain circumstances he was not going to have a banking director on the board.  We are taking away the right they must have two directors on the board.  We are leaving it wide open because of the new areas that will come under their wing.  To try and proportion that board for banking people is tying the Minister's hands.  We have one Governor and eight bank directors. We are talking about building societies, futures exchanges, trustee savings banks, commercial banks and so on.  I am more inclined to give the Minister of the day freedom to choose who he thinks is best fitted for the job.</P>

      <P>This is an amendment to the section which deals with existing banking directors when this Bill becomes law.

      <P>I move amendment No. 13:</P>
      <P>In page 13, before section 14, to insert the following new section:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="42" />&ldquo;14.  &mdash;The Principal Act is amended by the insertion after subsection (3) of section 5 of the following:</P>
    <P>&lsquo;(4)  No person who is a director of a bank or financial business, licensed or supervised by the Bank, shall be appointed a Director of the Bank.&rsquo;.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The amendment may not be worded very well but the point I am making, and I said it already when speaking on the previous section is, that a person appointed as a director of the bank should not continue to hold a post of director of a bank or financial business, licensed or supervised by the Central Bank.  What I have said in the amendment is that no person who is a director of a bank or financial business, licensed or supervised by the bank, shall be appointed a director of the bank.  The intention is that when appointed they would cease to be directors of the other bank.  The point I am making is that no person who is a director of a bank or a financial business, and continues to be a director of a bank or a financial business, should be appointed a director of the Central Bank.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The way in which the amendment is worded would seem to debar anybody who is a director of any financial body supervised by the bank from being a director of the Central Bank.  It could be argued very easily that it would be very difficult to select a board for the Central Bank with sufficient expertise if all directors of financial institutions were automatically forbidden to be members of the Central Bank board.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister and I agree that the amendment is not worded very well.  Would the Minister agree that when a person of expertise, who is a director of a bank or a financial business, is appointed to the Central Bank that person, in order to avoid conflict of interest, should resign their position in the bank or financial institution in which he held a directorship? That is the point I would like to bring out.  My amendment would probably exclude appointment of any person <Col N="43" /> who holds a directorship or such position. What I have in mind is that they would relinquish the other position if the Minister appointed them to the Central Bank so that there would not be a conflict of interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>In certain situations it could be unfair to a person to force them to resign from the directorship of a bank to become a director of the Central Bank. I would also remind the Deputy once anybody is appointed a director of the Central Bank they are governed by the oath of secrecy in that regard.  That should answer the Deputy's question about conflict of interest.  Certainly I could visualise cases where it would be unreasonable to ask somebody to resign as a director of a commercial bank if he was appointed a director of the Central Bank.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to have a long debate on the subject but I see a major conflict of interest arising in this case.  The conflict of interest has been increasing in recent years.  Because of the extent of the financial institutions' involvement in the whole economy there is a need for more supervision as the Central Bank Bill indicates.  The Minister recognises the need for more supervision down along the line through all sorts of financial institutions and that the conflict of interest can be very great.  In the normal course of events there is no problem, but where a major conflict of interest occurs, if large sums of money are involved, oaths of secrecy can mean very little.  I am sure the Minister can understand that where rogues exist oaths of secrecy mean very little to them.  We have had some operations in the financial area of a suspect nature, to say the least.  The Central Bank is there to ensure that that does not occur.  If there can be a conflict of interest in the political world between political and commercial interests, I am sure the Minister can see that there can be conflicts of interest in the industrial, commercial and financial world as well. An oath of secrecy where hundreds of <Col N="44" /> thousands or some millions of pounds are involved would be very little security for the State or for the Central Bank.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I move amendment No. 14:</P>
      <P>In page 14, subsection (3) (a), line 4, to delete &ldquo;or competitive&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is an amendment to section 14 (3) (a) which states:</P>
      <P>... every appointment under subsection (2) of an officer or servant of the Bank shall be made by competition (including a qualifying or competitive test in Irish) to be conducted according to regulations to be made by the Board and the Board may, in relation to any such competition, impose such conditions of entry, limitations, and safeguards as it thinks proper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have absolutely no objection to the general thrust of subsection (3) (a).  The board should have control over the qualifications of those who enter the service of the bank but it is, to say the least, a little peculiar that the only specific qualification referred to is a qualification in the Irish language.  The Central Bank have many functions but there are other qualifications which are far more relevant <Col N="45" /> to employees of the bank than qualifications in the Irish language.</P>
    <P>I know that in certain parts of the public service there are still requirements for one to have an ability to conduct business in Irish.  That is appropriate. However, there are other parts of the public service where the qualifying provision in the Irish language has been removed as a requirement for entry &mdash; I think that is the situation and perhaps the Minister might throw some light on this. For the life of me I cannot understand why, all things being equal, a competitive test in Irish should be a deciding factor. I would accept that a qualifying test in Irish is appropriate but it is difficult to understand why it is considered necessary in the bank to line prospective employees up to compete against each other in Irish. My amendment proposes to take out the competitive element in regard to Irish and to leave in the qualifying element.</P>
    <P>On the face of it one might envisage a situation where people who apply for positions in the Central Bank would have to do a test in oral Irish and they would compete against each other in oral Irish, but within the text of the subsection it would be possible for the board of the bank to decide that nobody was eligible unless they had got an honours Irish in their leaving certificate.  That is being done in certain parts of the public sector.</P>
    <P>In local authorities, for example, certain subjects are given weightings over other subjects.  Perhaps it is appropriate that this should be done, but it seems peculiar, to say the least, to have a competitive element in a test on one's ability to conduct business in the Irish language in the context of the Central Bank Bill.  I should like the Minister to throw more light on this provision before I decide what to do with my amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>When I saw this subsection I meant to put down an amendment to take out the words in brackets. It is worth reminding ourselves that this provision arises out of an amendment made by the Central Bank Act, 1942, to the provisions in section 31 of the Currency Act, 1927.  It was only in 1942 <Col N="46" /> that this competitive test first came into being.  Section 16 of the 1942 Act required the bank, for the first time, to appoint every position by competition, including a qualifying or competitive test in Irish.  I believe this is a grossly dishonest piece of legislation to re-enact in the late eighties.  We live in a very different world from the world which was there in 1927.  In 1927 this Oireachtas was much more tuned into the Irish language and two years later it required, rather ridiculously, that every lawyer had to start taking exams in Irish.  That has been more honoured in the breach than in the observance in that only a tiny minority of lawyers are capable of conducting cases through the medium of Irish.</P>
      <P>This provision in relation to the Central Bank has to be looked at seriously because it purports to be serious on its face.  It requires that every position the bank appoints shall be by competition, unless they decide that it should not be done by competition and that &mdash; and this is the frightening aspect &mdash; it shall include a test in Irish.  If an EC national comes here to university at the age of 18 or 19, has no opportunity to study Irish, and cannot be expected to know Irish, and even if his parents are Irish citizens who have lived abroad for a long time, I cannot see how it is fair, right or honest to say that person is ineligible for appointment to the Central Bank, if he is the best person for the job.  I do not think there is any legitimate reason in 1989 to say to a person in those circumstances &ldquo;You are ineligible for appointment unless we got through some dishonest manoeuvre and pretend you have passed an exam in Irish.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I do not know why Irish language qualifications would be necessary to check coinage in Sandyford or to be in charge of internal supplies in the building in Dame Street.  Maybe it is desirable, but it is about time that we as a reasonable, honest legislature faced up to the fact that it would be entirely unfair to say to a 19 year old person or a 23 year old graduate &ldquo;You cannot get a job in the Central Bank because you are incapable of speaking a word in Irish&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="47" /> Paragraph (b) of subsection (3) says:</P>
    <P>Paragraph (a) shall not apply to appointment to a position in respect of which appointment by competition is, in the opinion of the Board, unsuitable.</P>
    <P>That does not get around the situation at all because the appointment might be one for which it would be perfectly proper to hold a competition, such as a senior economist, and it might be one in which a knowledge of Irish was the least relevant qualification one could think of.  To disqualify people who are prefectly competent, who are nationals of this country or of an EC country and who for some good reason have no Irish, from holding a job in which the use of Irish will be zero, is simply dishonest.  It is about time we faced up to the fact that this is dishonest and that it is wrong in 1989 to include a qualifying or competitive test in Irish in that paragraph.  This means that if there is a competition it is mandatory to include a qualifying test in Irish.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>This is wrong because there are plenty of positions in the Central Bank for which Irish is completely irrelevant and it is about time we faced up to that fact.</P>
      <P>I also think that this provision will be knocked on the head at some stage by the European Commission on the basis that a qualifying test of this kind is discriminatory. Even though Irish is recognised as one of the European languages, to say in the case of an institution the size of the Central Bank that all positions, but for an exceptional few, must be competitive and that all entrants must have a qualification in Irish or must compete &mdash; which I suppose is slightly less likely &mdash; in competence in the Irish language, is simply not sustainable in this day and age.  I ask the Minister to agree that this section should be changed by removing that provision on Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the board of the Central Bank want at any given time to run a competition <Col N="48" /> which includes Irish and they seriously think in their judgment that a particular position requires a competence in Irish, we should let them say so and run the competition themselves.  To require them to do so even when the competition is for posts that have nothing to do with Irish is simple, downright dishonesty.  That is the kind of thing that gets the Irish language a bad name.  At one stage I was quite fluent in Irish and still retain an interest in and liking for that language.  I and people like me become extremely annoyed at hypocrisy of this kind, that to be an economist of some kind, one must have a qualification in Irish.</P>
    <P>One does not need that qualification to get into the Dáil; let us be clear about that.  One does not have to know even a word of the language and there are many here who could not pass many examinations in Irish.  For us to start telling a serious minded institution that their employees must have a qualification in Irish is utter rubbish.  The Minister should agree that in the age in which we live and with the kind of institution we are trying to set up, it is just a little obeisance to something which was all right in the days of wet turf and sugarless tea during the emergency, for the then Prime Minister, Mr. de Valera, to bring in, as a gesture to national culture.  Now it is simple, downright dishonesty.  Let us not pretend any longer; there are but very few positions in the Central Bank which require a knowledge of Irish.  Let us not pretend that every competition run must, as a matter of law, have an Irish language competence element to it.  Above all, as Deputy Noonan points out, there is the absurdity of having competitions among people to speak Irish when they will certainly find no need for competitive competence in that language, whatever about minimum competence for a tiny minority. I oppose the section if it is proceeded with without some indication from the Minister that he will make that deletion.</P>

    <P>On Second Stage debate, the point was made that in relation to the business of the bank the provisions of section 15 were drawn too widely, that it could have the effect of prohibiting the bank or its staff from disclosing matters of genuine public interest, either to the public generally or to the Oireachtas in particular.  I have examined these points and am prepared to amend the existing prohibition on disclosure so that it no longer relates to the business with the bank in general but to those aspects which it is desired to protect, such as the operation of monetary and credit policy and the issue of currency and coinage.  The amendments being proposed to section 15 distinguish clearly between confidentiality of information obtained by the bank in relation to third parties and information concerning the bank's own activities and the protection of the currency and control of credit.  Three new exemptions from the secrecy requirements are provided for in section 15 (2).  These allow for information to be given in relation to the activities of the bank where the bank consents, where the information is not harmful to the operation of the bank in <Col N="52" /> monetary exchange rate or currency matters or where the information on the bank is required to be given in a report which must be laid before the Oireachtas.  This latter exemption will also allow the bank to reply to questions from the Oireachtas on matters covered by the report.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 20 reads:</P>
    <P>In page 16, between lines 13 and 14, to insert the following subsection:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(5)  In any proceedings for an offence under this section, it shall not be necessary to prove that the provisions of subsection (2) do not apply and the onus of proving that any of those provisions do apply shall be on the person seeking to avail himself thereof.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I am also proposing a new subsection (5) which replaces the onus of proof in a prosecution on the person seeking to use the relief of the exemptions under subsection (2).  I consider that this is a reasonable course to follow.  If the onus were placed otherwise, an offender might well consider that the prosecution would be hampered in pursuing him since, in order to show prejudice or harm, it might be necessary to release further information which would be prejudicial to the bank's operations in financial markets or the affairs of third parties.  I do not believe that the authorities will abuse this provision. The prosecution for an offence under this section would be taken only after culpable behaviour has created harm to the legitimate activities of the bank or the interests of third parties.  I ask the House to accept these amendments to section No. 15.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome what the Minister has said.  Certainly, it is a more than adequate response to what I said on Second Stage and I thank the Minister for it.  In fact, he goes further than I imagined he would have gone in limiting the secrecy obligation which is put on employees, officers and directors of the bank.  That is very sensible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I am left with the question of my amendment No. 17.  I did not know, when I was putting it down, how topical <Col N="53" /> that amendment would be.  It appears that there are people &mdash; and I shall not comment any more controversially than that &mdash; being asked by committees of the House to speak to them but they say they cannot comply with the request because the Official Secrets Act prevents them from doing so.  It would be a great pity if, at some future stage, people should say that the provisions of the Central Bank prevent them from discussing a matter with a committee of this House. It is desirable that this House should, at some stage, establish a committee to interact with the Central Bank.  The Central Bank are being transformed by this and other measures that the Government are currently putting through the Oireachtas into a huge institution with colossal powers.  The Oireachtas is bound, in the next ten to 20 years, to find itself ever more concerned than it has been in the past with establishing some form of relationship with the Central Bank which does not involve any compromise of independence but does require the bank on occasions to explain themselves, and their policy or to justify some particular measure that the bank may or may not be taking in relation to credit generally or to the various institutions, including building societies and other agencies.</P>
    <P>It is worth while reiterating that the Central Bank are effectively immune from parliamentary scrutiny because the Minister and his predecessors have taken the view that the Central Bank are not accountable to parliament.  Therefore, apart from answering questions regarding their specific duties in relation to the Central Bank, successive Ministers for Finance have refused to answer questions in this House in respect of policies pursued by the Central Bank.  The House is confined to receiving an annual report from the Central Bank as to what they have done and three quarterly bulletins outlining the bank's policy.</P>
    <P>There is no occasion on which the Oireachtas is given the opportunity to talk to the directors of the Central Bank, to put another view to them and to <Col N="54" /> inquire why they are pursuing any particular line.  I believe a committee will be established in future by the Oireachtas to deal with financial services generally and the Central Bank in particular.  In that context any question which a committee of this House puts to a person in the Central Bank arising out of that person's duty &mdash; even on the narrowed down area to which this section will apply if the Minister's amendment is accepted &mdash; should mean that the person is in a position to say that he or she will answer the question if they must but that they will not commit a criminal offence.  That arose in the context of a Dáil committee yesterday in totally different circumstances where somebody said they could not answer the question because they felt inhibited by criminal law from so doing.</P>
    <P>I did not realise, needless to say, that that would happen when I put down the amendment but it is one instance of making provision for the bank to be made amenable to a committee of this House. If this was not done, if the Central Bank board could say to their staff that they must not disclose certain material in public, the board would effectively be able to prevent their staff from giving evidence to a committee of the Oireachtas which was supposed to be interacting with the bank at some future date.  That is wrong in principle because this House should not be in the position where things said in it or in a committee room could amount to a criminal offence. It is an invidious position where the board of the bank could prohibit their employees from coming to give evidence before such a committee or that the employees could say they would like to help but cannot because the criminal law prevents them from doing so.</P>
    <P>I ask, therefore, that my amendment be inserted in subsection (2).  This House should preserve its own right to know and should never have to go through what it has in the last 48 hours where a member of the public service told a committee that if he told them what they wanted to know it could amount to a criminal offence.  A public servant should not be <Col N="55" /> in the position of being tugged at in public by the House to say something and being worried about whether such evidence would amount to a breach of the criminal law.</P>
    <P>I cannot see how it will do any harm &mdash; it will do a lot of good &mdash; to establish a provision in the Bill that the prohibition on secrecy does not apply.  It does not apply when a court orders someone to make a statement in a special criminal proceedings, although I know it does not apply to civil proceedings.  The provision should apply to a committee of this House who are entitled to call on a member of the Central Bank staff with a view to examining him in relation to bank policies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I dwelt at some length on the issues raised by these amendments in my contribution on Second Stage and I should like to thank the Minister for responding in a major way to the concerns expressed then by Deputy McDowell and myself.</P>
      <P>Section 15 (1) as amended is far more tightly drawn and far more acceptable than the original draft.  There is no doubt that employees of the Central Bank have to observe rules of secrecy.  The bank, in the exercise of certain of their functions, have to do so in a confidential manner, the onus of confidentiality quite clearly has to extend to the staff and that must be enforced by law.  However, there is no need for any and all information by the bank being covered by secrecy provisions as was envisaged in the original draft.  I welcome the changes the Minister made which now confine the issue of the confidentiality and non-disclosure of information by employees to those areas of Central Bank activity for which it is appropriate.  I do not have any problem in regard to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second issue that arises is the cross-fertilisation between confidentiality of Central Bank activities and the independence of the Central Bank as the Minister sees them and the rights of the Oireachtas in respect of the public interest.  The section as originally <Col N="56" /> drafted, while it imposes under sanction rules of confidentiality on the employees and officers of the bank, also provides for a series of exceptions where it would not be illegal to disclose information.  There is a series of them from line 19 to line 49 where, in various circumstances, or at the request of various institutions, disclosures can be made without anybody being in breach of any law.</P>
    <P>My amendment has the same intention as Deputy McDowell's, it seeks to also make an exception of any committee of the Houses of the Oireachtas so that the series of exceptions in subsection (2) and controlled by the first line of that subsection &mdash; the provision as to non-disclosure contained in subsection (1) shall not apply to any disclosure &mdash; will also apply.</P>
    <P>The rights of any committee of the Houses of the Oireachtas to inquire into the Central Bank or their workings is an issue for another day.  I am not attempting to outline the circumstances in which the Committee on Public Accounts, for example, or a new committee along the lines suggested by Deputy McDowell could lay down parameters in respect of any new committee.  All I am saying is that there should be an enabling provision here to make it legal for officers and employees of the bank to disclose information where appropriate under law to a committee of either House of the Oireachtas.  Then we may have the balance between the independence of the Central Bank as an institution, the confidentiality of the bank in the operation of their function and the extension of that confidentiality to the agents, servants and employees of the bank.  The rights of this House must also be taken into account because that is where all authority in a democracy ultimately rests.  There must be a balance between an independent Oireachtas and an independent bank and I suggest that the balance is not one of standing off.</P>
    <P>I fully take the point made by Deputy McDowell.  It is not in accordance with the way this House should operate or in accordance with the principles of democracy, or how they should operate in the <Col N="57" /> context that somebody who is willing to give evidence before a committee of this House feels inhibited from doing so because he is afraid that the sanctions of criminal law might apply.  That is the difficulty which should be addressed.  I appreciate that the Minister has gone a long distance here.  I compliment him on taking on board in a very significant way what was said on Second Stage.</P>
    <P>This is no petty amendment nor is it a technical one.  Rather it is a major amendment and I thank the Minister for taking it on board.  I would now like him to examine the second issue which is what should be the relationship between an independent confidential bank and this House where both would have their rights and obligations and to see how we might get the balance right.</P>
    <P>With your indulgence, a Cheann Comhairle, I would like to diverge for a few moments though this is relevent.  In the first days of 1993 we will see the completion of the internal market.  All of us in this House have heard speeches on the completion of the internal market but beyond that it appears to be the intention of many sovereign governments in Europe, in particular the government of the Federal Republic of Germany, to move very quickly in the setting up of a European central bank.  I can see such a bank becoming a fifth institution of the Community taking its place alongside the Council of Ministers, the Commission, the Parliament and the Court.  Regardless of the way in which this would evolve we would have some kind of representation but because it would be led from the front by the German government, advised by the Bundesbank, and with the German economy continuing to be the strongest economy in Europe throughout the nineties, many of the attitudes adopted by the Bundesbank would also be adopted by any European central bank which emerges. In the final analysis when the internal market is completed the strongest economy in Europe will dictate economic policy in Europe.  A European central bank regardless of what kind of representation we may have would establish monetary policy in Europe.  Once this has <Col N="58" /> been conceded to a central institution fiscal policy too, will be conceded shortly afterwards.</P>
    <P>If we were to think of what the position might be in the mid-nineties, I believe we are looking at a far more profound loss of sovereignty than anything we have seen heretofore, certainly a greater loss of sovereignty in respect of our economic, monetary and fiscal policies than we agreed to on our entry to the market in 1973. In those circumstances and against that background the checks and balances we put in place in respect of the relationship between this House and our Central Bank could quite easily apply in respect of the relationship between this House and a European central bank on the one hand or in respect of the relationship between a European central bank in which we would have some kind of representation and the Council of Ministers and the Commission.  Therefore, there are wider issues involved here.  I am not going to get involved in the rhetoric of the purple patch but this is relevant.</P>
    <P>It is the experience of this House that we only address issues such as this once in any generation.  Unlike the position in respect of the Finance Bill we will not see another Central Bank Bill next year or the following year.  As well as addressing the immediate issue it would also be well worth looking at what the position may be in the mid-nineties against the background of what I have said.  I ask the Minister to bear what I have said in mind and to evaluate it to see if there is any merit in that kind of projection when he comes to examine what the relationship should be between this House and the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>I am not going to press the amendment today but I would like to get a response from the Minister to see where we can bring it forward between now and Report Stage.  Again, I compliment the Minister for the extent to which he has moved already.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>These amendments seek to make it clear that the bank would <Col N="59" /> be able to give information to a committee of the Oireachtas.  If the Government amendments are accepted there would be no impediment to the bank giving information about their own activities to any person, including a Dáil committee. However, as drafted, the amendments would allow the bank to disclose information, not only concerning their own activities but also those of third parties, to a Dáil committee.  The bank's supervisory function depends strongly, as Deputies will appreciate, on secrecy and this could not be diminished.  Deputies did not probably intend this to be the effect but to accept the amendments could damage the confidence of the supervised institutions in the bank's secrecy provision and raise a fear that some information about their activities might become public.  The Government amendments should ease the Deputies' fears about the capacity of the bank to discuss their affairs.  I have listened attentively to what the Deputies have said and we will take it on board between now and Report Stage.  If the Deputies would like to comment further I would be interested in hearing what they have to say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what the Minister has said in that such a danger exists. Quite frankly, I had not thought of it but I believe that we are proposing the creation of an institution which would be totally independent in its functions. While not wanting to be too controversial, when we take a look at the position in respect of some semi-State bodies we will see that Ministers are not always necessarily in charge of the bodies which are supposedly under their tutelage. I am sure the Minister's colleague, Deputy O'Kennedy, would appreciate that policy is not always dictated by a Minister.  How is policy arrived at in an independent institution and where is it asked from time to time to justify the policy it is pursuing?  Let us suppose that the policy it is pursuing is perceived by Members of this House, acting responsibly, to be wrong in some area.  I do not <Col N="60" /> know what that area might be or what the extent of its supervisory or regulatory functions are in relation to banking, building societies and so on, but let us suppose this House arrived at the view that there was a fundamental error in the policy being pursued by the Central Bank, in those circumstances, rather than compromise the independence of the bank by using the ultimate sanction of dismissing the directors or sending them directives or a letter from the Minister stating that this is what they should do as the Houses of the Oireachtas also believe that that is what they should do, a committee of the House should be set up to deal with areas such as financial services.</P>
      <P>Such a committee is going to come into existence at some stage because we are proposing the creation of such a powerful institution with such wide powers that somebody at some stage is going to want to call it to account for what it may have done.  Let us take a look at the position in England.  If a select committee of the House of Commons could not inquire into the policy being pursued by the Bank of England or the policy being pursued by the various financial regulatory agencies in Britain that would seriously compromise parliamentary sovereignty there.  We are now proposing the creation of what I would call a serious Central Bank with much wider powers than it merely being the bankers' bank.  It would be an arm of the State and would control credit, banking, insurance and the building societies and would have huge powers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This House should bear in mind that in creating such an enormous institution with such far-reaching powers which these series of Acts would give it we should not confuse independence with total autonomy.  Independence and autonomy are not the same thing.  One can be independent in the way that universities are independent but this does not mean that they cannot be called upon by this House to explain the policy decisions taken by them.  I believe that in the future these Houses will establish a select committee whose function will be to take seriously <Col N="61" /> what is stated each year in, for instance, the Central Bank report.</P>
    <P>I have tabled amendments, which I do not want to refer to now, about the quality of information given to the public and to this House by the Central Bank.  No number of reports or unilateral statements made by Members of this House or by the board of directors suffices for a relationship of mutual involvement which there should be between Parliament and an institution as powerful as the one we are creating by this series of Acts.</P>
    <P>The Minister says that under his amendment there is nothing to prevent the bank disclosing this kind of information to a committee.  If employees of the bank knew there was something substantially wrong, say, about the supervisory quality of the decisions implemented by the board of the bank, they could be told by the board of directors to keep quiet.  Unless they get permission from the board of directors it is a criminal offence for them to come before a committee of this House and disclose information of this limited kind. The directors of the bank would effectively have a veto over what evidence a committee could receive.  That is what I am worried about.</P>
    <P>I go along with the Minister's statement about the desirability of maintaining confidentiality, but what I am driving at is that it is not right that a committee of this House, should be told by an employee of the bank that he declines to appear before the committee on the basis of potential criminal liability. The committee should have the right to say: &ldquo;We want to know what you did in relation to the supervision of an institution that went bust.  We want to know what you personally did and we do not want your board of directors to give you immunity from questioning by simply saying they do not consent to the information being made available to the Oireachtas.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I want to <Col N="62" /> come back to the Minister's original reply about my amendment.  He said it would be paramount that licence holders would not only realise that the Central Bank act in a confidential manner but that there was no possibility of the confidentiality being breached by a committee of the House.  There is still a major difficulty in that respect.  I can envisage an institution which was supervised by the Central Bank going bust and it becomes a matter into which a committee of this House is inquiring.  In those circumstances the confidential information about the regulatory process is what would be required by a committee of this House in evaluating that situation.  There is a difficulty getting the kind of balance we desire.</P>
      <P>The principle we want is the right of the Oireachtas in certain circumstances to get that information without those it is examining being afraid of outside sanction under the criminal law.  I do not know how you are going to construct the framework in which that is possible, but I am very clear on the principle.  This House should be in a position, either meeting in plenary session or through one of its committees, to establish the facts of any situation within the remit of this House.  That should apply to the workings of the Central Bank or any other institution.</P>
      <P>By this legislation we are creating a very serious Central Bank, a major institution. We think quite frequently of transfer of sovereignty from national governments to institutions in Brussels. It is possible to transfer control and sovereignty also to institutions within one's own state.  A Central Bank along the lines of this bank with all the powers accruing to it will be a serious policy maker across the whole area of monetary policy.  There should be checks and balances, and they do not appear to be there at the moment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 17 proposes to allow the bank to dispose of documents and other records after six years.  This time period is standard in relation to companies generally and is provided for in the Companies Acts.  Concern was expressed in the House that section 17 as drafted would allow the bank to destroy documents of historical or clerical importance, such as those covered by the National Archives Act, 1986.  This was raised by Deputy Noonan and Deputy FitzGerald on Second Stage.  The Central Bank does not at present come under the 1986 Act, unlike the Registrar of Building Societies whose functions are to be assumed by the bank under the Building Societies Bill. The bank can, however, be brought <Col N="65" /> within the terms of the 1986 Act by an order approved by both Houses.</P>
    <P>The purpose of section 17 is to reduce the storage problems of the bank in retaining Government stock transfer documents and other clerical forms and material.  It is not meant as a licence for the bank to destroy archival documents, minutes of the board of the bank, etc. Notwithstanding that the bank is not subject to the National Archives Act, I propose to amend section 17 to meet the concerns expressed by the House in this regard.  The proposed amendment deletes the phrase &ldquo;or of any other enactment&rdquo; from the present text of section 17.  This is the phrase to which Deputies drew attention in the House.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 26:</P>
      <P>In page 17, subsection (1), line 2, to delete &ldquo;6 months&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;3 months&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of these amendments is to reduce from six months to three months the period during which the bank are required to prepare their accounts for transmission to the Comptroller and Auditor General.  We are always very generous with the time limits we prescribe and Parkinson's law always applies.  Things like the Revenue Commissioners' report are hopelessly in arrears.  This measure proposes to give the bank half a year to get their accounts together.  No private company would be allowed by the Stock Exchange to fiddle around for half a year before getting their act together.  I do not see why an institution which lectures such companies and moralises about them should be given a little holiday of this kind.  If they have to meet a three month deadline, they will do so.  If they are told it is six months they certainly will not do it within three months but rather when it suits them. The Comptroller and Auditor General's audited accounts of the Central Bank have become so divorced in terms of time that they cannot be included in the annual report of the bank and appear completely separately.  Three months is a perfectly adequate time for the bank to get their act together.  If they are capable of regulating and supervising the standards of others, they should be able to get their own act together and get their accounts ready within three months of the end of the financial year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am proposing in amendment No. 28 that the Comptroller and Auditor General should be given a deadline for carrying out his function.  I propose to do this by the addition of a subsection.  The Comptroller and Auditor General is obliged, as the section stands, to audit, certify and report upon every statement of accounts transmitted to him by the Central Bank under this section, but there is no limit on the time he can take for his activities.  I fully appreciate that in <Col N="68" /> certain circumstances the exigencies of auditing mean that one cannot fix a strict time limit since it may be necessary to investigate some matter in a manner which is extraordinary and unusual. Nevertheless I do not believe there is anything wrong in saying to the Comptroller and Auditor General that he is expected to finish his work within three months of receiving the material from the bank.  If he cannot finish it within three months, let him say whether it is due to shortages of staff or to a particularly knotty audit.  It is wrong that the Comptroller and Auditor General operates without any time constraints.  No auditor in a private company would be allowed to bring in his report whenever it suited him, depending on his workload in other areas.  Any company would demand that the audited accounts would be available by a specified date.  I have not attempted to put a strict limit on the time within which the Comptroller and Auditor General has to carry out his functions. I have suggested that we should provide that, in so far as is practicable, he should do his work within three months of receiving the statement of accounts. Where he is unable to carry out his function within that period, he should do so as soon as practicable thereafter and append to his report a statement giving the reasons which prevented him from completing the work within the specified time.  That puts the onus on the Comptroller and Auditor General to have the final accounts completed so that within six months of the end of any given year the fully audited accounts of the Central Bank will be available to the Oireachtas.  That is a reasonable time-span to lay down as a requirement of an institution which lectures and moralises about how others should run their affairs.</P>
    <P>I am not happy about the last part of section 18 (1) which refers to the form of accounts which the Central Bank are to give to the Comptroller and Auditor General.  I do not accept that the form of the accounts should be decided upon on a consultative basis between the Minister and the bank.  There should be a requirement that there be a specific form.  If <Col N="69" /> things are to be left out, that should be done by regulation and this House should be given some opportunity, even if only by challenging a statutory instrument at a later stage, to say that a better or different form of accounts is required.  It is wrong simply to allow the Minister to change the form of the accounts on an open-ended basis without having to come to this House.  Section 18 (1) proposes an informal process of consultation as to the form of accounts.  That is a mistake.</P>
    <P>I want the bank forced to make their report to the Comptroller and Auditor General within three months.  I want some time target of a reasonable kind given to the Comptroller and Auditor General.  There is no reason the Central Bank's accounts should not be forwarded within three months and audited within a further three months.  Since there are potential reasons that that might not be possible in every case, amendment No. 28 is designed to take into account special circumstances which might prevent auditing within the specified period.  Amendment No. 27 is merely designed to require that the form of accounts be not simply informally agreed but put before this House from time to time for approval.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy wishes to have the accounts published within three months of the year end rather than the present six months.  He also wishes to give the Minister power to decide the type of accounts without consulting the Central Bank.  Finally he wishes to impose a requirement on the Comptroller and Auditor General to audit the accounts within three months.  These amendments are opposed because any delay by the Central Bank is presenting their accounts is due in the main to auditing constraints.  The amendment, taken with the Deputy's third suggestion, would allow the bank three months to submit their accounts to the Comptroller and Auditor General, who would be given three months to audit the accounts.  The final accounts would not be ready until six months after the year end.  As things stand, the bank publish their audited accounts in June or earlier each year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="70" /> Previously, they were able to do so earlier in the year.</P>
    <P>The Deputy's amendments would not mean that the accounts would be published any earlier.  In my view the present system should be allowed stand.  In relation to the Deputy's second suggestion, that the Minister unilaterally prescribe the form of accounts, I should like to state that the tradition and the requirement has been for the bank to be consulted since it is their accounts that are to be published.  Some account must be taken of their suggestions since the bank are not just a commercial organisation but have wider responsibilities in the financial markets.  The form of accounts would need amendment after the passage of the Bill and the Deputy's suggestions on Second Stage concerning the need for more information on staff deployment and so on can be taken into account in that review.  The form of accounts will be revised and I have no strong feeling whether I should do that by regulation, if that is what the House wants me to do. I will look at this issue between now and Report Stage.</P>

      <P>I am suggesting that the queue be speeded up.  The section is proposing that the accounts be in such form as shall be approved of, from time to time, by the Minister after consulting with the bank.  That seems to suggest that the Minister has the right to say, &ldquo;These are the accounts and I am stating what the accounts are&rdquo;.  I am not against consulting with the bank but I am suggesting that the Minister should have a right to prescribe, by statutory regulation, the form that the account should take.  He should have power to say to the bank, &ldquo;It is not a matter of you coming up with a set of accounts and my approving their form; I am saying what form they should take and you produce whatever I say&rdquo;. The Minister may consult with the bank as much as he likes but I am suggesting the proper way to deal with this matter. It is not right to have the Minister faced with formal accounts for approval, after consulting with the bank.  I should like to ask the Minister to give consideration between now and Report Stage as to whether he can bring the time back to three months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment `1No. 30:</P>
      <P>In page 17, between lines 21 and 22, to insert the following subsection:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="72" />&ldquo;(3)  The report of the Bank's proceedings under this section shall include:</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>(i)  a statement concerning the national economy,</P>
    <P>(ii)  a statement concerning monetary developments,</P>
    <P>(iii)  separate statements summarising the activities of the Bank in relation to every function conferred on it by statute,</P>
    <P>(iv)  other notable events at, or concerning, the bank,</P>
    <P>(v)  a detailed statement concerning the deployment of staff and any changes in numbers and general remuneration of staff,</P>
    <P>(vi)  a statement concerning the cost of carrying out the functions of the Bank by function,</P>
    <P>(vii)  a statement concerning the way in which the Bank has carried out its functions under section 14 of this Act,</P>
    <P>(viii)  a statement showing how the Bank's surplus was derived and detailing the separate sources of revenues of the Bank,</P>
    <P>(ix)  a statement indicating changes in the Bank's reserves and setting out the policy considerations which justify the level of reserves for the time being,</P>
    <P>(x)  such other matters as the Minister may specify for inclusion in the Annual Report of the Bank.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is about time we told the Central Bank what we want them to tell us and not leave it to their discretion or their good judgment as to what they put in their annual report.  As I pointed out on Second Stage, there was a time &mdash; it stopped about three or four years ago; I am not clear about that because I did not go back too far in the annual reports &mdash; when the House was informed by the Central Bank each year what they were doing with their staff, how they were <Col N="73" /> deployed and what their duties were.  The bank gave up doing that for some reason. The information slipped out of the annual report and I do not know why.  It may be that it was too much bother to include it in the report.</P>
    <P>If the Minister can specify by regulation what is to be in the annual report so be it, but I suggest to him that at least we should have the customary statements about the national economy and monetary developments and separate statements summarising the activities of the bank in relation to every function conferred on them by the State.  I am suggesting that they should be required to report separately in relation to money markets, the international financial service centre, banking, building societies, and so on.  I am also suggesting that the report should include other notable events at or concerning the bank.</P>
    <P>In subsection (3) (v) I am suggesting a detailed statement concerning the deployment of staff and any changes in numbers and general remuneration of staff.  I want that information so that we can judge if the bank are operating efficiently.  I would like to know if staff wages have gone up or down and the wages policy the bank are following in any given year.  Like any member of the public, I am entitled to know the policy the bank are following on that front.</P>
    <P>I am also seeking a statement concerning the functions of the bank under section 14.  I want the bank to state the buildings they own, the buildings they have invested in, the leaseholds they have acquired or sold, what they are spending on maintaining places like Sandyford and what they are spending on cleaning and heating their premises in Dame Street. The public are entitled to that information from an institution of this kind which appears to be immune from any examination.  If the bank are to be accountable to the same extent that the bodies under them are to be regulated, then the House is entitled to get that information so that we can judge if we are getting value for money.</P>
    <P>Subsection (3) (viii) is equally important. It suggests that the bank should <Col N="74" /> provide a statement showing how the bank's surplus was derived and details of the separate sources of revenue of the bank.  I want to know how much money was made by appreciation of capital assets of the bank, and whether the money came from surpluses on deposits or from currency gains.  In subsection (3) (x) I am seeking a statement indicating changes in the bank's reserves and setting out the policy considerations which justify the level of reserves for the time being.  I do not believe the bank have been asked in public to account for the level of reserves kept by them.</P>
    <P>On Second Stage the Minister said he thought the present policy in relation to reserves was proper but I do not know how the level of reserves is fixed.  If there is an excessive level of reserves being kept, they could be returned to the Exchequer and used towards the liquidation of the indebtedness.  I would like to hear a statement of policy in relation to those matters.</P>
    <P>In my subsection (3) (x) I am suggesting that the Minister should be entitled to specify other matters which he requires to be included in the annual report of the bank.  It is not good enough to say to an institution, &ldquo;You must report to us every year&rdquo;, without telling them what they must report on and in what detail.  Unfortunately, in the past there has been a tendency on the part of the Central Bank to do the minimum of reporting on some areas where it suited them not to give information that would be of public interest and to leave us with no information by which we can decide whether the bank is being efficiently or inefficiently run, whether they are being wasteful or not.  That is the problem with the annual report of the bank.  If one looked at it for hours on end one would not be able to derive from it any indication as to whether they are running better or worse in any given year.  All we are given are aggregate sums for income and expenditure and, within them, we are left in the dark as to how the management of the Central Bank by their board of directors is operating.  This is simply a matter of accountability.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="75" /> The Central Bank are being given the role of supervising others and we are entitled to objective and clear-minded reporting so that we can judge whether we are getting value for money from them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>At present the bank publish an annual report covering almost all the areas referred to, chapters on the national economy monetary developments and so on.  They do not publish details of their market operations where they gain most of their surplus income. To do as the Deputy requests could require publishing sensitive information about the bank's activities in the markets. The bank are prepared to expand the contents of their reports and they could and do publish their report within three to four months of year end.  I can assure the House that the comments made will be taken fully into account.</P>
      <P>The report will be expanded to give details of staff deployment and other information.  The items left out in recent years will be restored and included in this year's report.  With regard to the suggested subsection (3) (x) I do not think it would be acceptable to the House, or anybody, to give the Minister for Finance power to tell the Central Bank what to say in their annual report because the Minister might want them to say what the Government might like them to say.  That would be dangerous.</P>

It may be possible to explain it on the basis that they are a totally sectarian organisation; they have <Col N="77" /> no connection or interest whatsoever in the unity of this country or of its people. They are simply intent on annihilating as many Protestants as they can manage to annihilate.</P>
      <P>In relation to the Taoiseach's reply to my question, would he agree at this point that whatever his intentions may have been &mdash; and I accept that they are not intended to be damaging &mdash; they have been read as provocative and as using the threat of violence against the Unionist population and that this was regrettable?

He will have noted my statement on the issue in the House last December when reporting on the outcome of the Rhodes European Council and also the Minister for the Environment's successful initiative at last week's EC Environmental Council meeting.</P>

      <P>Ag féachaint do staid airgeadais na cuideachta sin, chinn an tÚdarás ar 4 Samhain 1988 go lorgófaí tairiscintí go poiblí don mhaoin, i.e., an t-óstán féin agus na tithe saoire.  Fuarthas 16 tairisc-intí ó 12 dreamanna ar leith.  Socraíodh go dtabharfaí cuireadh do na daoine a chuir tairiscintí isteach agus a bhí sásta suim áirithe airgid ar a laghad a íoc (suim a luadh leo) in airgead tirim i leith an óstáin agus na tithe saoire mar aonad, bualadh le Bord an Údaráis chun na pleananna a bhí acu don mhaoin a léiriú.</P>
      <P>Maidir leis na daoine a thiocfadh i láthair Bhord an Údaráis, cinneadh nach bpléifí a dtairiscintí ná praghas don mhaoin leo ach go ndéarfaí leo, sa chás gur theastaigh ó aon duine díobh tairiscint leasaithe a dhéanamh, go bhféadfadh sé é sin a dhéanamh tríd é a chur i gclúdach séalaithe faoi rún agus é a thabhairt d'oifigeach de chuid an Údaráis roimh chríoch chruinnithe an bhoird ar an lá sin.</P>

Fish farmers are obliged to keep records of all substances used for the treatment of fish and to supply the necessary information to my Department. All chemicals used in fish farming are subject to the EC Veterinary Medicines Directive 1981 which was implemented in Ireland by the European Communities (Veterinary Medicinal Products) Regulation, 1986.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The best possible advice is given by the scientific experts in my Department who examine these matters to those engaged in this kind of activity. The dangers of any chemicals used in this or any other industry are clearly highlighted and every care is taken to ensure that the people who work with them are fully familiar with the difficulties involved.  There has been wide speculation about this product.  There is no question that if handled carelessly or neglectfully it can cause problems but if the regulations and conditions under which this or any other chemical or disinfectant is used are abided by, there would be no danger to anybody involved.</P>

      <P>Under the particular directive, all substances used in treating fish must be first approved by the National Drugs Advisory Board.

      <P>I understand that but this is a particularly serious problem. If this chemical is only being examined by the National Drugs Advisory Board at present, would the Minister not consider it appropriate to ban its use until that body report on it?  Is it not irresponsible to allow this chemical to be broadly used in the meantime?  Is the Minister aware that it is believed that the trend towards the more frequent use of the chemical will not solve the sea lice problem but will put fish farm workers at greater risk?</P>

The problem of sea lice up to now has been dealt with in every country by this method and to the best of our scientific knowledge and advice, there has not been, and is unlikely to be, any danger arising from its use provided it is used according to the conditions and regulations laid down.

      <P>Market research and promotion in relation to fish and fishery products are the responsibility of An Bord lascaigh Mhara.  My Department provide funding to BIM for this purpose and agree programmes in this area with the board.</P>
      <P>BIM's overall strategy is to provide specialist, relevant and cost effective back-up marketing support to the fish exporting industry.</P>
      <P>BIM have carried out a number of research studies on the market situation for a wide variety of fish products ranging from fresh and chilled farmed fish and shellfish to highly processed added-value fish products.  The research has been undertaken on the principal target markets for Irish fish product exports mainly in Europe and in the United States.  Over the past five years a total of 31 reports have been issued under BIM's market research series.  A number of other market research studies have been carried out for individual fish processors and exporters.</P>
      <P>An increasing proportion of fish exports is marketed in branded consumer packs mostly under individual company labels.  These products are given market research and promotional support by An Bord Iascaigh Mhara.</P>
      <P>The main products currently exported in brand consumer form are processed mussel products in frozen and marinated form, frozen Dublin Bay prawns, prepacked whole crab and crab claws, vacuum packed smoked salmon, smoked and canned mackerel and herring products.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that these brand name products do not appear to have the same influence on the home or external markets as, say, Kerrygold butter?  Would he consider directing An Bord Iascaigh Mhara to make an all-out effort to highlight a number of fish products in a positive manner, such as is being done with regard to some of our dairy products, since it is now recognised within Europe and beyond that we produce high quality fish?  Can he tell the House exactly what <Col N="86" /> directions his Department are issuing to BIM in relation to that matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>We have already taken that initiative with BIM.  For example, I have requested them to examine the possibility of establishing a quality image for Irish farm salmon by way of its promotion under a national logo.  This is something to which we have already drawn the attention of BIM.  They are already working with individual producer groups and with the industry with a view to the establishment of common quality standards. Those product groups are jointly funding promotional advertising.</P>
      <P>Recently, in conjunction with An Bord Iascaigh Mhara, I attended a promotion of this nature in West Berlin where we initiated a big marketing exercise, getting into the German market where there are now very bright prospects for us.  In fact, in one afternoon, we took orders for approximately £0.5 million worth of quality smoked Irish salmon.  We are moving in that direction.  We now have quality fish products, indeed the best in Europe. Therefore our main priority must be to get into the marketplace, exploiting the markets that exist for the type of upmarket quality product we now produce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister inform the House exactly how many tonnes of processed and unprocessed fish are exported and whether he intends to have the tonnage of the unprocessed reduced substantially?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>We are now getting into specific details with regard to statistics on quantities.  I do not have that type of information here.  As the House will be aware, under the new BIM fisheries development plan, which was recently supported at Government level by funding and positive support, we hope to undertake the secondary processing of much of our fish products now being exported in their primary state.  Not alone will that add value to the fish product itself but it will also create many more jobs in processing.  I can assure the Deputy that we are progressing along <Col N="87" /> those lines.  I have made clear to An Bord Iascaigh Mhara and the industry on numerous occasions the desirability of secondary processing and developing up-market, quality products which can command premium prices especially on European markets.  This is the area on which we are at present concentrating and where there are many opportunities to be tapped.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>There is regular consultation between my Department and the Department of the Environment on the question of pollution controls and water quality monitoring for aquaculture projects including fish farming at sea.</P>
      <P>The Department of the Environment are consulted by my Department on all proposals for the designation of areas for aquaculture purposes and on all proposals by my Department to issue aquaculture licences.  The Department of the Environment are also represented on the aquaculture advisory group which advises us on various applications for projects.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the Foreshore Act, 1933, I, as Minister for the Marine, am responsible for the effective planning controls over the State-owned foreshore which extends from the high water mark to the limit of our territorial waters in the area within which the Department of the Environment would not have responsibility. It will be seen that there is regular consultation, communication and dialogue between ourselves and the planning authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that there is growing public concern about pollution at sea as a result of fish farming at sea?  Furthermore, is he <Col N="88" /> aware that many of those fears could be allayed if he were able to give stronger assurances to this House in relation to the degree of the monitoring process and consultation engaged in by his Department and the Department of the Environment? While there are proposals to site fish farms at sea there is a certain amount of nervousness felt by local and, in some cases, extended communities which is causing certain problems in those areas.  Could the Minister clarify the position for the benefit of the House and the public at large?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Much of the difficulty arises from misinformed comment about projects and applications even in cases where licences have not been granted.  I might give one example: recently in Roundstone there was much public criticism of a project which had not been licensed by me.  If people would take the trouble to check either with the Department of the Environment &mdash; who have planning responsibility&mdash;or with ourselves&mdash;who are charged with the responsibility of issuing licences&mdash;frequently they would find that some of their complaints were totally unfounded.  The reality is that there is a double safeguard obtaining, in that while my Department have responsibility for the issuing of licences &mdash; each application being carefully evaluated from the point of view of scientific and environmental considerations, with public inquiries being held before designation takes place, and people are given opportunities to express their views about such matters &mdash; there is the added safeguard that, in the case of many applications, detailed planning permission is required by a local authority.  Therefore, there should not be any necessity for much of the adverse criticism there has been in recent times, especially in relation to applications that have not even being approved.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8, 11, 12, 16, 24 and 27 together.</P>
      <P>The interdepartmental committee on the deployment of search and rescue helicopters was established in June 1988 to consider the implications of and to make recommendations as regards the deployment of search and rescue helicopters. Their report, which was presented to the Minister for Defence and myself in October 1988, put forward a number of options for improving search and rescue helicopter coverage within our area of responsibility.  The interdepartmental committee had taken into consideration the relevant recommendations made in the report of the west coast search and rescue action committee, presented to the Minister and me in September 1988. The question of helicopter coverage was also considered by the Irish Marine Search and Rescue Committee who advise the Minister on a continuing basis in relation to search and rescue matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the advice of all relevant interests secured it became clear that the deployment of search and rescue helicopters. could not be considered in isolation from the overall strategy for dealing with distress incidents within our region of responsibility and should take account of facilities provided by the various search and rescue agencies.  In this regard our search and rescue system has undergone considerable change in recent years.  The rejuvenation of the marine radio communications programme has expanded our VHF network considerably and its completion is expected before the end of the year.  The Royal National Lifeboat Institution carried out a review of their services late last year as a result of which some restructuring of their operations is taking place.  The Institution have already re-equipped some of their stations with modern craft and recently announced plans to establish a new main station at Ballyglass, County Mayo.  My Department's coast life-saving service, the <Col N="91" /> Valentia unit of which operated so effectively during the recent incident involving the motor fishing vessel <i>Big Cat</i> has also been progressively modernised in recent years and further improvements will take place in the near future.  The airstrip at Finner, County Donegal will have its navigation equipment upgraded to permit night operation of search and rescue helicopters there.</P>
    <P>So far as the Marine Rescue Co-ordination Centre is concerned, both high frequency and very high frequency aviation communications equipment have been made available to the MRCC thus effecting a direct communications link between the centre and rescue aircraft and helicopters.  This equipment worked extremely well during the course of recent incidents.  A direct and dedicated data communications link between the MRCC and the coast radio stations at Malin and Valentia has been ordered. These initiatives form part of a programme aimed at providing a more efficient information network between State search and rescue agencies.</P>
    <P>The Government considered, therefore, in view of the changing capabilities of our search and rescue services and the considerable upgrading and modernisation of the facilities provided by each component organisation in that system, that an in-depth review of our search and rescue arrangements was required and they have now established a review group on air sea rescue services. The group members are: Mr. Eamon J. Doherty, Former Commissioner of the Garda Síochána, Chairman; Mr. T. M. Boyd, Chief Executive, Commissioners of Irish Lights; Mr. Francois Benda, European Commission; Col. Patrick A. Cranfield, Group Commander, Air Corps, Baldonnel; Mr. Gerry Hickey, Principal, Department of Finance; Cdr. John Kavanagh, O/C <i>LE Eithne,</i> Naval Service; Mr. Patrick Keating, Deputy Director, Aviation and Marine Communications Service; Mr. Clayton Love, Vice-President, Royal National Lifeboat Institution; Captain James L. McDonald, Coastguard Attache, United States <Col N="92" /> Embassy, London, Ms. Deirdre O'Connor, Principal, Maritime Safety Division, Department of the Marine, Mr. Dick Richards, Ex-Regional Controller, HM Coastguard, Swansea and Mr. Niall McCutcheon, Assistant Principal in my Department, who will act as secretary to that committee.</P>
    <P>The review group have been asked to examine the structure and the operation of the air sea rescue services and to make recommendations to ensure a cost effective and efficient service to meet national and international requirements and to report at the earliest possible date.  While it will be a matter for the group I expect that the group will examine the operations and capabilities of each of the component organisations in the system, including the Marine Rescue Co-ordination Centre, the Air Corps, the Coast Life-Saving Service, the Royal National Lifeboat Institution and the coast radio stations and recommend any possible improvements.  I do not wish to tie the group to a precise date for submission of a report but I am confident that the matter will be examined with maximum speed.</P>
    <P>To date both current and capital expenditure relating to the State's search and rescue services has been funded by the Exchequer.  The Royal National Lifeboat Institution, as an independent and voluntary body, finance the purchase and operation of their lifeboats from voluntary contributions although my Department make an annual grant of £100,000 to the institution.  The possibility of securing European Community aid has been examined in the past but national search and rescue activities are effectively excluded from such funding. The Government's aim is to arrange for the provision of the best safety services possible within the resources available to them.  Any adjustments which are under consideration will be determined primarily by the overall implications for safety around our coasts and within the country, and the Government intend to be guided by the advice which will emanate from the review group on air-sea rescue services.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="93" /> The provision of air-sea rescue services on a contract basis by private companies is a feature of search and rescue facilities in some other countries.  The review group on air-sea rescue services will, no doubt, consider that option in the course of their deliberations.</P>
    <P>My Department received an unsolicited offer from a helicopter company to provide such a service.  Their offer has been discussed with officials of my Department but no commitment has been given to contract such a service from them or from any company.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister clarify if he is seeking international funding and not just EC funding having regard to the fact that the majority of accidents that occur relate to nationalities other than EC nationalities?  Of the 23 tragedies that occurred since the beginning of this year, only four vessels were from EC countries. Would the Minister agree that he has a strong case to seek international funding to help us to set up an adequate sea and air rescue service on the west coast?  Will the Minister also let me know if the review committee to which he referred have met?  If not, when is it intended that they will meet and has a deadline been put on their deliberations so that something urgent will be done?</P>

      <P>The committee as yet have not met but the Minister and I have met their chairman.  As it is an international committee there will be some difficulty in summoning all the members but I expect that the chairman will arrange a meeting of the committee shortly after Easter.  We certainly will look at all sources from which finance may be available.  We all appreciate that search and rescue knows no boundaries. It is erroneous to suggest that every <Col N="94" /> country should have available to it of itself sufficient search and rescue services. We have proven ourselves in incidents such as that relating to the <i>Yarrawonga</i> which was well outside of our control.  This ship on its way to the US turned on its way back to Europe when it found itself in difficulties.  The MRCC, Valentia and Malin Head, played a vital role together with the naval services and others and we ensured that a tow line was thrown aboard the vessel. We played a vital role there, but I appreciate the point made by Deputy Pattison that we should look at all sources of revenue.  It would be ideal if a rescue base under the control of the Irish Government was set up in Ireland for all countries using the North Atlantic.  That would be an ideal situation but we are living in the real world.  I hope the committee who will sit shortly after Easter will report to us at the earliest possible date and make recommendations to Government.</P>

    <P>9.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Marine if he will outline the action he has taken to date to deal with the continuing problems of pollution in Lough Sheelin, County Cavan; and if he has satisfied himself that the present position is satisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I attach major importance to the task of fully restoring Lough Sheelin's reputation as one of Europe's premier brown trout fisheries. To that end, my Department continue to remain significantly involved in orchestrating and implementing action programmes designed to progressively improve water quality conditions in the lough.  The pollution control management strategy of the Lough Sheelin management committee on which both my Department and the Central Fisheries Board are represented, is supported by <Col N="95" /> the work of a technical subcommittee chaired by my Department.  Among the works carried out by this subcommittee, established at my Department's instigation in 1987, have been: (i) the development of a detailed slurry management plan for each large pig producer in the catchment.  These are now in place and operational for over 12 months, and (ii) comprehensive surveys of cattle farms in both the Cavan and Meath portions of the Lough Sheelin catchment.  The volumes of slurry exported from the catchment in the 12 months period to September 1988 were greater than volumes taken out in any 12 month period in the early eighties under the slurry transport subsidy scheme.</P>
      <P>While there are no grounds for complacency, I am nevertheless satisfied that conditions in Lough Sheelin will gradually improve.  It is imperative, however, that the goodwill and active co-operation of the agricultural sector within the catchment be maintained and increased if progress is not to falter.  For the past few months water quality in the lough has shown positive signs of improvement.  If the input of phosphorous from the feeder streams can be maintained at a low level it is likely that a significant improvement will continue to occur.  Recent monitoring indicates that there is a range of trout stocks, normal for unpolluted streams in the tributaries to Lough Sheelin. It is hoped, too, that 1989 will witness the beginning of a recovery in the flora and fauna of the lough.</P>
      <P>I would also like to mention the proposals for the pilot plant trials to convert pig slurry into organic fertiliser and biogas for on-farm energy use.  If successful these trials will, combined with the installation of a suitable treatment plant to remove the phosphorous from the final effluent, lead to the elimination of the current need for landspreading of slurry and greatly assist the rapid rehabilitation of Lough Sheelin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I am greatly encouraged by the progress of the measures outlined above, there are circumstances in which there is a need to invoke penalties and sanctions <Col N="96" /> if some polluters are to be deterred.  For this reason, and in order to strengthen the hand of fishery boards and local authorities in Sheelin and in other areas proposals for substantially increased penalties form part of the Local Government (Water Pollution) Bill, 1989, which was recently published by the Minister for the Environment.</P>
    <P>As part of the ongoing monitoring of the condition of Lough Sheelin's water checks are made at least every month on visibility through the waters.  Unless natural light can penetrate the waters of a lake plant life and invertebrates cannot survive or regenerate.  It is heartening to note that in December 1988 and January of this year the visibility was three metres or even more.  There is of course a seasonal variation in visibility and in February this has shown up a reduction due to wind induced sediment uplift.  There can be no slackening of efforts on the part of all State and private interests to reduce the pollution threat to the lough, to reverse the build up of undesirable compounds in the water body and to restore the flora and fauna to its pristine quality or to its former quality.</P>
    <P>Finally it would be remiss of me to let this opportunity pass without paying tribute to the sterling work performed to date by the local authorities in tackling and overcoming the major environmental problems which had evolved within the Lough Sheelin catchment. Likewise, the resourcefulness and dynamism which the Cavan County Manager, Mr. Mackey, is bringing to bear on these problems has rightly generated a considerable reservoir of optimism among all parties for the future health and well-being of Lough Sheelin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>This reply could be <Col N="97" /> given in the form of a tabular statement but, however, there are only a few figures. It is estimated that at present almost 13,500 people are engaged in a full or part time capacity in the sea fishing industry.  Approximately 5,850 persons are employed full time and 6,250 part time in the fish catching, farming and processing industries.  In addition an estimated 1,400 are involved in the provision of ancillary services.</P>
      <P>Since 1987 about 340 new jobs have been created, mainly in aquaculture.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister when compiling statistics on sea fishing to keep the traditional sea fishing, as we know it, separate from mariculture proposals which is a different operation even though it is involved in the sea?

    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>At all times we try to separate them.  While they are all based on the sea fishing industry, there is a difference between the traditional type of fishing and the more modern aquaculture. However, in case the Deputy requires a breakdown of the 340 new jobs, 170 have been directly in aquaculture, 100 in the processing sector, 50 in fishing and 20 in the downstream and ancillary services.  We have established that it is right and proper to have a breakdown under the various headings.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that we found ourselves in a very difficult position in 1987 when there were serious constraints on us on assuming office when the previous Administration were of the opinion that there were only about half as many boats fishing as were actually fishing.  We should put it on the record once more that the previous Administration tied our hands with a figure of 32,000 GRT whereas it is almost double that figure.

      <P>Salmon angling licence revenue in 1987 amounted to £170,874.  In addition, £21,576 was received under the voluntary registration system.</P>
      <P>Total revenue from rod angling licences in 1988 amounted to almost £400,000.

      <P>Having regard to the reductions announced in December, is the Minister in a position to give a <Col N="99" /> projection, if the same number of licences are bought in 1989 as were bought in 1988 as to how much less would be collected this year?  Would he not consider at this stage being responsible to the House and instead of inflating and distorting figures would he be honest and say that in relation to trout licences where there are 100,000 trout anglers, 3,500 trout anglers purchased licences amounting to £56,000?  Why does the Minister continue to distort the overall figure? Please give us some idea as to the projected revenue for 1989?</P>

      <P>First, I have neither inflated nor distorted figures.  I have given factual figures as ascertained from the various boards who have the statutory responsibility to issue these licences and who have accountability in this regard.  I want to make this quite clear because this accusation has been made on one or two occasions by responsible people who should know better.  These are actual figures which are subject to audit, are subject to scrutiny and are subject to examination.  The people involved in the compilation of those figures have a statutory responsibility for the provision of these figures and for their accuracy.  It is most unfair to have these accusations made in a wild and sweeping manner by people, including the Deputy.  It is most unfair to the professional people who have responsibility for compiling those figures.</P>

      <P>In view of the fact that the composite licence has been reduced this year from £40 to £25 a number of anglers who only fish for salmon and who want only an A licence are being given a P licence, or composite licence, for the same amount of money.  This will distort this year's figures of the number of people who purchase trout or coarse fishing licences.  These people are confused because all they want is a salmon licence. This will distort the eventual figure on the number of people who buy trout licences.  Is the reason for the reduction&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The composite licence was introduced last year in response to numerous representations I received that it would be desirable to have one licence to cover all fishing, whether it be game or coarse fishing.  This point of view was canvassed by representatives of anglers associations, by individual anglers and many others who believed that with the multiplicity of individual licences for particular species of fish it would be sensible and reasonable to have one licence to cover game, salmon, trout and coarse fishing.  It was indicated to me during the course of the year &mdash; and I indicated that we would be flexible about this legislation &mdash; by numerous bodies that the composite price which we set at £40 last year was excessive and was prohibiting people from buying licences which would cover them for all types of fishing activities in all parts of Ireland.  In recognition of that widely canvassed view I reduced the price by ministerial order from £40 to £25.  I believe that any shortfall which might arise from that reduction will be made up in the purchase of more licences.  I believe we will sell more licences and this will compensate more than adequately for <Col N="104" /> whatever we might lose by the way of the reduction in the charge.</P>

      <P>The Fishing Vessels (Certification of Deck Officers and Engineer Officers) Regulations, 1988, were made on 16 November 1988 and will come into force on 1 September 1989.</P>
      <P>By way of information I should like to tell the House that the reason for the delay to 1 December 1989 is to ensure that the introduction of these regulations will coincide with the start of the academic year at Greencastle Fishery School and the Regional Technical College in Cork.  This will give the surveyors time to examine candidates for certificates.  It is also important to inform the House that officials from my Department will be available to brief groups of interested fishermen and this is being arranged at present through the representative bodies.</P>

Would the Minister consider providing the opportunity for a discussion in this House on these long outstanding and important regulations in regard to safety and other matters in this area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the point made by the Deputy that these regulations have been long outstanding but immediately on assuming office we initiated them.  As I said they could be in operation now but for the fact that we do <Col N="105" /> not want to bring them in mid-stream whereby they could be disadvantageous to the students in Greencastle and the RTC.  A copy of the regulations will be made available to the Deputy at the earliest possible date.</P>
      <P>I should like to take the opportunity of saying that a certificate of service will be equivalent to a certificate of competence. This will allay any fears of traditional fishermen that they may not be in a position or have the time to sit the examination. Their service will be taken into consideration.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister indicate the size of vessel which will be covered and whether the requirements of these regulations will reach down to deal with vessels under 40 feet, which the majority of Irish fishing vessels are?  Secondly, may I ask the Minister what range of matters will be covered in order to ensure that the vessels will comply with the requirements of the regulations?  Will requirements such as life jackets, loading and design of boat be covered?  Thirdly, does the Minister envisage the introduction of policing of these regulations once they are introduced within his Department by way of regular, if not annual inspections?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>In the unlimited fishing area, a full skipper, two second hand full skippers and tow skippers limited will be required for vessels of 50 metres and over.  In the unlimited areas for vessels under 50 metres, it will be one skipper, one second hand or a skipper limited.  In the limited areas for vessels of 50 metres and over, it will be one skipper limited, two second hand limited or two second hand special.  In the limited area, for vessels of between 24 metres and 50 metres it will be one skipper limited, one second hand limited, or one second hand special.  In the limited area, for vessels between 16.5 metres and 24 metres, it will be one second hand special. I would point out that we are referring here to vessels over 16.5 metres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where vessels are described by way of <Col N="106" /> kilowatt, for vessels of 3,000 kw registered power or more, the number of qualified engineer officers will be three &mdash; a chief engineer officer, class one, a second engineer officer, class two, and a third engineer officer, class three.  Then there are vessels of 2,000 kw and of £1,750 kw.  This information will be available to the Deputy and to the House. We will police this area as efficiently as possible.  Even at this stage it is difficult to examine each individual vessel.  It is certainly done when a vessel is being registered or re-registered.  Then, the marine surveyors' office will have a look at other boats in the port at that time.  As of now, it is impossible to examine each individual boat.  I can, however, assure the Deputy that the best policing possible will be carried out.</P>
    <P>The question is a factual one, asking when this regulation will be introduced. It will be introduced on 16 November and will come into force on 1 December.  The Deputy mentioned lifebelts and other equipment on board vessels.  We are at the moment preparing very simple pamphlets and booklets.  These will be available not just to skippers but to fishermen. We hope that they will be available to all fishermen and that the skippers will act responsibly, ensuring that all the necessary equipment is on board vessels and that the crew members take due notice of these pamphlets.  The pamphlets should not be necessary but we find they are and will make them available.</P>

The Deputy will be aware of the deputation, attended by the public representatives, which I recently met.  I pointed out that I should like to examine the situation in Fenit from a number of points of view, not merely from the commercial aspect.  I am talking about the provision of tourist and leisure facilities there, of the provision of recreational and other amenities as well as the commercial and fisheries aspects.  Following the meeting, I also received a submission from Fenit for inclusion in the mid-west <Col N="108" /> regional programme for structural funding. That has been sent to Shannon Free Airport Development Company.</P>
      <P>I have some detailed information which I should like to discuss with the Deputy.  If he is available to do so, I can supply him with some additional requests for information which we sent to the commissioners, to enable us to make a proper assessment of the situation.  What I should like to see is an overall development plan for Fenit Harbour area generally, taking into account all the other aspects of development down there.  The Deputy should not forget that the limited funds that are available this year for commercial harbours have already been earmarked for the Deputy's colleague on the front bench, Deputy McGahon.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 17 and 22 together.  Forty draft net licences were issued in 1988 to Dundalk fishery district under the Control of Fishing for Salmon Order, 1982.</P>
      <P>A total of 46 persons have applied in 1989 for the 40 draft net licences allocated to Dundalk fishery district under the Control of Fishing for Salmon Order, 1982. Of this total, 39 are seeking renewal of licence and seven are new applicants.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy must be aware at this stage that pressure is on my Department to curtail rather than increase the number of drift or draft net fishing licences.  The recommendations of the review body which was established by my predecessor as regards how the whole salmon fishery aspect might be managed have come out very strongly in support of a view that drift or draft net fishing should be curtailed rather than increased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that there is a particular problem in the area to which the Deputy refers.  I give an undertaking here to have the matter examined to see if it is possible to make some arrangements which would <Col N="110" /> meet the problems of the fishermen in that area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The strongest suggestions have been made that we should change the method of fishing from draft net to drift net fishing.  These are technical problems. The advice that the fishery board give for this area is that the existing control should remain, in the interests of the fishermen themselves.  If they continue to overfish, that will put pressure on the stocks and probably damage the fishermen's own livelihood in the long term. As I have said, we are prepared to look at the situation in consultation with the Deputy, to see if we can work out a satisfactory solution.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Recent events have shown the extent to which Ireland as a maritime nation in the path of the prevailing south-westerly winds at the edge of the Atlantic, which lies to the west, south and south-west of the country, is <Col N="111" /> exposed to the dangers of maritime threat, whether from such instances as the holing of the bulk carrier <i>Yarrawonga,</i> the foundering of the fishing vessel <i>Big Cat</i> off the coast of Valentia, or the sinking of the cargo vessel <i>Secil Angola</i> off the north-west coast.</P>
      <P>I understand that there are only two commercial ocean going tug companies based in Northern Europe and the location of their tugs at any time depends on their work commitments.  Their travelling time depends in the first instance on many factors, including the distance they are required to travel as well as the conditions of the seas and the strength of the wind.  Details regarding the registered power of any tug are readily available to the Marine survey office of my Department.</P>
      <P>The Deputy's suggestion raises certain difficulties both practical and legal.  In the first instance, a towline may not always be available.  Secondly, the taking of a towline on board a vessel is usually a matter for the master and owner of the vessel.  However, the International Convention relating to Intervention on the High Seas in cases of Oil Pollution Casualties which Ireland has ratified allows coastal states to take such measures as should be necessary to prevent oil pollution from a vessel.  These measures include the taking or the restriction on taking of specified salvage measures.</P>
      <P>I should point out in a case where there is no imminent grave danger of oil pollution, domestic legislation cannot be enforced beyond the 12 mile limit and a court in a foreign jurisdiction is unlikely to enforce an Irish judgment if the liability under Irish law is not internationally accepted.  Therefore, the Deputy's suggested measures are only likely to be enforceable against Irish registered ships and foreign vessels in Irish territorial waters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is hoped to bring before the House shortly a Bill which will enact into Irish law MARPOL 73/78 and the Intervention Protocol.  MARPOL deals with pollutants other than oil i.e. noxious liquid substances, harmful substances, <Col N="112" /> sewage and garbage.  The Intervention Protocol empowers states to take action in relation to ships on the high seas which may be a threat of pollution by substances other than oil.</P>

I referred to the Oil Pollution of the Sea (Civil Liability and Compensation) Act, 1987, which ratified the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage under the 1969 and 1976 Protocol.  We also have MARPOL which deals with pollutants and the Oslo and London Conventions.  The Intervention Protocol will also be enacted as soon as possible.  We will then be in line with all the other countries.  I appreciate that any boat at sea is a threat but that applies to all cars on the road.</P>

The report brings together information on the Irish Sea in relation to oceanography, biology and the impact of pollutants, other than radioactive pollutants, which will be the subject of a separate report.</P>
      <P>With regard to information on fish and fisheries, the report's main comment is that most of the Irish Sea fisheries have been under heavy fishing pressure for some time.  The report concludes that the only discernible effect on fish stocks from man's activities is from intensive fishing and not from pollution.  Necessary conservation measures in respect of fish stocks in the Irish Sea are adopted by the EC on the basis of scientific advice from ICES.  Scientists from my Department participate fully in the formulation of this advice.</P>

      <P>I had just started my contribution on this Bill last might.  I made the point that despite the fact that the Minister and the Government had introduced various rationalisations of a fairly minor kind and some improvements, the reality was that the poor remain poor.  That is not just the view of The Workers' Party, it is the view of a large number of organisations working to have poverty eliminated in the State. They also feel that the Government have failed in their declared objectives.</P>
      <P>Social welfare is not a solution to poverty; the only effective solution is a decent, well paid job for those who are capable and fit for work.  Social welfare should be a system of providing for those who cannot work through illness or other problems.  Nevertheless, unfortunately, close to 250,000 people depend on social welfare because there are no jobs available for them.  Tens of thousands of others depend on the family income supplement because their income from their jobs is so low that they are in a poverty trap.  Having said that, the social welfare system should be designed to provide a barrier of safety net to protect those in need from the worst effects of poverty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="139" /> Given the level and extent of poverty, the provisions of the Bill are totally inadequate. It will do nothing to make those who are already poor less poor, it will simply ensure that most people on social welfare are not any worse off than they were before.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned, this is not just the view of The Workers' Party but that of organisations such as the Combat Poverty Agency and the Catholic Social Services Council.  Let me quote what the Catholic Social Services Council stated following the presentation of the budget in the leaflet entiled &ldquo;Budget Comment&rdquo;:</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the CSSC considers that the Minister has failed to meet, in any substantial measure, his two dominant aims.  As this Comment argues, the 1989 budget has introduced some measures that will benefit the poor but has failed to address the more basic challenges of a reform of the social welfare system or of job creation on the urgent scale now needed.  Going on this budget, action on poverty remains far from a national priority.  The government has missed yet another opportunity to translate its rhetoric into effective action.</P>
    <P>As I said, that is not a statement issued by The Workers' Party, but rather by the Catholic Social Services Council, set up many years ago by the Roman Catholic bishops of this State, who have been working over the years to try to alleviate the worst excesses of poverty.</P>
    <P>In their submissions and the submission of the Combat Poverty Agency it is quite clear that poverty is an increasing problem for a large number of people.  I refer to the report of the Combat Poverty Agency on an ESRI report where they list on page ii of Part I those people worst affected.  In paragraph 2.3 they state that using the objective cut-off lines of about £32, £40 and £48 for a single person per week and their equivalents, that is, 40 per cent, 50 per cent and 60 per cent of average disposable income respectively, up to 34 per cent of people are living in <Col N="140" /> poverty.  They go on to detail those most at risk.  They state at paragraph 2.4:</P>
    <P>The key trend to emerge is that the percentage of people below the relative poverty lines increased considerably between 1980 and 1987.  This is an accentuation of trends towards larger households in poverty that was emerging between 1973 and 1980 and reflects a change in the nature of poverty over time.</P>
    <P>In paragraph 2.5 they state:</P>
    <P>Households headed by the unemployed, families with several children and farming households stand out as the three main groupings vulnerable to poverty.  Those in low paying jobs, female single parents and the sick and disabled are also highly at risk of poverty.</P>
    <P>The report goes on to detail the extent of poverty in our society.  This Bill has to be viewed against current attempts by Government politicians and right-wing economists to sweep the problem of poverty back under the carpet.  There have been a number of attempts in recent months to deny what is plainly evident for all those who want to see, that poverty here is now worse than at any time since the fifties.  The interview given by the Taoiseach on the weekend of the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis is just the latest example of this and of the efforts to challenge the honesty and integrity of the statistics on poverty produced by organisations such as the Combat Poverty Agency and the ESRI.</P>
    <P>The indisputable fact is that the research undertaken on behalf of the Combat Poverty Agency by the ESRI in one of the most comprehensive studies on poverty ever undertaken showed the statistics I have already quoted &mdash; using a cut-off line of £48 per week, roughly 60 per cent of average disposable income, 34 per cent of people are living in poverty. Surely nobody could claim that anyone living on the equivalent of less than £48 per week could be living in anything other than poverty.</P>
    <P>The same report found that households <Col N="141" /> headed by the unemployed, families with several children and farming households stood out as the three main groupings vulnerable to poverty.  The report points to the increasing impact of unemployment. Thirty three per cent of all households with less than 50 per cent of average disposable income are headed by an unemployed person.  Attempts are being made to suggest that the figures produced by the Combat Poverty Agency are misleading because they do not take into account what are described as non-cash benefits.  This line was trotted out by the Taoiseach at his Ard-Fheis and is a favourite line of that great guru of right-wing economics, Dr. Seán Barrett, who also holds the perverse view that paying social welfare contributes to the continuation of poverty.</P>
    <P>What the Taoiseach and Dr. Barrett chose to ignore is that all sections of society benefit from non-cash benefits and there is considerable evidence to suggest that the well off benefit to a greater extent from these non-cash benefits than the poor.  Concessions such as mortgage relief, relief on life assurance policies, subsidies to private schools and third level education all benefit the well off to a far greater extent than the poor.  Dr. Barrett is one of the most prominent economic ideologues of the right and is typical of a group of economists who persistently try to put a veneer of intellectual respectability on the principles of greed and privilege which characterise so much of the economic policy of the right. Dr. Barrett is not averse to taking a second salary from the State in his position as a member of the board of Bord Fáilte or to enjoying the non-cash benefits of the heavily subsidised third level academic life, but he seems to begrudge the poorest families in the State assistance to put food on the table.</P>
    <P>The principle of increasing most social welfare payments simply in line with inflation would only be adequate if the basic levels of social welfare payments were themselves sufficient, but this is not so.  Even with the inflation linked general increase and the special increases given to the long term unemployed an adult on <Col N="142" /> long term assistance will still have to exist on less than 80 per cent of the amount the Commission on Social Welfare identified as the basic minimum necessary for survival.  It must be kept in mind that minimum needs are just that.  In most cases such income will do no more than keep people in a sort of half life, a twilight zone, of never being able to do more than live in frugal misery.</P>
    <P>For many people on social welfare the increases given in this Bill are simply token.  The personal rate of old age pension will go up by £1.70, widow's contributory pension by £1.50, disability benefit by £1.40 and the prescribed relative's allowance will go up by 70p from £27.20 to £27.90.  In many cases a significant portion of the increases have already been clawed back by increases in differential rents, in the case of local authority tenants, and, in the case of those in receipt of a rent allowance, from supplementary welfare.</P>
    <P>The decision to push the date for payments of social welfare increases back to the end of July is particularly mean and petty.  Up until 1983 social welfare increases were paid at the beginning of April but since then the date for implementation has been pushed back by successive Governments, and this year the gap between the announcement of the increases in the budget and their actual payment will be more than six months.  Let it be said that Fianna Fáil were critical of this practice when in Opposition, but it is one they have enthusiastically taken up now they are in Government.  In the Dáil debate on the 1986 Social Welfare Bill the then Fianna Fáil spokesperson on social welfare, Deputy McCarthy, accused the Coalition Government of pushing the payment date back towards Christmas.  Deputy McCarthy and his colleagues have done their bit this year is bringing that Christmas date even nearer.</P>
    <P>The provision in the Bill to increase the amount of weekly earnings disregarded in calculating the rate of pay related benefit is a further attack on the pay related system.  The result of this move will be to further reduce the value of pay related <Col N="143" /> benefits.  This is a sinister attack on a very important part of the social welfare system but one which has received little notice.</P>
    <P>In his Budget Statement in 1987 the then Minister for Finance, the former Deputy Ray MacSharry, said:</P>
    <P>We intend to proceed with the proposals of the previous Government to reduce pay related benefit for new applicants from rates of 25 per cent and 20 per cent down to a new uniform rate of 12 per cent.</P>
    <P>This year's reduction in pay related benefit is part of that process.  The effect of this attack on pay related benefit has particularly hit those who have just lost their jobs.  Pay related benefit is paid in addition to the basic level of unemployment benefit for a period of 15 months and is based on the recipient's gross income in the previous tax year.  It has been particularly important in providing a buffer for the newly unemployed to help them adjust from paid employment to much lower social welfare levels, but because of the cuts in pay related benefit those who lose their jobs now face a very substantial drop in their incomes.</P>
    <P>In a recent article in <i>The Sunday Tribune,</i> Mr. Paul Tansey, their economics correspondent, published figures which showed that in 1982 a person who lost a job could expect to get in unemployment benefit 83.3 per cent of the income he or she was earning previously, but that because of the gradual reduction in pay related benefit this has fallen to 62.8 per cent in 1989.  This attack on the pay related system must be resisted if the value of social welfare payments is not to be further undermined.</P>
    <P>These reductions are particularly objectionable because workers are paying very high levels of PRSI contributions which are supposed to go towards financing pay related benefits. Although the amounts workers qualify for in pay related benefit have been steadily decreasing, there has been no decrease in the amounts workers are asked to pay <Col N="144" /> in contributions.  There is need for a strong campaign to protect what is left of pay related benefit and I hope the trade unions will raise this issue in the framework of the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i></P>
    <P>While there is a number of progressive and welcome proposals in the Bill, such as the introduction of a scheme of social assistance for widowers, it does not address the problem of poverty in any serious way.  The most damning indication of the low priority attached by this Administration to social welfare is that, despite all the evidence of poverty, the amount allocated for social welfare in 1989 was reduced by more than £88 million compared with the 1988 figure.  Such cutbacks in the face of the sort of poverty visible to everyone other than, apparently, the Fianna Fáil Party and their supporters in Opposition, the Fine Gael Party and the Progressive Democrats, are nothing short of criminal.</P>
    <P>Before I let Deputy McCartan in I would like to refer briefly to one or two other points.  The Minister has made much out of a proposal that he intends to pursue husbands who have deserted to get money from them for maintenance for their wives.  It seems from what is proposed here that there will be a claw-back from the maintenance being received by women and, we hope, by men, when the new scheme is introduced. When I heard this proposal first I thought the Minister was going to go out and try to get maintenance for wives, that the wives would in turn benefit from this. According to the Minister's speech and the Bill, he is proposing to take a proportion of any increase which wives get in maintenance from here on and where they get any kind of maintenance this will be clawed back and the wives &mdash; or husbands &mdash; will not be entitled to it as a top up of the deserted wife's allowance or benefit which they are already in receipt of.  That trick ill becomes this Minister.  I regard it as wrong that he should attempt to promote this as in some way as doing justice.  In effect he is doing an injustice to the unfortunate people who are caring for children and who are <Col N="145" /> left abandoned by either husbands or wives.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's proposal for widowers but I ask him to move urgently on the proposal he has also indicated he intends to consider, that is an allowance for fathers who are unmarried and caring for children.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>In joining with Deputy De Rossa in the contribution of The Workers' Party to the Second Stage of this Bill I would like to read into the record two documents I received today which are very pertinent and relevant to this debate.  The first is a very useful survey carried out by the Darndale-Belcamp unemployment action group.  A cover letter from the project leader stated that the report was prepared due to the ongoing hype by certain sections of the media and some of our politicians that people living in poverty contributed in some way to creating their own situation. The group believe this analysis shows the true facts and reality of poverty in Ireland today.  In doing that they seek to introduce a realistic dimension into the debate on this Bill and to show how much has to be done if any Government are to tackle poverty seriously as we know it, and by definition of that, indicate how far the Minister has failed in this Bill to do anything to tackle the poverty that is rampant throughout society and in particular in his own constituency.</P>
      <P>The analysis is based on four families on the estate.  The first is a typical family of two adults and three children on unemployment assistance.  Their total income is shown to be £111.80.  Covering all basic essential such as food, clothing, bus fares and the like the total cost found is £111.23, giving a family living at subsistence level a surplus of 57p per week to leave aside for all other items, all emergencies, all savings and all planning for the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The survey breakdown on food items and the like indicates that the total that could be expended on fresh vegetables is just over 6 per cent.  Poverty equals ill health because of the diets forced on people in such circumstances.  The survey <Col N="146" /> shows that under the Minister's proposals a widow living on a widow's pension of £67 per week would have a total expenditure on basics just to survive of £65.68, leaving her with £1.32 per week to plan for other items.</P>
    <P>The picture gets worse when one considers the single parent, such a common feature of the poverty trap.  Overall income is £80.5p per week while basic necessities for the survival of mother and child total £84.77, leaving them with a deficit of £4.72 per week which they have no capacity to meet.</P>
    <P>The final example given is of two adults and five children on the low income of £137 per week and not in the usual way looking to social welfare for assistance. This amount is typical of the pay of many members of the Defence Forces or of people in the public service and many other low income areas.  They will have a deficit of £60 per week because their necessities cost a total of £197.  That is the scale that has been illustrated in this very useful report delivered to the desks of many public representatives in this House and to the Minister just this morning.</P>
    <P>I want to point out the Minister's great scheme of searching for jobs that we have often said simply do not exist.  For a long time Jobsearch have been hounding the unemployed and doing very little else.  It is interesting because it has drawn to my attention this morning a letter from the Minister's Department explaining why a family of a father and four children were disallowed unemployment assistance in November 1988.  He was sent for a job from Jobsearch and on the morning he was due to go to work his wife who had been delivered of a child in hospital was due to be discharged from hospital.  She had serious back problems previously and had had an operation and because of the delivery was extremely debilitated.  The husband had a letter from her doctor indicating that she needed attention in the short term once released from hospital.  He went to the exchange, explained his position and said he simply could not go to work that morning.  He was cut off unemployment assistance <Col N="147" /> because he was not reporting for work. He had no choice but to stay at home with his family.  That is the type of treatment being afforded to people by the Minister and his Department.  I had to write to that person's public representative, Deputy Woods, Minister for Social Welfare, to plead that he be allowed back on to assistance and that when Jobsearch was presented to him again they might allow for the fact that his wife has to go back into hospital this very month.</P>
    <P>The Minister has failed abysmally in his efforts to help in the vast majority of cases.  The day after the Budget Statement in this Chamber I went as a city councillor, to a public meeting with the officials, and they introduced rent increases for local authority tenants right across the board.  A document came into my possession within days of that meeting stating that CIE were demanding increases in bus fares.  Irrespective of the itsy-bitsy response of the Minister for Social Welfare to poverty, any increase is whittled away within weeks, if not days, by agencies and other people looking for increases in prices and so on.  As long as the Minister and the Government continue this approach to poverty, ignoring all the advice and submissions of so many people and failing to deal with the fundamentals, people will be left in the poverty trap.  What little they get one day will be taken from them the next.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnStafford" hpid="Mr. Stafford Mr. Stafford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stafford</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend the Minister on his achievements during the past two years and the humane approach he has adopted.  He has worked extremely hard, speaking to every section of the community, to backbench Members of Fianna Fáil and to anyone else in relation to social welfare problems.  He has succeeded in obtaining various concessions, despite constraints on the Cabinet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have lived and worked in the north inner city all my life and have been aware of the social problems around me.  Many families in the area where I was brought up lived a hand to mouth existence, living from one dole day to the next.  In the forties and fifties, poverty was endemic <Col N="148" /> in the north inner city.  Families were living in tenement buildings with barely enough money to put food on the table. Children in many parts of the area never wore new clothes or shoes.  Deputy Wallace outlined yesterday a similar situation in Cork.  Since those days, I have seen a steady improvement in the standard of living of families at the bottom of the social scale.  Housing conditions have improved dramatically.  Many very nice houses have been built, especially in the city centre.  There have been improvements in health care and the provision of a free health service for people on low incomes, as well as increases in social assistance payments over the years, mostly by Fianna Fáil Governments.  All this has led to fundamental changes in the living patterns of the unemployed. Perhaps when the financial position improves, the Minister might consider positive discrimination in regard to second level and possibly third level education in the inner city areas.</P>
    <P>Despite the many improvements over the years, we have to acknowledge that room for further improvement exists. Unemployment is one of the great social ills of our time.  One of the main priorities of this Fianna Fáil Government is the creation of more jobs.  It must be admitted that jobs are not being created or saved at a rate that would satisfy all of us.  Businesses have been closed and jobs have been lost due to changes in technology. Production lines operated by person power are almost a thing of the past.  It is difficult for any Government in this technological age to get people at work.  Ten or 15 years ago in my area many people worked on the docks.  It was quite common at a funeral to see 1,000 dockers lining the quays, but today in the docks area there are only 300 people.</P>

      <P>Yes, technology will create jobs in the service industries. Tourism can play a major part in the economy.  The schemes operated by FÁS and CERT are designed to bring extra people into the workforce.</P>
      <P>Long term unemployment in endemic in parts of Dublin Central and is a difficult problem to solve.  There are instances of families who have never worked, perhaps for several generations.  Such a family environment destroys the incentive to seek work, even when the wish to work is present.  With the best will in the world, some of these people would be considered unemployable.  Our Government and any future Government will have to consider they have failed if jobs are not available for everyone who wants to work.  The vast majority of the unemployed do not want to be in that position.</P>
      <P>This Fianna Fáil Government will not and should not be thanked if, having succeeded in stabilising and eventually abolishing the national debt, nothing is done for the great mass of the unemployed. However, I have great confidence in future employment prospects in this country.  Great flair and imagination are needed to solve the problem and these qualities are possessed by this Government. I have never taken the view that this country cannot sustain a fully employed adult population.  When we look at the geographical size of Ireland in comparison with other European countries, we realise that with the proper attitude we can achieve this goal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unemployment has a very profound <Col N="150" /> effect on the individual, as well as the family unit who are socially and economically affected.  The longer a person is unemployed, the greater the psychological impact.  Hopes of employment disappear. Long term unemployment has a tragic effect on the family, as well as imposing severe financial hardship.  In recognition of this, the Minister for Social Welfare has made major improvements in payments to the long term unemployed. The increase for a single person is from £42 to £47 and for a married couple the payment increases from £70 to £76.</P>
    <P>Married couples with two children will receive £97 per week, an increase of £6.60 per week.  The percentage increase is more than 10 per cent but the allowance paid to the long term unemployed has been increased by 25 per cent.  When we consider that the CPI last year increased by less than 3 per cent we will appreciate the excellent job the Minister has done. The Minister recognises the problems of the long term unemployed and has given a huge increase in their allowance.  Many people have given him credit for this work.</P>
    <P>We have a big problem trying to create jobs in our area and for that reason we welcome the decision to establish the financial services centre at the Custom House Docks site.  I have no doubt that there will be a knock-on effect in the surrounding area but we must ensure that the residents of the centre city are not discommoded by the major changes that will take place.  We must ensure that they are allowed to live in peace and harmony and are encouraged to integrate with the new residents.  My duty to my constituents is to ensure that new developments do not make aliens of those who live in the city centre as happened in the London docks area.</P>
    <P>We have been told that because of the type of hi-tech work involved at the financial services centre it will not be possible to employ local people, but I do not accept that.  A proper FÁS training programme will equip people in my area to do any of the jobs in the centre.  Many <Col N="151" /> people from my area occupy top positions in the country.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the deserted wife's allowance.  Marriage breakdown is one of the great problems of modern society.  There is great heartbreak when a marriage breaks down and nobody wishes to add to the burden of such families. However, when a family unit breaks up and the partners separate the duty to provide financial support still rests within the family, be it the husband or the wife, or both.  There is an attitude that when a marriage breaks down the State should support the separated spouse and children of the union.  Where a husband and wife have well paid jobs they are more than capable of supporting the children. The partner who leaves the family home must continue to give financial support if at all possible.  When I see widows and single parent families trying to live on their social welfare allowance it grieves me particularly when I bear in mind that in the case of some separations rich partners do not give any support to the family but expect the State to pick up the tab.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister has undertaken to rectify this glaring abuse.  The cost to the State of the deserted wife's allowance is £52 million and that must be paid for by the hard pressed taxpayers.  Once again the PAYE sector must bear the cost.  I congratulate the Minister on his efforts to rectify this anomaly.</P>
    <P>I am worried about the claw-back provision, although I accept the need for it. The State must be equitable in all its schemes.  Where husbands are making payments to the family income they will be deducted from the deserted wife's allowance but we must keep an eye on this to ensure that people do not suffer any hardships.</P>

      <P>I do not think it will.  The greatest poverty is created by the partner who walks away from the family and does not support those left at home.  That should not be tolerated.  I am pleased to <Col N="152" /> know that the Department will be pursuing defaulting husbands.  I am pleased that the deserted spouse will be pursued through the courts to ensure that adequate financial support is given to the families.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about the activities of moneylenders particularly in deprived areas.  For many years I have been associated with the credit union movement and I was chairman of the north Dublin district branch.  That organisation rarely gets the praise it deserves.  Most of those who work for the credit union movement do so on a voluntary basis.  For most families births, first holy communion, confirmation, weddings and Christmas prove happy occasions but they also prove to be very expensive.  We all have pleasant memories of such occasions but there are people who find them distressing times because they have to resort to moneylenders to pay the bills.  The advice given to these people is that they should save for those special days but how can one save if every penny one gets goes to buy groceries and other necessities? It is unfortunate that most of those people have to turn to moneylenders, some of whom are ruthless racketeers who are oblivious to the trauma and heartbreak they cause.  They charge outrageous interest rates and in many cases insist on the borrowers paying back five times the amount of money borrowed. Some moneylenders use physical violence in their endeavours to collect their immoral earnings.  I have seen families torn apart as a result of the vicious activities of moneylenders.  Many wives are afraid to tell their husbands they have borrowed from moneylenders and some husbands cannot understand what their wives do with the housekeeping money. There is often great strain and conflict in those families.  Many women who have borrowed from moneylenders have told me that they cannot tell their husbands because of what might happen to them or their children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On occasions legitimate financial institutions are guilty of charging interest rates above the norm.  I am pleased that action has been taken to help those who <Col N="153" /> are in the clutches of the moneylenders by the establishment of a guarantee fund of £100,000.  I understand that the credit union movement, and others, will be involved in the distribution of that money and I wish them well.  I hope that as a result of the establishment of this fund, credit unions will be able to set up business in the few black spots where they failed in the past due to delinquency problems.  People who succeed in paying off moneylenders with a credit union loan will pay less interest and I hope they will be in a position to save some money.  The problem of moneylenders was widespread in Dublin some years ago but, thankfully, it is now confined to certain areas.</P>
    <P>Section 21 contains an interesting provision in regard to records maintained by an employer.  It deals with those who are claiming social welfare benefits while at work.  Heretofore a company would have to bring half their staff in to prove that this person was working.  Now I understand any records produced would be accepted.  Perhaps the Minister could make that retrospective.  I wonder if it would be <i>prima facie</i> evidence in law that a person was employed once documents were produced to show that such person was on the books of a company.  Over a period that would sort out the problem. Many people on PAYE who know quite a few people claiming social welfare while working, feel quite aggrieved about it and wonder why this problem has not been solved before now.</P>
    <P>In my own constituency of Dublin Central can be seen some of the worst poverty and unemployment in the country.  We are all seeking improvements and the Government are doing the right things.  I hope we will have a greater sense of urgency in relation to employment prospects. I would like to again commend the Minister for his humane feeling towards those who are less well off.  He will certainly have my support in doing anything he thinks will improve the lot of those people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to say a few words on this <Col N="154" /> Social Welfare Bill.  I listened with interest to the Fianna Fáil speakers over the last few days.  If a popularity poll were now held within that party Minister Michael Woods would rank in the top three.  The Fianna Fáil script writers have dished out the usual kind of Government speech very far removed from what I listened to when we had the opportunity to sit on those benches some years ago. At that time crocodile tears were shed week after week about the poor, the old, the lonely and the unemployed and what Fianna Fáil would do for them when they were swept back into power on a wave of popularity.  They have been back in power two years supported by this party with a consensus to do what is good for the country in terms of keeping inflation and interest rates down and keeping exports up.  All of these things, which were in train, have been continued; but we have been put over a political barrel and Fianna Fáil have been a complete and abject failure when it comes to solving the fundamental problem of creating jobs and eliminating the problem of poverty which result in frustration, anger and cynicism among our younger population.</P>
      <P>We are now faced with 1992.  Many local authorities have submitted a list of schemes to Brussels which amount to much more than the £500 million which the MEP for my own Connaught/Ulster constituency promised before the last election, much of which will never see the light of day.  It is as if the population here are only travelling to the match while the other countries are already togged out and waiting to play.  I do not know what Fianna Fáil intend to say over the next three months to tide them over the month of June, but if half of the battalions of unemployed out there on the streets decide to use their vote as a protest against what is happening, there will certainly be red faces on the Government side when votes are counted in June.  The Government have failed to use the support given to them by this party in Opposition to create jobs which would eliminate poverty, the problem of low incomes and all the rest.</P>
      <P>Brussels will not solve our problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="155" /> We have to solve them ourselves.  Unless there is flair, motivation, incentive and leadership on the part of Government we will never get out of the rut, the cul de sac, in which we are at present.  I am reminded of the words in the song years ago, &ldquo;Oh Ireland what has happened to the promise and the dreams&rdquo; etc.  We heard words of boom and bloom and they have gone too, faded away.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods, the Minister for Social Welfare, is a good and caring constituency worker; but in his capacity as Minister for Social Welfare he ranks extremely high among his Fianna Fáil colleagues, and why not after they have supplied him with scripts and managed to keep people reasonably happy down the country.  However, we are not out of the woods yet.  Around the Cabinet table they wonder how much the electorate will bear before there is a revolution. They say they will give Deputy Woods so many million pounds and let him lash it out under the various schemes, tinker around with the engine of social welfare, make a few modifications here and there and let it continue on until the end of the year and hope Fianna Fáil will still be in power.</P>
    <P>In fairness to the Minister, he has done something which was not achieved even in our own time in Government, that is, he recognised the status of widowers. They may not have got all they should have, but it is very traumatic to see the circumstances, personal and social, in which widowers find themselves on the sudden death or loss of a spouse and they are left with a young family.  Often the widower is incapable of looking after the children to the same standard as his deceased spouse.  That recognition is important, and I am glad to give the Minister credit in that regard.  I hope a proper level of compensation can be added to that recognition after some time.</P>
    <P>There is an army of over 241,000 unemployed people on the streets who are cynical, apathetic and frustrated.  They have to suffer the indignity of standing in the rain and the wind and jostling their <Col N="156" /> way inside to a small area often in a disgraceful condition to sign for State money.  Many of these people are willing, anxious and eager to work.  I know Deputy Woods, in his capacity as Minister, does not have a magic wand to create jobs that match the qualifications and aspirations of the unemployed, but his Department should be linked with those Departments involved in job creation and in the process of bringing forward schemes that will lead to the creation of jobs.</P>
    <P>Every Tuesday the employment exchanges across the country boast that thousands of people are standing outside waiting to sign and draw their money. The Minister has saved £90 million in the Department of Social Welfare.  I certainly cannot condone any kind of abuse of social welfare and the Minister has taken certain steps to eliminate it, but this saving of £90 million has been taken from the soft targets.  That £90 million could be used to balance the scales in a way that would not be more costly in time to come.  We have all heard local authority representatives speak about the very poor state of country roads.  That amount, £90 million, would resurface 18,000 miles of road at £5,000 per mile, which is the average rate for resurfacing and which, under the Department of the Environment, will cost a colossal amount over the next two years.</P>
    <P>As I have said, these young people and the unfortunate people who are out of work are cynical, frustrated and angry. When they turn on their televisions they see advertisements referring to the élite, high style, high fashion and high cost, and that creates an even wider gulf between the haves and the have nots.</P>
    <P>I am not sure that the Minister, Deputy Michael Woods, would be the hit that Fianna Fáil representatives seem to think he is were he to speak to Irish emigrants in Camden Town or other places across the water or on their arrival back at Knock Airport.  Many of these young people have been assessed under the social welfare system here as being living at home.  A 20 year old on the maximum allowance of social welfare should get <Col N="157" /> about £37 but because he is assessed as living at home with his parents that amount would be reduced by £10, £12 or £13.  That means a 20 year old is expected to get up in the morning, go out on the land, check the cattle, feed the dog, cycle down to the village and still be expected to compete with his or her peers on an allowance of that nature.  These people are condemned to exile as a result.  The human indignity of walking, cycling or having to be driven by somebody to an employment exchange to draw that amount of money puts them in a position that, if they have any motivation at all, they will leave the country and leave they do.  Many of them then end up on the streets of foreign countries or are used as slave labour for sub-contractors.</P>
    <P>In that context I want to bring to the Minister's notice something that is extremely serious in the context of those emigrants who are forced to leave.  Many of them are forced to work in the construction industry.  They end up on building sites in London and other countries ill equipped to work in an area like that. For example, I have a letter from the registrar of Hammersmith hospital referring to a young emigrant from my own constituency who, because of the social welfare system here emigrated.  On 17 June that person fell from a four storey building and suffered severe head injuries. The registrar gave a medical report which I am not competent to understand but he said in his concluding remarks:</P>
    <P>It is now 18 months since this patient's unfortunate accident and there has been little or no change in his clincial condition.  It is the opinion of most Neurologists that if there has been no improvement after a year then subsequent changes are virtually out of the question.  I personally have been involved in this patient's care in the last five months and can be sure that there has been absolutely no improvement whatsoever.  I am afraid, therefore, that we must come to the conclusion that his distressing, vegetative state will never improve and he <Col N="158" /> will require continual nursing care for the rest of his life.</P>
    <P>That young man who is in his twenties, has a wife and three children, fell from scaffolding because he was probably ill equipped and ill trained to work on building sites.</P>
    <P>The Department of Social Welfare, in conjunction with the centres for the unemployed and the UCATT union who are dealing with immigrants in England, should make an effort to see that those who arrive in London and are forced to work in these jobs at least have some idea of what they are doing.  A young person from an urban area who has no experience of working in England may have to work on the 20th floor of a building and because he is not used to that work he can end up in serious difficulty.</P>
    <P>A recent report in <i>The Irish Times</i> indicated that most of the 35 people who were killed on building sites in London in the last year were Irish and 13 of them were not identified.  Information given to me recently indicates that in the seven years to last March 129 people were killed on building sites in London and 2,259 were seriously injured.  Many of these people are emigrants who were assessed under the social welfare system here but who, because of the low rates of social welfare allocated to them, were driven to emigration, condemned to exile.</P>
    <P>In regard to the young man I have mentioned, his family, friends, neighbours and the community have had to band together on more than one occasion to attempt to raise finance to keep his wife and family and to pay the council rent.  While leniency can be shown by the authorities it is never the ultimate.</P>
    <P>The Jobsearch scheme is a complete joke.  This is where the real savings occurs by the Department.  On numerous occasions fine strapping young men who could dig a trench around Merrion Square with a pick and shovel in a day, visit my clinic and tell me that they have been spoken to by individuals in pinstripe suits from Jobsearch who tell them how to make a telephone call, how to speak into the receiver and so on.  They are <Col N="159" /> advised how to approach a sub-contractor in relation to getting jobs.  The removal of these people from the unemployment list is only a temporary measure and does not address the fundamental question of the creation of jobs for those who are prepared to work.  Every Deputy here can give examples of people who, under the Jobsearch scheme, have to walk long distances to the place of assessment for work and then are given the most degrading positions.  I am well aware, as is the Minister, that many of the people who were interviewed originally for the Jobsearch scheme were already working and subsequently signed off.  I certainly cannot condone that.</P>
    <P>In relation to the demographic trend in the west of Ireland, it is now mostly elderly and young people who are living there due to the emigration factor. Because of the assessment system people who might have left money in the bank for their burial will withdraw it and lodge it in the house.  This leaves them open to the same kind of racket that took place some years ago where people travelled around the country beating up these people and causing death in some cases, with robbery as the sole motivation.  That system of assessment should be changed.</P>
    <P>In the many cases people on long-term disability benefit have been assessed as being medically fit for work.  It appears as if the system is operated on the basis of the doctors in the country as against the doctor from the Department and the referee usually decides in favour of the Department.  In some instances when the case is appealed it is overturned in favour of the claimant.  During that period the person is off the register.  Many of these people are genuinely not able to work.  It is very difficult to detect the bad back syndrome which, like the moving statues some years ago was very prevalent in this country.  It has now gone too far and there are a number of genuinely distressed people who are being assessed as medically fit for work and when they are quite unable to work.</P>
    <P>In regard to employer incentives, the changes in this area appear to be very <Col N="160" /> much favoured by Government Deputies but there is still not sufficient incentive for employers who wish to take on people.</P>
    <P>The family income supplement area needs to be overhauled.  We have been given examples of people who work six days a week and if their employment is reduced to a three day week, between the payment for three days and the unemployment benefit for the other three days they lose out on the family income supplement because Saturday is not counted as a day of claim.  Some employers, dependent on that type of operation, would request employees to work on Saturday.  The Department would need to examine that aspect.</P>
    <P>If the Minister wants to be remembered as a kind, caring, humane, forward-looking, progressive Minister, he could certainly do something with regard to the prescribed relative allowance.  Our historical background has created a strong inter-family dependency.  The disabled person's grant has been abolished in recent years.  This means that people who wish to keep an elderly relative at home in the privacy, comfort and dignity of a room of their own, now receive no assistance.  If one cared to calculate the average weekly cost country wide of maintaining an elderly person in a geriatric unit I am sure it would amount to several hundred of pounds.  There are many families who would be willing to keep such elderly people in the comfort of their homes but are forced &mdash; through circumstances beyond their control &mdash; to have them accommodated in geriatric units.</P>
    <P>I know that not all personal relationships are good and that such circumstances do arise, but it would be worth-while exercise were the Minister to undertake a financial equation of the saving that could be effected and the consequent personal comfort to be gained by keeping many elderly people out of geriatric units in the comfort of their homes.  I contend the prescribed relative allowance should be paid directly to the person who has taken the decision to remain at home on a full-time basis <Col N="161" /> to care for an elderly relative.  That is another matter that warrants examination. Certainly, in the interests of human dignity, the Minister could strike a blow for everybody by deciding to introduce a provision whereby, under proper conditions, elderly people could be maintained at home rather than having them accommodated in geriatric units at much greater expense to the State.</P>
    <P>Many fishermen on the west coast have assessments made of their incomes when they are not working in winter time. Many such fishermen would be very poor accountants and would not maintain their books very well.  There should be a proper system devised to grant them allowances for the repair of fishing nets, purchase of diesel, repair of engines, overhaul of boats and so on, taking into account the vagaries of the weather and the ups and downs they encounter on the ocean waves.</P>
    <P>With regard to smallholder's assistance, I have heard of social welfare officers being driven around the country by taxi, getting lost and seeking directions, in order to assess their means.  I can assure the Minister that, if a social welfare officer were to arrive in a rural area by taxi, get lost and seek directions, one could be quite sure he would be sent down the wrong road by a neighbour or anybody else in the locality because that kind of news spreads like wildfire in the country.  Such assessments would need to be validated by somebody with a knowledge and understanding of agriculture and the various circumstances and difficulties smallholders encounter.</P>
    <P>I have listened to many Members speak about the harassment of individual smallholders and so on.  On one occasion only did I attend an appeal by a smallholder against his claim for assistance.  In that case I have to say that the appeals officer handled the case with the essence of courtesy and fair play.  I might add that the relevant claimant had asked me to attend.  In that case, I could not fault the appeals officer.  However, that may not be the case nationwide because others have related different stories of harassment by social welfare officers and <Col N="162" /> appeals officers.  That has not been a problem in my part of the country to the same extent as would appear to be the case in others.</P>
    <P>While the Minister may be held in great esteem by his colleagues, that esteem does not appear to extend to all other Members of this House.  I understand the Minister has a difficult and complex Department to administer.  Equally I am aware he has effected a saving of £90 million at the expense of many unemployed people, having forced others off the live register, many of whom have gone abroad.  The Cabinet would need to bear in mind the fact that the consensus on this side of the House has led to circumstances in which the Minister's Department, to a large extent, could become redundant.  I am sure everybody would like to see it become redundant, in the sense that we would not want to see long queues building up at employment exchanges in future years and the abolition of such queues would indeed constitute good Government and politics.</P>
    <P>We have given the Government underlying support for the benefit of the country as a whole.  But leadership on the part of Government has not been forthcoming in the creation of conditions in which those at present drawing unemployment benefit could lift themselves out of the morass in which they find themselves to a new and better way of life.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to be able to contribute to this debate and to have an opportunity to tease out some issues which have been of concern to me over the past year or so, and to examine some of the provisions of this Bill as they seek to improve the lot of social welfare recipients. I should also like to examine some of the innovative schemes introduced by the Minister over the past 12 to 18 months.  The Minister has involved himself specifically not only in monetary matters in so far as his Department are concerned but also in a whole range of other issues that have warranted scrutiny and attention for some time.  This involvement on his part has meant that necessary schemes could be introduced <Col N="163" /> or existing ones rationalised and streamlined for the benefit of social welfare beneficiaries.</P>
      <P>More than any of his predecessors, the Minister has addressed himself to the twin fundamental issues affecting the operations of his Department.  The first relates to financial matters with regard to benefits and social welfare payments. The second was the conclusion that the Department needed to have their operations upgraded and modernised.  The Minister set about those twin aims on assuming office in 1987.  Of course, he could not do so without bearing in mind overall Government strategy or the operations of other Government Departments. We should not forget that the policy of this Government, on assuming office, was to continue the strict control on Government expenditure and borrowing, to improve the position of the deprived in our society, particularly those on low incomes, to lighten the burden of personal taxation and to promote increased employment.  Those were the four principal aims of the Government on assuming office.  Of course it falls to the Minister present to assume responsibility for dramatically improving the position of the deprived in our society and those on low incomes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provisions of this Bill constitute the third stage of this process emanating from this Government's third budget.  There are a number of increases granted &mdash; with which I will deal later &mdash; which signal the commitment of the Minister to improving the lot of the under-privileged and those on low incomes.  A great deal has been written and spoken about poverty in our society, particularly over the past few years.  As we know, many seminars have been held; on the subject; reports have been produced by various interested individuals and organisations, and the whole question of poverty has been debated at national level for quite some time.  Real poverty has undoubtedly been caused by high unemployment.  The most successful way to deal with poverty is to get more <Col N="164" /> people back to work.  This would allow available resources to be spread evenly among a diminishing number of social welfare recipients.  In that way we would meet our aim to improve the lot of those on social welfare and on lower incomes.</P>
    <P>The Minister has ensured that everything possible is being done to ease the plight of the less well off.  The main purpose of the Bill is to give effect to increases in rates of social welfare payments and other improvements in social welfare schemes, announced in the budget.  We live in difficult economic times and resources are scare.  This places an increasing burden on the Government and on the Minister for Social Welfare who must utilise available resources in the best possible way.  The Minister has taken a number of positive steps in the Bill apart from the various financial increases.</P>
    <P>In the past year the Minister referred on more than one occasion to the FIS and has indicated his disappointment that not enough people who qualify have taken up the scheme.  The Minister has done his best to highlight this fact.  At some stage over the past two years the Minister decided to have carried out a detailed study of the FIS and that report is with the Minister now and he referred to it in his contribution today.  In May 1988 just over 5,000 people were in receipt of family income supplement which was an average weekly payment of £17.89.  I have been surprised by the fact that people on low income who visit my clinics have not applied for the FIS.  There is probably a communications difficulty here and information from the Department is not getting through to those who would qualify for the scheme.  I know that the whole question of the communication of information from the Department is something that has concerned the Minister in the past and that he has worked for some time to ensure that information is readily available in an understandable form to members of the public.</P>
    <P>The Minister has initiated a new approach in helping widowers and <Col N="165" /> deserted husbands with child dependants. This issue was constantly highlighted for many years not perhaps in a co-ordinated way but on an individual basis almost.  Widowers and deserted husbands who have had to care for their children at home found themselves unavailable for work.  They were only entitled to the lowest social welfare allowance.  They were not well organised in articulating their difficulty.  I am glad that the Minister has taken on board the representations from all sides of the House over the past year and a half or so and has now found it possible to set this difficulty aside for deserted husbands and widowers who will benefit greatly from the improvement.  I understand that something of the order of 5,500 men are in that situation.  I compliment the Minister for making the change.  This is not a change that will be widely publicised. Indeed, in purely electoral terms, it is not very important either.  However, it is an important issue for a small number of people relative to the total number of social welfare recipients.  At the moment a widower with two children in receipt of supplementary welfare allowance gets £56.80 a week.  Under this new scheme that will increase to £74.80 a week.  That is a very substantial increase of £18 a week.  From talking to individuals in this situation I know they appreciate the improvement very much indeed.  Of course, larger families will gain more. The 5,500 men who will benefit from this scheme are glad that at last a scheme has been introduced which will help them in their very important role in caring for their children.  The Minister is to be complimented for dealing with this issue.</P>
    <P>I agree also with the change in relation to the rural-urban anomaly in the rate of unemployment assistance.  I represent a largely urban constituency in Tallaght-Clondalkin. That anomaly was present in the area and it caused a lot of grievance and annoyance to people who came under the rural scheme.  It did not make sense because many of these people were living in housing estates which just happened to have been built in a field that was designated rural rather than urban.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="166" /> The difference in rates has now been dealt with by the Minister.  Those who were on the low rate will now receive the top rate of unemployment assistance. The change will also have a beneficial effect on the staff of the Department as they carry out their work in the front line. Where civil servants have had to deal with different rates, even though people were coming from the same parish, it must have been very confusing and very time-consuming to monitor the operation of both rural and urban unemployment assistance schemes.  The scheme has now been streamlined and that will help the staff of the Department of Social Welfare in dealing with the public.  That is something to which the Minister's attention had been drawn for some time and I am glad that the Minister has now found it possible to make the appropriate change.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to see some action being taken in relation to deserting spouses. This issue arises frequently nowadays and I have come across it frequently in my constituency.  Often the deserting spouse, usually the husband, has been seen by his own wife to have simply walked away from his responsibilities.  I have often received representations from wives who say that this should not be allowed.  They should not have to take from the State the deserted wives' allowance knowing that the deserting husband could be made to contribute his share of financial responsibility to the wife and family.  The case has often been made that something should be done about this.  The difficulty has been that the wife did not always have the resources to pursue the deserting husband in order to obtain proper and adequate financial support.  Now that the Minister, through his Department, will be getting much more involved in this process, I think deserting spouses will think more carefully about walking away from their financial responsibilities, whatever about their own personal relationships, in the family home.  It is right that the message should go out from the Minister that his Department will pursue deserting spouses to ensure that they, in so far as is possible, meet their family responsibilities.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="167" /> The most important part of the scheme is that the person left at home, particularly the deserted wife, will not suffer financially while the process of pursuing the deserting spouse is underway.  If that was not the case, then the scheme would be flawed.  The Minister has taken the view that the deserted spouse should not suffer while the process of pursuing the husband &mdash; if he happens to be the breadwinner &mdash; is underway, particularly when the wife has to remain at home to rear the children.  I am glad the scheme is now in position and that the message will go out to deserting spouses that they simply cannot walk away freely from their financial responsibilities and expect the State to pick up the financial responsibility for the family.  The Minister in taking action on this matter is to be complimented.</P>
    <P>I heard Deputy De Rossa refer at one stage to the fact that the fraud, so far as the Department of Social Welfare are concerned, is not all with the welfare recipients.  I agree with that.  The Minister has shown by his actions in the control of fraud and abuse over the past year that he is not differentiating between any group that has any business with the Department of Social Welfare, whether it is a social welfare recipient or those involved in employment etc.  He has taken a number of steps to pursue very diligently those people in business who defraud the system in relation to the payments of tax and PRSI.  The Minister has initially singled out a number of sectors &mdash; for example, construction, contract cleaning, forestry and security industries and introduced a system whereby these industries are now required to notify his Department when they take on new employees.  The Minister has advised us that the preliminary returns &mdash; because the schemes are at a very early stage &mdash; from January have indicated that over 500 employees have been taken on in this sector and have been notified to his Department.</P>
    <P>This situation was getting completely out of hand over the past number of years and it had very serious and adverse effects <Col N="168" /> on the legitimate economy.  Legitimate businesses who paid their taxes and PRSI on behalf of their staff were unable to compete with other companies who were defrauding the system in relation to the payment of PRSI and taxes.  They had an unfair competitive advantage over those who were legitimately honoring their tax and PRSI requirements.</P>
    <P>As well as dealing with whatever abuse by social welfare recipients, the Minister has gone after the employment sector where abuses were evident and singled out a number of industries.  Early indications are that his approach is proving successful.  We should not say that the Minister is interested only in fraud by social welfare recipients; he is also interested in the other side of the coin. That is a point I wished to make because fraud by the employment sector has caused serious difficulties in competition.</P>
    <P>I want also to refer to the pre-retirement allowance change which the Minister has also introduced and which is provided for in the Bill.  In last year's budget a pre-retirement allowance scheme was introduced.  The legislative basis for this scheme was contained in the Social Welfare Act, 1988, and I understand the regulations to implement it are on the way.  The Minister has also allowed for some amendments to be made to this Bill.  It is a very innovative and compassionate approach to dealing with this type of social welfare benefit because under the 1988 legislation to be eligible for the scheme there were specific conditions attached.  Generally speaking, the scheme will relieve certain persons of the need to attend the local office while at the same time providing them with alternative arrangements for receiving their basic entitlements.  That will be welcomed by the people who wish to participate in the pre-retirement scheme.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer briefly, on what I consider to be the Minister's innovative approach to the organisation of his Department.  During the early stage of his term of office, since 1987, the Minister has committed himself, and received approval from the Government, to carry out a major computerisation programme <Col N="169" /> in his Department.  The effect of such a programme would be to provide a better, more modern and up-to-date service to social welfare recipients and to those people who need to do business with the Department of Social Welfare because of their personal financial circumstances caused by unemployment etc.  The Minister has extended the computerisation scheme to the payment of cheques in his Department, which allows for greater efficiency.  That may be one of the reasons I detect a decrease in the number of complaints from recipients who previously experienced difficulties and delays in receiving their cheque entitlements. As far as I am concerned the level of complaints has decreased rapidly and I receive very few complaints now.  Presumably, that is because of the computerisation programme so far as the payment of cheques is concerned.</P>
    <P>The programme does not stop there. It involved a considerable financial investment to computerise the other exchanges in Dublin and in Cork, and it is being extended further afield.  This suggests that the Minister is anxious to give a good service to those on social welfare and that he is anxious to ensure that information is available at the point of entry for particular recipients.  They can go to the social welfare office in their own locality and get the information they require because of the development by the Minister of the one stop shop.  This is an important development so far as social welfare is concerned.  Very often when people need to go to the Department of Social Welfare for the first time it can be very confusing and disheartening for them, unless the right staff are available to assist and provide them with up to date information.</P>
    <P>I want to commend the Minister for his attack on the moneylenders and on the introduction of a very innovative scheme to be run in conjunction with credit unions and in which he has made a financial commitment and investment.  This will be of tremendous help to people who are unfortunately caught in very difficult financial situations and who see no way out.  The Minister's commitment to these <Col N="170" /> people through the action plan to get them out of the grip of moneylenders, which he announced some months ago, will help them once and for all get out of the vicious circle in which they find themselves as a result of doing business with moneylenders and to realise that to have recourse to this source of borrowing is not the correct step to take.</P>
    <P>I hope the introduction of this scheme will ensure that financial institutions and credit unions are more caring in their approach to those who come to them to borrow money.  The credit union organisation have a very proud record in this regard but I am not sure that all money-lending institutions have always acted in the best interests of those who seek to borrow money.  I regularly meet people who have borrowed far and above what their income allows for by way of weekly or monthly repayments.  I question why people under pressure are given loans by several different institutions or additional loans by the same institution without the institution checking out whether an applicant is in a position to make normal weekly repayments without destroying his or her family.  The scheme now promoted by the Minister will perhaps bring it home to the lending institutions that more care must be given in lending money and, therefore, there is a responsibility on them to ensure that an applicant is in a position to make payments and to reasonably carry on with his or her family life.</P>
    <P>The Minister has also carried out a rationalisation of the fuel scheme.  This scheme had gone completely out of control over the years and I believe very few records were available as to who precisely qualified for the scheme or who did not. The Minister decided to intervene in this scheme because there was so much unfairness in its operation.  Some people were availing of the scheme though they were not so entitled while others who would have qualified were not receiving their entitlements.  Because the fuel scheme is now administered by the Department of Social Welfare, who process and pay the fuel allowance for all social welfare recipients, this will lead to <Col N="171" /> a great deal more efficiency and will be of benefit to those people who are in need of assistance so far as the fuel scheme is concerned.</P>
    <P>A similar situation arose in relation to the footwear scheme.  This was a much abused scheme and needed to be completely and radically overhauled.  In rationalising the scheme the Minister set down the exact conditions of entitlement, etc. so that those concerned will know exactly what their entitlements are and there will be no ambiguity in future.</P>
    <P>I welcome the increases proposed in the Bill, particularly the 12 per cent increase for the long-term unemployed. This increase comes on top of the 11 per cent increase introduced last year, which means an increase of 23 per cent over a period of two years.  If we also take into account the changes in regard to the urban-rural payments this means that in some cases people on long-term unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare assistance have got an increase of the order of 25 per cent during the past two years.  That is no mean achievement during these difficult times.  I suppose it says something for the strength of the Minister in going to his colleagues in Government, spelling out the needs of the people he represents and ensuring that the best possible assistance is given to those on long-term unemployment which, in some cases, amounts to an increase of 25 per cent.</P>
    <P>I look forward to next year's budget. I believe further improvements can be made for those people on social welfare through the continued modernisation of the Department, as spearheaded by the Minister and his excellent staff.  I hope that through Government policy fewer people will need to draw social welfare as time goes on because they will be back at work and that improvements will continue to accrue to those people who will still be in need of social welfare entitlements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on the Social Welfare Bill.  Social welfare and the mechanism by which it is administered need close study so that we can bring a fresh approach to the many and varied problems afflicting the entire code.  First we have to remember that we are endeavouring to cater for people depending on welfare who are either permanently or socially deprived.  In dealing with this problem and these people we have put in place over many years a mechanism of payments which is hard to follow and causes confusion in the minds of many.</P>
      <P>There are large pockets of exceptionally high unemployment in my constituency of Cork North Central &mdash; in some areas it is as high as 78 per cent among the male population.  The increase in payments to long-term social welfare recipients is welcome.  However, I understand that only the recipient, that is, the insured person, and not his dependants will receive an increased payment, thus rendering the percentage increase to be much lower than appeared to be the case when first announced.</P>
      <P>We spend millions of pounds of taxpayers' money annually but it has been obvious for some time that the system controls us rather than we controlling the system.  It is time to change and put our house in order.  People entitled to social welfare benefits should be paid adequately and we should make no apologies for catering sufficiently for those people and families who need and deserve assistance.  The fact that a large percentage of the State revenue is committed to this purpose should never deter us from providing this support.  However, it does beg a vital question: what is the cause for such a necessity to the extent that we know it to exist today?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Social welfare recipients will always be with us and I am alarmed at the extent of the problem which has grown to virtually <Col N="173" /> epidemic proportions in recent years and which threatens to engulf us.  We will have to look at the factors involved and codify the entire system of payments so that we can cut out the anomalies and focus on the essentials.  The system needs to be grasped by the scruff of the neck and given a good shaking up.  In doing so people will be hurt but far more will benefit.  If, in the end, we get a better system it will be worth the effort.</P>
    <P>For a country which is supposed to be advanced and modern it is nothing less than a crushing indictment of our system that we have so many deserving of welfare support.  We see critiques on our economic performance by international evaluators which point to our well-being and monetary resilience.  These assessments sit uneasily on the many new groups within our society who now come within the scope of qualifying for welfare payments.  It is obvious that we are building a two-tier society and that the gulf between the haves and the have nots is growing all the time.  This is very worrying and is the reason there is such a pull on our social welfare resources.  Too many are caught in the poverty trap and we must release them from it.  In the so-called exercise of balancing the books, we have tightened the trap and in some cases, locked it on people who have no hope of escape.</P>
    <P>We have created the poverty trap because we never gave people either the opportunity or the incentive to work. Even in areas of limited opportunities, we kill off incentives by crushing financial impositions on employers and workers alike.  This must stop.  We must create a financial climate in which employers will be encouraged to take on employers instead of being taxed for it and on the other hand, employees will have the incentive to work, through lower income taxation.</P>
    <P>We live in precarious times, with serious issues to be resolved.  We will not create a climate of renewal by a cost-cutting spree alone, a myopic book-keeping exercise that has condemned thousands of our fellow countrymen and women to penury for life.  There is no <Col N="174" /> even-handed justice here.  It has only accelerated the two-tier society, which is anathema to all of us.</P>
    <P>It is the responsibility of the Minister, as a member of the Cabinet, to devise a system whereby employers can afford to employ additional staff, resulting in a reduction in the numbers of those unemployed. Surely, it is not beyond the powers of imagination of the Cabinet to devise a reduction in employers' PRSI contributions.  This would greatly enhance the prospects of creating jobs for the unemployed.  Such a reduction in revenue would be balanced by an increase in PRSI contributions and income tax from those newly reemployed, together with the consequent reduction in social welfare payments.</P>
    <P>Fresh breezes need to blow through the corridors of power.  This Government should live up to their promises but, in that, one can only express great expectations, such has been their appalling record in this regard.  The issues of social welfare are great and need the fresh hand of independent assessment, not the craw-thumping statements of a Government which over the past two years have done so much damage and created a disastrous climate of ill-will.  Only a tremendous effort will reverse the dangerous trend that the Minister and the Government have set in train.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Burke for sharing his time with me and I am glad to have the opportunity of speaking on this Social Welfare Bill.  I share the view expressed by our party spokesman and Deputy Burke that this is a very conservative Bill.  It misses entirely any opportunity for radical change in the system and such a change is very badly needed as we struggle to provide employment for the huge numbers who are unemployed for very long periods or shorter periods and those who are leaving the country in such numbers annually to find work elsewhere.  This will be an ongoing task, a task for a decade ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our social welfare system is an integral part of the problem about creating employment.  It is tied in, with the PRSI <Col N="175" /> contributions, directly with the taxation system.  It has for some time now been the view of Fine Gael that PRSI should be treated as part of the general taxation system and that we should move towards a basic income system which would make unnecessary the present complicated social welfare system.  It would simplify matters greatly and bring dignity and respect to people.  It would acknowledge the changing face and nature of work and the fact that periods of unemployment, changes in employment, the moving into and out of employment and taking on of different types of work may have to be recognised and given their value in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>Nothing of this kind of thought or consideration in depth enters into this Social Welfare Bill.  It tinkers about with the system, misses a major opportunity and fails to make a substantial contribution to the greatest challenge now facing the country &mdash; since we have made progress at last with taxing our debt, a task which I know is ongoing &mdash; that is to free our economy to provide work for people here and give an opportunity to those who have left the country to come back and find a role here.  This Bill will do little or nothing to help people in those categories.</P>
    <P>The existing system as Deputy Burke has said, grew up in an <i>ad hoc</i> fashion, with benefit added on to benefit and scheme added on to scheme &mdash; schemes which had good intent initially but had to be modified later when they were abused or over-expanded, or had not given the expected results.  Despite the consolidation Bill, it is essentially a rag-bag of schemes in which there are still enormous anomalies.  I welcome the announcement that the child benefit scheme is being left as it is.  However, as it stands, child benefit is now available in regard to children up to the age of 21 years for certain limited categories of parents and not for others in similar circumstances but on slightly different benefits. This system is riddled with such anomalies.  We all have become aware of particular cases.  There is the case of a boy <Col N="176" /> of 18 years, still in his leaving certificate year, for whom the children's allowance was cut off on the next appropriate date to his birthday and who had a father who was unemployed.  This was because, while the child was in full-time education, the father was not in receipt of benefits that enabled the child benefit to be continued up to the age 21 years.  People in other long-term categories would receive it, but here the need is equally great and yet these people are not being considered. That serious anomaly still remains to be dealt with.</P>
    <P>The many changes in the Bill are welcome and make improvements to the schemes but those schemes continue to grow in anomalies and in inadequacy. The levels of increases have been commented on and I shall not dwell on that matter.  I am glad that an effort was made to reach out to those on particularly low levels of income.  A 12 per cent increase by any standards must be seen as a substantial increase.  However, as Deputy Burke pointed out, it is modified by this word &ldquo;streamlining&rdquo;.  I shall refer to that later and hope the Minister will reply in more detail to the sections in the explantory memorandum which detail streamlining. Could he give me a reassurance that this does not simply mean &ldquo;cutback&rdquo;? The Minister achieved great savings last year.  I gather they amounted to £70 million in a situation where fewer people were employed and fewer people were paying PRSI.  It is extraordinary that that could have happened.  Obviously, some categories of people have been cut off in that time.  I have no argument with the Minister and congratulate him on any success that he may have had in dealing with fraud, but many other categories of people have been dealt with rather roughly by the system.</P>
    <P>The levels of increase afforded have brought people an increase of a very small amount of money, indeed.  They fall very far short of the amounts recommended by the various commissions and agencies involved with the poor.  These indicate that an amount closer to £60 per annum would be necessary to live with any form of dignity.  This is a direction which must <Col N="177" /> be striven after.  While welcoming the increases, we lament how far short they are of the minimum necessary for dignified living.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the need to look at the basic income proposals supported by young Fine Gael and now a long-term objective of our party.  It is the only solution towards bringing dignity, fairness and evenhandedness and removing the disincentive to work.  It would be a transformation which obviously would have to take place in stages but it is our objective and I would be interested to hear if the Minister's party share our aims in regard to income support, social welfare payments and taxation in the long term.</P>
    <P>I share the welcome for the changes in the Bill in relation to deserted wives.  This has been an ongoing problem and I am glad the Minister is making the improvement. Perhaps now that the Department are moving one step to take on a certain responsibility in ensuring that husbands who desert live up to their commitments, they will throw their weight behind the mother and children in ensuring that that occurs and that they will carry the can in the interim.  Perhaps it would be possible to look at the treatment of children whose parents are not married or cohabiting. The system might be extended to ensure that the children born outside wedlock are treated in the same way and the fathers should be asked to perform the function for which, in all justice, they should initially be responsible and which the State should take up only if they are unable to do so.  In many cases the taking up of maternity payments and maintenance awards for children is so difficult that many parents simply do not avail of them.  We should look at this area in the context of equalisation of the treatment of children in the Children Act.</P>
    <P>I should like to draw the attention of the Minister to one group who have been robbed by the action of the Government last year of all entitlement to social welfare payments.  I refer to part-time workers, waitresses and others working in the hotel business.  The Minister is a <Col N="178" /> north Dublin Deputy with a working class constituency very similar to mine and many part-time hotel staff reside in his area.  He may have had representations from this group who, since the changes in the Social Welfare Act last year, are totally without entitlement.  For example, a woman who has been working steadily in the hotel business for three or four years finds that she is not entitled to maternity benefit and her baby is due shortly.  This occurred because last year the qualification for benefit increased from 26 to 39 weeks.  Many of these part-time workers have casual work which depends on functions.  They could work very long hours coming up to St. Patrick's Day, Easter and Christmas but it is usually very quite at the off peak season. Some of these women might work for 18 hours one week, which is the requirement to qualify for benefit, but the increase from 26 to 39 weeks has effectively meant that not many of them would be working an even 18 hours during that period. However, many of them work for 22 hours one week, 33 hours in another and it can go as high as 35 at certain times of the year.</P>
    <P>They have made the convincing argument that if their contributions were assessed on an annual basis and divided among the weeks they would qualify on a 39 week basis.  I should like the Minister to introduce an amendment to provide for this.  It would be a modest amendment but a fair way of dealing with the position. It would retain the 39 weeks qualification but would acknowledge that the workers have been cut off from money to which they are entitled.  They are generally in low paid employment, quite often they are the only wage earner in the family and now they are without benefit in the weeks they are not working, something they have enjoyed for the last decade.  I do not think that this was intended.  They are the accidental victims of the changes made last year.  I ask the Minister to specifically reply to this point.  As there would be a charge on the Exchequer, it would be difficult for us to move an amendment.</P>
    <P>The Minister made welcome changes <Col N="179" /> in relation to separate payments.  Many of us meet families in difficulties with separate payments because of alcoholism, gambling, lack of responsibility and so on.  In most cases the father does not live up to his responsibilities and it is very clear that because the dependent element was paid to the wife, the erring partner went off with an undue share of a very limited amount.</P>
    <P>I should also like to draw the attention of the Minister to a related problem, fuel vouchers, which are paid to the husband, the principal recipient, not the dependant. The thinking may be that the money may not be properly used or may not get to those for whom it is intended, but clearly fuel vouchers are intended for those who are handling the domestic bills. It is a minor change but in the spirit of the amendment and in the context of the very tight budget of families dependent on social welfare, obviously £5 per week over the winter is a lot of money.  We should ensure that it is used for the purpose intended.</P>
    <P>There are a couple of things that puzzle me and perhaps the Minister will clarify them.  There is a reference in the explanatory memorandum to a streamlining of the increases in adult dependant allowances under the unemployment paying schemes and to provision being made for a further streamlining of child dependant allowance increases.  I would like the Minister to explain what exactly is involved here.  I am aware that the net increases referred to by Deputy Burke will not reach everybody as the increases only apply in respect of the person unemployed and not for his dependants. Section 23 relates to self-employment contributions and as I have not seen a copy of the Minister's speech perhaps he might be good enough when replying to refer to these.  Can he tell us in what circumstances he would anticipate applying the provisions contained in the section?  There must be some reason for including these provisions and I would like some further clarification.</P>
    <P>I was going to comment on the way <Col N="180" /> women are treated under the social welfare system but I notice that Deputy Barnes has come into the House and I have no doubt that she will deal with this matter very thoroughly.  I have attended a number of appeals with women in respect of the payment of social welfare benefits and I would like to add my voice to the case I know she will make very well for equal treatment for women.  The fact that a woman is married and has children is used as an automatic reason for refusing the payment of unemployment benefit.  I have attended appeals to make sure that this attitude is not adopted.  If an employer were to adopt the attitudes which are evident in the social welfare system in the processing of claims from women, in particular for unemployment benefit, he would find himself before the court.  I ask the Minister to ensure that every effort is made within the Department to eliminate this discrimination against women, that strict guidelines are laid down and that it be made clear that it is equally illegal to refuse women benefit as it is to refuse them employment on the presumption that they would be unable to provide some form of care for their children. There are many cases where a husband who is unemployed, and looking for work, is willing to care for the children.</P>
    <P>I welcome the amendments to the provisions for the pre-retirement allowance. I am wondering if this allowance will be paid in the same way as the retirement pension is paid at present.  This is a welcome change.  I would also like to draw the Minister's attention to, and to express my own interest in, the educational opportunities pilot programmes.  These programmes should be extended and the regulations loosened as much as possible as one of the biggest difficulties we are going to face is how to treat those who become unemployable.  If people can be encouraged in periods of unemployment to achieve educational qualifications we would save ourselves a great deal of money in the long term.  They would also be helped in using up their time in a much more human and dignified fashion.  We should extend these programmes without <Col N="181" /> cutting across the educational grants scheme and the existing position in regard to access to education.  There should be no restrictions in place, however, on entry to certain basic courses for the unemployed.  I ask that this suggestion be looked at very sympathetically as with our present high levels of unemployment, which will continue into the foreseeable future, these programmes offer an important outlet for the unemployed.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, let me say that many of the changes outlined in the Bill are welcome but a huge opportunity has been missed.  All we have seen is a conservative tinkering with the social welfare system. The question of integrating our taxation structure with the social welfare system still remains untackled and this Bill will not help in our efforts to provide more employment.</P>

      <P>Every Deputy who has contributed to this debate has concluded his contribution by saying that he widely welcomes and agrees with the main provisions of the Bill.  This is only as it should be.  There was a little bit of hypocrisy attached to the speech of Deputy Flaherty who told us that for a long time Fine Gael felt that PRSI should <Col N="182" /> be included in the general taxation bill.  I have to ask the logical question as to what happened between 1983 and 1987.  If this was the view of Fine Gael, why was this not provided for in legislation?  It is hypocritical, and I use that word deliberately, of Deputies, particularly those who may have been Ministers in the previous Administration, to come into the House to tell us that something needs to be done and that it is disgraceful that nothing has been done.  If Deputy Flaherty wishes to bandy words about I will match her.  I can draw on our record.</P>
      <P>Many people did not think it was possible to achieve what has been achieved to date.  In his opening remarks the Minister gave one example of where progress has been made.  He referred to the case of a family with five children in receipt of long-term unemployment assistance and indicated that over two budgets he has increased the rate of allowance by £29.10. He also pointed out that this is more than three times the amount of increase made available by the Coalition Government, £9.20, in the previous two budgets.  We cannot look at these increases in isolation. We also have to take into account the present rate of inflation which is now so low that it does not impinge on those increases.  If Deputies on the Opposition benches look at our record they will have to say that they agree with what is contained in the Bill.  They may niggle about certain sections but, as I say, I sympathise with the main spokespersons who are faced with a difficult task.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Burke opened his contribution by saying that we need to put our house in order.  I would like to refer, as I did in my contribution last year, to the position in 1987 when at that stage the national debt had more than doubled from a figure of £12 billion to £24.5 billion. Considering that and Deputy Burke's opening remark that we would want to put our house in order, it is a bit funny, but he can be assured that we are heading down that road.  The public put Fianna Fáil in here to do that job and it will be carried out.  He also said we were obsessed with balancing the books.  He <Col N="183" /> must make up his mind what he wants to do.  Does he want to ignore the books totally or does he want to get the house in order?</P>
    <P>This Minister, by sheer hard work and nothing else, has been able to come up with conditions that benefited social welfare recipients and at the same time did not help to double the national debt.  He has worked hard at eliminating fraud.  He has been most fair in his approach and he has directed cash to the least well off.</P>
    <P>I wanted to refer to this before she left. Deputy Flaherty automatically assumed the term &ldquo;streamlining&rdquo; meant people's payments being cut.  This was most unfair considering she could have drawn on last year's experience.  In 1987, there were 36 different rates of child benefit in existence. Last year the Minister reduced that to 24 and this year he has reduced it to 12.  In all cases these rates have been rationalised upwards.  It is unfair to say streamlining is by definition cutting back on funds to people who need them.</P>
    <P>The Minister got rid of the anomaly between the urban and rural unemployed. Again he has rationalised upwards.  He has brought the rural payment up to the level of the urban rate.  A very large amount of money is involved here.  For instance a husband, wife and five children will get an increase of just under £15 &mdash; including child benefit and the payment they will get £14.85.  This rationalisation upwards is estimated to cost £3 million.  Let people be fair.  Let them read what is happening and be aware of reality.  The urban-rural change will affect most constituencies.  People might think of me as representing a totally urban constituency in Cork city but 37 per cent of my area is rural.  There are areas on the fringes which we would consider part of the city, Douglas being the classic example where the old divide was involved.  People on one side of a street were collecting a higher rate than people on the other side.  That was obviously discriminatory.  I congratulate the Minister for taking the initiative here as he has done in so many other areas.  Last night Deputy Harney was seeking an all-party <Col N="184" /> Dáil committee.  That is totally unnecessary.  The Government are well aware of the problems that exist and the Minister took steps last year and again this year to improve almost every scheme.  He has achieved more in those two years than a dozen committees would achieve.  There is no need for an all party committee; the work is being done.</P>
    <P>We all recognise there is a problem with financing.  There is a need for finance without doubling the national debt in the short period of three years and seven months.  This could be achieved by investigation, sheer hard work and control in areas where there was abuse.  The Minister has moved to control fraud and abuse of the social welfare schemes.  He has moved not only against recipients where there was obvious fraud, but he has looked at fraud in the business area too. During the Coalition era, the mid-eighties, many otherwise honest people perceived that they were foolish if they did not participate in dole fiddles.  All that is changing now.  Every public representative had people coming to his clinic saying they knew ten, 12 or 14 cases of people fiddling the system.  At that time there was a total lack of governmental and ministerial initiative or control and otherwise honest people thought they were foolish if they did not get in on the fiddle.  That is now changing.</P>
    <P>Any system can be abused but the proof of that change is that £37 million approximately was saved through tackling fraud last year.  That money was redistributed immediately to the most deserving cases.  It did not go into the Exchequer coffers.  In 1987, in 1986, 1985, perhaps even going back to the seventies when Fianna Fáil were in office, the really deserving cases were not getting the maximum benefit possible.  The taxpayer was paying more than he should and there was general chaos.  The Minister has shown that by careful management and control many millions of pounds can be made available for the least well off.</P>
    <P>These controls need not always be aimed at the social welfare recipient. Very often employers and speculators <Col N="185" /> were creaming off vast profits at the expense of others in the same industry. This year the Minister has specified four areas where new, more rigid controls are being brought in to ensure such activities are brought to a halt.  The most obvious is the construction industry where the greatest damage was being done not just to this State through the failure to pay insurance and taxes but to competing companies in the industry.  I know many small legitimate employers, and some large ones were put to the wall by the activities of the unscrupulous operators who had no respect for either their employees or their competitors, and obviously they had no respect for the country at large.</P>
    <P>The trade unions generally have been most anxious to get controls into this area and they support the Minister's efforts in this regard.  I hope the construction industry will support his efforts.  I felt there was some ambiguity about the response from the CIF earlier in the year. If the black economy is to be tackled effectively and the legitimate trader given a fair chance, some form of record keeping and accountability will be required. Nobody wants paperwork for the sake of satisfying the structures of bureaucracy, but I believe it was the failure to require accurate records of employees that brought about most of the trouble in the industry.  There were allegations of massive activity of this type in the Cork area in a few years.  I hope the implementation of the new regulations alongside the activities of the trade unions who were also working in this area will eventually eliminate the bad practice.</P>
    <P>Section 21 of the Bill removes the ridiculous requirement that existed up to now in regard to the giving of evidence about people being employed.  This must be welcomed.  Under section 22 the rogue employer can be convicted of certain offences and will be liable for repayment on demand of any social welfare payment gained as a result of his negligence or deliberate attempt at fraud.  This is welcome also.  These provisions are long overdue.  I say to Deputy Flaherty and others, there is no need to rob the State <Col N="186" /> to make meaningful improvements.  If you do your homework and are willing to work hard that can be achieved.  General support from the trade and honest practitioners is there and we should avail of it.</P>
    <P>Nobody has a monopoly on wisdom and there are areas where I would like to see action taken under the Bill.  One of those is the <i>pro rata</i> pensions and mixed pensions.  Last year the Minister had the courage to deal with <i>pro rata</i> pensions and he has gone a long way towards redressing the anomalies which have been a source of complaint.  A second group are caught up in a similar situation which is not of their own making.  These are the people in the group known as the mixed insurance category.  They have adopted the suitable acronym DOAPS, which stands for Deprived Old Aged Pensioners.  I have been in consultation with a number of these people for the past two years in my constituency and I understand fully their frustration and resentment.  They point to the fact that post-1974 contributors can do much better than they, even though the latter were contributing for many years before 1974.  I am aware that the Minister is having their position considered by the National Pensions Board and I would ask him to request an early report with a view to rectifying the position of these people. The Minister's record over the past two years shows his genuine care for those who are deprived through no fault of their own.  In this case the fault does not lie with the people involved and I would ask for a speedy response to their problem, with a view to achieving a fair and equitable solution.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wallace pleaded yesterday for greater flexibility in dealing with those in receipt of unemployment benefit where retraining and opportunities for further education are concerned.  He gave the example of a voluntary group in Knocknaheeny in Cork who wished to establish a co-op to this end and who have laid down guidelines as to what should be done to allow people to be more creative and innovative in trying to solve their <Col N="187" /> problems.  I agree totally with the sentiments expressed by Deputy Wallace and would strongly support the suggestion of using that group for a pilot scheme.</P>
    <P>During the past year the Minister introduced a scheme to assist the credit unions and the Society of St. Vincent de Paul to help people caught in the clutches of moneylenders.  This scheme was based on a programme initiated by the Lough Credit Union which operates in my parish in Cork.  I am glad we in Cork are giving a lead in some of these areas and I would strongly back the call for the co-op known as Support to be used as a pilot effort.</P>
    <P>The Minister is anxious to allow as much freedom as possible to people on unemployment benefit to further their education prospects and to deal with the psychological aspects of unemployment. He and the Minister for Education are to be congratulated on introducing the educational opportunities scheme.  The Minister for Social Welfare has also introduced the part-time job incentive scheme and the voluntary work option.  The problem with the educational opportunities scheme is that only VEC courses are recognised.  I had the personal frustration last year of seeing a local group in Mahon in Cork trying to organise an educational opportunities scheme but failing to do so because of lack of flexibility in the operation of the scheme.  The Minister, the manager of the local employment exchange and the nuns who were running the scheme were supportive and the unemployed persons wished to attend, but regulations prohibited it.  I would look for greater flexibility in this area and greater discretion for the Minister and the local exchange manager.  These people should have the right to examine a scheme to see if it is of general benefit to the public at large and, if so, to give sanction.  The most crucial term here is &ldquo;flexibility&rdquo;.  I would ask the Minister to include a provision whereby he would initially have the right to decide individual cases but thereafter could delegate this power to local exchange managers. Some such amendment might be included <Col N="188" /> on Committee Stage.  It would be widely welcomed.</P>
    <P>Cynics may decry this approach and say it represents an acceptance of the long-term unemployment figures.  We must accept that unemployment will be with us for a long time and we must make the greatest number of opportunities available to everybody to improve their situation.  It is of paramount importance that we do not restrict these people.  It is illogical to make life so restrictive that opportunities generated by local initiative and effort cannot be availed of, despite the fact that it would not cost the State anything.</P>
    <P>Section 20 of the Bill takes account of changes in modern technology in that an officer's certificate will be accepted for facts recorded on computers or micro film.  This is a logical approach which allows for changing technology.  This provision also extends to organisations such as An Post, who propose to micro film cashed social welfare pension orders, for example.  This is a step by another semi-State body in the adoption of modern technology.</P>
    <P>I use the opportunity afforded by this debate to expand on the co-operation required between An Post and the Department of Social Welfare.  The Minister is most anxious to ensure that every social welfare recipient should get not only the highest possible rate of payment but also the speediest and most efficient service.  He can see no reason why a person should be stigmatised or unnecessarily inconvenienced because he happens to be unemployed.  A programme is under way to utilise new technology to bring about changes in this regard.  Employment exchanges are being modernised to meet the challenge, but post offices will continue to play a critical part in the payment system.  The availability of suitably located exchanges and post offices is essential, especially in areas of high population.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the chairman and chief executive of An Post to accede to my request and that of local residents to provide a sub-post office in the parish of <Col N="189" /> Mahon in Cork.  This is the fastest growing area in Munster and was identified by Cork Corporation as their first effort in regard to the new town concept.  By definition this should include all the facilities required in a town, including a post office.  A major shopping centre has been provided, in which one or two units are still available for rent.  One of these would be a perfect location for a sub-post office. Bearing in mind the massive number of social welfare transactions which would take place there, I have asked the Minister for Social Welfare to support my case for a post office.</P>
    <P>I would also point out to the chairman and chief executive of An Post that I recognise the great transformation which they have initiated since the change of status of their company.  I support their efforts to run an efficient and profitable service for the State.  I recognise that their survey at Mahon indicated that it would not be commercially viable to establish an office there.  However, I should like to ask An Post to take into account the progress made to date by the Department of Social Welfare, under the guidance of Deputy Woods, in modernising the social welfare payment system.  The Minister has expressed the view that all recipients of payments from the State should have bank and post office facilities available to them, like other members of the community. Bearing that in mind, and the great inconvenience caused to my constituents anxious to transact postal business, I should like to appeal to An Post to provide a post office in Mahon.</P>
    <P>There are so few provisions in the Bill that one can criticise that it might appear to the general public that all the Opposition and Government speakers can do is to praise the Minister.  We are complimenting him on a job well done but we are asking him to take up a number of issues along the way.  However, we must be realistic when suggesting changes. Deputy Harney referred to the stigmatising and the degrading of recipients by asking them to subject themselves to a means test.  I abhor means tests for old age pensioners.  I have boycotted such a test operated by my local authority since <Col N="190" /> 1974 on the basis that those who were subjected to it had helped to build the State and, consequently, deserved more. In that instance we should make an arrangement that would not embarrass those elderly citizens.  I do not think it is feasible to abolish all means tests because they differ from scheme to scheme.  The State could lose hundreds of millions of pounds if it did not operate means tests for certain schemes.  I was surprised to hear Deputy Harney's suggestion particularly when she represents a party whose policy is to improve the public finances.</P>
    <P>I welcome the decision to allocate £1 million to the family income supplement scheme.  The Minister has told us that this money will be used to increase the income ceiling and the number of children in respect of whom FIS will be paid.  I am concerned that so few people are aware of this scheme and I suggest to the Minister that he publicise it, particularly in rural areas.  It is important to bear in mind that for certain recipients the amount of the allowance has been increased by 25 per cent.  The person at work who receives a low income should be catered for and the Minister should consider giving more assistance to those people. The gap between unemployment benefit and what those on a low wage receive has been closing and the Minister should do something about that.</P>
    <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister on improving the free electricity scheme for the elderly, a scheme which was introduced by the Taoiseach when he was Minister for Finance.  Many of us have been campaigning for years for an improvement in that scheme.  I am pleased that the Minister has agreed to allow unused units to be carried from one billing period to the next.  That represents an enlightened approach.  Elderly people find it difficult to read a meter and are afraid to use up their quota of units.  I should like to compliment the Minister on including natural gas in the free fuel scheme in the Cork area.  I found it difficult to criticise any of the provisions in the Bill and I should like to compliment the Minister on his enlightened approach.</P>

      <P>I should like to point out to Deputy Dennehy that I will be welcoming some of the provisions but criticising the Minister for some omissions. The first point that must be made in a debate of this kind is that poverty is a national scandal and must be top of the political agenda.  We should not pretend that poverty does not exist in our society or that there is not inequality.  We are still light years away from the concept we should all aspire to, equality of opportunity. Under our social welfare system we should strive for equality.  Political will, budgetary allocations and co-operation between the Departments of State are needed if we are to do that.  Through our social welfare system we offer a sop to cope with poverty, inequality and the lack of opportunity for those who live in deprived areas.</P>
      <P>I must acknowledge that the Department of Social Welfare have been tackling those problems.  It is only right and proper that one should acknowledge the commitment of the officials of the Department to their work.  They have always shown compassion when dealing with problems and have been anxious to rectify any injustices brought to their notice.  However, there are areas where an injection of the same compassion and understanding is needed.  I was pleased to hear the Minister say that training will take place in those areas.  It is important to recognise that it is not the fault of the unemployed that they do not have a job. They are in that position because of our economic and political difficulties.  Those who are employed should help the unemployed. They should recognise the privilege of being employed and should not try to undermine the dignity and independence of those people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, social welfare has done that to the extent that one of the resources we must build into our social welfare system is the psychological building up of the claimant who finds himself in a situation where he has to claim.  I know very few who want to go through <Col N="192" /> the difficulties and the bureaucracy, the means testing, the interrogations and investigations necessary to get enough, or sometimes less than enough, to keep them.  Who with any energy, enthusiasm and dignity would want to go through that if he had an opportunity to work? We owe it to the people to give them jobs.  The political will is there on all sides of the House to create the jobs that will remove the huge demand there is on social welfare at the moment and, more particularly, remove the endemic poverty which emerges as a result of unemployment.</P>
    <P>The Minister showed that families and benefits for families are a priority by addressing himself to this issue first.  I welcome this, but I hope the Minister will accept it if hot on the heels of that welcome, I say that the benefits should be greater or that the system should even be reformed.  The Minister and the Government have put paid absolutely to the suggestion of not paying child benefit directly to mothers, or indeed fathers where that arises, but in the Irish situation we are talking in the main of a very high level of women in the home as mothers and homemakers.  We have a higher level of women working in the home than is the case in the rest of the EC.  We have a higher level of social and even moral pressure on women to stay within the home and be good wives and mothers.  The only acknowledgment of the important work of bringing up the next generation is the small amount of child benefit that women are paid directly in the home.</P>
    <P>I am delighted the Minister is here because I want to make some very definite points on this area of child benefit. In France and Germany the child benefit, which is much larger than ours &mdash; I take the point that they are wealthier countries &mdash; is paid directly to the family regardless of the salary of the income earner or earners.  All kinds of tax clawbacks are operated at other levels, but that child benefit is paid for the development and rearing of the children.  In France the child benefit increases after the age of five; it again increases at the <Col N="193" /> age of 10; it increases again during the teenage years in line with the higher expenses for clothing, education and so on.  In Germany it actually extends where children are in full-time education, to the age of 27.  So we are not talking here of some elitist or esoteric privilege or bonus that women have been getting on the side.  We are a child and family-centred country and we are proud of it, but if we are to have a sound family policy we have to acknowledge and support it by giving direct payment and acknowledgment.</P>
    <P>There are already alarming signals being sent out because of the penalties imposed on parents, particularly mothers, by the lack of acknowledgment of that work in the home resulting, according to a survey carried out by Dr. Ann McKenna, in a drop in the birth rate in Ireland to 2.8 per family which is one of the most dramatic drops in birth rate. The replacable population rate in demographic terms is 2.5 children per family and every member state except Ireland which has the highest birth rate still, is now operating on an average of 1.8 children per family which is below the replacement generation level.  France and Germany are now trying desperately to cope with this by adding huge bonuses and allowances for any family with more than three children, and are regretting that they did not acknowledge, recognise and support firmly enough procreation and child rearing.  Ireland has an opportunity to learn from that.  Time is running out for Ireland as Dr. Ann McKenna says in her report.  The declining birth rate will create difficulties for all of us with regard to taxes, pension for the older generation etc.  As one of the people about to ride off into the sunset, a Cheann Comhairle, I would be worried that we were not regenerating enough young people to be able to afford your pension and mine.  There is a fundamental economic, not just social, issue here and that is why that direct payment to the family has to be, even in an objective economic sense, seen to be of absolute fundamental importance.  I welcome the fact that the Minister has attempted to improve it to the extent that he has raised from 18 years <Col N="194" /> to 19 years the limit for child dependency and has allowed the fifth child allowance to be extended to further children in families.</P>
    <P>One disappointment is that there has been a freeze on the child benefit itself and, as any parent knows, the costs are not frozen.  We have to seriously think of multiplying the allowance much more and making it a really decent allowance. I am not being negative here because there are ways in which we can pay a realistic sum of money to the child rearing parent.  We could claw back on the tax of income earners at high income levels or introduce legislation to ensure that a nonearning spouse who is completely economically dependent on the one breadwinner will have a legal, automatic, proportionate entitlement.  We have already done this with regard to social welfare in certain circumstances and I will refer to that later.  In the same way, with regard to independent income earners, I would not be loath to introduce that measure so that women in particular will not be economically as dependent as they have been up to now, a dependency which is far beyond that of women in other member states.  The problem is that women will be forced to make very difficult decisions which will have huge implications, as happened in France and Germany.  They will have to decide whether it is worth their while to have a family and give up their economic independence. That is a problem that exists already.</P>
    <P>In an interview given by the Minister recently he said that in this year's budget at least the child benefit was not interfered with.  I would like to think that until we bring in the alternatives I am suggesting there will never be such an interference but rather that the allowance will be greatly increased.  There should be acknowledgement of the family and particularly the role of the mother in the home.</P>
    <P>Like everybody else, I welcome very much the Minister's intitiative in bringing in equality in social welfare.  The changes with regard to widowers and deserted husbands are long overdue.  Everybody <Col N="195" /> felt that there was injustice in that regard. This is tied in with the changing attitudes and the changing roles of men and women in the family and also with the changing structures of work.  Matters such as work structures, social welfare, pensions and so on should be flexible so that men will be able to take on child rearing roles. Rather than penalising them as we have done up to now we should encourage them and in that regard the new measure for widowers and deserted husbands is to be much welcomed.</P>
    <P>I would remind the Minister that there is a small but growing group of fathers who have taken on the task, as unmarried fathers, of bringing up their children and they also deserve and need support.  The Minister has rightly pointed out that in bringing in that change, he and his officials will have to deal with six separate social assistance schemes.  This is one of the difficulties that arises.  The savings that will accrue in that area will be of tremendous help not just to the Minister and his Department but also to the economy as a whole.  I welcome very much the Department examining the possibility of replacing all those schemes, with all their anomalies and difficulties, with one scheme.  I would like to think that the next time the Minister makes social welfare changes in this House he will also make that change.  It is part of the reform that is needed in this area.</P>
    <P>With regard to the changes introduced to claw back maintenance allowance owed by husbands to the State, I would like some more elucidation on this matter.  It would be a tremendous step forward if the State &mdash; by that I mean the Department of Social Welfare &mdash; would take direct responsibility for reducing the length of time in which a woman has to prove she is deserted.  The three month period can be extraordinarily long and can be a very traumatic time for a woman, particularly as she has already gone through the emotional shock of being deserted.  It has always been reprehensible to demand that she should have to make contact with her husband in order to prove whether she could get <Col N="196" /> maintenance from him.  There have been cases where women have been afraid to do so and have been penalised under the system for that reason.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">

      <P>I take Deputy McGahon's point that where the deserted spouse is the husband, the same should apply.  There should be full equality and I would make the same passionate case for them.  However, it is usually the wife who is the deserted spouse.  Would it be possible for the maintenance to be claimed directly by the Department of Social Welfare from the husband so that payment to the wife would not be interfered with and she would not be penalised in any way as a result?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>That is to be very much welcomed.  I welcome, too, the introduction of flexibility with regard to education. This is also tied in with another section of the Bill, as the Minister stated in his Second Stage speech, and that is the section with regard to retirement allowances.  I welcome the flexible arrangements for unemployed people in the over 60 age group, many of whom regard themselves as semi-retired and not really members of the labour force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to make a point which caused indignation the last time it was mentioned here.  I attended a recent seminar addressed by Professor Thorborne from Sweden who has carried out a tremendous amount of study on changing work structures and so on.  He made the point during the seminar that two factors had struck him with regard to employment &mdash; unemployment in Ireland.  One of the factors was that there was a very low participation rate of women in the workforce as compared with the rest of Europe and the other was that there was <Col N="197" /> a very high participation rate of elderly men.  The women in the audience responded very positively to the acknowledgement and recognition of both these factors but the men totally ignored the first factor in regard to the low participation rate of women and felt that their integrity and dignity were being attacked.  The women felt that Professor Thorborne was right to draw attention to the unique position in Ireland with regard to the structure of work.  Even in the European context, one of the areas we will have to consider is earlier retirement for everybody.  The reaction we got to that matter was not just from politicians but from economists, civil servants, public servants and so on.  There is a tremendous attitudinal change to be gone through in that respect.</P>
    <P>Deputy Harney recommended that perhaps an all-party committee should sit and discuss this matter.  I want to refer briefly to some of the recommendations of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights when they published a report in 1984 on social welfare matters, particularly as they affected women. These are matters that must be examined urgently, we hope, incorporated in the next reform package.</P>
    <P>Certainly the Minister has attempted to deal with the matter of part-time work and employers who do not pay their PRSI contributions.  It is a scandal how women are being expoited at present with regard to part-time work, being restricted to working hours which ensure they are precluded from making PRSI contributions and the protection it would afford them, to say nothing of sickness, holiday pay and so on.  I will not dwell on that issue now because I know we shall be debating it on legislation in the labour area.</P>
    <P>Reverting to the evaluation of women's work and contribution in the home, particularly as child minders, is it possible that the non-contributory pension be paid directly to a wife when she reaches the eligible age?  As of now it constitutes a double payment to the husband. As a result many women experience real stress and deprivation through <Col N="198" /> their husbands not allowing them sufficient, leaving them with a sense of dependency even at pension age.  Many women have made the case rather bitterly to me that after a lifetime of care and dedication to spouse and children they are left desolate, that surely the least they might expect would be a pension.</P>
    <P>My heartfelt cry to the Minister would be to have all of the anomalies obtaining removed in one fell stroke through the concept of the basic income which, if granted to everybody, based on age, regardless of marital status or employment &mdash; except where, in the case of employment, it would be credited &mdash; we would be giving direct payments to people now engaged in what is termed informal work, not seen to be gainfully employed, recognising their value to society and the inherent economic independence that should accompany such recognition.</P>
    <P>I would also appeal to the Minister to use the moneys saved on the elimination of abuse in his Department on the establishment of a proper dental and optical service for women, particularly insured workers' wives who remain in the home. Women have lobbied for years because of the desperate state in which they find themselves in that regard.  It is a matter of tremendous disappointment that that service has not been implemented, and in fact we have raised women's expectations only to have them dashed.</P>
    <P>Other Members have referred to the prescribed relative's allowance.  It is scandalous that that allowance is paid to the dependent relative rather than the carer.  I am sure this arrangement costs the State much more.</P>
    <P>I would also appeal to the Minister to extend paid maternity leave, in respect of which there will be tremendous pressure and I hope a directive from Europe as we approach 1992.  The present period of maternity leave of 14 to 18 weeks does not really give the mother and child the start they need.  Also paternity leave must be introduced so that fathers are given a chance to share equally in child rearing and family relationships.</P>
    <P>I welcome the reforms already <Col N="199" /> implemented.  I know the difficulties the Minister faces but I should like to think that, even on Committee Stage, he would be able to address some of the points I have raised.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity of contributing to this debate, as I do annually because it has been my experience since becoming a Member of this House that, generally speaking, it tends to be a debate free of acrimony, when Members have made valuable contributions and adopted a very positive attitude to the provisions of the Bill. Deputy Barnes's contribution is just such an example.  Most Members who have already spoken have approached the matter in a very positive manner.  In itself that is to be commended.  It also gives the lie to the public criticism levelled at politicians, that they do not care, are not interested in the poor or the less well-off. Indeed it would pay such critics to listen to some of the contributions made on Social Welfare Bills in this House.</P>
      <P>This Bill underlines the Minister's total commitment and dedication to improving our system of social welfare so that those in greatest need will benefit most.  The provisions of this Bill are wide-ranging, addressing a huge number of issues.  As has been the case for the past two years the Minister has availed of the opportunity, in introducing this Bill, to initiate new schemes or modify or improve existing ones.  If we take the provisions of this Bill along with those of the most recent budget we find that 23 new or improved schemes have been introduced by the Minister, much to his credit and that of his Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also agree with Deputy Barnes's sentiments with regard to the staff in the Department of Social Welfare.  As in all Government Departments there will be good and bad but, over the past four or five years, the commitment and dedication of the staff of that Department have been recognised by the public and certainly by us public representatives. We are very ready to criticise when things go wrong, when people do not do their <Col N="200" /> jobs properly.  Equally we should be positive and give praise where such is due.</P>
    <P>Having said that, the Minister is introducing a number of new schemes by way of the provisions of this Bill; one I particularly welcome is that pertaining to widowers and deserted husbands, the new payment to be made to those wishing to care for their children.  This is an issue I have mentioned in all my contributions on Social Welfare Bills since becoming a Member of this House.  It gives me great pleasure to welcome the introduction of this scheme and commend the Minister on having taken the relevant initiative. Deputy Barnes mentioned equality a number of times.  In these days of equality consciousness it is good to note that the concept is applied positively in both directions.  It is my firm conviction that the introduction of this scheme will particularly help the children of spouses who, for one reason or another, have split up, so that children who may be deprived of one parent will have the remaining parent to care for them. Another innovation which I welcome was announced in the budget and referred to by the Minister in his speech at the time and that is the change in the free electricity allowance scheme.  None of us could understand how it could be so difficult to allow old age pensioners to carry their free electricity units from one bill to another.  I never got a satisfactory explanation for that although it was something that was questioned for years. The Minister in keeping with his fresh approach to these things has started the discussions which I hope will lead to the introduction of a change very shortly.</P>

      <P>One positive thing that has been highlighted by this debate is the lack of legislation from the Government side over a wide range of areas.  Not enough emphasis has been put on this fact. Because of the creation of the single European market, the need for legislation over a huge range of Departments cannot be underestimated.  It is not sufficient for us to be forced to implement this type of legislation when 1992 arrives. The need for legislation is great and it should be introduced now and over the next three years.  That is the clear message coming from the debate on this Bill. If something is not done we know what the consequences will be.  It is not enough for the Government to tell everybody else in this country to be aware of 1992 if they are not fulfilling their legislative role.  The Government should lead with legislation and not come from behind to introduce legislation when things are already occurring due to the lack of legislation.</P>
      <P>I am still confused with the Minister for Finance's response last night to the whole question of competition and the introduction of Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty of Rome in this Bill.  I simply cannot understand what other method the Government might be considering. The international sector of our economy is already operating under the rules of Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty of Rome. I cannot see any benefit, particularly for a small open economy like ours in introducing some other form of anti-competitive legislation.  The type of legislation operating in Europe at the moment is more than adequate for our immediate requirements.  The main thrust of such legislation is correct&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The view of the Government is that the optimum arrangements for economic development and planning for the completion of the single European market would be as follows: first, to put our economy on a sound footing by restoring order to the public finances and by maintaining business confidence, second, to pursue a series of strategies in targeted economic sectors, based on improved competitiveness and on exploiting our natural advantages as outlined in the <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> third, to use enhanced European Community Structural Funds to upgrade our infrastructure and, fourth, to help improve the competitiveness of the productive sectors to meet the challenges which will face us between now and 1992 and thereafter. We have put in train a fairly sound strategy to deal with the completion of the single market.  The Minister for Finance spoke yesterday on the wider national measures involved.  I will concentrate my remarks on the areas that touch on my own Department, indeed where appropriate, on the specific measures suggested in the Bill before us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not very impressed with the somewhat fragmented set of measures set out in this Bill.  I reject the contention in the explanatory memorandum that they constitute an integrated set of measures to prepare the economy for the single European market.  The fundamental changes in economic performance that have taken place over the past two years will help Irish business to take advantage of the increased opportunities and to cope with the greater competition that the completion of the internal market will bring.  I will give some examples of the results of that improved performance.  In 1988 output growth in manufacturing was more than 10 per cent.  This was the second year in a row in which industrial output exceeded 10 per cent.  Contrast that with growth in low single figures during 1985 and 1986.  Of even greater importance, the implications are that output growth is becoming somewhat more broadly based with many of the more traditional sectors dominated by <Col N="203" /> indigenous firms now showing a significant rise in output.  It is in the indigenous sector that we need to concentrate our efforts.  The picture is more dramatic in exports.  In the Government's first year in office exports increased by £1.5 billion. In our second year in office there was a further increase of £1.6 billion, making an accumulative increase over two years of £3 billion.  That is an increase of some 30 per cent in our exports in that period. Here again, indigenous companies have participated strongly with their exports growing at about twice the rate in 1988 compared with the previous year.  We were very fortunate in that the growth from exports has not just come from international firms based here but has come to an increasing extent from indigenous firms.  The trade surplus in 1988 was of the order of £2 billion.  This compares with a surplus of £1.6 billion in 1987 and it is has nearly trebled the 1986 surplus.</P>
    <P>So far as employment in industry and in internationally traded services is concerned, 19,500 new jobs were created during 1988.  These figures are based on a detailed employment survey conducted by the State industrial promotion agencies.  If the net increase in temporary employment is included the total number of new jobs created in 1988 well exceeded the average annual target of 20,000 set under the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> The end of the year surveys by the State agencies also point to a modest increase in the total net number employed in manufacturing and international services at the end of 1988.  This confirms the results of recent labour force and CSO quarterly industrial employment surveys which showed a stabilisation in manufacturing employment and an increase in the services area.  Projections from independent forecasters such as the ESRI, the Central Bank and the OECD suggested that there will be a further rise in manufacturing employment during 1989 which reverses the continuous downward trend which has been going on now since 1980.  This increase is taking place notwithstanding the growing <Col N="204" /> practice with manufacturing companies of contracting out services such as catering, security, maintenance and the general downward European Community trend in manufacturing employment.</P>
    <P>Industry spends about £9 billion a year, £4.5 billion of which goes on Irish raw materials, £2.5 billion on wages and salaries and about £2 billion on overheads. Over 200,000 people are directly employed in industry and probably as many again are employed in service activities directly related to industry.  As the House will be aware, we have a very active programme in operation in the whole area of import substitution.  The Irish Goods Council, who do a very good job, have informed me that there is approximately £1 billion of products being currently imported that could be manufactured almost immediately in this economy by existing industry and, perhaps, by fresh industry.  We are working very hard to ensure that those particular companies come on stream.</P>
    <P>There has been a significant improvement in Ireland's cost competitiveness <i>vis-á-vis</i> our main trading partners during 1988.  Labour cost competitiveness has improved as a result of the moderate wage increases negotiated under the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>.  In the UK annual pay increases are currently of the order of some 9 per cent.  Ireland's rate of inflation for 1988 is about 2 per cent, three times lower than the UK rate and lower than average OECD and EC rates.  Interest rates for prime borrowers are currently 8 per cent in Ireland compared with 14 per cent in the UK.  Further progress towards improving competitiveness was achieved through the enactment of the Courts Act, 1988, which should have a moderating influence on liability insurance for companies.  The year 1988 has also seen a reduction in the cost of international telephone calls and electricity prices for business users fell by an effective 5 per cent.</P>
    <P>I mention the above statistics to point to the marked improvement in our overall economic fortunes and international competitiveness.  I know from my own extensive contacts with business people <Col N="205" /> in my present post that they have become more confident and more optimistic about investing in the country.  Of equal importance they are looking increasingly towards mainland Europe for export and for joint venture possibilities.  Once we looked consistently towards Britain and our economic fortunes, as the House will appreciate, were inextricably linked to the UK.  While we still have strong economic ties with the UK &mdash; and it is still a major market for us &mdash; our recently sustained differentials in interest rates and inflation point to a growing economic independence within the context of the European Community as a whole.</P>
    <P>This augurs well for the good performance within the single European market.  I am not saying the UK market is any less important to us.  Indeed, as 1992 bites we will increasingly find that the UK market, which is our major market, will come under increased competition from international firms from America, Japan and so on.  In that context we need to be on our toes to hold our share of the UK market.</P>
    <P>Industrial policy is an important element of our overall economic policy and has been under continuous review since the late seventies.  A further review is required this year in accordance with the 1986 Industrial Development Act.  It seems to me that there is little disagreement at present among the major parties in the House on the direction industrial policy should take.  Differences where they do exist are confined to matters of emphasis or priority.  The view is well exemplified by the amendments prepared to the Industrial Development Act, 1986, in the Bill at present before the House.</P>
    <P>I should remind the House that the broad goals of industrial policy are: first, greater concentration on the development of internationally competitive indigenous industry &mdash; we have made some progress in this area in the last few years, second, promoting an overall environment conductive to business development &mdash; the House is well aware of our progress in that area regarding interest rates and inflation, correcting <Col N="206" /> finances and so on, that are bringing about the environment which is a central part of this policy; third, better value for money from State industrial incentives &mdash; the House will be aware of the moves that have taken place to rationalise agencies and so on; fourth, better targeting of incentives to address areas of perceived greatest business weakness, for example, marketing and management development &mdash; I will say more about that before I conclude; fifth, employing science and technology more effectively to develop new industrial products and processes; sixth, policy instruments to be more directly employment related &mdash; all of us in the House would wish to be able to draw a tighter line between policy instruments and the employment which results directly from those decisions; seventh, greater concentration on developing sectoral strategies and approaches to maximise industrial potential &mdash; the House will be aware of a number of sectoral strategies already announced; and eighth, clearer formulation and direction of policy by central Government.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that we are making substantial progress in achieving these policy goals.  There are now clear statements of policy, our industrial legislation has been updated, our incentives and development programmes have been refined, the business environment has improved and agency rationalisation is in train.  Sectoral strategies, for example, in food and electronics, have already been published and more are on the way. Greater resources are being devoted to science and technology initiatives in areas such as biotechnology, industrial materials and so on.</P>
    <P>I do not see the amendments suggested in the Bill before the House as particularly valuable in strengthening industrial policy and, indeed, I would say that many of them are unnecessary.  The first proposed amendment calls for the inclusion of material in the Triennial Review of Industrial Performance which would detail the shift in State support from fixed assets to marketing and research and development.  This material was provided <Col N="207" /> in the 1986 review of industrial performance and it will be included in the 1989 review.  I do not think we need to amend the legislation as the information will be provided in any event.</P>
    <P>As regards the industry budget, the direct State expenditure associated with industrial development has fallen significantly since the mid-eighties.  For example, the IDA's capital grants budget has been cut by one quarter and the building budget by three quarters.  Moreover, the proportion of the reduced industry budget earmarked for marketing and product development has increased by one third and over half, respectively, mainly at the expense of reduced assistance for fixed assets.  This shift is taking place.  Tax concessions in the area of leasing and capital allowances have been curtailed and export sales relief will be replaced for all manufacturing companies by the 10 per cent rate next year.</P>
    <P>Cuts in the budgets of the State industrial promotion agencies have already forced major changes in grants policy, differentiating between greenfield and expansion projects.  For expansions the new policy involves a grant rate of 25 per cent, the abolition of training grants and a greater degree of repayability.  Average fixed asset grant rates approved for industry have fallen by nine percentage points since 1985.</P>
    <P>A further amendment proposed requires the Minister to report to both Houses of the Oireachtas on the establishment of independent regional development authorities to &ldquo;prepare, implement and monitor development plans for each region in the context of the Structural Funds&rdquo;.  The arrangements for the preparation of plans for Ireland's receipts under the funds are already well in train and have been announced publicly by the Minister for Finance.  The regional dimension to the planning process is catered for by the establishment of the seven subnational working groups and advisory committees whose work is already well advanced.  Accordingly, I do not see much merit in the proposals in the Bill in this regard.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="208" /> Another amendment relates to industrial costs and requires the Minister to report to the Oireachtas every three months.  As I have already outlined, substantial progress has been made in making industrial costs more competitive in European terms.  Other than in the area of transport &mdash; which will be addressed under the Structural Funds Programme &mdash; I believe that industry is generally satisfied with the progress we have made in this area.  The whole question of costs is continuously monitored, as the House will be aware, by the industrial costs monitoring group which operate under the aegis of the Department of Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>In relation to the setting of statutory targets, as suggested in a further amendment, for industrial development performance by the year 2000, I am not convinced that this would be particularly useful.  The overall target for industrial employment has been set under the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> at 20,000 extra jobs per year on average over the ten year period 1988-98.  The target in the programme has the backing of the employers, the trade unions and the Government.  It is an ambitious target, nevertheless it is a realistic one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister have a script?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but immediately I finish speaking I will arrange to let the Deputy have one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of other amendments are proposed, the combined effect of which is to encourage an increase in funding of industry through equity rather than through grants.  As a general principle, it is the policy of the State industrial promotion agencies to seek to increase the proportion of equity funding in all projects.  As a general practice, all grants are matched with equity or equity equivalent. Project executives ensure that the best use is made of the business expansion scheme and other sources of third party finance towards this end.  Moreover, the general cutback in grant rates has forced <Col N="209" /> companies to finance an even greater proportion of their needs from equity.  Management developments grants are now being used to assist small companies to bring in management personnel from particular disciplines with specialised expertise, e.g. marketing and finance, appropriate to the needs of small companies. For these reasons I believe that the amendments proposed in this general area are not necessary.</P>
    <P>Section 13 of the Bill seeks to amend the National Development Corporation Act, 1986, by giving the corporation a power to form or assist in the formation of regional investment funds for the purpose of making equity investments in projects or businesses.  Under this provision it seems to be envisaged that it will be the funds rather than NADCORP which will take the individual investment decisions.  If NADCORP's activities were to be extended to enable them to form or assist in forming regional investment funds &mdash; and this would probably imply a substantial NADCORP investment in such funds &mdash; such an important change in their activities would need to be catered for by an addition to section 10 (1) of the NADCORP legislation which sets out their objects rather than section 10 (3) which is concerned with ancillary operational powers.  It is, however, very clear that such an object, which would involve investing money in a fund rather than directly in an enterprise, would be substantially at variance with the existing 12 objects of NADCORP as set out in section 10 (1) and would run counter to the whole tenor of the National Development Corporation Act.</P>
    <P>Currently NADCORP hold over 50 investments in commercial enterprises with a number of other investments which have been approved awaiting completion. As is clear from their annual reports there has been a wide regional spread in NADCORP's activities.  The criteria applied are those of commerciality and employment generation. It is clear that the amendment proposed <Col N="210" /> would serve to reduce the criteria currently applied by NADCORP and would weaken NADCORP commercially&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash; and for that reason I would not favour that direction.</P>
      <P>Section 14 of the Bill proposes to include Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty of Rome in Irish domestic legislation. This is not an entirely new idea &mdash; the suggestion that our legislation be changed from the present &ldquo;control of abuse&rdquo; system to a &ldquo;prohibition&rdquo; system was considered by the then Restrictive Practices Commission, now the Fair Trade Commission, in their 1977 study of Irish competition policy.  The matter was also raised by Deputy Bruton during the debate on the Restrictive Practices (Amendment) Bill in this House in 1987. Arising from this debate the then Minister asked the Restrictive Practices Commission to undertake a detailed study of the respective merits and disadvantages of the &ldquo;prohibition&rdquo; and &ldquo;control of abuse&rdquo; systems.  A considerable amount of work has been done by the Fair Trade Commission on this study.  However, legal advice is awaited from the Attorney General's Office in relation to certain aspects of the study.</P>
      <P>The House is aware that last month there was a lengthy discussion here on the Enterprise (Competition and Consumer Protection) Bill which was sponsored by the Progressive Democrats.  That Bill also proposed, among other things, that Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty of Rome be included in domestic legislation.  I do not wish to repeat what was said on that occasion.  However, I will say that merely including Articles 85 and 86 in domestic legislation was not found to be the cure for some of these ills.  In addition a prohibition system modelled on the provisions of Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty of Rome is likely to be costly and bureaucratic if one takes into consideration the systems and procedures currently operated by the Commission of the European Communities in exercising its functions under these Articles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="211" /> The administrative practice of the Commission provides for a procedure enabling parties to an agreement to seek a declaration from the Commission that their activities do not come within the scope of the competition rules.  Notification of agreements, decisions and concerted practices is made to the Commission for the purpose of seeking a decision either than the conduct is not caught by Article 85 (1) at all, which is called the negative clearance procedure, or that while it is caught it may nevertheless benefit from exemption under Article 85 (3).  No examption or negative clearance may be granted unless an agreement has been notified to the Commission. Depending on the complexity of the complaints of any given case it may take the Commission one year, two years or more to reach a final decision.</P>
    <P>For the sake of expediency, many cases before the Commission are concluded by way of informal settlement, notably where the undertakings involved voluntarily eliminate any objectionable practices.  In fact the Commission normally takes a dozen or so formal decisions each year whereas the number of informal settlements is usually several hundred. It is clear from this that the administration of Articles 85 and 86 is not without its problems.</P>
    <P>It is accepted that current competition legislation may not be perfect.  However, merely to import Articles 85 and 86 without a full and complete assessment of all that this would entail would not necessarily be the correct solution.  If new legislation is to be put into place we must try to learn from the problems encountered by the EC in implementing Articles 85 and 86.  The Fair Trade Commission have been asked to examine the merits and disadvantages of both systems.  When this study has been completed the necessary information will be available to enable an informed decision to be made on the advisability of changing our legal system. I would expect that the report of the Fair Trade Commission would be available later in the year and we should perhaps <Col N="212" /> wait until then before deciding where to go.</P>
    <P>Having dealt with the amendments proposed in the Bill, I should like to make a few other comments.  As Deputies will be aware, exports of industrial products from Ireland fall under two broad headings &mdash; those from multinational companies operating here and those from indigenous Irish industry.  My primary focus in the Office for Trade and Marketing is on the latter grouping.</P>
    <P>Córas Tráchtála are at present working to a target of raising the contribution of exports from indigenous companies from £2.2 billion in 1987 to £3 billion in the three year timescale of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>.  CTT estimate that in 1988 exports from indigenous exporters increased by around 15 per cent to over £2.5 billion.  I recently held a meeting with the board of CTT and I agreed with them that they should adopt a target for indigenous export growth this year of a fresh figure, over and above last year's exports, of £400 million, keeping us well on target for the £3 billion figure in 1990.  I should like to take this opportunity of thanking CTT for taking that target on board.  It is a very ambitious target of an additional £400 million and I am confident they can deliver on it. In the longer term we are aiming at an increase in indigenous exports to £4.5 billion by the mid-nineties and a doubling of Ireland's share of the Community market.  At present we hold 1.2 per cent of the total EC market.  My target is to double that by the mid-nineties to a figure of 2.4 per cent of the entire EC market. That kind of achievement would substantially transform the Irish economy, particularly in terms of jobs which come from indigenous industry.  I know that the House would support that target and encourage industry to go out there and make it happen.</P>
    <P>The main point I should like to make is that while setting targets is necessary it must be accompanied by practical policy measures.  We have put a number of these in place in recent months.  On being appointed Minister I recognised that many of our smaller and medium sized <Col N="213" /> enterprises simply did not have the expertise to win markets on their own and for that reason I introduced the special trading house scheme.  That scheme has been a resounding success.  Eight trading houses have been licensed to date and they have targeted export sales of well over £100 million during their first three years of operation.  I expect to issue further licences in the very near future.  I should tell the House that a number of these are very exciting applications which will considerably add to our exports.</P>
    <P>The special trading house scheme is designed to put in place a new corporate animal.  Provided that corporate body purchase from small Irish manufacturers and sell the products abroad, they can then avail of two particular tax incentives. The first is the 10 per cent rebate which is currently available only to manufacturing and ancillary activities.  The second is the business expansion scheme fund.  I am confident that the special trading house scheme which is at present a success will come to be a major player in developing Irish exports.</P>
    <P>I am also in the process of finalising a national marketing plan.  I am doing this with the assistance of the National Marketing Group which were announced by the Taoiseach and myself some time last year.  Among the measures on which I expect the plan to make recommendations shortly are the roles of marketing and language training in education.  I note that these areas feature also in the Bill before the House this evening.  These measures will, by their nature, bear fruit in the longer term because nobody has any doubt at this stage that if we are serious about winning a market share in the European Communities we must improve our language capability.  I hope in this national marketing plan to make some specific proposals as to how we can make a quantum leap in that direction.</P>
    <P>My colleague, the Minister for Education, has already made substantial progress improving the syllabus and switching away from the more academic side of language training to concentrate on the more practical elements.  The <Col N="214" /> House, I know, will encourage her in that regard.</P>
    <P>I spoke earlier about the import substitution drive and should like to remind the House that the levels of imports into this economy are still running above what is acceptable.  Something like 70 per cent of everything sold here is imported.  That is a figure no other European country would tolerate.  The European average is less than half that.  We do not have a majority share of our market-place and most European countries do.  To an extent we are out of step.</P>

      <P>I am pointing out to Irish industry that there are business opportunities on our doorstep.  I would not like the Deputy and myself to send out the opposite message, that imports are all right, that we need not take them on.  We must never stop that battle of taking on imports and trying to replace them by Irish manufactured goods.  The day we do that, even in the name of the Community, is the day when small Irish industry will stop picking up opportunities and running with them.  In that context, it is an important point that I stitch into the debate.</P>
      <P>To meet competition in the single European market, we must do everything in our power to maximise these exports. Our buoyant export performance and our record trade balance are proof that Irish industry can meet and match the best in the world.</P>
      <P>In my working day I spend much time talking to Irish industrialists and meeting with them.  There is an air of confidence in Irish industry just now and I can assure the Deputy that from the services that are available and the products I have seen being manufactured and put out by Irish companies just now, there is no need for us to apologise to any country in regard to these products.  There is plenty of business out there for the products which are as good as any I have seen anywhere in the world.  There is absolutely no reason we cannot win even more of the market share.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a good time for manufacturers to try to crack the international market <Col N="216" /> places.  I have spent much of the last two years encouraging them to do that and to win an additional share of our own domestic market, as well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill which, once again, underlines the exceptional initiative, foresight and ability of my colleague, the author of the document, Deputy John Bruton.  Last evening in the House the Minister for Finance, Deputy Reynolds said that he rejected this Bill.  However, he did not reject the individual proposals contained in it.  In fact, he put forward no arguments against most of the individual proposals.  He said the Government would tackle these issues in due course. I contend that the whole point of the Bill is to avoid delays inherent in dealing with the Bill in due course.  The Minister of State, Deputy Brennan, is tonight adopting the same attitude in that he has not addressed the issues in the Bill.  Effectively, he stated that he agreed with the principal contents of the Bill, but rather than accept it, the Government want to do it their own way and in their own time.</P>
      <P>Last night, the Minister Deputy Reynolds' only substantial objection to the Bill was on the grounds of style, not content.  He thought the Bill lacked coherence and was a hotch-potch of measures.  This criticism is totally invalid. Even if his criticism were valid could I remind him that the real world is not arranged in neat lines and that the real economy is not coherent in the bureaucratic sense?  The single European market will affect every aspect of our economy. Any legislation that inhibits efficiency must be changed if we are to maximise our benefits from that market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we wait to take action on any issue until, as the Minister would seem to suggest, all the measures have been organised in neat, coherent lines, we will never do anything.  I predict that the Government eventually will have to implement all the proposals in the Bill and, unfortunately, they will take their time.  If they implement them now they will be working to the benefit of the economy within two to three months.  If, on the other <Col N="217" /> hand, the Government continue to reject this Bill, they will eventually implement the same measures but in a haphazard way and over a much longer period, probably for up to five years.  This will result in valuable time being lost.</P>
    <P>Let me indicate what will happen if this Bill is rejected.  The reform of higher education will be delayed; the establishment of a roads development authority will be delayed; the reform of our competition law will be delayed; the development of language teaching and second chance education will be delayed; the effect of promotion of long-term leasing of land will be delayed; the giving of effective tax incentives to people to invest their savings in productive business will be delayed; the introduction of a new dynamic to State companies by selective sale of shares will be delayed; and the introduction of effective tax concessions for private investment in research and development will be delayed.  If all these urgent issues are dealt with in this Bill, they will be carried through quickly.  If the Bill is not passed, these matters will be left to various Government Departments in pending files and pending trays.</P>
    <P>All the measures proposed by Fine Gael in this Bill rise from a coherent economic philosophy.  That philosophy says that Ireland needs to put more emphasis on the development of human resources and brain-based activity.  The proposals in the Bill on higher education, research and development, agricultural leasing, industrial policy, regional authorities, continental languages, second chance education and banking spring from the desire to shift resources towards brain-based activity and the development of human resources.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael economic philosophy is also one which emphasises freedom and competition as the best way to maximise economic growth.  The propoals in the Bill on cutting business costs, on the possible sale of shares in State companies, on strengthening competition law and on shifting aid for industry away from grants and towards private equity are all ways of promoting greater competition and freedom within our economy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="218" /> It is now clear that a dramatic new environment awaits consumers and producers after 1992.  The removal of a whole range of non-tariff barriers such as frontier red tape, closed public procurement and a plethora of differing national product standards will lead to an immediate downward impact on costs but this is only a primary effect &mdash; there is much more. Above all there will be a new and pervasive competitive climate in which all the players, manufacturing and service companies &mdash; and indeed consumers &mdash; can exploit new opportunities to maximise the use of available resources.</P>
    <P>The principal impacts will be reduction in costs and increased competitiveness, improved efficiency in companies, increased competition, innovation from increased research and development which a larger market can justify and increased economic activity resulting in anything from two to five million new jobs in the Community.  While some of the gains from the internal market will occur almost automatically, the vast majority require changes in the behaviour of the economy's main players to achieve maximum impact.  These challenges will only be taken up by companies if they have assurances that competitive behaviour is adequately policed.</P>
    <P>A strong competition policy will be an essential part of the European home market of the nineties if the market is to function properly.  Benefits for business will include economies of scale and the potential gains vary significantly in relation to industry.  The manufacturing industry should have cost savings from economies of scale.  The bulk of these savings will come from the restructuring which will follow the opening up of a market of 320 million consumers.  Benefits for consumers will include price levels and profit margins for a given product. Competitive pressures tend to trigger downward pressure on prices and convergence of prices lowers profit margins so that they are artificially sustained above competitive levels.</P>
    <P>The internal market, by liberating cross-frontier trade flows, will create the <Col N="219" /> necessary competition.  Prices to consumers are estimated to drop by 6 per cent, even more in highly taxed countries like ours, and there will be a greater choice available to consumers.</P>
    <P>For companies costs and prices are just two of the components of their competitive strategy for the nineties.  Today, more than ever, the capacity of businesses to develop new forms of organisation, to penetrate new geographical markets, to invent new products and processes and to establish brand image are what create a competitive edge.  Among these, innovation is crucial because it is the key to the revitalisation of traditional sectors which are able to transform certain traditional areas such as textiles and steel into high performance industries. It is the essential ingredient for lasting success in the rapidly expanding high technology sectors.  Of course these benefits will not appear at the wave of a wand.  To bring them about many changes are needed, not least the gearing up of business strategies to meet the greater challenges of the new markets.</P>
    <P>If the single market is to succeed so must business.  Most important, business must keep the pressure on Government to live up to their 1992 commitments. Companies will not launch themselves into major strategic choices without evidence of political commitment.  Delays, muddled decision-making, obscure compromises and derogations&mdash;in short, failure to seize the political opportunity available today&mdash;will result in the missed market opportunity of tomorrow.  Europe's greatest market opportunity is within our grasp but unless the Government assist business to prepare for the new environment, we will simply have prepared the ground, by removing the barriers to trade for outside multinationals, to take advantage of our weaknesses.  We as a nation will not be in a position to take advantage of the massive new market being opened up.</P>
    <P>Nineteen-ninety-two is not the beginning of the opening of this market, it is the date for completion of the market. To take advantage of this economic <Col N="220" /> environment we must plan and prepare now.</P>
    <P>To benefit we must be prepared.  This Bill is progressive and decisive.  It is necessary because the idea that all economies within the Community compete with each other on a level playing pitch is far removed from reality.</P>
    <P>In support of section I of the Bill, it is obvious from survey results that, in looking for new opportunities, there is still evidently a strong tendency for Irishowned companies to confine their interest to the United Kingdom.  A number who look beyond the United Kingdom seem to look at the United States market next, before thinking of mainland Europe.  Of course, the great mental block we have about mainland Europe is mainly due to the language differences.  Part of this is the arrogance of the English language: we assume we can go anywhere in the world and find someone who speaks English.</P>
    <P>That is fine so far as it goes, but it puts definite limits on our ability to work and do business in the rest of Europe.  The notion that all Germans speak English, for example, is simply untrue.  This complacency of English-speaking people about languages is in direct contrast with the Dutch.  Dutch people know that they can hardly travel more than 50 miles without having to speak another language. Dutch people are generally fluent in other languages because they have to be &mdash; they have turned necessity to their advantage.</P>
    <P>Some of the consequences of our linguistic inability are quite tragic in human terms.  This decade has witnessed the return of large-scale emigration of young people.  Of course, it is a positive thing for people to move around the world but, if it proves to be more than temporary for the people concerned, we cannot be happy with what is happening. What is worse is that instead of emigrating to France or Germany, most, for language reasons, are emigrating to America and Australia.  At least in Europe, Irish people who find jobs are legally entitled to be there, and they are only one or two hours' flying time from their family and friends in Ireland.  There <Col N="221" /> is also the thought that at least some of the tax they pay to European Governments finds its way back to Ireland through European funds.  As 1992 approaches, the opportunities for qualified Irish people to find work on the European mainland &mdash; whether as teachers or architects or in any other area &mdash; will be opened up completely.  The only obstacle remaining will be the need to speak another European language.</P>
    <P>In business terms, the US market is thought of by most Irish business people as our second export market for language reasons, despite the distance, extra trade barriers and currency fluctuations.  As long as the language problem remains as disastrous as it is, we will be entering the internal market with one arm tied behind our back.</P>
    <P>This Bill highlights the need for a better foreign language service in education and industry.  Ireland is on the fringe of Europe.  There is a great need for us to bring our talent to the Europeans, not <i>vice versa.</i></P>
    <P>They have the resources, finance and power which we as a nation must exploit. On this basis, languages are essential, if we are to be properly integrated into the EC.</P>
    <P>In three years' time our markets will be fully open to European trade.  If we are to avail of the full open market, our knowledge of European languages is vital in areas such as advertising, marketing, negotiations, law and contracts.  Our European politicians must be able to communicate with their European counterparts, especially outside official governmental chambers, where the real decisions are made.  We need more language teachers and resources in education, especially in the areas of German, Spanish and Italian.  We must provide training courses for business students in modern languages; and we must make greater use of our language institutions and centres in providing courses for anyone wishing to get involved in European trading, and grant more scholarships for courses abroad for Irish people which allow for day-to-day contact with a language.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="222" /> The provisions contained in section 6 of the Bill would ensure that the Higher Education Authority would be required to make provision for second chance part-time education for those who may already have been employed.  Second chance education is essential if we wish to ensure that those who have been unemployed for some time make a fresh start in the workplace.</P>
    <P>The most urgent task facing us is the need to build up the country's resources in specialised skilled labour and technology in specific fields.  Both of these point to the key role which needs to be played by the education system.  If we are to take all of the talk about the new information economy seriously we will have to start thinking about our educational institutions playing a role in the economy, as crucial as that played by banks in a capital economy.</P>
    <P>One of the major elements in the tremendous post-war economic growth in southern Germany was the development of a first-class higher education system.  Our education system apparently is of very good quality by international standards in relation to the amount of resources spent on it.  However the amount of resources devoted to research and development within the education system for example cannot compare with European levels.  Strangely, the European Community avoided assisting the education systems of poorer member states until recently, with the exception of technical colleges.  Spending on education has traditionally been considered as social spending with the education system not being seen as forming an integral part of an economy's infrastructure, but new horizons are now opening. However, as a result of a ruling in a test case brought before the European Court by the Commission funds from the Social Fund may now be used in funding education.</P>
    <P>Another positive development is the introduction of the Comett programme to foster co-operation between industry and universities.  Education is more important than training for our economic development.  Training provides very <Col N="223" /> specific knowledge or skills which can easily become obsolete given the pace of change in today's world.  Education on the other hand should equip people with the fundamental abilities to analyse and organise which can then be used in absorbing quickly new information and mastering changing circumstances.  Irish education is quite weak in developing creative thinking, initiative and organisational abilities and these skills are just as important as the more technical skills.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, this Bill contains a coherent package of provisions based on a coherent policy.  It is not, of course, exclusive.  Additional provisions may be included by way of amendments on Committee Stage.  Fine Gael would welcome such amendments and we ask the House to support this Bill so that we can get on with the job of preparing for 1992 in an expeditious, planned and co-ordinated fashion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn) Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this discussion on the Bill before us in so far as it draws attention to the need for preparation in all aspects of our national life for the opportunities and challenges of the single market.  This is a matter of particular concern to me because of my responsibility for planning and co-ordination of the provision of physical infrastructure to prepare the economy for 1992.  This involves ensuring that our approach in this area is comprehensive, that facilities are not duplicated and that requirements in particular areas of infrastructure are met.</P>
      <P>It is my responsibility to see that changes take place as rapidly as is economically feasible and that developments in the different areas of infrastructure are consistent with one another.  While development of adequate infrastructure is a key area of our preparation, we must of course, consider our preparedness right across the board.  Anything which serves, so to speak, to raise consciousness in this area is to be welcomed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That said, I would have to query, without in any way wishing to detract from <Col N="224" /> the proposer's good intentions, whether a piecemeal collection of legislative amendments of this kind would make any real contribution to our preparations for 1992.  In the case of the main provisions of the Bill which affect my Department, sections 3 to 5 and section 8, I would have to go further and say that I consider them to be inappropriate or unworkable.</P>
    <P>Before dealing with the Bill's specific proposals to amend the law on physical planning, I feel it necessary to engage Deputy Bruton on the nature and purpose of the planning system and planning control.  In what was an original and interesting contribution to Second Stage debate on the Local Government (Planning and Development) (No. 2) Bill, 1988 last December, the Deputy posed a number of fundamental questions about planning.  Unfortunately, time constraints did not allow me to respond to them on that occasion, but I do so now because I believe the issues involved are relevant to the approach to physical planning underlying the present Bill.</P>
    <P>In the course of that contribution, at columns 2014 to 2028 of the Official Report of 15 December 1988, Deputy Bruton suggested that planning is intrusive and creates rigidities, and that we now have very unwieldy planning mechanisms. He suggested that the system involved the imposition of the views of the few on the many.  Deputy Bruton argued that the primary objective of planning is to prevent developments which are intrusive or which cause nuisances to other people, and suggested that this might be achieved, in certain cases at least, by leaving regulation to be effected by means of restrictive private convenants between residents of an area and people operating commercial or other activities which could cause interference.</P>
    <P>My principal reaction to this argument is that it involves an excessively negative view of the role of physical planning. Deputy Bruton emphasised the major purpose of planning as the prevention of development which is intrusive or which could cause nuisances.  I, however, take a much more positive view of the purpose of physical planning.  I believe that its job <Col N="225" /> is to achieve the orderly development of areas, in accordance with acceptable standards and the requirements of the common good.  I would not accept, as the Deputy seemed to suggest, that development can be left to the operation of market forces.  There is a valid role for the public sector in regulating and promoting development so that it occurs in a wellordered fashion.</P>
    <P>The existence of different forms of development control in all European countries is a clear indication that we are part of a broad tradition in believing that development must be subjected to certain public restraints and controls. Indeed, the key EC Directive on Environmental Impact Assessment, the purpose of which is to ensure that development takes place in accordance with acceptable environmental standards, presupposes the existence of development control procedures in all member states.</P>
    <P>The Deputy argued also that planning is intrusive and creates rigidities.  I do not accept that this is the case.  Our planning system is generally based on the principle that permission for development should be refused only where there are serious objections on important planning grounds, and I am satisfied that this is broadly how it operates in practice.</P>
    <P>It is also difficult to accept the Deputy's suggestion that planning involves the imposition of the views of the few on the many.  Our planning system is an open one which allows public involvement in the formulation of development plans and in the determination of planning applications and appeals.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Bill proposes amendments to the Local Government (Planning and Development) Acts, which would reduce the time within which planning authorities must decide planning applications, and impose time limits also on the determination of appeals by An Bord Pleanála.  The important balance involved here is between the right of a developer to a quick decision on his application or appeal, and the need to allow <Col N="226" /> sufficient time for the proper consideration of a case, having regard to the requirements of proper planning and development and the common good. While I appreciate the desire for speed in planning administration underlying section 3 of the Bill, I consider nevertheless that it errs too much in that direction and could consequently inhibit proper consideration of cases.</P>
    <P>Section 3 (1) would require planning authorities to decide planning applications within six weeks, instead of the present two months.  This, in my view, is not acceptable.  I believe that two months is a reasonable time for deciding applications, many of which are in respect of major and complex development.  I would be concerned that a reduction of the period for decisions to six weeks could inhibit proper examination of the wide range of issues and questions raised by proposals.  It is unacceptable also in so far as it could lead to developments obtaining permission by default, in accordance with section 26 (4) (a) of the 1963 Planning Act, if planning authorities found they could not reach a decision within the allowed time.  I might add that in the UK the movement has been in the opposite direction to that suggested by the Deputy; the time for determination of applications has been increased from eight to 16 weeks in cases involving environmental impact assessment.</P>
    <P>To illustrate how the system is operating in practice, I would point out that planning authorities received almost 32,000 planning applications in 1987.  In only 689, or 2 per cent of cases, was it found necessary to extend the time for consideration of the application with the consent of the applicant.  The time for making a decision was extended in some 7,500 other cases, but only because planning authorities found it necessary to seek further information from applicants. Nevertheless, 73 per cent of all applications were decided within two months. I would not accept that reducing the statutory time limit to six weeks would bring about any improvement in practice in the speed, or the quality, of planning decisions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="227" /> The remainder of section 3 is concerned with the imposition of time limits on the determination of planning appeals by An Bord Pleanála, &mdash; six weeks in a case not involving an oral hearing and 12 weeks in a case where a hearing is held. It is, of course, generally accepted that delays in determining appeals should be minimised.  To this end, my Department liaise regularly with the board about their organisational performance in disposing of appeals, and I have emphasised the vital importance of dealing expeditiously with appeals on major developments, especially those with a significant employment potential.</P>
    <P>The board are, however, the final arbiter in planning cases and are obliged to discharge their functions in accordance with the principles of natural and constitutional justice.  This involves giving all parties to an appeal an adequate opportunity to make their case and to respond to the case of other parties.  I have received legal advice that absolute time limits on the determination of appeals could prevent the board from respecting these principles and would to this extent be constitutionally unacceptable. I cannot, for this reason, agree to the limits which the Deputy has proposed.</P>
    <P>I would point out that the board have in practice been making every effort to cut down delays in dealing with appeals. At the end of 1988 only 3.4 per cent of the appeals on hands had been on hands for more than six months, compared with 11 per cent and 7 per cent respectively in the two previous years.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the Bill would require all applicants for planning permission to erect a notice on the site of the proposed development giving details of the development.  I might comment in passing that I do not see how this relates to speeding up the planning process, or to gearing up for 1992 for that matter.  That aside, the Deputy's suggestion is not without merit.  This whole area of public notice of applications has been contentious and warrants examination, and <Col N="228" /> the Deputy's proposal sets down one possible solution.</P>
    <P>I could not, however, accept section 4. A procedural provision of this kind does not belong in primary legislation; its proper place is in regulations under the Planning Acts, along with related procedural rules and requirements.  I am currently reviewing those regulations with a view to amending and consolidating them, and I will be considering the question of public notice requirements.  I assure the Deputy that his suggestion will be carefully considered in that context.</P>
    <P>While I cannot accept the specific proposals the Deputy has made in relation to the planning system, I would hasten to assure him that I share his concern that the planning system should operate effectively and should deal expeditiously with applications and appeals.  I will be keeping the situation under review, to ensure that Ireland is not put at a competitive disadvantage because of undue delays in the planning process.</P>
    <P>I now turn to section 5 of the Bill, which seeks to impose a six-week time limit for deciding applications for building by-law approval.  These by-laws are adoptive and, at present, only seven major urban authorities operate them. Applications for by-law approval must normally be decided within two months.</P>
    <P>I have already dealt with the question of time limits on applications for planning permission, and indicated that I considered six weeks to be too short to allow the proper determination of applications. I hold the same view in relation to applications for by-law approval.</P>
    <P>There is another matter which is relevant to section 5.  The Building Control Bill &mdash; at present on Dáil Committee Stage &mdash; will enable us to replace the current building by-laws system with a national system of building and building control regulations.  Essentially, the options for the resulting control systems will fall into two categories.  The first option, a so-called full approval system would involve the submission of plans and specifications to the local authority whose approval would have to be obained before work commences.  There would, <Col N="229" /> of course, be an obligation on the authority to give a decision within a specific period of time.  The alternative method of administering building regulations is by way of a &ldquo;self-certification&rdquo; system of control.  Under such a system designers and builders of individual projects would, on their own responsibility, provide certificates of compliance with the requirements of building regulations.  Reliance on this form of self-regulation by the industry would not involve the approval of plans by local authorities and the question of time limits would not, therefore, arise at all.</P>
    <P>During the debate on the Building Control Bill I explained to the House that I have an open mind as to which of these systems should be adopted and that I will be asking the Building Regulations Advisory Body, to be established under the Bill, to advise me in this regard.  I do not want to go beyond this at present but I expect that the advisory body will take full cognisance of the merits of the self-certification system of control including the facility for construction projects to get under way in the shortest possible period of time.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude on section 5 I wish to repeat an assurance which I gave during the debate on the Building Control Bill.  I intend to bring forward Report Stage amendments to ensure that local authorities are required to decide on applications for building regulations approval within a two month period.</P>
    <P>What I am saying, therefore, is that even if an approval type system is put in place, applications will have to be dealt with within the same two-month period as applies to planning permission.  As I have explained, however, the question of time limits will not arise if the concept of self-regulation by the industry is adopted instead.</P>
    <P>Section 8 of the Bill proposes to confer on the Minister for the Environment the statutory power to establish, by regulations, a National Roads Authority.  This would not be the appropriate way to establish a body with such wide-ranging powers as those envisaged for the NRA.</P>
    <P>When I established the interim NRA <Col N="230" /> last July, I indicated that I intended to wait some months before commencing the detailed drafting of the Bill to set the authority up on a statutory basis.  This was designed to give us all, including the interim board of the NRA, a better feel for the specific legislative measures which should be included in the Bill.  I intend to have the general scheme of a Bill to establish the NRA on a statutory basis prepared by the end of May and a Bill brought before the House as soon as possible after that.  The NRA have made recommendations with regard to the scope of this legislation.</P>
    <P>The top priority in the roads division of my Department at present is the preparation of an operational programme for roads which I will be submitting to the EC, in the context of the revised Structural Funds, before the end of this month. This operational programme will be the channel through which work on our national roads can be accelerated.  Following completion and submission of this programme, top priority will be accorded to the NRA Bill.</P>
    <P>I have informed the interim NRA that, pending the enactment of the legislation, it has a significant role to play in the operation of the roads programme.  In particular, they now supervise the development programme for national roads, within the context of my responsibility for policy and finance; they promote private investment in national roads and process all new toll road proposals for such roads.  My Department will conclude negotiations on the possible tolling of the Dublin Ring Road and Newbridge/Kilcullen, in consultation with the Authority; they are developing proposals for loan-based investment; they will promote the case for EC aid for national roads, following submission of the operational programme; they will carry out annual reviews of the operational programme for national roads; they will prepare and submit to the Minister for approval future medium-term plans for the development of the network of national roads and they will recommend the annual State road grant allocations for the improvement and <Col N="231" /> maintenance of national roads, having regard to the blueprint and future approved road plans.</P>
    <P>The NRA have already provided valuable comments on the draft Blueprint for Road Development which has been prepared by my Department.  They are also being consulted on the operational programme.  Fifteen administrative staff and 13 professional staff of my Department are now providing services to the Authority.</P>
    <P>When the Authority have a statutory basis, they will, in addition to the functions I have already mentioned, also be empowered to: pay approved grants for national roads; arrange for the design of road improvement projects on national roads; place contracts or secure the placing of contracts for improvement works on national roads and charge tolls in respect of road projects attracting private investment.</P>
    <P>This country badly needs an improved network of national roads.  Transport costs for Irish exporters to mainland Europe are approximately twice those incurred by Community countries trading with one another on the mainland.  Our problems will be exacerbated when all trade barriers are removed in 1992.  The total cost of bringing our road network up to an acceptable standard has been estimated at £9 billion, £3.3 billion of which should be spent on national roads and access routes to ports and airports. The new partnership of the State, local authorities, the NRA, the EC and the private sector can deliver the required road network.  I intend to publish the blueprint within a few months, taking into account the views of the EC on the operational programme.  The blueprint will serve as the benchmark for the NRA.</P>
    <P>The policy has been settled, the financial prospects are bright and the programme is gathering momentum.  The total State road grant this year, at £194 million, is the highest annual amount ever provided, in real terms.  This year is, in effect, the first year of a strategic programme to improve the road network. The National Roads Authority will have <Col N="232" /> as their main focus the development of the network of national roads and the access routes to the principal ports and airports.  Their task will be to ensure that the job is done within the shortest possible time and in the most cost effective manner.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I must firmly reject any impression which might be given by this Bill that environmental controls are something to be abandoned or relaxed in the context of the completion of the single market.  The Single European Act expressly lays down the objective of harmonising environmental standards, but on the basis of a high level of environmental protection.  Far from espousing a policy of deregulation on planning and environmental matters in prospect of 1992, the EC is intensifying and strengthening environmental controls.</P>
    <P>The reasons for this are simple.  The Single European Act emphasises action at source to prevent pollution, rather than remedying of environmental damage after the event, as the best way of dealing with environmental problems. High environmental standards, guaranteed by planning and other controls, are critical to the achievement of the single market.  More and more, consumer demand, within the EC and beyond, is for state of the art, environmentally friendly goods.  To the extent that the Community as a whole, or we in Ireland, fall behind this demand, we will be harming ourselves economically and allowing our manufacturing base to slide into obsolescence.</P>
    <P>For these reasons, I reject the thrust of this Bill's proposals, particularly as they relate to environmental requirements. Preparation for 1992 will have to proceed on a broader front and on more enlightened principles than are represented in this Bill.</P>

I am not surprised that the proposals have been rejected by the Minister and his colleagues.  Fianna Fáil have <Col N="233" /> traditionally rejected everything which was radical in nature.  They rejected the Treaty, the foundation of the Garda Síochána, the foundation of the Army, the Free State Constitution, the declaration of the Republic in 1948 and, in more recent times, they rejected every initiative between 1973 and 1977.  In the life of the last Government, after having rejected the foundation of the IDA and the VHI, organisations to which they now doff the cap, they rejected the need to control the national debt and, secondly, they rejected the Anglo-Irish Agreement. They also rejected the Single European Act.  It is no surprise to me that Ministers tonight and last night, have rejected another radical proposal being put forward by this side of the House.</P>

    <P>The principal progress, through the work of the last Minister for Finance, Commissioner Ray MacSharry, was a major reduction in the national debt. That would not have been possible if the Minister had not received the co-operation of this side of the House. Recent history will illustrate that adversarial politics can sometimes end up in frustration but that consensus politics can <Col N="234" /> get things done.  The key to Deputy Bruton's proposal is that we would have a further exercise in consensus on matters of principle.  If we leave the political playacting aside, there is no difference in principle anyway.  In my time in politics I have seen a number of major opportunities missed.  We certainly missed one in 1973 when the initial input of funds from the EC under various headings was channelled into increases in standards of living.  In one respect that was necessary but that move ensured that those funds did not go into the type of investment that was necessary to put the economy in the shape it should have been in the early seventies.</P>
    <P>More recently, we have missed other opportunities.  Had the corrective action which was taken in the last two years, following on the progress we made, been taken in 1979 when the Taoiseach took over, we would have a different country today and we would not be talking about an effective rate of unemployment of 28 per cent, if we add to the live register those who have emigrated in the last four years.  It is not a sufficient response for Ministers to describe these as cod proposals, to say that they represent pie in the sky and that they will not get us anywhere.  The history of recent years in the House has proved that a minority Government whose economic policies are supported, in so far as the general thrust of them go, by the main Opposition party can achieve objectives with which we all agree.</P>
    <P>We are faced with another opportunity in 1992 when the market will be completed. The opportunities presented by the completion of the market are not that we are going to get a bonanza of Structural Funds from Europe, even though that is important, but that we will be able to participate in a market of 320 million people as equal partners.  What we produce can be sold without let, hindrance, regulation &mdash; fair or otherwise &mdash; across the boundaries of Europe.</P>
    <P>All argument about economic policy for this country could be reduced to one objective and it is one that I am sure all Members will share.  It is all about Ireland <Col N="235" /> Incorporated producing more and selling it more effectively.  Whether we sell it abroad or at home to substitute for imports, it ends up the same way.  If we can organise an economy which can produce more and sell more effectively then it will require people to produce more and we will get a reduction in the massive unemployment figures we have.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State and his colleagues would do well to look at the proposals contained in Deputy John Bruton's document, and they might look in particular at the lack of progress which we have made in comparison to other European countries.  There have been massive improvements in the economies of countries all over Europe in the last 50 years, but Ireland seems to be stuck and going further and further down the league table.  I should like to refer to the suggestion of consensus contained in these proposals. We believe there are certain objectives which are common to many parties in the House if they were openly stated.  If there was a forum where the leaders of the parties, together with the social partners, could discuss those objectives and refine them, then those economic objectives would survive changes of Government and real progress could be made.</P>
    <P>We have massive levels of unemployment, 240,000 on the live register, and huge levels of emigration, almost 30 per cent now.  I do not think we will get out of those problems by the type of playacting that has passed for politics here over the last 20 or 25 years.  We have suggested a forum where the social partners could discuss the issues of the day and the economic objectives of the leaders of all parties.  We realise that the Executive must lead in the implementation of policies but we want clear objectives stated and action taken as a consequence of that.</P>
    <P>There are areas which give us great concern.  If we are thinking in terms of spending the money in the Structural Funds and evaluating whether it will be spent beneficially or not, we must ask ourselves, &ldquo;what economic disadvantage <Col N="236" /> will be removed when all that money is spent in the Irish economy?&rdquo; The test of whether Structural Funds are effectively spent is not how many roads are built, how many bridges cross rivers, how many sewerage schemes are completed or whether the length of one runway in a regional airport is longer than the runway in the next county.  At the end of five years when we ask the question we must be able to answer it by saying that the following disadvantages have been removed.</P>
    <P>If we look at the economic disadvantages at the moment, we will see that top of the list is the inadequacy of our road structure.  As the country on the periphery of the Community in the North Atlantic we have a problem getting to the market of 320 million people.  At present it costs 40 per cent more to move a metric tonne of produce here than it does in the United Kingdom and we have to get to the Continent after that.  That is a result of the high level of excise duty on articulated trucks, the level of excise duty on fuels, particularly auto diesel, and the inadequacy of the road structure.  If we could agree that it should be a priority of the House to reduce the cost of transport to the European average that alone would enable us to make significant progress in getting ourselves ready for the internal market.  It would mean that a major economic disadvantage would be removed from our economy and ultimately, it would result in more of our people getting jobs at home and staying at home.</P>
    <P>On the night of the budget I suggested to the Minister for Finance that he should use the revenue accruing to the Exchequer from the increase in the price of petrol to reduce the price of auto diesel.  Had he done that, the price of auto diesel could have been brought down by between 25p and 30p per gallon and that would have been a significant cut in transport costs here.</P>
    <P>I am glad that tonight the Minister for the Environment has finally come into the House and told us he is going to provide a statutory basis for the National Roads Authority.  This was suggested, <Col N="237" /> announced and re-announced on several occasions, but there is no statutory basis for it.  There is a statutory base for the road building activities of every county council in the country.  The Minister is talking about tolling certain roads and about building other roads and about having a Bill before the House in mid-May. I hope he fulfils his promises because he has not done so up to now. Since this Government came to power, £35 million has been left in the coffers of Brussels &mdash; money that could have been used to improve the roads of Ireland &mdash; because the matching funds were not put forward by the Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the debate was adjourned I spoke about some of the innovations the Minister introduced in the budget.  I mentioned the change he was bringing about in the free electricity scheme which will allow pensioners to carry over unused units from one billing period to another.  This is a welcome move.  I take this opportunity now to ask the Minister to modify this scheme a little more to review the living alone condition in certain well-defined circumstances. Everybody in the House is aware of cases where single sons or daughters, more often daughters, have given up work to care for an elderly parent who needs constant care and attention.  In those circumstances the elderly person loses the free electricity allowance because he or she is not then living alone.  A move to change this regulation would be welcomed by all sides of the House and would be an encouragement to people to look after their elderly relatives at home. I know there would be difficulties in doing this but certain conditions could apply, for example, a certain age could be specified or it could be a requirement to supply <Col N="238" /> a medical certificate stating that the elderly person required constant care and attention.  I am sure the Minister will take note of what has been said by a number of speakers and do something about that scheme.</P>
      <P>I would like to compliment the Minister in general terms on his approach to suggestions made by his own backbenchers and by Deputies on the other side of the House.  He has always shown a willingness to listen to suggestions and act on them where possible.</P>
      <P>Because of the Minister's flexible attitude and his willingness to initiate schemes geared to the needs of those on social welfare, I would like now to urge him to take a look at the regulations in relation to unemployment assistance and the qualifications for such.  Our unemployment figures now stand at approximately 235,000.  Even the most optimistic forecasters concede that for the foreseeable future we will not be able to provide jobs for all of these people.  I use the word &ldquo;jobs&rdquo; in this context rather than the word &ldquo;work&rdquo; because I have no doubt but that we could provide work for a considerable number of the people who are unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the moment instead of allowing people to make a positive contribution to their community or to their own self-development we currently say to them that they are idle and must remain so, that the State will pay them for remaining idle and if they do anything other than remain idle the State will stop paying them.  We tell them to go out and look for jobs in areas where every second person is unemployed.  We also tell people who have reached the age of 55 and 60 years of age that they must be available for and seeking employment when we all know that the chances of people in that age group getting a reasonable job are practically nil.  This approach has resulted in the talents of very many capable people being wasted.  They have to sit at home and do nothing, contributing nothing to their own development or that of their communities.  This is a terrible waste.  In our culture a person's status in society is measured by the job <Col N="239" /> he holds and the income he earns and a person's self-esteem depends largely on his status in society.  Consequently a person who has no job has little or no status and therefore little or no self-esteem. It has been proved by successive studies that the longer a person is unemployed the lower his self-esteem becomes.  Our present system reinforces this state of affairs by encouraging idleness and discouraging any attempts at self-development.  We are punishing any show of initiative or effort to investigate means of becoming self employed.</P>
    <P>There have been examples of groups of unemployed people who have sought to set up co-operatives, as in the case of one group in Cork, or a group in Dublin who set up a dramatic society, but who lost their entitlements to social welfare assistance because they were not available for work.  I have personal experience of an individual who began to investigate what he felt might be a viable enterprise that he could set up for himself.  He set up a meeting for himself on a day that he was due to sign.  He went to the employment exchange to explain what was happening &mdash; this was about 18 months ago &mdash; and the rules were so rigid that when he did not sign on the proper day he was struck off the register for six weeks.  That type of rigidity in the regulations, which existed in the past and is slowly changing because of the innovations of the Minister, is a major disincentive to everybody. Why do we not allow a person who has no job the right to use his God-given skills and talents while he waits for a job opportunity?  Why should there be a period of enforced idleness when that time could be used productively for the individual or for the local community?</P>
    <P>I feel very strongly that the social welfare system as it pertains to the unemployment assistance scheme should be more flexible.  The Minister should be allowed to make regulations which would provide that those who find themselves without a job spend their time productively. I have no doubt that if the present Minister was given that opportunity by way of regulation under the <Col N="240" /> social welfare system he would grasp it with both hands and would put even more measures in train which would dispel the sterile idea that a person on unemployment assistance should sit at home and do nothing.</P>
    <P>As I have said, in the past two years the Minister has introduced schemes which show that he is more than willing to help people to help themselves.  Other Deputies have mentioned the educational opportunities scheme and in this Bill there is the pre-retirement scheme.  I commend the Minister for the tentative steps he is taking through these schemes. I realise that the reason he has not gone any further at this time is that he is literally hamstrung by the social welfare legislation.  The principle behind the moves he has already made is a good one and should be extended.  I strongly believe that the legislation, whether through this Bill or a future Bill, should be framed in such a way that power is given to the Minister to make regulations to introduce schemes like the ones he has already introduced, whether they be on a local or a national basis.</P>
    <P>I might go a step further and suggest that we get rid of the whole concept of an unemployment allowance or, to put it another way, an allowance for unemployment. Why do we not adopt a more positive approach to those who are not fortunate enough to be able to get a job? We should get rid of all the negative connotations surrounding dole and unemployment assistance and adopt a more positive approach completely.  That could possibly be done by scrapping the idea of unemployment assistance and by deciding to give people who have not a job or a source of income a living allowance which would enable them to participate productively in society, whether in the form of educational courses, community work or whatever.  I would say as an aside that the educational opportunities scheme to which I referred earlier is an excellent scheme and one that should be developed and extended right across the country.  That could be done by allowing people to pursue courses and, by regulation, allowing the Minister to <Col N="241" /> designate courses, whether public courses in VECs or privately run courses. As long as the Minister felt they were suitable courses he should have the power by regulation to introduce them under the educational opportunities scheme.  Any course which would help a person's self-development or help him to acquire new skills which might be more useful in securing a job should get the go-ahead from the Minister and he should be allowed to do that.</P>
    <P>Why do we not allow people who are unfortunate enough not to have a job the freedom to work on a voluntary basis for a set period of time with local committees to help develop their own communities? The Minister has already introduced one such scheme on a limited scale.  If schemes such as these were introduced, particularly for those who have been made redundant in their later years and who have little hope of full-time permanent employment they would be of benefit not only to the person involved but also to the community in which he lives.  As I have said I recognise, as I think does all sides of the House, the Minister's commitment in this area and the moves he has made in the past two years.  It is up to all of us in this House to support and encourage him to introduce more schemes such as this and to get rid of the stigma attached to a person who is unfortunate enough to lose his or her job and who is left feeling that he or she has nothing to contribute to society.</P>
    <P>Provision is made in the Bill for measures which are directed towards the family.  This budget, like the two previous budgets introduced by this Government, was introduced in a time of harsh economic circumstances.  The Minister has managed in the past two years to find ways of directing the huge amounts of money being provided for social welfare to the areas that are most in need.  One feature of the budget, and now confirmed in the social welfare legislation before us, has been its approach to providing measures which help the family at a time of grave economic crisis.  Two years ago the Minister increased the social welfare budget.  He increased it again last year <Col N="242" /> and this year it has been increased even further.  The measures introduced for the family in this budget alone cost £42 million. As everyone would concede, that has been done at a time of grave difficulties. That shows the commitment that the Minister and the Government have made in this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Not at all.  We have always honoured our commitment to social welfare recipients, to the family and the poor.  We have always shown that commitment by the introduction of changes in social welfare, ploughing money into needy areas.  We do not merely pay lip service, as have other Governments in the past when they awarded amounts like £9.60 to stay-at-home spouses and various other commitments never honoured, in times when money was being spent and borrowed as if it was going out of fashion.  This Government have a real commitment to the needs of the less well off in our society.</P>
      <P>Deputy Barnes spoke at some length about the family, contending that we are a child-centred family centred society and that we should have a policy geared to the family unit.  This Government have shown in this and previous years that they have that commitment to the basic family unit in our society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been considerable talk about the child benefit scheme and its advantages for families in that it is the only benefit paid directly to the wife.  I do not know why that should be so.  Irrespective of whether a person is a social welfare recipient or an earner, the stay at home spouse, whether it be husband or wife, should have the right to a minimum percentage of the income earned.  Most of <Col N="243" /> the discussion on child benefit focused on the fact that this money would be lost to the wife and may be the only amount she receives.</P>
    <P>I know it is the case that many wives may receive very little from mean husbands and so on.  However, the way to tackle that problem is by the introduction of some form of legislation.  I recognise that that is probably more properly the responsibility of the Minister for Finance. But I contend that the stay at home spouse should have the right to a minimum percentage of the income earned by the other.  If we are to show concern about the family unit we should encourage at least one spouse to remain at home through our social welfare and taxation systems &mdash; as I believe we are doing in part by way of the provisions of this Bill &mdash; so that the family with one spouse only working would receive the same allowance as the family where both spouses work.</P>
    <P>Farmers have made much play of the fact that they feel they are not being treated equally under our taxation system.  The same contention could be made in the case of families where there is one income earner only.</P>
    <P>I welcome the new provision to eliminate abuse in the construction, contract cleaning, forestry and security industries on the part of contractors and sub-contractors. This is a provision which should be welcomed by all sides of the House.  It should be remembered that those who draw benefits to which they are not entitled are robbing those to whom we want to direct such payments, the less well off in our society.  The Minister is to be commended on his initiatives in this area.  The loophole that obtained with regard to builders and sub-contractors to date has had to be closed because it led to widespread abuse.  It meant that most builders of any size got around the regulations by engaging sub-contractors. Indeed transport is another industry that springs to mind in which this loophole obtained.  The sooner this type of abuse is arrested the better it will be for everybody.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="244" /> The appeal system has been improved enormously in recent years.  However, it could still be more open and be seen to be more caring.  Most applicants' view having gone through an appeals procedure, is that it constitutes an inquisition, that one appears before an appeals officer with little hope of winning one's case.  I would appeal to the Minister to ascertain whether he can do anything to improve that procedure further and allay applicants' fears.</P>
    <P>As a Deputy representing a rural area I commend the Minister on having abolished the rural versus urban rates of unemployment assistance because that system was outdated even though it had been in existence for the past 20 to 30 years.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on his approach to the task in hand and look forward to more initiatives on his part in the future.</P>

      <P>Having sat in the House all day I am slightly punch drunk at the succession of Fianna Fáil Deputies who have been eulogising the Minister. It makes me wonder, apart from his good looks, what are his unique qualities. Because I am a somewhat unconventional Member people may expect me to be critical of the Minister.  That is not my intention apart altogether from the fact that I am not a member of the Fianna Fáil Soldiers of Destiny Party, the party of negativity, who opposed everything introduced in this House over the past four and a half years when Deputy Dempsey was only a young man.</P>

      <P>I want to congratulate the Minister on the good work he has done over the last two years as Minister for Social Welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a popular belief, or more properly myth, in this country that many people are starving or near to starvation.  I do not believe that.  It might be popular to say so but I do not believe that <Col N="245" /> anybody here is near the poverty line.  I suppose it all boils down to a question of definition of poverty.  I do not think there is anybody hungry in this country.  I have said before and will repeat that our social welfare system has been feather-bedded by successive Governments and is now one of the best in western Europe.  For example, 40 years ago there was not a family here who were not supported to some degree by a few dollars from America or a few pounds from England.  We have now created a social welfare system better than that obtaining in the United Kingdom who have the wealth and investment of centuries behind them.  I wonder how long this can last.  In many ways our system could be described as a social welfare paradise.  Much of the hardship &mdash; and there are varying degrees &mdash; I contend is the result of excessive gambling &mdash; about which I know a little &mdash; and drinking.  We have a very caring society.  I, too, am concerned for those unfortunates whose jobs have foundered. I come from a town with the highest unemployment rate in Ireland &mdash; 32 per cent, almost double the national average.  I have seen industry after industry crumble without being replaced.  I know there is great stress in Ireland but I object to the use of the word &ldquo;poverty&rdquo;.  Poverty does not exist in this country as it exists in Ethiopia, the Sudan or India.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I want to share my time with my colleague, Deputy Boylan.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

      <P>Is that satisfactory to the House?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>Agreed, if it is accepted that two of our Deputies can do likewise afterwards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that the Minister has acknowledged the plight of widowers whose payments were seriously out of line with those of widows.  A widower's children get hungry at the same time as a widow's.  There was a serious anomaly in respect of those payments for many years.  I am glad the Minister has put it right, but I cannot understand why he is asking them to wait until October for <Col N="246" /> the money.  The saving to the Exchequer must be only nominal so perhaps the Minister would look at that to see if he can bring forward the payment date.</P>
      <P>I also agree with the Minister's decision to bring payments in rural areas into line with payments in urban areas but I again fail to see why that distinction was drawn over the years.  I also agree with the payment of child benefit in respect of people up to 19 years old, who are at school and whose families, we may presume, make sacrifices to keep them at school.  That is a commonsense and practical approach.</P>
      <P>Another area that deserves the Minister's attention relates to children who leave school at 16, under educated and ill equipped for life and who, perhaps, come from deprived areas in the city. One of the reasons so many turn to crime is that they come from deprived families, in some cases where the father has been unemployed for a long time, and they have no money at all in their pockets, while every ten minutes the television exhorts them to go for a pint.  These are adults with L plates, without money, so they go out and steal it.  There is a case for the introduction of a payment to children coming from families where there is long-term unemployment, to bridge the gap from 16 to 18 years old.  They should be given some money of their own and some little dignity.  Will the Minister look at that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While acknowledging the Minister's concern and the concern of all Deputies about social welfare recipients, I must ask what about the working man on a lower income.  In many cases people have given up their lowly paid employment and gone into the ranks of the unemployed to avail of the many benefits such as rent reduction, medical cards, children's footwear allowances and so on.  To many people it is more attractive to be unemployed and to do nixers.  I know of people who have given up their jobs to do that as they are better off unemployed.  It is a matter for serious concern that people should think in that negative way.  The unfortunate working man, particularly the lower paid worker, is paying for everything.  He pays income tax, he pays <Col N="247" /> to get his children to school, he pays water rates and doctors' fees, too, as he has no medical card.  It is really a very small band of people who are paying for everything.  The attractions of going into the social welfare system are huge for people on lower pay, and then they have the possibility to do nixers.  The Minister should look at this area.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dempsey referred to the building industry, the industry that really lends itself to abuse of the system.  In the Border area the building trade has all but ceased.  The builders in Dundalk have now moved to London and the Isle of Man because of lack of opportunity here, despite the much vaunted claims of Fianna Fáil that when they are in power the building industry booms.  Now it is booming in foreign places.  The builders in the Border region are faced with unfair competition particularly for public works contracts.  They have to stand by and see lucrative contracts in the south being awarded to Northern Ireland firms who are grant aided, who undercut southern Irish companies and, having got that advantage, use scab labour or clients from the North of Ireland who are signing here and are possibly signing on in the North as well.  This has been going on for years.  The special investigation unit in the Department have a fair idea of the extent of that outrage.</P>
    <P>Another area I would like to address relates to desertion, a despicable crime that is sadly on the increase.  The number of unfortunate women being deserted has escalated recently.  The numbers have doubled and possibly trebled.  While it may be a symptom of the times it is a despicable trend.  I can understand a man or wife parting but I cannot understand a man &mdash; I will call him a man although I could call him by another word only parliamentary decorum prevents me doing so &mdash; deserting his children and expecting the State to pick up the tab. People who do that should be pursued and if necessary left without social welfare payments themselves.  It is all too easy for married men to desert their children today and while this problem is <Col N="248" /> very hard to balance, steps should be taken against every man who deserts his children.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to say to the Minister that the prescribed relative allowance is one with which all of us in public life are concerned, and we are all inundated with requests to get elderly people into geriatric homes.  In many cases the beds are not available particularly when it is Fianna Fáil policy to close hospitals despite their con claim before the election that health cuts hurt the old, the sick and the disadvantaged. That was another con trick they used to get into power.  Having said that, beds are not readily available at present because of the Government's policies.</P>
    <P>More and more people should be encouraged to bring their aged relatives home, and keep them at home, and a realistic payment should be made to them.  We are all aware of the inflated and unbelievable bureaucratic assessments of what it costs to keep people in hospital. A realistic payment to people who are prepared to take their relatives home and to care for them in the home environment should be made.  That prescribed relative allowance should be increased and the whole scope of that area should be widened.  I want to renew my plea to the Minister to look at the possibility of bringing forward the date of payment to widowers, of which there are about 5,000 in the country.  Do not ask them to wait until October, but bring in legislation to enable payment to be made to them before that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak briefly on this Bill.  This Minister is in charge of a Department that has an input into every home in the country.  In his introduction, the Minister stated that he had taken a major step &mdash; I would not call it a major step, I would call it a step. As I have often said, Fianna Fáil are never slow in heaping praise on themselves or their Government, but they are, and have been, rather selfish when it comes to recognising the worth of others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer to my own party, Fine Gael, in opposition and our constructive <Col N="249" /> attitude which has brought about the climate where these modest social welfare increases are now higher than the inflation rate.  Were it not for the guidance, direction and support we have given here in the Dáil over the last two years that would not have happened.  If it was not for the work of the last Government reducing raging inflation from 20 per cent to the present figure of 2 per cent, we would not be in the position we are today, despite bitter opposition at the time from Fianna Fáil when they were on this side of the House.  I was not in the House then but I read the reports.  They used every opportunity to trip up that Government in their sterling efforts to bring some sanity to the finances.</P>
    <P>There are a number of points I would like to raise with the Minister and I will not be selfish like the Minister or his Government.  I will pay tribute to what I recognise as improvements in our social welfare code.</P>
    <P>The first item I would like to refer to is the family income supplement.  That should be welcomed but there is an anomaly here because the wife has to collect it.  This is an embarrassment to a husband who is working and who got the best job he could.  If his income is not sufficient to provide for his family, his wife is expected to go to the local office to collect the balance that may be ascertained by the Department of Social Welfare. It should be possible to make that payment to the husband through his employer.  In fact, there is a double cost involved &mdash; the employer pays his PRSI contribution, it is channelled into the Department and is channelled out again. If the employer was allowed to pay it direct to the employee to give him a reasonable income, there could be a saving.  Some mechanism should be found to deal with this.</P>
    <P>I do not like embarrassing people on social welfare because I know the majority of them are anxious to get work but, through no fault of theirs, the jobs are not available.  That could be truly said for 90 per cent of people on social welfare.  That is the feeling I get from talking to people, they are anxious to <Col N="250" /> get some form of work which would be beneficial to themselves and their families.</P>
    <P>We also have the problem of the management of low incomes.  That does not apply only to social welfare recipients; it applies to all households.  People on social welfare have difficulty managing the money they receive.  In some households £150 could keep people quite comfortably but the same sized family next door with an income of £300 could be living in bad circumstances.  The vocational education committees should provide classes to show people how best they should manage their income.  That applies to myself and to every household in the country.  I agree with Deputy McGahon that a great deal of poverty could be prevented, generally it is the children who suffer from bad management of the family finances.</P>
    <P>In relation to PRSI for the self-employed over 55, unless I am mistaken, when these people reach the age of 65 and qualify for old age pension they will not get supplementary pension.  That is wrong.  There is also a very hazy attitude as to whether they will receive a refund of the moneys they are paying in.  If that is the case, and I believe it is, there should be a scaled increase of social welfare for those people in recognition of the contributions they have made, from age 55, 59 or 60, rather than that they do not get a contributory old age pension but only qualify for the ordinary old age pension. There is no recognition of the contributions they are making and, in the meantime, the State has the benefit of that money.  That is an area the Minister should look at in order to bring about some improvement.</P>
    <P>There are two items to which I would like to refer.  The Minister said he has made major savings in social welfare payments over the last 12 months or two years.  Some of that would be brought about by emigration, which is sad, and other savings would be brought about by the detection of people who were working while drawing unemployment benefit. Nobody in this House would condone that sort of activity, and I have no doubt <Col N="251" /> it was happening.  At present employers have to give the names of their employees when they take up work with them.  This will rule out that kind of abuse.  I welcome that development because we must ensure that scarce resources go to the people who are entitled to them.</P>
    <P>There were two other areas where the Minister made massive savings &mdash; I believe they were soft targets.  The first was in the free fuel scheme.  In rural areas there were major cutbacks but thankfully we had a mild winter, otherwise many old people would have died from the cold because they were deprived of the free fuel because they had two or three acres of land and it was deemed that there would be sufficient firewood to provide them with heating.  That is nonsense and it is not acceptable.</P>
    <P>The Minister has abolished the rural rate of unemployment benefit and brought it up to the urban rate.  That is correct, and the same should apply to people living in rural areas who should get free fuel, because old people cannot go out and cut firewood to provide heating. If they are a very close family, then perhaps in-laws, cousins or other relatives might come to their aid.  Unfortunately it is a sad reflection on our society today that few people think of or care for the old who could die from the cold.</P>
    <P>There is also the small farmers' assistance. I have come across umpteen cases &mdash; and I have stated this here previously to the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Agriculture and Food &mdash; of people living in dire poverty because they have been assessed by people in the Minister's Department who have no knowledge of agriculture.</P>
    <P>I can give the Minister instances where social employment officers who assessed the income of farmers who own 20 acres of land and five or six cows immediately assumed that each one of those cows would have a calf.  These officers listen to the top prices for continental calves, being quoted on the radio and they think each calf will earn the farmer £400 or £2,500 in round figures for six.  This is <Col N="252" /> absolute nonsense.  A farmer would be very lucky to sell three calves.  If they are heifer or friesian calves he would be lucky to get £150 or £200 for each of them.  It is only occasionally he will get the top price.  Some calves are retained as replacement stock but they are regarded as income.  This is wrong.  No consideration is given to the cost of maintaining the stock.  Farmers on small holdings very often buy in feedstuff for cash.  These people are not accustomed to keeping accounts.  They may buy 20 bales of hay at a time.  We may hear that hay is worth only £1.50 a bale but those people may have to pay £3 or £4 a bale in order to have it delivered.  The social welfare officer will not take that into account in assessing a farmer's income. He will go by what he reads in the paper about the price of fodder and the prices stock are making at marts.  I ask the Minister to review this situation immediately because there are many cases of genuine hardship and poverty.  Many young families are suffering and some children have to go to school without their lunches because their parents do not have any money.  Usually these are hard working decent people trying to make use of the little piece of land they have but it is not sufficient to give them an income.  Very often these people are too proud or embarrassed to fight their case with the social welfare officer.  This area needs to be examined immediately and I have deliberately stayed on this point in order to hammer it home.</P>
    <P>I want to give an example of the real hardship which can be suffered by these people.  A man came to tell me that he could not send his daughter, the last child in a family of five, on a school trip to Dublin because he did not have the £10 for the bus fare.  This child could not understand why she could not go on this trip with her friends.  That is real hardship affecting innocent children.  The reason that man did not have £10 for the trip is because his unemployment assistance had been reduced the previous month from about £80 to about £22 per week, a dramatic decrease.  I know the Minister <Col N="253" /> will take this on board and do something about it.</P>
    <P>With regard to the child dependant allowance, recipients will be paid up to 19 years of age where a child continues in full time education.  This is a very welcome provision.  At present if there is a handicapped child at home an allowance will be paid for that child up to 16 years of age but if that child stays on in education and undertakes a commercial course or carpentry course the benefit will be withdrawn.  If the child is kept at home the parents will receive an unemployment allowance for that child and this will encourage parents to keep the child at home.  They may get an allowance of up to £30 per week from the health board.  Unfortunately the attraction is to keep these children at home rather than send them to school where they may get the best opportunities and so be able to gain meaningful employment later.  We are talking about a very small amount of money&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is talking about the DPMA.  It comes under health.  They go on to the disabled person's maintenance allowance after domiciliary care but I appreciate the point the Deputy is making.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Minister to take it on board and have it examined.  I have already welcomed the discontinuance of the non-urban rates of unemployment assistance.  People living in rural Ireland often have greater costs than people living in urban areas.  People living in urban areas have all the services at their disposal but some people in rural areas have to take a bus or hire a taxi if they want to travel to a shop or local town.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer to the living alone allowance and the free telephone and ESB schemes.  Stringent regulations are attached to these schemes.  We in this country have always had a great tradition of looking after the aged in our society, whether they are our parents or in-laws, but circumstances have changed.  Nowadays many people find it difficult to get <Col N="254" /> by.  People had smaller incomes long ago and were able to live comfortably but this is no longer the case.  In many instances a daughter stayed at home to look after her aged parents.  For want of a better word her life was spoiled in that when her parents died she was left with a void in her life, had no income and had no possibility of getting employment.  An allowance should be given to such people in recognition of the work done by them. An allowance is paid at present in respect of a son or daughter caring for his or her aged parents but if two or more of the family stay at home and one of them is working no allowance is paid.  This is wrong and recognition should be given to the contribution made by the person who stays at home.  The work they do is saving the State a considerable amount of money.  If these sons and daughters did not stay at home to look after their parents the only alternative would be to place these old people in nursing homes, if this was possible.  Like Deputy McGahon, I find it impossible to get people who are genuinely in need of hospitalisation for a short time placed in St. Felim's hospital in my constituency because there are not sufficient beds.</P>
    <P>I also want to make the case for husbands and wifes who take care of their aged parents.  In many cases these husbands and wives are rearing young families at the same time.  Many wives may have stopped working in order to stay at home to look after their parents.  Even if they were not working previously &mdash; and I do not make any distinction &mdash; an allowance should be given to these people in recognition of the work done by them.</P>
    <P>Those are some of the points I regard as important.  I welcome the efforts being made by the Minister and I know he will take on board the comments we have made.  I have listened to the debate and the concerns expressed by many Members.  This debate is important because it is often said that when we come into this House we lose contact with the ordinary people.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  I have been more than impressed by all of the contributions made.  People are genuinely concerned <Col N="255" /> about the unemployed, the aged and the sick in our community and I can assure the Minister that my party will fully support any efforts he makes in improving the lot of these people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>With the consent of the House I should like to share part of my time with two of my colleagues, Deputy Swift and Deputy Cowen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that agreed? Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to refer to a number of comments made by my constituency colleague, Deputy McGahon. I am sorry that the Deputy has left the House because I feel obliged to reply to one or two of his remarks.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy McGahon that Dundalk has the highest unemployment rate in the country.  He seemed to be pointing the finger at Fianna Fáil but I have to say &mdash; I think this is on the record, and the record speaks for itself &mdash; that when his party were in Government they sat on the demise of the Dundalk industries and it will only be as a result of the policies brought forward by the Fianna Fáil Government since February 1987 that Dundalk will eventually come back to what it was, one of the best towns in Ireland.  Various items like the 48 hour rule which have helped the general upturn in the economy have also helped to bring Dundalk back partly to where it should rightfully be.</P>
      <P>Deputy McGahon also referred to Northern building contractors.  There is no doubt that that was a problem in Dundalk over the last ten years.  It is quite pleasing to see that over the last year or so most of the public contracts given in the Dundalk area have gone to local builders. One builder has, I think, about four contracts on his hands and is employing local people.  That is to be commended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am inclined to agree with that Deputy's views about the prescribed relative's allowance.  In nearly every county there is a waiting list for admission to geriatric hospitals.  This has nothing to do with <Col N="256" /> the policies of Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael or Labour.  There will always be such waiting lists.  If a thousand beds were available in every hospital, they would all be filled.  The Minister for Health is on record as saying that he would be more inclined to have old people at home.  In this regard, the prescribed relative's allowance should be looked into in an effort to allow that to happen rather than to have old people institutionalised.</P>
    <P>The area of poverty has been mentioned. It has been the great buzz word of the media over the last year or so.  I am glad to see Deputies on the far side of the House acknowledge that it is not as bad a problem as it is made out to be. It is all relative.  Poverty in Ireland may be richness elsewhere.  If you visit some of the Third World countries, you will see what poverty is really all about. Having said that, in certain areas or pockets there is poverty.  The Government have recognised this.  There have been various ESRI reports which have highlighted it.  The Government, in their <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> stated that they will give this area high priority. It must be acknowledged by all in the House that since we came into power the social welfare area has been the least effective of any with regard to cutbacks in the public expenditure programme. Indeed, a figure of £265 million has been spent on families alone by the Government over the last few years.</P>
    <P>Over the last two years substantial increases in social welfare benefits have been given, particularly to those on the lower end of the scale somewhere in the region of 25 per cent.  That is to be commended by all.  The area of the low paid is something the Government have given high priority to.  The Minister mentioned that the family income supplement had been reported on and that before July he would bring forward proposals which would beef up that supplement.  That, too, is to be welcomed.  While it is a good scheme, it has not been properly taken up.  There should be a widening of the limits to bring in more people.</P>
    <P>Flexibility was mentioned by a number of speakers from both sides of the House.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="257" /> This is the hallmark of this Minister.  In quite a number of instances his assistance was called for.  I remember athletes who were going abroad to compete in the Olympic Games and who were on unemployment assistance or benefit and the Minister stepped in to allow them to continue to receive their social welfare payments. Again, people willing to take up part-time educational courses were helped by the Minister on occasion.</P>
    <P>The problem is he is restricted by legislation. That is something which he and future Ministers will have to constantly review to see where they can put a little more flexibility into the scheme.  Rather than Deputies or the general public having to contact the Minister to put something right, perhaps we should be looking to devolve more power to the local employment centres.  The people there could make the decisions on the spot, rather than having to do a lot of paper work to correct the situation.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies mentioned emigration and there is no doubt that this House is united on that problem.  This is something with which the country nearly always has had to live and despite our efforts in the past, we have not put it right.  People follow capital.  I am not being political about this, but during the time of the last Government there was a black hole and a great deal of money flowed out of the country.  In England one can see people do follow capital, from the north to the south where the jobs and capital are.  Since coming into power this Government have seen the black hole phenomenon disappear. Money has come back into the country and while things have not picked up as quickly as we would like, capital has come back and the job figures are taking a turn for the better.  The most recent job figures make pleasant reading for everybody.</P>
    <P>A number of Opposition speakers mentioned that the Government were not doing enough with regard to emigration. The DION people were given £500,000 this year.  These are the committees abroad dealing with emigration. Again, the Government should be given credit for that.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="258" /> Turning to a number of items in the Bill, the increases in social welfare payments are very welcome.  They bring up the basic level of unemployment assistance to £47, which is quite an increase. People are looking forward to July when that increase will come into operation. The new child related tax exemption will help those on low incomes.  It is a hallmark of the Government that they are trying to do whatever they can for such people.  These people feel that they are losing out as a result of having a low wage and say that they would be better off on social welfare benefit.</P>
    <P>All parties in the House would agree with the introduction of the widower's and deserted husband's assistance.  This is long overdue.  I note that the Minister is now talking about a lone parent allowance. This is something which should be looked at.  It will cut down the number of allowances at present in the system.  As Deputy McGahon has said, we have one of the most sophisticated social welfare systems in the world.  The Commission on Social Welfare stated that we should make an effort to cut down on the various allowances, of which there is a plethora. This would simplify and codify the social welfare system.  The Minister is looking constantly at this area and should be complimented on his efforts.</P>
    <P>Doing away with the rural rate of unemployment assistance is to be lauded by all parties.  I do not know why it existed in the first place.  Probably there was an historical reason for it.  This brings equalisation into the system.  I was looking at the figures of medical card holders recently.  The greatest increase in the number of medical cards was in Dublin, Wicklow, Kildare and Louth.  More rural areas showed decreases in the number of medical cards held.  That would lead one to believe that the people in the urban areas suffer slightly more than people in rural areas.  Maybe it is because there is an upturn in the agricultural sector. While I welcome the equalisation of the two rates the figures show that people in urban areas are suffering more than their rural counterparts.</P>
    <P>I agree with the efforts of the Minister <Col N="259" /> in the Bill in regard to deserted wives. How will it all work in practice?  It will take one or two years before we know because I visualise a situation where a court order is made which could be flouted.  The Minister and his Department will have to keep a constant eye on that aspect.  I also welcome the exemption on fostering allowances in regard to means testing because health boards have had trouble in getting foster parents for children because they would lose financially.</P>
    <P>The appeals procedure was mentioned by a number of speakers.  I am not happy at the fact that Deputies or the public cannot make contact with appeals officers.  This should be allowed because, otherwise, it will lead to complicated bureaucracy.  When people have to go on supplementary welfare allowance, there is quite a difference in health board areas. In some areas a person is entitled to quite a lot whereas other areas are restricted. It depends on the funding of the health board and the Minister for Health and the Minister for Social Welfare should look at this matter.</P>
    <P>The free electricity allowance scheme has been mentioned by a number of speakers.  I note that the Minister will allow a carry-over of units, which is welcome. However, the area causing most concern is where old people are not entitled to the allowance if someone is living with them.  I know the Minister is concerned about this and something should be done as quickly as possible for old people who are worried that they will not receive the allowance when someone is living with them.  Perhaps the Minister would permit the allowance to be paid if the person living with the recipient was over 80 years of age.</P>
    <P>A number of speakers, particularly on the so-called Left, referred to the recommendations of the Commission on Social Welfare.  However, many of the recommendations have been implemented over the last while but some Deputies have been quite selective in highlighting some aspects of the report.  One of the recommendations was that a child dependant <Col N="260" /> allowance should be payable to all long term recipients until the child reaches 21 years, where he or she is in full time education.</P>
    <P>In the Bill before us we are talking about an age limit of 19 years and the Minister has indicated that he hopes to extend that to 21 years.  Another recommendation was that the self-employed should be brought within the scope of social insurance and that has been done. The commission also recommended that all public servants should be liable to the standard rate of PRSI and the intention is to do that.  They also recommended that social insurance should be extended to ministers of religion and that is being done.  The list goes on and on.  The report said that the child dependant allowance should be rationalised and the Minister has made great progress in that area over the last three years.  Another recommendation was that children's allowances should be improved and that there should be differentiation according to the age of children, with higher payments for older children and larger families.  The Minister has made that effort in the Bill.  For people to say that we have not done enough in the area of social welfare does not stand up to scrutiny.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill, it is my third time to speak on a Social Welfare Bill since coming into this House.  We have made great strides in every Bill and the Minister and the Government are to be complimented. The Government made it quite clear that, while they will make savings in other areas, they will not cut down on social welfare.  I fully approve of that policy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianSwift" hpid="Mr. Swift Mr. Swift">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Swift</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister for Social Welfare and the Government for this latest Social Welfare Bill which brings a further improvement in the social welfare system.  It was introduced &mdash; like the previous one &mdash; against a background in which the Government are taking great steps to right an economy which was rapidly going downhill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I disagree with Deputy McGahon's remark that there is no poverty and that, to some extent, people are living in a <Col N="261" /> social welfare paradise.  You cannot live on unemployment assistance or a widow's pension in a social welfare paradise.  You may not be on a starvation diet, as is the case in other parts of the world, but you certainly are not living in paradise.  The whole reason for introducing a Social Welfare Bill is to look after those people and to acknowledge that things are difficult for them.  They need State assistance and the better off people in the community can look after them.  Having said all that, I am sceptical at times when some Members of the House &mdash; admittedly a tiny minority &mdash; work themselves into a paroxysm of socialistic fervour and say that we should allocate even more resources which we do not have or imply that we should further tax the hard pressed PAYE worker to provide greater benefits.  This is not practical politics and in the long term it would not work.</P>
    <P>I welcome the general increases as they have at least kept pace with inflation and, in many cases, have exceeded it.  I particularly welcome the increases for the people on long-term unemployment assistance.  A single person will get an increase of about £5 per week which is a very big increase, especially taken in line with a similar increase last year.  There is no doubt that the long-term unemployed are being catered and cared for more by this Government than by any Coalition Government we have had up to now.</P>
    <P>The abolition of the difference between the rural and urban unemployment assistance rates which had not changed since 1934 will be welcomed by all of us whose constituencies have a rural content.  This may have had some relevance in 1934 but it certainly has none in 1989.  There have been calls over many years for the abolition of this difference, and once more it was left to a Fianna Fáil Government to abolish the difference. This is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the initiative taken by the Minister, Deputy Woods, to provide for deserted husbands and widowers. Many of us have repeatedly called for provision to be made for these people. There was no logical reason for a Government who provide assistance for widows <Col N="262" /> and deserted wives &mdash; rightly so &mdash; not to acknowledge the role being played by husbands who have lost their wives or whose wives have deserted them.  They need assistance just as much as women. I welcome the initiative the Minister has taken in that respect.</P>
    <P>The Minister is to be complimented for extending the occupational injuries scheme to members of the Garda Síochána. We often compliment the men and women of the Garda Síochána for the magnificent job they do but compliments cannot match an expression of practical concern.  The Minister has demonstrated his practical concern by providing that members of the force who are injured or become ill in the course of their duty qualify for disablement benefit after a period of 26 weeks.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the initiative to allow those in receipt of unemployment assistance take up part-time education courses which I hope in due course will enable them to avail of employment opportunities without having to look over their shoulders to see if some over-zealous official is seeking to disqualify them.  I hope at some stage in the future the Minister might look at the position of those on unemployment assistance, with children in full-time education.  Regardless of the age of their children, parents should be allowed to claim for them if they are in full-time education.</P>
    <P>We all welcomed the introduction of the social employment and jobsearch schemes but to be practical anyone over the age of 50 should not be compelled to take part in a scheme or to take a course against their wishes.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provisions in this Bill especially those which relate to people in receipt of long-term unemployment assistance.  I compliment the Government and the Minister for making further improvements to our social welfare system which will be welcomed not just by almost every Member of this House but by the general public.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few points I would like to make in relation to this Bill. What has impressed Members most as <Col N="263" /> regards the performance of the Minister is that he has applied common sense in tackling a number of the problems which have arisen, but there are two areas where he has to continue to try to make progress.  First, he has to try to simplify the existing system by introducing more uniform rates.  At present there are far too many allowances, and there is a need to eliminate any abuse or fraud in the system.  Secondly, there is a need to integrate the social welfare system with other areas of Government expenditure targeted at similar groups.  In particular there is a need for greater co-ordination in the activities of certain sections of the Department of Health and the Department of Social Welfare as there is duplication at present and there is a need for greater co-ordination in the activities of the Department of Labour and the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
      <P>In relation to the activities of the Department of Labour and the Department of Social Welfare, there is a great need to synchronise the activities of Manpower and employment offices and to ensure that they work from the same record system.  At present they operate on different record systems.  When first established employment offices were meant to cater for a small number of unemployed people in rural centres of population.  At one time these centres would have catered for up to 300 people living within a seven mile radius but now they may have to cater for anything up to 2,000 people.  Unfortunately, this is a sign of the times.</P>
      <P>In relation to the operation of the social services in health board areas, there is a need for the Department of Health and the Department of Social Welfare to work more closely together so that the social welfare system would not be seen, as it is at present, as a mechanism for the payment of various allowances but rather as forming part of an effective and streamlined caring network.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Probably the most important point I have heard in this debate was one raised by Deputy Dermot Ahern &mdash; and this is a hobby horse of mine.  He said there is <Col N="264" /> a need to regionalise the activities of the Department of Social Welfare, particularly the processing of applications for unemployment assistance which is the lowest rate of payment.  In my constituency a person goes to the employment office in Tullamore to sign on.  Then he is assessed by an official and the file is sent to Dublin.  A decision is made which is relayed to Tullamore, and it is then made known to the person concerned.  If the person wishes to appeal he has to return to the office in Tullamore with the file, which is then sent to Athlone, following which a social welfare officer from Athlone comes to assess the person once more.  The file is again sent to Dublin for a decision.  It is sent back to Athlone and then on to Tullamore. Having gone through this great maze of bureaucratic nonsense we probably end up with the same decision that was made six or seven weeks previously.</P>
    <P>This is absolutely ridiculous.  There should be no need in the event of an appeal for the file to be sent to an appeals officer in Dublin, but what is most galling is that I, as a public representative, cannot pick up a phone to contact an appeals officer in the Department of Social Welfare to ask him to justify a decision made.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I ask the Minister to take a look at this area where there appears to be very little communication between public representatives and those who make decisions within the Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose Deputy Cowen's contribution was in a way a model in that in such a short time he could include so much.  He pinpointed a couple of very fundamental, practical suggestions relating to simplifying the system, dealing with fraud and controlling measures in the system.  That will be one of my main objectives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards integrating social welfare with health and labour I regard that as a very important development which I will pursue as actively as I can.  As the Deputy may know, we are doing a great deal of <Col N="265" /> work at the moment on the supplementary welfare allowance system but so many community welfare officers are doing so many different things that difficulties are created.  However, that is being examined and we are regarding it as a priority.</P>
    <P>I am also very keen to regionalise and localise the system and everything is being developed in that direction.  There are many implications in that, and the Deputy can be assured we are following it through.  There is disability benefit direct entry in quite a few places around the country and, as the Deputy said, it can be handled locally.  This is far more efficient and effective, and eliminates waste of time and duplication of work.  Appeals for unemployment assistance would be part of the whole localisation of the schemes.  I am glad Deputy Swift mentioned the Garda and the occupational injuries scheme which has been welcomed by the Garda.  It is an important development for them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ahern covered quite a few points which I will take on board, including the question of flexibility.  Deputy Boylan put some very interesting points to us in relation to the FIS.  He spoke about the payment through the employer.  I would be reluctant to make these payments through the employer because the employer would have this information and there could be a danger the wages would not increase <i>pro rata.</i> There is a benefit in paying it directly to the individual, but I admit there could be other ways of doing that and I appreciate the point made by Deputy Boylan.  He also raised the question of the free fuel scheme.  The operation of the free fuel scheme in rural areas and the regulations which are there at the moment are longstanding. There is no change in them, but I appreciate the point he made that people in rural areas should be treated in the same way as people in urban areas. We can look at that next year.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGahon talked about 16 year olds and said if we gave the money under a social welfare scheme we might keep them away from crime.  The danger with <Col N="266" /> this is that it could bring many other young people out of the education system.  That is the great concern here but the Minister for Education and the Minister for Labour have jointly set up the Youthreach programme designed to help people who have stepped out of the educational system at that early age.  We will see how that goes.  There is a major investment in that area at present.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGahon was also worried about unemployment assistance becoming too attractive and the danger of people taking unemployment assistance and doing nixers.  We will try to maintain control to prevent that.  On the other hand, the improvements in the FIS will be very important when people are near the margin.  I bring to the Deputy's attention the child related tax exemption scheme, a novel scheme introduced in the budget which the Minister for Finance will bring in with the Finance Bill. People at work on lower incomes will get considerable benefits from it.  A total of £20 million is being devoted to help to offset the difficulties the Deputy sees in that area.</P>
    <P>I thank the Deputies generally for their contributions.  As usually happens with social welfare, their contributions were very wide-ranging and searching and some very useful ideas were put forward. The measures included in this Bill represent an unprecedented improvement in the level of income maintenance support provided by my Department and will improve significantly the position of those depending on social welfare, particularly families.  The approach I have adopted is to concentrate the available resources on improving the basic levels of payment in line with the recommendations in the Report of the Commission on Social Welfare and the ESRI poverty report.</P>
    <P>The 1988 and 1989 budgets provided significant increases for those dependent on the lowest levels of payment.  These increases are not reflected in the results of the ESRI survey, which was taken before last year's increases came into operation and, obviously, before this year's increases came into operation. Two years' increases are in operation <Col N="267" /> since the ESRI survey was carried out.  It is important that people who are going to comment on this area recognise that fact and at least comment in a factual way.  I am talking about comments made publicly.  Many Deputies have recognised the major improvements I have brought in&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It has been suggested in this debate that even large percentage increases are of little value when the basic income is low.  Let me provide some examples of what the increases mean in cash terms for those dependent on social welfare.  Let us look at pre-July 1988 and post-July 1989.  Let us consider a widower on supplementary welfare allowance with five children.  I mention this kind of case because the ESRI study showed that families, large families in particular, were among those who were doing worst in the current circumstances and they mentioned particular categories which have been mentioned by the Deputies.  For a widower on supplementary welfare allowance with five children last year's increases and this year's increases amount to £41.85 per week.  A married couple on supplementary welfare allowance with five children have an increase of £21.25 per week.  A married couple on long term rural unemployment assistance with five children will have an increase of £22.45 per week.  A married couple on long term urban unemployment assistance with five children will have an increase of £20.65 per week.  A married couple on unemployment benefit with five children will have an increase of <Col N="268" /> £10.15 per week.  This last instance is indicative of the general range of increases.</P>
      <P>A striking feature of the examples I have given is the narrowing of the gap between the various schemes in the levels of payment provided to families with an equal number of children.  For example, prior to July 1988 the payments being made to a five child family ranged from £75 to £117.20, a gap of £42.20 per week. Taking account of the measures included in this Bill, the payments being made range from £115.30 to £127, a gap of only £11.30 per week as compared with the previous £42.20.</P>
      <P>Another way to look at these figures is to consider the increase in real terms taking again pre-July 1988 and post-July 1989.  What is the increase in real terms allowing for the effects of inflation in the meantime?  For the widower on supplementary welfare allowance the increase after allowing for inflation is £35.90 per week.  For a married couple on supplementary welfare allowance with five children the increase is £13.80 per week.  For the married couple on long term rural unemployment assistance, again with five children, the increase is £14.60 per week.  For the married couple on long term urban unemployment assistance with five children the increase is £12.70 per week.  Those are the increases after allowing for inflation in that period. I mention them to emphasise the fact that the increases are substantial in themselves, taking into consideration the consumer price index and the rate of inflation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other significant improvements made during the past two years include major advances in the streamlining of payments generally.  The number of rates payable in respect of adult dependants has been reduced from ten to six and the rates payable in respect of dependent children have been reduced from 36 to 12; the introduction of new social assistance schemes for widowers and deserted husbands; the introduction of a pre-retirement allowance; the abolition of the lower rural rate of unemployment assistance at a cost of £7.25 million in a full <Col N="269" /> year; an increase from 18 to 19 in the age limit up to which increases are payable for dependent children, where the child is in full time education, as a step towards increasing it to 21; the extension of social insurance to the self-employed and the extension of cover for occupational injuries to the gardaí.</P>
    <P>To a large extent these improvements have been made possible by the success of a programme which I initiated to eliminate fraud and abuse in the social welfare system.  During the past two years alone, this programme has resulted in savings in excess of £92 million.  I am glad to hear Deputies acknowledge the importance of the need to vigorously combat fraud.  At the same time I share their concern that we must not target everyone on social welfare as guilty.  The best way to ensure that this does not happen is to have effective measures in place which are seen to work by all.</P>
    <P>In 1987 I brought in new legislation compelling employers to keep records of wages paid to employees, showing the amounts paid and the period in respect of which the payment was made.  Cases are now being processed through the courts where employers have failed to comply.  Indeed, a number of cases have been dealt with by the courts and employers have been convicted and in some cases fined up to £740 for breaches of the regulations.</P>
    <P>Last year I brought in legislation whereby employers in the construction, security, cleaning and forestry industries are required to furnish me with the details of all new employees taken on since 1 January 1989.  For the month of January my Department were notified of the commencement of 528 new employees and 23 of these were referred for further investigation. These investigations are underway at present.</P>
    <P>Deputy Durkan raised the matter of including cases where people receive State contracts and suggested that we should look for lists of employees.  I have noted what he said in that respect and I regard the steps we have taken to date as our first steps in this area.  We will see how we get on and I would certainly be <Col N="270" /> prepared to extend them further, once we have gained the experience of operating them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bell referred to the activities of the special investigation unit of my Department.  I wish to make it very clear at the outset that my Department do not under any circumstances make use of paid informers or spies in the course of their work.  It is very easy to castigate the good work done by this unit and other social welfare officers.  That gets us nowhere.</P>
    <P>For the record, the social welfare officer has considerable powers of entry and inquiry.  If premises are being used as a place of employment then the social welfare officer has the right of entry and inspection of employment records.  As already indicated, these powers are proving to be invaluable in the fight against fraud and abuse.  I do not think that this House would have it otherwise.</P>
    <P>The social welfare officer does not have deciding powers.  He cannot cut off any-one's social welfare entitlement.  When information is received about a person, that is then investigated and a report of the outcome of that investigation is furnished to a deciding officer.  The deciding officer will decide on entitlement on the basis of that report.</P>
    <P>Whether it is a report to a deciding officer or a submission for prosecution, the social welfare officer will in the course of the investigation put the allegation fully to the client, ask him whatever questions are relevant and invite him to make any statements or observations he may wish.  Where an offence is suspected the suspect is made aware of the fact and of the nature of the offence and that he is not obliged to say anything unless he wishes to do so but that anything he may say will be taken down and may be tendered in evidence.  Before signing any statement, the statement is read back to the client so that he knows what he is signing.  These procedures are in accordance with Judges Rules and are operated within advice received from time to time from the Chief State Solicitor's Office.</P>
    <P>Likewise appeals officers and deciding officers are required to operate within <Col N="271" /> the rules of natural justice.  There are procedures for the handling of appeals and clients are fully informed at their hearing of the case against them.</P>
    <P>The worthwhile effect of the steps I have taken to combat fraud and abuse of the social welfare system can be seen from the fact that savings attributed to measures to control such abuse amount to some £93 million to date.  I have been able to plough this back into the improvement of the system through higher payments and special measures directed at those in greatest need.</P>
    <P>I share the concern expressed by a number of Deputies about the position of part-time workers under the social insurance system.  This was raised by Deputies Bell, Flaherty and Barnes, among others.  I am examining at present the question of changing the current criteria for insurability so as to provide better coverage for workers in this situation. I am also considering the possibility or desirability of having an earnings criterion.</P>
    <P>Numerous Deputies spoke about the question of flexibility.  Deputy Noel Dempsey spoke at length on this matter and the desirability of the Minister for Social Welfare having power to make appropriate regulations.  Deputies Harney, Wallace, Durkan, Stafford, Flaherty, Barnes, Dennehy and Ahern all mentioned aspects of the question of flexibility.  This question of flexibility within the unemployment schemes is one that has concerned me for some time.  As Deputies know, I have already tried to introduce the greatest possible flexibility into the current system.  I have provided opportunities for the unemployed to take holidays just like anyone else.  As Deputies have pointed out, the unemployed must be treated with dignity and they should be allowed the same chances as anyone else.  I have allowed unemployed persons with the talents to get on a national team to participate in events outside the State, not just the Olympics, without losing their entitlement. I have encouraged their participation in education courses so as to <Col N="272" /> enable them to remain in the labour market.</P>
    <P>I am concerned to ensure that the criteria of availability are not used to force the unemployed into a situation of being unable to do anything without running the risk of losing their entitlement.  We have to be realistic in our application of these criteria and I will continue to keep the situation under review and where necessary will introduce any amendments to the legislation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bell spoke of the plight of the homeless in our society.  In addition to the normal State support services for the homeless the Government have introduced a number of special measures in this area.  Last year a special additional allocation of £3 million was approved to finance the provision of accommodation for homeless persons by voluntary organisations over a three year period.  In addition, a special grant of £50,000 was made to Focus Point in recognition of the significant contribution which that organisation has made in tackling the plight of homeless persons in Dublin.  Arising from these measures voluntary activity in this area has increased and as a consequence the Government have provided a further £1 million this year for accommodation for homeless persons.  That will be dispensed by the Minister for the Environment.</P>
    <P>Assistance is also available to voluntary organisations dealing with the problems of the homeless under the scheme of grants to voluntary organisations which is operated by my Department. I am pleased that a sum of £750,000 has again been made available this year to assist voluntary organisations in their efforts.  This scheme has over the years provided valuable assistance to very many voluntary organisations.  Last year £86,000 was made available specifically to assist projects dealing with the needs of the homeless, including grants of £20,000 each to the Catholic Social Services Conference towards the provision of a food centre for the homeless in the north inner city and to the Teenage Care Development Trust towards the provision of a night shelter for homeless children.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="273" /> Apart from projects specifically related to the homeless I am also providing substantial resources for voluntary organisations operating in other areas.  I would like to mention in particular the further sum of £500,000 which has been allocated to the Society of St. Vincent de Paul to allow the society to undertake, in consultation with my Department, a major development programme aimed at creating employment opportunities and continuing the programme of home management and personal development courses.  As Deputies will know I made a sum of £100,000 available last year specifically for these courses which were extremely worthwhile.  Those courses are under way and are proving successful.  A number of Deputies, including Deputy Bernard Durkan in particular, mentioned the problem of home management as being a major area of concern and I agree.  I think the measures we are taking to assist in this area are very important and will make a significant contribution. I would also like to mention the special sum of £100,000 which has been provided for the Samaritans.  These measures clearly demonstrate the Government's commitment to assisting voluntary organisations in a worthwhile way in tackling the problems of the less well-off in our society.</P>
    <P>Various Deputies mentioned the need for separate payments and Deputy Flaherty suggested that we should make the fuel allowances payable to the dependent spouse.  I will consider that suggestion in the context of re-arranging separate payments.  The pre-retirement allowance was referred to by Deputy O'Keeffe and others.  Deputy O'Keeffe suggested that the age limit should be reduced to 55 years.  I should like to tell the Deputy that we are starting at 60 years but we will monitor the scheme in the coming years and keep the Deputy's suggestion in mind.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wyse expressed fears that gardaí could lose out on the occupational injuries scheme.  I should like to assure him that he need have no such fears.  The Garda compensation Acts only cover the gardaí for malicious injuries.  We will be <Col N="274" /> covering all injuries sustained by them in the course of their work, and that has been welcomed by the Garda.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bell referred to the free fuel scheme for old age pensioners and mentioned the case of an old age pensioner who has a son drawing unemployment assistance.  He asked if the fact that the son was drawing unemployment assistance would preclude the pensioner from benefiting under the free fuel scheme.  I should like to tell the Deputy that in our package this year we have included £2.4 million to eliminate such anomalies.  That problem will be resolved by next October. The anomaly has existed in the regulations for many years and I am sure the Deputy will welcome our moves to eliminate it.</P>
    <P>Deputies Dennehy, O'Keeffe and Barnes referred to the <i>pro rata</i> benefit for mixed insurance.  Those Deputies, while welcoming the <i>pro rata</i> pensions introduced so far, were anxious that those with mixed insurance should be looked after as soon as possible.  I am anxious to tackle that matter speedily and I have asked the board to deal with it.  I understand that they are preparing a report which will include the question of mixed insurance.  I will consider that matter as soon as the report is presented to me.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies referred to the prescribed relative allowance and had suggestions to make in regard to the carer's allowance.  I should like to tell them that that allowance is paid by the Department of Health.  However, I have sympathy for their views and I will bear them in mind.  It is important to point out that there are cost implications involved.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCartan referred to the Darndale report which gave details of the outgoings and income of a number of families for the period 21 January to 31 January last.  He referred to two adults and three children living on unemployment assistance.  The cost given for food for the week was £55.71; for cigarettes and tobacco, £17.60; coal, £10; loan repayments, £7; life assurance, £5; newspapers £2.50; rent, £2.50; toiletries, £2.36; bus fares, £2.25; bingo, £2; detergents and so on, £1.67; piped TV, £1.30; <Col N="275" /> clothes, 69p; medicines, 65p making a total cost of £111.23.  That left that family with a surplus of 57p, an indication of how tight the margin is for those people.</P>
    <P>I should like to point out to the Deputy that that family would receive child benefit. I accept that it is used on a monthly basis to pay ESB bills and so on and that, consequently, it is not taken into consideration in the weekly income. However, that would increase the overall surplus to £10.97.  The increases provided for in the Bill before us will mean that the income of such a family will rise to £120 per week leaving a surplus of £19.17. That is an indication that we are helping such families.  I accept that the increases will not overcome the problems but we are helping them.</P>
    <P>In my reply I have answered most of the points raised in the debate.  We could spend a lot of time dealing with all the points raised but my time is limited.  I should like to pay tribute to those who contributed to the debate for their wide ranging and incisive speeches.  It is a pity that the media, and the public, do not have an opportunity to listen to the contributions made in the House on social welfare issues and are not aware of the impact they have on our schemes.  I try to implement many worthwhile suggestions made in the course of these debates within the resources available.  However, I will bear in mind the suggestions made in the debate.</P>

      <P>Deputy Joe <Col N="276" /> Sherlock gave me notice of his intention to raise on the Adjournment the subject matter of the situation that has arisen in the Cork region as a result of the shortfall in funding to the health board with particular reference to the Mallow General Hospital.  The matter is in order.  The Deputy has some 20 minutes to present his case.  The Minister has ten minutes to reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset let me thank you for giving me the opportunity on this Adjournment Debate to raise the vital issues which are confronting the health board and particularly the people of north Cork at present.  At the most recent meeting of the health board the chief executive officer painted a grim picture of the board's situation.  Facing a deficit of £3 million, its overdraft sanction of £2.8 million was exhausted and so there was no way forward for the executive of the board but to cut general hospital services and this, in effect, means that people in need of acute general hospital services cannot be provided for.  This particularly affects elderly people, children who are in need of ear, nose and throat treatment and it affects the orthopaedic service where there is such a long waiting list for implants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will now refer to the Mallow situation in the context of the budget allocated to the board.  I am calling upon the Minister at this time to satisfy me on the conflict that exists between replies which I have received here and the replies given to me by the board executive.  The Minister today advised me that the Southern Health Board are the responsible body to decide within their allocation the level of resources to fund Mallow hospital.  In the year 1987 the Mallow General Hospital services were cut by 25 per cent. That meant a figure in excess of £235,000. Prior to that the executive of the board proposed to take out Mallow as an acute general hospital and that was rejected by a vote of the Southern Health Board by 25 votes to one.  Yet when it came to allocating the budget for the area hospitals we found that in that year the budget for Mallow was reduced by 25 per <Col N="277" /> cent and that was an unjust, inequitable decision by the executive of the board. The figures are there for the Minister to see.  I would ask him to explain why such a massive deficit should be proposed for Mallow.</P>
    <P>I come next to a question that I have failed to get satisfactory answers to for some time.  On 27 October 1987 the Department of Health notified the chief executive officer of the Southern Health Board as follows:</P>
    <P>I am directed by the Minister for Health to state that the 1988 level of net expenditure (i.e. gross expenditure less minor income from patients etc.) approved for your Board under Section 31 of the Health Act 1970 is £125.880 million.</P>
    <P>Following on that, during the year there were various amounts added to it for pay increases and so forth.  That is what the statement said.  In my interpretation and in the interpretation of others that is a revenue expenditure for the Southern Health Board.  At the end of the same document it says that the allocation notified in paragraph 1 included a specific amount of £0.75 million to allow for the commencement of a phasing back into the system of beds in the Cork Regional Hospital.  Conflict No. 1 arose when I looked at the figures supplied to me by the board in 1989 and found that the finance officer of the Southern Health Board gave out a document dated 9 January 1989 and in that document he said:</P>
    <P>For comparison purposes, the total allocation for 1989 is £131,820,000.</P>
    <P>That is before the additional £800,000 came in and that was 9 January 1989. He said that compared with the revised allocation of £131,400,000 for 1988 or a net increase of £420,000.  The same document shows that there were revisions there; there was the refund of drugs, writing off of loans and pay awards etc. When they came in it totalled £3,280,000; but the figure from which the finance officer subtracted the required figure was £130,600,000.  At the next meeting, I asked the chief executive officer of the board to explain that anomaly.  Unfortunately <Col N="278" /> he could not explain it but after some hugger muggering with the finance officer, the finance officer said that there was no problem, that it was for the CT scanner for the regional hospital.  I asked him if £800,000 was the correct figure and he said yes, that he could have told me that earlier on.  I put a question to the Minister for Health on 14 February 1989. The Minister for Health, Deputy O'Hanlon, advised me that the total cost of providing the CT scanner for the Cork Regional Hospital in 1988 was £647,500 and that the cost was met out of funds specially allocated.  At the same time I asked the question as to whether there was a capital allocation for the board and was advised by the chief executive officer of the board that there had been no capital allocation for eight years for works. I got a reply from the Minister on 14 February 1989 when he said that an additional capital payment to the board for 1988 amounted to £1,195,000.</P>
    <P>While I am dealing with the subject of conflicts which have bothered me very much, let me refer to another figure.  This again is a reply which I got from the Minister on 2 November 1988.  I asked the Minister if his attention had been drawn to the proposals from the management of the Southern Health Board to locate maternity services for the Cork region on a site at the Erinville Eye, Ear and Throat Hospital which involved capital investment and the reply was:</P>
    <P>There is agreement in principle that maternity services in Cork should be located on a single campus.  The possibility of concentrating facilities on the St. Finbarr's site was examined by a committee representative of the Department and the Southern Health Board.  However, the capital cost of that option was considerably greater than developing a maternity service on the Erinville/Eye, Ear and Throat Hospital site.  The Eye, Ear and Throat Hospital will be made available to the Southern Health Board following the transfer of ophthalmic services to the Cork Regional Hospital which is taking place at present.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="279" /> The basis of the reply was that the capital cost of retaining St. Finbarr's was greater than what was originally proposed. That reply from the Minister was dated 2 November 1988.</P>
    <P>On 29 November 1988 the Southern Health Board passed a motion on the maternity services in Cork city to the effect that a general hospitals committee recommended that a comparative feasibility study be carried out at St. Finbarr's by an alternative design team regarding a central maternity unit for Cork city bearing in mind that the present buildings of Erinville/Eye, Ear and Throat Hospital could be sold.  That was on 29 November and yet the reply given on 2 November was that the cost would be too high.</P>
    <P>I asked the deputy chief executive officer of the board, Mr. Christy Walsh, why I received such a reply on 2 November when the alternative comparative feasibility study had not been carried out at that stage and he said the Minister had no figures before him, that he based his reply on builders' estimates of the cost per foot of the building.  The decision to carry out the alternative feasibility study was made by the board on 29 November. I would advise the Minister that there is no record in the Southern Health Board of a motion having being passed giving power to the executive of the board to spend £20,000 on the first study.  No decision had been taken by the board giving that power.  I would like to know where that £20,000 came from.  I would also like to know where the £20,000, or probably more, came from for the alternative feasibility study which has now been carried out.</P>
    <P>The people of Mallow are continually crying out for efficiency in the health board area and for recognition for the valuable work being done in Mallow hospital.  The hospital which exceeded its budget by £1 million in 1988 got special recognition from the Department this year.  The letter of allocation states that in the determination of the allocation now notified the Minister has recognised the key role that Cork Regional Hospital <Col N="280" /> must play in the provision of acute hospital services.  Accordingly, the allocation referred to provides for the provision of the average 1988 level of services.  If the average level of services was to be provided why was there a reduction of £750,000 in the budget for the regional hospital, the amount that had been added to it in 1988?  Why does the Minister not recognise that there is in excess of £600,000 in charges outstanding in the regional hospital from 1987 and 1988?  I would also point out to the Minister that there is a figure of £840,000 &mdash; the health board's figure &mdash; outstanding in health contributions.  There are also youth employment and income levies but they have nothing to do with the revenue of the board.  The executive of the board have blatantly refused to be efficient in the carrying out of their duties and they find no difficulty in practically closing Mallow hospital, the most efficient hospital in the health board area.</P>
    <P>I would refer the Minister to a statement made by the consultant staff of Cork Regional Hospital on 1 March 1988. They claimed that an income in excess of £2 million could have been generated in 1987 from patients who were treated privately in Cork Regional Hospital.  The deputy chief executive officer tried to refute that allegation but he made a very bad job of it.  The consultants made that statement and they should either substantiate or withdraw it.</P>
    <P>In 1987 the Southern Health Board rejected by 25 votes to one the closure of Mallow hospital.  The people of north Cork have raised £150,000 for capital works in the hospital.  Last year alone £56,000 was collected by these people.  I would ask the Minister to recognise that Mallow General Hospital is an efficient hospital serving a population of 72,000 people.  In excess of 3,280 operations were performed there last year, 15,000 people attended the casualty department and 8,000 attended the outpatient department.</P>
    <P>In 1980 Mallow General Hospital which is now fighting for survival played a heroic, life-saving role after the Buttevant rail disaster.  The Taoiseach, <Col N="281" /> Deputy Charles Haughey, paid tribute to the professionalism, skill and care shown by the staff.  In 1987-88 he accepted the recommendation of Comhairle na nOspidéal, who had carried out a thorough investigation, to upgrade Mallow General Hospital to a double consultant hospital.  On that occasion when the Taoiseach visited Mallow with the present Minister for Finance, Deputy Reynolds, they were very loud in their praise of the role that Mallow General Hospital played in the aftermath of the Buttevant rail disaster.</P>
    <P>The people of north Cork are entitled to general hospital services.  The sociological argument is that the hospital is within easy access of many people who wish to visit relatives and friends.  The people demand that Mallow hospital receives a fair budget and that the number of beds be increased to at least 80.  Even though that may not be done immediately it is what we should aim for. There should be adequate provision for the accident and emergency department. The Minister should direct the executive of the Southern Health Board to recognise the democratic decisions of the board and also the authentic voice of the people of north Cork who need general hospital services in their area.</P>
    <P>The reduction in the number of staff and beds in that hospital has been so great that the health board executive will decide that the hospital is not viable.  I have been told by people of good standing in the community that they will back the hospital financially.  If the community decide that, as a result of the motion passed, that the hospital be retained as a double consultant hospital and that negotiations be entered into between the Minister for Health, the Southern Health Board and the staff of the hospital about its future staffing and financial provisions, will the Minister give me that assurance when in turn, I can assure him he will get value for money?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with a few of the points raised by Deputy Sherlock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the maternity services in <Col N="282" /> Cork, I should say there is not any conflict between the reply given by me to a question in this House and the information furnished to the Deputy by the Southern Health Board.  Officials of my Department and of the Southern Health Board examined the possibility of developing a combined maternity service involving the Erinville Maternity Hospital and the Eye, Ear and Throat Hospital in Cork which would cost £3.2 million.  The Deputy said that the Southern Health Board members themselves, which was their right, decided that they should reexamine the provision of services at St. Finbarr's Hospital.  There is not any conflict there.</P>
    <P>In regard to the difference between the £647,000 for the CAT scanner and the £800,000, I should say that the total of £800,000 is accounted for by the fact that, along with the CAT scanner, other equipment was purchased for the regional hospital in Cork last year &mdash; general and cardiac ultra-sound equipment.  That expenditure brought the figure up to the level of £800,000.</P>
    <P>With regard to the general services within the Southern Health Board area I should say that the members of the health board do have a role to play. Deputy Sherlock referred many times to what the executive were imposing.  The executive are obliged, under the provisions of section 31 of the Health Act, to live within their allocation, a sizeable one in the case of the Southern Health Board, the second largest in the State, whose allocation stands at almost £132 million for 1989.  The members of the health board do have a responsibility and indeed the facility to make their views known and take decisions.  Only when board members are not prepared to take decisions is the chief executive officer charged with the responsibility of taking decisions himself.</P>
    <P>I have said many times in this House that the funding of Mallow Hospital is the responsibility of the Southern Health Board.  My responsibility as far as financing is concerned, is to allocate the amount voted for the health services by this House to the eight health boards and the <Col N="283" /> voluntary health agencies in as fair and equitable a manner as possible.  As a member of the Southern Health Board the Deputy will know that it is a matter for each health board and agency to decide how their funding should be distributed in line with their statutory obligations and priorities.</P>
    <P>As I have said, my Department allocated almost £132 million to the Southern Health Board to fund services in 1989.  It is the responsibility of the Southern Health Board to decide how this substantial amount of money can best be used to provide health services for the people of Cork and Kerry.  As the Deputy will be aware, I met the chairman and senior officials of the Southern Health Board on a number of occasions recently to discuss the board's financial position. I have asked the board to examine all the options open to them to ensure that as comprehensive a service as possible is provided for the people of Cork and Kerry within the allocation of £132 million. Indeed, I have offered my assistance and that of my Department to the board in what I recognise to be the difficult task of maintaining services within their budget.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, I also met a number of delegations from the Mallow area.  At no stage did I suggest that acute hospital services should be discontinued or that Mallow Hospital be closed.</P>
    <P>With regard to allocations to Mallow Hospital I should say that the relevant <Col N="284" /> figure for 1988 was £2.237 million and for 1989 the corresponding figure is £2.160 million.  That figure has been determined by the executive of the Southern Health Board and represents a reduction of £77,000 between the years 1988 and 1989.</P>
    <P>While I have informed the Deputy that at no stage did I ever suggest that Mallow Hospital should discontinue acute hospital services, equally, I am sure the Deputy would agree with me that the role of Mallow Hospital in the overall provision of hospital services in the Cork area needs to be determined and defined. Primarily that is a matter for the Southern Health Board and its members and should be done in conjunction with an examination of the services provided by the other hospitals in Cork.  The Southern Health Board will have the assistance of officials of my Department if there are any points they want to raise with them. But primarily it is a matter for the health board themselves which I am sure Deputy Sherlock, as a member of the Southern Health Board, will know. Indeed I am sure he will have a valuable contribution to make in that respect.</P>

      <P>Suggestions for a block licensing arrangement have been circulating since early 1988 on the understanding that the detailed arrangements would have to be agreed with the regional fishery board concerned and fit in with the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These suggestions have to date been rejected in principle by elements among the protesting groups either on the basis that they would not accept any form of compulsory payment or on the basis that <Col N="115" /> they would not accept any system which would leave the individual angler open to being checked.</P>
    <P>In the last formal meeting between my officials and representatives of the protesting groups, the latter made it quite clear that they would only accept a voluntary system.  The Government will not accept a return to a voluntary system as it failed before and will not work now. While there have been suggestions in the media and elsewhere that the protestors have now come around to accept the principle of a mandatory system, this has not been communicated to my Department and, indeed, it is clear that it is not fully agreed among the protesting groups themselves.</P>
    <P>There are no difficulties on our side in looking at any reasonable proposals within the framework of the legislation. The real difficulty is that the protestors do not appear to be able to agree among themselves on anything other than that the licence should be revoked and replaced by a voluntary system.  This will not be done.</P>
    <P>The issues now involved in this protest go far beyond the sphere of angling. These groups are in effect challenging the Government, as well as the right of the Oireachtas to make laws in this country. The tactics involved, including intimidation and the creation of a climate of fear, are unacceptable in a free society. Particularly objectionable is the cynical and calculated damaging of the tourist sector so as to bring pressure to bear on this House.  In this regard, we must bear in mind that the vast majority of those involved in the protest are at no economic loss &mdash; they have merely opted out of a discretionary recreational activity.  Many of them indeed fished for salmon and sea trout last year while other sectors were left high and dry.</P>
    <P>This conduct is unacceptable to the Government and it should also be unacceptable to all parties in this House. There is an onus on all Deputies and on all responsible community leaders to tell these groups to end this protest now. The sooner that is done, the sooner this <Col N="116" /> protest will be over and a good tourist angling season assured.</P>

      <P>Under the Dumping at Sea Act, 1981, which gives effect to the Oslo Convention and the London Convention relating to the prevention of marine pollution by dumping of wastes, marine incineration may only be allowed by way of a permit for disposal at an agreed site.  There is only one such site in Europe, located in the North Sea.</P>
      <P>Ireland has not in the past used the incineration at sea technology nor has it any plans to do so in the future.  The Department of the Marine are not aware of any permit having been issued by the regulatory authorities of other countries for the incineration at sea of wastes generated in Ireland; neither are the Department aware of any instances of incineration in Irish coastal waters.</P>
      <P>Ireland has supported proposals to terminate incineration at sea at the 1988 Conferences of the Oslo and London Dumping Conventions, to which Ireland is a contracting party.  The Oslo Convention Conference agreed to terminate incineration at sea by contracting parties to the Oslo Convention and within the Oslo Convention area by 31 December 1994.  The London-Convention Conference agreed that contracting parties should re-evaluate incineration at sea of noxious liquid wastes as early in 1992 as possible proceeding towards the termination of this practice by 31 December 1994.</P>

    <P>No licence has yet been issued in respect of the proposed fish farm at Murvey Rock and no licence will issue until I have personally examined the details and the site.  The project has, however, been examined by the aquaculture licence vetting group within my Department.  This group comprises a representative each from the engineering section of my Department, our fisheries research centre, our marine survey office and the Central Fisheries Board.  The group approved in principle of the issue of a licence for the project to go ahead on a pilot scale, subject to a technical survey being carried out by the promoters. Any licence which issues will contain strict conditions regarding the operation of the fish farm and the quantity of fish being kept at the site so as to avoid damage to the environment or to other fish resources in that area and to ensure that tourism amenities are properly safeguarded.</P>

Nevertheless non-compliance on the part of the taxpayer continued and estimates were raised on him under the relevant statutory provisions on 2 March 1989 in the amount of £16,079.96 for the years 1980-81 to 1987-88.  There can be no question of the issue by the Revenue Commissioners of a subcontractor's certificate (Form C2) until the arrears of tax mentioned have been cleared by him.</P>
      <P>It is the policy of the Revenue Commissioners to enforce strictly the statutory provisions governing the tax treatment of payments made to sub-contractors which are contained in section 17 of the Finance Act, 1970, as amended, and the regulations made thereunder.  The commissioners have informed me that there are no grounds for the assumption that the failure of the taxpayer to comply with the statutory requirements has not resulted in loss of tax to the Exchequer.</P>

      <P>All member states party to the International Telecommunications Union &mdash; which, being a specialised agency of the United Nations, effectively embraces all UN member states&mdash;operate statutory licensing or similarly compatible régimes for wireless telegraphy to ensure the orderly and beneficial use of the radio frequency spectrum.</P>
      <P>The radio frequency is a finite natural resource used by a wide variety of services ranging from aeronautical and maritime communications services to mobile communications such as those used by security, emergency and business services, telecommunications links, broadcasting services, space communications, radio astromony, etc.  It is a resource which is shared and which is subject to pollution, through interference between or among services.  Furthermore, radio waves do not stop at national boundaries. Its effective use therefore requires planning and co-operation at international level in the first instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The International Telecommunications Union in Geneva is the primary body concerned with the international regulation of the radio frequency spectrum.  International agreements on the use of the spectrum are reached at administrative conferences held by the ITU.  These agreements become part of the international radio regulations which lay down, often in considerable detail, how individual countries may or may not use the spectrum.  The constraints imposed by these regulations are the price which each country has to pay for <Col N="130" /> the benefits of a measure of international order and co-existence among radio services.</P>
    <P>The Wireless Telegraphy Acts, 1926-1988, which create the statutory licensing scheme for wireless telegraphy apparatus, are essentially the vehicle through which regulation of the spectrum is effected at national level.  By requiring such apparatus to be licensed the regulatory body &mdash; which is the Department of Communications &mdash; ensure that the various services operate in the segment of the spectrum and in accordance with parameters laid down at international level, that the spectrum is used efficiently and that interference between different services or within similar services is avoided both nationally and internationally.</P>

    <P>* Data for 1986 and 1987 is provisional and based on year of registration.</P>
    <P>Source: Reports on Vital Statistics, Central Statistics Office.</P>
    <P>The figures show that, with some fluctuations, the numbers of deaths due to cancer to persons resident in the Eastern Health Board area have increased over the period 1982 to 1987.  It should be noted that the figures given for 1986 and 1987 may change somewhat when the final totals based on year of occurrence become available.</P>
    <P>The comments which I made in reply <Col N="133" /> to a similar question from the Deputy on 9 February this year regarding national trends in cancer mortality apply equally in this case.  The Eastern Health Board area reflects the national and international pattern of a gradual rise in deaths from cancer over several decades. There is, however, no evidence to indicate that this trend has been any more pronounced in the Eastern Health Board area than elsewhere in the country.  In 1982, 33 per cent of all cancer deaths occurred to residents of the Eastern Health Board area; for 1987, the corresponding figure was 32 per cent.</P>
    <P>The toll exacted by cancer on the community cannot be underestimated, and every effort must be made to elucidate its causes and to limit its effects.  One of the best methods of realising these objectives is through the establishment of a National Cancer Registry.  The expert committee set up to advise me on this issue will soon be submitting its report, and I would hope to have the Registry in operation before the end of this year.</P>

The environmental concerns of those authorities would have to be satisfied before planning permission might be granted.  I have no doubt that <Col N="138" /> both the mining interests and the planning authorities concerned will give most careful consideration to all aspects of the mining and processing operation for which application may be made, including the processes to be used in handling the ore.</P>
