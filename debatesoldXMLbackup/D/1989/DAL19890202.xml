    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>When we adjourned the debate last night I was talking about the people's expectation of reasonable reform in the tax system.  People are leaving because of our penal tax system.  This morning I listened to one of our more popular sports people being interviewed. He criticised our tax system.  He mentioned the amount of money it would cost him to stay here and said that some slight reform might have induced him to live here &mdash; and he has a case.  It may be said that these sports people are exceptionally well paid.  That may be so but the vast bulk of it is earned outside the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I have great concern for people like that, I have even greater concern for people who are leaving the country to earn a living in England where there is substantial income to be earned in the building industry.  I can relate the story of a married man who, having lost his job last September, went to London to work in the building industry rather than go on the dole.  He was able to earn £480 sterling per week.  When he came home at <Col N="1182" /> Christmas the Revenue Commissioners informed him that he must pay the difference between the tax paid in England and what would have been due here on the money he was good enough to earn so that he would have something reasonable in his home for the Christmas period. That is unjust and unfair.</P>
    <P>A young person told me the other day that he had worked in this country for 26 weeks from April to September, and then went to England where he earned a considerable amount of money.  When he came home the Revenue Commissioners were looking for the difference in the tax paid.  This must be looked into.  This situation is arising more often now when people find that, come autumn, jobs are closing down.  They could go on the dole and if they do, the strange fact is that they could reclaim the tax they paid for the first half of the year, but because they have the initiative to go outside to seek work and bring home an income to their families they are penalised.</P>
    <P>With regard to the description of the tax reforms as being modest, I would say that is being polite; they are meagre.  The top rate of tax has dropped from 58 per cent to 56 per cent.  Therefore the higher the income the better off people are. That is what happens when one deals in percentages, and until we get away from that the people at the higher end of the scale will always have greater benefit than the people at the lower end.  The standard rate has improved by 3 per cent from 35 per cent to 32 per cent.  Further down the scale there were allowances and other initiatives.  However all of them are taken away immediately when we look at things like mortgage relief and relief on life insurance premiums because now one can claim relief on only 80 per cent of the premium whereas two years ago one could claim 100 per cent.  There is no clawback for people who have mortgages and life assurance premiums &mdash; and those who have not are few and far between. Any young man starting up a home will have a mortgage and he should get recognition for his initiative rather than expecting the local authority to provide him with housing.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1183" /> Then we had the Minister making vague references to the proposal to withdraw child benefit.  Immediately there was an uproar and Government Ministers, one after another, poured cold water on this proposal saying that it was only floated, that it was not a definite proposal and that it would only affect those at the higher end of the scale; but no figure was mentioned in the budget of where the cut off point would be.  The Taoiseach clarified this yesterday by saying that the cut off point would be above £30,000 a year income.  This obviously was not the intention originally, but because it was seen to be such a hot potato and there was so much reaction from the housewife who spends most of her time looking after her children &mdash; and surely she was entitled to this little income without the Government trying to get their hands on it &mdash; it was seen to be a bad development and should never have been suggested.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ellis made great play last night of the fact that we had free fuel and free electricity for our old aged pensioners and various other categories.  I accept that but they are hard got.  I do not know what Deputy Ellis' experience is, but my clinics are taken up with people whose social welfare payments have been cut, causing grave hardship.  These unfortunate people with the minimum income, living in poor homes, look forward to free fuel to keep them warm over the winter months.  Fortunately we had a mild winter.  I believe if this were not so the consequences would have been tragic.</P>
    <P>I have had widowers and old age pensioners coming to me and saying that because they had a bit of ground &mdash; not land but rocks and bushes &mdash; they were expected to provide a certain amount of fuel.  Able bodied people would not be able to go out and get it, and it would not burn in the first place; but these people were assessed as having an amount of ground around the house which could supply a certain amount of fuel.  Nothing could be more miserly.  Nothing could be more disheartening for old people who have given their life to this country.  I <Col N="1184" /> hope there will be a change of heart in our approach to social welfare and that those people who are not in a position to fight their case will not be put through the hardship they are going through at the moment.</P>
    <P>I want to refer now to 1992.  Being a Border Deputy I am particularly concerned. Some five or six months ago the Government were on a hobby horse with Ministers all over the place saying we must prepare for 1992.  There were seminars everywhere.  There was one in Monaghan which was exceptionally well attended.  Minister Brennan came and gave an excellent outline of how we were to approach it.  There were various spokespersons from key businesses all over the county and from senior development organisations all over the country. We were led to believe that this business was being taken seriously.  However, there was not even a line in the budget with regard to 1992.</P>
    <P>In fact, we have turned in the opposite direction.  Instead of trying to achieve harmonisation in the taxation system, duty on petrol &mdash; the one important ingredient so far as the Border areas are concerned &mdash; was increased by 5p per gallon.  If we had taken 5p off we would be heading in the direction of 1992, we would be helping to achieve a balance between prices North and South, but there is more to it than that.  This whole business of cross-Border trade should be addressed now if we are looking forward to 1992 rather than waiting until the night before to do all that will have to be done when the barriers are lowered and people can come here freely and trade, and we will be expected to go abroad and do likewise.  We will have to face a certain amount of competition but we will not be prepared.</P>
    <P>People in the Border areas were living in the expectation that there was light at the end of the tunnel with the approach to 1992 and that their businesses could hold out until then.  They hoped that between now and 1992, with a movement towards the equalisation of the tax system, they would receive benefits and that gradually their incomes would <Col N="1185" /> improve but this has not happened. Nothing has happened to give them any ray of hope and they no longer see any light at the end of the tunnel.  With the announcement of an additional 5p on a gallon of petrol their hopes were dashed. That increase may seem small and people may say it will be absorbed with the forthcoming decrease of 5p a gallon by the oil companies but I do not accept that.  If the reduction by the oil companies, which was to be announced on the eve of the budget, had been announced and if the Government had reduced the price of a gallon of petrol by 5p rather than increasing it, the difference between the price per gallon in the North and that in the South would be less than 60p.</P>
    <P>The question of the Structural Funds also rises.  The Government have apparently decided that they will not devote any more time to setting up regional committees. The people have responded to this.  In the area which I represent &mdash; Cavan-Monaghan, Sligo-Leitrim and Donegal &mdash; a number of meetings have been held.  At least ten meetings were held in Cavan and on each occasion people attended in their hundreds.  Husbands and wives attended in the hope of getting some information.  There is an amount of confusion in regard to this matter.  People believed that 70 or 75 per cent grants would be made available for improving their homes or renovating old dwellings in tourist regions.  They thought they would receive grants of 70 to 75 per cent for setting up mushroom units or for breeding turkeys, chickens or suckling herds.  This was the drift of the message that was coming from these meetings but no such grant aid is available.  We have been told that we will receive from the EC funds 70 to 75 per cent of the amount that we make available.  There is no mention in the budget of how much money will be set aside to match the funds from Brussels.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that the true facts regarding the increase of the EC Structural Funds are being presented by the Government in order to create a false feeling of well being.  Members of local authorities, development organisations <Col N="1186" /> and the public generally are being misled and will be disappointed as a result of wild statements that large amounts of money will be received from the EC Structural Funds.  It has been mentioned regularly that we will receive an extra £4 billion in the next five years.</P>
    <P>Yesterday I spoke to the chairman of the regional committee in my area who told me that he has received at least 300 applications for funds from individuals and groups but he has no office and no back-up service to deal with these applications. That chairman is an exceptionally capable chairman of the regional committee.  He has had great experience in Europe and was a former national figure in this country.  He told me he is depending on the goodwill of the local co-operative, Killeshandra Co-op, to make available to him their staff and offices to help him to get into some semblance of order the applications that have been received.  I would like to put it on record that he has received much help from the Cavan county development officer but the staff available to him is minimal and they are quite busy.</P>
    <P>Likewise, the county manager who is a capable and dynamic man, whom we are proud to have in the county and who has brought about great changes in the short period he has been there is also making his staff available but that is not a well organised system for dealing with what is undoubtedly a very important development, the increased Structural Funds that are being made available to us.  If we are serious about this matter surely we would set up an office in the region with clerical staff.  I presume not more than three or four people would be willing and able to deal with the applications.  We should ensure that the efforts of the people who made applications get fair recognition.</P>
    <P>Many groups are concerned about the development of tourism, about developing their local areas and making amenities more accessible to tourists.  Farmers come together to develop areas of land for plantation.  I believe &ldquo;drainage&rdquo; is not a very popular word to include in an application for Structural Funds, that agricultural production is not favoured, <Col N="1187" /> but a number of farmers have waste land which, with some development, could be used for planting, pony trekking and hiking.  Those applications have been detailed and costed.  The people are doing the best they can, given that they have not the back-up service and the knowledge that is needed.</P>
    <P>What I and many people cannot understand is if on the third day of February these applications are still lying in a room in Cavan and have not been opened due to lack of staff, how will they be considered in the drawing up of a county plan and a national plan?  Will the efforts of these people be wasted?  In fairness to the people, a clear and definite answer must be given so that they will not be totally disillusioned.  They have shown a keen interest and awareness in this area. If there is any motivation at all the people will respond.  That has been proven by the numbers of honest people who attended meetings to ensure that they would get a grasp of what is available to them.</P>
    <P>An agreement has been reached that the total amount of money in the three funds will be doubled by 1993 but no guarantee has been given that Ireland's share will be doubled although there is a good prospect of that happening.  This means funds will be increased by approximately 15 per cent annually and will amount to about £700 million in 1993.  In the past the Regional Fund was allocated on a quota basis with Ireland's share at 3.2 per cent.  Last year we did not receive that amount because we did not provide enough money to match that sum.  We receive about the same amount from the Social Fund as from the Regional Fund. We received 10 per cent in 1987 and we can hardly expect this to be doubled.  We received 10 per cent from the Agricultural Fund, one area in which we could have collected at least double the amount but we did not avail of all the opportunities. There are good prospects for a large increase in this area.</P>
    <P>There is also misunderstanding as a result of statements about 75 per cent funding, as I have said earlier.  Agreement has been reached only in relation <Col N="1188" /> to the Regional Fund but it is hoped that it may extend to the Agricultural and Social Fund in future years.  It will not however apply to the cost of a project and that is the important message that we must get across.  People should not be misled into thinking that if they put up 25 per cent of the cost of a project, 75 per cent will be received from the EC.  It would be great if that was the case.  These people are well entitled to that type of grant aid.  I have no doubt that 100 per cent grant aid has been handed out to foreign industrialists to come to this country but they close down within a number of years for tax reasons.  Having got all they can from the system they close their doors and leave the country.  If grants are made available to small, family-run businesses these people will stay and make every effort to succeed.</P>
    <P>In future years the grant aid will not apply to the cost of projects but to the amount of public finance involved.  The Structural Funds have gathered much support; people are keenly interested but the Government have a lot of work to do and explanations to give so as to ensure that the applications sent in will get a fair hearing, that they will be judged on their merits and that the funds which these people are seeking will be available to them.</P>
    <P>There is another important aspect of the Structural Funds and that relates to the county councils and, therefore, the roads.  The Minister for Health, Deputy O'Hanlon, on the other side of the House is equally aware of the state of the roads in Cavan-Monaghan.  They are no better than in any other county and are worse than most other counties.  People might say I am making a meal out of the potholes in Cavan but I make no apology to anybody for that.  We have a unique problem.  We have no other means of transport.  We do not have an airport as yet and I do not suppose we will.  We had a rail service but it was taken away in the mid-sixties.  Therefore we are solely dependent on our roads and they are in a deplorable state.</P>
    <P>I think it was Deputy Ellis who paid <Col N="1189" /> tribute to the Minister for the extra moneys he has made available in this budget.  I am sorry to say I do not see it. There may be extra money but it is not sufficient to make a reasonable impact on the serious situation that exists.  There are unfortunate people who live in long laneways.  Before leaving the house children going to school must first put on their wellingtons and carry their little shoes in their hands to the end of the main road to meet the bus.  They must then take off their wellingtons and hide them behind a gatepost or a tree and put on their shoes.  If they travelled in their shoes their legs and their stockings would be destroyed and they would be soaking for the day.  That is the situation we are faced with apart altogether from the unsightly mess to be faced by tourists who we are trying to attract to the country.</P>
    <P>Long ago, and I am sure it is still the case, there was always a general clean up before inviting guests, to make sure that every place was looking well.  By way of all sorts of promotions &mdash; many of them hare-brained &mdash; we are bringing people here who, because of the state of our roads, will not return.  Nothing sells better than a good product and a good product needs no advertising; the word will spread quickly.  If you treat a customer well he will bring ten customers back.  If you treat a customer badly he will prevent 100 from coming.  Many of the people involved in tourism would also be involved in clubs of one kind or another and there are general comments when they return as to whether they enjoyed the holiday.  If it was good then more people will come but if it was bad it will turn people away.  That is an aspect with which I am concerned.</P>
    <P>I am primarily concerned about the people who are using our roads every day and who are depending on them and have to put up with existing conditions.  The rate support grant has been cut by half and that has been the sole reason for the serious deterioration of our roads.  The problem started in 1977 and it is now with us 12 years and it is getting worse.  Like a wild teenager our potholes are creating havoc all over the place.  This problem <Col N="1190" /> must be tackled; it cannot be allowed to continue any longer.</P>
    <P>Yesterday I was in Cavan at the launch of Local Awareness for the eradication of TB.  It was a meeting that was exceptionally well presented.  The local district veterinary officer, Seamus Griffith, gave an excellent outline of what they expect to do within the next three to four years. Eradication of bovine TB is a major problem. We have been working at it &mdash; if working is the correct description &mdash; for the past 35 years.  We made rapid progress in the early years but for the last few years we seem to have become bogged down.  It is a serious setback to any farmer, married or single, when the veterinary surgeon announces on the morning of the test that he has a reactor or a number of reactors in his herd.  It is devastating.  It was probably a lifetime of work building up a good herd of dairy cows and then they are gone by the way-side.</P>
    <P>I do not think it has been appreciated by the powers that be, by the Government, by the Minister for Agriculture and Food or the Minister for Finance how these people are expected to live when their herds are taken from them and when their farm is totally destocked.  Nobody has come up and said, here is an income as in the case of an industrial worker who has been made redundant.  They are just left.  Their cattle have been taken from them and they are told that in six months they may be allowed to get back into stock again but it could be a period of 12 months.  Nobody has said how they are to live in the meantime.  I know there is compensation for the cattle but I do not have to spell out here the enormous losses suffered by people as a result of putting small cattle into factories and good dairy cows in their full term of milking.  Certainly they would not be in great condition and the moneys received would represent a loss, on average, of over £700 per cow.</P>
    <P>I recognise that some improvement in the new scheme has taken place regarding an income of £45 per month being offered for depopulation grants.  A good <Col N="1191" /> dairy cow producing four gallons of milk per day would bring in £124 per month to the farmer.  Now he is getting only about a third of that amount.  We are now talking about small pockets of areas afflicted with the disease.  It is not good enough that farmers who are not affected, because of some good luck and the grace of God, should turn a blind eye to those who are hit with this serious problem.  A fund should be set up and I believe the farmers would be the first to respond, and the Government should also put in a major capital investment in the fund.  I would expect the meat factories and the co-ops to respond likewise.</P>
    <P>In conclusion there is one important aspect that I would like to mention and that relates to a bypass for Cavan town &mdash; not a surgery bypass.  I have no doubt the Minister for Health, Deputy O'Hanlon, would support me in that.  We have a major problem and the bypass has been on the cards for the past ten years.  It is a bottleneck for people, for businesses and for lorries travelling to Dublin or to the West who have to pass through Cavan town and who are seeking a bypass.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy Boylan, and anything that would be good for the regions outside Dublin, and particularly for Cavan-Monaghan &mdash; I am sure Deputy Boylan and myself would be allowed to be a little parochial &mdash; I would certainly support it. Indeed, for many years I have advocated not only a bypass for Cavan but a major road north of Dublin from, say, Sligo to Dundalk which would be beneficial to the whole north-west, north-east and all the Border counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of double taxation I have a certain sympathy in cases where <Col N="1192" /> a husband is working in the Twenty-six Counties and a wife is working in the Six Counties.  They are both paying PAYE and the wife finds she is obliged to pay a higher rate of tax at this side of the Border.  I am unaware that a person working abroad and who would be longer out of the country than six months would be asked to pay the higher level of tax.</P>
    <P>On the question of the social welfare allowances, the free electricity and the free fuel guidelines are laid down.  These guidelines are to ensure that people who are entitled to these services have the services provided for them.  I do not think it would be acceptable that somebody who only had &mdash; to use Deputy Boylan's words &mdash;&ldquo;a bit of ground&rdquo; and did not have any means of providing fuel from, say, a garden would be denied free fuel vouchers provided that in all other ways they qualified.</P>
    <P>As a Border Deputy I was surprised that Deputy Boylan raised the issue of the excise duty on petrol and the 5p. What is important about that 5p is that the price of petrol, following this budget, did not change at the pumps.  It is no harm to reflect back to 1983.  In January of that year, the first month the Coalition were in office, the price of petrol increased on three different occasions by 35p. in all.  This had an effect on petrol stations in towns along the Border, and in a sizeable town like Clones there are now no petrol stations and the public have to travel seven miles to buy petrol for their vehicles.  As I have said, during their first term of office, the Coalition increased the price of petrol by 35p.</P>
    <P>Not alone did it effect petrol sales, but there was an exodus of people from every town along the Border to the Six Counties to do their shopping.  This had devastating consequences for all traders along the Border.  In the months leading up to the last general election and during the general election campaign, this was a very important issue.  We, in the Border areas, were very pleased when the then Minister for Finance, Mr. Ray MacSharry, found a simple solution to the problem.  He introduced the 48 hour rule for travellers.  I am very glad to say <Col N="1193" /> that that has had a major impact on improving business in each town along the Border.  One or two towns that are surrounded on three sides by the Border like Clones and Belturbet still have some problems; but, the other Border towns which suffered when the Coalition were in power, have now reaped the benefit of that decision.  We have all reaped the benefit of the improvements in the economy that have come about as a result of the Government's programme.</P>
    <P>On the question of Structural Funds, I think it is important to recognise that Ireland is seen as one region in Europe. It is an indication of the Government's commitment to devolved administration and to decentralisation that they decided to set up seven regional committees, giving them the opportunity to represent their area and to submit to Government what they would see as priorities and developments that might be taken into account in our application for the Structural Funds that become available.  I believe that was a wise decision.  This reflects the difference in approach between ourselves and the Fine Gael Party.  The Fine Gael Party are not very much in favour or supportive of decentralisation. Not so long ago we had a Private Members' motion in the name of a Fine Gael Deputy to centralise the health administration and to abolish the health boards.  That is an indication of Fine Gael's approach to the question of how we should administer the country. Against that background, perhaps it was understandable to hear Deputy Boylan's comments.  Deputy Boylan is aware that the largest sum ever provided for roads has been provided in the current year. The Minister for Finance has announced in the budget a very sizeable increase in what had been previously allocated for roads.</P>
    <P>In this limited debate, I would like to deal with the health services.  The post-budget non-capital provision for health is £1,251.4 million.  The budget adjustments account for about £9.1 million made up as follows: £8 million in lieu of income generating measures through increased charges; £1 million to allow a <Col N="1194" /> 3 per cent increase in cash allowances to disabled persons with effect from July; and £100,000 towards the agreed restructuring of the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre. The Exchequer contribution included in the overall provision amounts to £1,109.9 million and appropriations-in-aid account for the remaining £141.5 million.</P>
    <P>The provision for health services, expressed as a share of total funds for non-capital supply services, has increased in 1989 over 1988.  This represents a clear recognition by the Government of the high priority of our public health services. The amount of Exchequer funding provided for the health services represents one-fifth, or 20 per cent, of total Government spending &mdash; which is a very sizeable amount &mdash; and is a 1 per cent increase over last year.</P>
    <P>The Exchequer provision for capital expenditure in 1989 is £35 million.  The non-capital provision that I have just outlined will support net expenditure of £1,256 million.</P>
    <P>When account is taken of local income of £107 million available to the health agencies, total expenditure of £1,363 million can be generated.  This level of expenditure will allow for the continuation of key services at existing levels and provides for the phased introduction of some major new facilities in the acute hospital area.  In notifying the agencies of their allocations I made specific provision for the commissioning of new hospital facilities, which I will refer to later.  At the same time, the allocations were structured so as to afford protection of services at other existing major centres such as the regional hospitals and key Dublin hospitals.</P>
    <P>In relation to the source of expenditure on our health services, it must continually be recognised that the public, in whatever shape or form it is paid for, is the ultimate funder of health services and, indeed, of all Exchequer funded services.  In such circumstances, it behoves all who are involved in the planning, managing and delivery of health services to ensure that the investment by the Government of public money in our health services ensures the most productive return.  This <Col N="1195" /> must be the basis of all expenditure by health agencies having regard, of course, to the needs of patients, which have to be the priority.  Agencies must be satisfied on all occasions that their investment in personnel, infrastructure or on any other aspect of service delivery is producing the results in terms of service delivery which is the best that can be achieved.</P>
    <P>In their determination of the 1989 Health Vote the Government have decided that every effort should be made to achieve efficiency savings in the health services next year.  Specifically they have decided savings totalling £10 million should be achieved through additional cost containment measures including, where appropriate, additional use of contract services.  A target saving in this area has been reflected in each health agency's allocation for 1989.</P>
    <P>My Department and I will continue to encourage innovative, practical and workable developments in the cost containment area which will achieve worthwhile results in the short, medium or long terms.  My Department's cost containment unit has been strengthened and will continue to provide all necessary support and assistance, and I have taken steps to implement another central recommendation of the Trident report in relation to product evaluation.  The unit will also continue to assist agencies in assessing alternative arrangements in regard to more cost effective purchasing.</P>
    <P>A study undertaken in 1986 into purchasing arrangements found that there was considerable variation from hospital to hospital in relation to similar items purchased particularly where a number of alternative brands are available on the market.  A central ingredient of an effective and efficient approach to supplies is to ensure that as much information as possible is made available on a regular basis to those involved at individual agency level in order to assist in obtaining the best price for goods.  My Department's cost containment unit concentrated considerable effort in this direction in 1988.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1196" /> As a result of such efforts a liaison system with health agencies has been established in order to facilitate the effective flow of information on market prices in specific areas of health care.  My Department are advised in this important initiative on purchasing by an informal committee of supply officers.</P>
    <P>Efforts continue to be made to improve general purchasing efficiency, stock control and buying strategies.  The sheer bulk and range of purchasing which is carried out on a daily basis throughout the health services lends urgency to their efforts and requires that greater effort should be made to improve efficiency.  While a good start has been made this year, much work, application and initiative are still required.</P>
    <P>I shall not refer to the Voluntary Health Insurance because we had a debate on that over the last two nights and the House decided, by a sizeable majority, to support the recovery plan.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>An important feature of the recovery plan is that it is based on controlling the cost factors which have caused the VHI's problems, rather than on substantial premium increases.  The premium increase for the majority of members is only 3 per cent.  The higher premium increases which have been applied to certain plans are to ensure greater equity, after taking account of differences in the average age of membership.</P>
      <P>I am now considering the longer term corporate plan, which has also been prepared by Mr. Fox, the recovery manager, and the VHI Board.  The purpose of the plan is to ensure that the VHI are in a position to meet whatever challenges may emerge in the coming years.  In the meantime, the prompt and decisive action which was necessary to secure the VHI has been taken.</P>
      <P>Despite the critics our hospital service have responded with efficiency, innovation and in a most positive way to the demands placed on them.  It remains a service we can be proud of and one which serves our people professionally and with quality.</P>
      <P>The increased productivity in our acute hospital system has ensured that a figure for the hospital bed complement so frequently used in the past as the measure of service availability is no longer reliable. Instead, attention must be focused on the outputs of our hospitals to determine the quantum of service provided.  The changes in the methods and types of services are becoming a more important barometer of activity.  The increasing concentration of resources by most hospitals on day case treatment and out-patient services has also ensured that the services available within a hospital are assessed by a greater number of people.  For example, although bed numbers in the Dublin area have been reduced, the number of patients treated has increased overall.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In one major Dublin hospital, although the number of acute beds has been reduced by about 25 per cent the number of admissions actually increased by 7 per <Col N="1198" /> cent in January to August 1988, as compared with the same period in 1987.  In the same hospital, day activity both surgical and medical, has increased by 25 per cent.  Indeed, I am glad to say that one week ago in the same hospital I opened an x-ray unit with equipment that cost £5 million, the most up to date available anywhere in the world.  What is important is that the State is providing the most sophisticated hi-tech equipment for public patients in public hospitals, although some people would like us to believe otherwise.</P>
    <P>It is clear that beds and hospital services generally are being used more intensively so that there is a higher throughput and a greater availability of services than the bed stock would suggest.</P>
    <P>We are managing to keep pace with developments in sophisticated diagnostic technology.  I have already pointed out about the new x-ray unit in St. James' Hospital.</P>
    <P>Since coming into office our efforts have been successful in eliminating facilities that were clearly surplus to requirements, to clarify the role and responsibilities of each hospital and where appropriate, to promote the grouping of hospitals, particularly in urban areas.  This is necessary to ensure, in so far as resources permit, that we have a cost effective, rational and fully productive acute hospitals service throughout the entire country.  Indeed, the statistics I have used in relation to increased productivity are but some examples of concrete evidence available to show that the rationalisation programme, first was required and secondly, that it is producing the desired results in the interests of patient care.</P>
    <P>During 1989, we will open the new hospital at Cavan and major new units at Castlebar, Mullingar, St. James's and the Mater Hospitals.</P>
    <P>The year 1988 has seen important new initiatives in the area of health promotion. Underlining my programme has been a concern that a fresh approach was required which concentrated on the promotion of positive health and prevention strategies.  The structures which <Col N="1199" /> I established during 1988 have addressed in a positive and purposeful manner the important role that health promotion must continue to play in our approach to health and health services generally.  The health promotion unit in my Department are responsible for developing a policy on health promotion and, as the House is aware, have launched several important campaigns in their own right and in conjunction with the health boards and voluntary agencies.  Included among these are participation with the Irish Cancer Society in the Europe against Cancer Week; a community based approach to combating alcohol and drug abuse entitled `Drugs Questions &mdash; Local Answers; and the `Cleanwatch' campaign which concentrated on food hygiene within the food trade in particular.</P>
    <P>The international efforts at health promotion are evident in the Europe against Cancer campaign which will involve specific involvement by my Department and by the community generally.  I will be announcing my Department's programme in that regard shortly.</P>
    <P>An important campaign which is currently in progress concerns the MMR &mdash; measles, mumps, rubella &mdash; immunization programme.  While I am satisfied at the uptake of the MMR vaccine, much progress still needs to be achieved if we are to meet the targeted uptake of 90 per cent of children in the 15 month to 5 years age group.  I am asking parents to ensure that their children receive this important vaccine which is safe and available free from family doctors.</P>
    <P>The health promotion structures operate at a number of levels which reflects the varied approach required in order to ensure success.  I have referred to my Department's health promotion unit.</P>
    <P>The second level is the Advisory Council on Health Promotion which represents the main economic and social interests whose activities impact on health.  The council have been meeting regularly in addressing their objective of recommending to me changes in public policy which would have a positive impact on the health of the community generally.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1200" /> Their current concerns are policy issues associated with tobacco, alcohol, nutrition, accident prevention and exercise.</P>
    <P>The third level in the structures is a committee of Ministers which ensures that issues which impinge on the health of the community can be addressed and resolved at the highest level and given the intersectoral dimension of health policy.</P>
    <P>Under my chairmanship, the committee include the Ministers for Agriculture, Education, Energy, Environment and Labour.  The establishment of such a committee is a concrete expression of each individual Minister's commitment to, and the collective emphasis of, the Government on health promotion.</P>
    <P>A further recognition of the central position of health promotion is the sponsorship by my Department of a new Chair of Health Promotion at University College, Galway.  A sound academic research base for work in this area is an added dimension to the concrete initiatives that I and my Department have taken.</P>
    <P>Last year I established a working party to examine the organisation of screening for cervical cancer in this country.  The working party, chaired by the chief medical officer of my Department, recommended a number of changes to improve the service.  I shall shortly be circulating that working party report to the various agencies involved in the provision of the service to see how we can improve that service of cervical screening.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons I established the working group was due to concern about delays in analysing cervical smears in some public laboratories, in particular the laboratory at St. Luke's Hospital, Dublin.  I am glad to say that this problem has now been resolved and reports are issued from St. Luke's Hospital within a week of receipt of the smear.</P>
    <P>In the psychiatric sector, progress is continuing with a further reduction in the number of in-patients during 1988 and further development of alternative, community-based services.  Similarly, additional residential places have been <Col N="1201" /> provided for mental handicap patients, notably with the replacement of inappropriate accommodation by more homely and suitable provision.</P>
    <P>Indications are that the level of availability of child and school health services has continued largely unchanged over the past number of years.  Our child care services have been able to respond to an increase in the level of reporting of child abuse and we have taken steps to provide a more comprehensive and effective specialist service to cope with that problem in two of our children's hospitals in Dublin and a further centre in Cork.</P>
    <P>We have made progress in tackling the very serious AIDS problem by strengthening the new, specialist services in that area.  Furthermore, the opening in 1988 of the new Drugs Treatment Centre in Dublin is a major boost to our services for this very much at-risk group who are a cause of major concern because of their vulnerability to AIDS.  The availability of a high standard of care to the entire population remains the central objective of health policy, together with continuing emphasis on policies to promote and maintain the health of the community. Any impartial observer must conclude that, in large measure, these objectives have continued to be met in 1988 and will guide policy in 1989 also.</P>
    <P>Of course there are areas of particular difficulty and areas of unmet need or need which might be met in more appropriate ways.  I am very much aware of the need to continue the momentum to provide a more satisfactory framework of services for the mentally ill.  I acknowledge that further provision of residential and day places for the mentally handicapped is necessary.  With the new framework for child care which is contained in the Bill currently being debated, it will be necessary to review and strengthen our services in that area.  I am also aware that the broad framework of community support services could be strangthened to the benefit of the health care system as a whole.</P>
    <P>However, I would maintain that progress in these areas is being maintained and that it is necessary for us to continue to pursue all possible options for greater <Col N="1202" /> efficiency and effectiveness in the way in which the very substantial resources devoted to health care are spent.  It will also be necessary for us to keep under continuing review our priorities within the health care field.  Every developed country has the same problems and none is able to provide the level of funding that would satisfy all the needs of the health service.  I have already referred to the fact that 20 per cent of Government spending goes on our health services.</P>
    <P>Against this general background of the maintenance of our key objectives in health policy, there is a number of developments which I would highlight as being of particular significance for the future of our policy in 1989 and beyond. First, with regard to personnel in the health services, I would point out that as part of the general review of public service numbers, a significant reduction has taken place in the numbers employed in the health services, notably through the voluntary redundancy and early retirement scheme.  This reduction has been made possible by the rationalisation of services and activities which agencies have been undertaking in the past two years.</P>
    <P>The general policy on the non-filling of vacancies in the public service has been applied sensitively and rationally to the health services.  We have carefully considered applications from agencies for the permanent filling of key posts and, as a result, approval has been given to the recruitment of staff to these sensitive, priority areas.  In addition, because of an imbalance which was emerging in the ratio of permanent to temporary staffing in the health services, I approved the conversion of 850 staff to permanent posts in priority areas as a particular initiative to reduce the reliance of services on an undue number of temporary staff.  My Department are continuing to review the position of the remaining temporary staffing with the Alliance of Health Service Unions and if necessary further conversions of temporary staff to permanent status will be approved by me. In addition, during 1989, my Department will be maintaining close contact with the <Col N="1203" /> various agencies in order to ensure that critical vacancies in the services are filled and it will be my policy to ensure that all appropriate services are properly staffed within the framework of the resources available to each agency.  The efficient use of personnel is of critical importance to the health services, given the extent to which staff costs account for the expenditure of our health care agencies.  I have instructed all health managements to pursue with vigour all of the potential savings which exist in the way in which activities are organised and staff are deployed.  I am confident that the progress which has been made in this area will be continued.</P>
    <P>At this point I would like to make some comment on the new arrangements to be introduced for the general medical service. As the House will know, I concluded agreement with the Irish Medical Organisation on a new form of agreement for doctors participating in the general medical service.  This new agreement provided for a change in the method of payment of participating doctors to one which emphasises payments per patient rather than per visit.  It also contains important provisions to support the development of the quality and range of services provided by general practitioners.  For example, provision is made for regular study leave, for supporting the employment of nursing and secretarial staff and the purchase of equipment.  The more appropriate recognition of the need for annual and sick leave and for superannuation has met a legitimate concern of the profession.  The very convincing majority which accepted these proposals in two successive ballots conducted by the IMO augurs well for the future operation of the scheme.  I am confident that the new arrangements will provide a very firm foundation for the realisation of the full potential of general practice to deal with a wider range of medical problems and provides a satisfactory basis to plan a transfer of care from institutional to community-based services.  I would emphasise, of course, that patients retain full choice of doctor <Col N="1204" /> in the new arrangements and will experience no diminution in the quality of care. Health boards will be in a position to assess trends in the delivery of care by participating doctors and new and innovative arrangements have been agreed to ensure that problems which may arise are dealt with speedily and effectively.  I have no doubt that this new arrangement will prove very satisfactory both to participating doctors and to patients and we have an agreed arrangement to review its operation to ensure that the objectives which I share with the health boards and the IMO in entering this new contract are fully met.</P>
    <P>I have been considering in detail the report of the working group I appointed to review the delivery of dental services. This report was prepared under the chairmanship of Deputy Terry Leyden, Minister of State at my Department.  In my Department's recent letters of allocation to health boards I have sought specific information in relation to the dental services which will enable me to devise and cost a plan for the improvement of the services.  My Department's deputy chief dental officer is currently engaged in discussions with the Eastern Health Board and with the Dental Hospital to see how that hospital might play a greater role in the provision of services for public patients.</P>
    <P>The Government's approach to the management of the economy has been purposeful, has produced positive results and has set the foundation for further growth and development.</P>
    <P>My priorities as Minister for Health are to ensure that the level of resources available is allocated in such a way and is utilised to the best advantage in the bests interests of patient care.  Resources must continue to be invested in priority services to ensure that those most in need of care receive care in a timely fashion, in the appropriate setting and in a cost effective manner.  Initiatives that I have taken to date and will continue to take this year will ensure that these core objectives are met.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset it seems that there is little merit in making a budget speech and I am quite mystified as to why Deputy Shatter got so upset about the order of speakers because I am sure little new remains to be said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps there would be merit in making a speech at a time removed in distance from the glitter and the glare of budget day after one has had time to evaluate it in a calm atmosphere.</P>
      <P>Last night as I attempted to frame my speech, the first question I asked was how will this budget rate among those who evaluate budgets one year from budget day?  Will those who sit down to evaluate the effects of the budget one year from now say that this was a good budget and that it brought about significant improvements in every area of life?  Will they be able to say that Ireland in January 1990 will be a better place in which to work and live as a direct result of the provisions in this budget?  Sadly, I do not think that will be so.</P>
      <P>There is little in the budget that convinces me that many major changes will be brought about one way or the other. I see no strategic planning that will bring about major social or economic change. There is not even one single, strong, strategic measure that I can identify that would lead me to predict with certainty that the budget will break the spiral of rising unemployment, stem the tide of youth emigration or eradicate the root causes of wide scale poverty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new Minister was well positioned to bring in a budget specifically geared to growth.  He brought with him a bundle of advantages denied to his predecessor. Two tough budgets had prepared and created the conditions for growth in the real economy.  The tax amnesty and the availability of funds from lottery sources had given extra cash at Exchequer level and the prospect of vast sums of money <Col N="1207" /> accruing through the Structural Funds certainly gave the Minister an opportunity to plan creatively, courageously and strategically for real growth in the real economy. By &ldquo;the real economy&rdquo; I mean the economy in which ordinary people try to earn a daily living, raise their children, improve their standard of living and have some kind of a decent lifestyle for themselves. I do not mean the paper economy of bankers and stockbrokers which we are assured is doing extremely well.</P>
    <P>As a result of the budget and all the advantages to which I referred, I was looking for significant directions to create more jobs and growth in the real economy. Unfortunately, the Minister ignored this opportunity.  Instead of going for growth he opted for a policy of appeasement, giving a morsel here and a morsel there.  We had a &ldquo;keep them ignorant but happy&rdquo; kind of budget, the only certain outcome of which will be a continuation of the <i>status quo.</i></P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats have long argued that radical tax reform is an absolute pre-condition to any growth in the real economy.  We are not alone in this as every major scientific report on the Irish economy hammers home the fact that Ireland tops the list of European countries where taxation and the social welfare system combine to sap the will to work and stifle enterprise, initiative and investment.  The Minister had an ideal opportunity to begin to dismantle the taxation system that hangs like an albatross around the neck of the Irish nation, but he failed to bite the bullet.  One more financial year is lost and with it will surely go another 32,000 young Irish people, the real casualties of our anti-work taxation system.</P>
    <P>It is a cruel irony on the nation and its taxpayers that in this time of deep economic difficulty thousands of our brightest and best young people are effectively excluded from participation in the economy and are forced to emigrate. Taking with them excellent educational qualifications, they are being enthusiastically conscripted into the labour forces of our competitor countries in a <Col N="1208" /> tough world market and quickly, like the Wild Geese of the 18th century, fight in everyone's battle except their own.  I warn the Minister that this country is in for a period of national degeneration unless strong measures are taken soon to stem the tide of youth emigration.  There is nothing in the budget that gives hope to the rising generation.  I think it was Sean O'Casey who once said that Ireland is an old sow that eats her farrow.  That statement could also be applied to this generation of planners and politicians, more than to any previous generation, which is a sad commentary on us all.</P>
    <P>Recent surveys all over Europe show that the lack of highly qualified personnel is the greatest single barrier to economic development, more serious by far than the scarcity of capital or the high cost of production.  We have no such scarcity, our third level colleges are turning out graduates second to none but, because of the failure of successive Governments to match major advances in education with parallel strides in other areas of life, these highly qualified, well motivated young people are precluded from working for the betterment of their own people and the advancement of their own country.</P>
    <P>The budget gives a commitment to create 3,000 new jobs in 1989 through developments in tourism, fisheries and industry.  I hope this target will be met and, in this context, I appeal to the Minister for the Marine to give some political leadership and to bring to an end the rod licence row that is having such an adverse impact on our tourist industry.  Equally, I appeal to the Minister for Tourism to take all necessary steps to put the Swansea-Cork ferry service in place on a permanent basis.  Scientific studies carried out by the members of the economic department of UCC confirm that this service is capable of making a major contribution to the local economy in the Cork-Kerry region.  There is ample scope for further growth and expansion of the tourist industry in this region, yielding hundreds of jobs directly and indirectly, but if access to the region is not improved jobs will not accrue in large numbers. The putting in place of the Cork-Swansea <Col N="1209" /> car ferry on a permanent basis is essential in the improving of access to this region.</P>
    <P>If this service is to attain its full potential its timetable must be made available not later than September in any given year in advance of the time when block bookings are made by travel agents and when brochures and marketing strategies are designed and implemented.  We cannot go into another tourist season with the sad spectacle of this year when the ferry service will be put in place long after the 1989 brochures have gone to print and long after leisure fairs and all sorts of marketing occasions at which the service could be marketed have been held.  No service would be able to compete with another if it were to be marketed on that basis.  It must be confirmed not later than September in any given year that the service is in place.  If this service is to be successful that is a most essential pre-condition.</P>
    <P>The number of jobs the Minister predicts will be created will not accrue if we continue to carry on in the way we have been carrying on up to now.  Certain steps must be taken if these jobs are to accrue, such as the putting in place on a permanent basis of the ferry service and the improvement of access generally to the Cork-Kerry region.  Such steps are vital if we are to adequately promote that region.  In this respect I appeal to the Minister for the Environment to do something about the condition of the roads in that region.  We are talking about tourists who bring their cars with them but the condition of our roads will do little to encourage them to return or to tell their friends that this is a good country to visit.</P>
    <P>A natural follow on from the putting in place on a permanent basis of the ferry service is a proper road structure.  The Minister now has an opportunity, because of the funds that will be made available from Europe, to improve the condition of the roads in this region and to bring them up to standard.</P>
    <P>We also need improvements at the airport. During the past year there was significant improvement there and for that we are grateful but there is room for <Col N="1210" /> further improvement.  If there is evidence to suggest that this will be done I will have some credence in the Minister's prediction that 3,000 new jobs will be created in the tourism sector this year.  Unless those steps are taken his prediction will just amount to another piece of fiction.</P>
    <P>There is very little in this budget that touches on education.  The modest increase in capitation grants for primary school children is to be welcomed and in fairness it must be said that this is the first such increase for a number of years, that it will make some small difference and improve conditions in primary schools. For this reason I welcome it.</P>
    <P>In the lead-up to the budget there was much talk about poverty.  The Minister stated that this was one of the key issues he was going to set about tackling.  In fairness, it must be admitted that provision is made in the social welfare area for those hardest hit.  I welcome all of these measures, especially the introduction of the new social assistance payments for widowers and deserted husbands looking after their children. This move was long overdue.  I also welcome the extension of the child dependant allowance to 19 year olds in full time education.  This will be of help to families who are struggling to keep their children in education and bring our benefit schemes into line with other European countries.</P>
    <P>While all of these are worthwhile measures in the short term they will do nothing to eradicate poverty in the long term. This budget is not a poverty fighter.  We in the Progressive Democrats have argued consistently that the best weapon against poverty is a job.  In this context I want to point to our continued failure to recognise the role which our education system plays, inadvertently perhaps, in the perpetuation of poverty.  There is ample evidence to suggest that large numbers of early school leavers, who leave school without any qualifications, very soon become unemployable.  This is the exact term used by the YEA in a report they published on the results of a survey they had carried out in 1986.  Clearly these are the disinherited in our education system <Col N="1211" /> and are condemned to living in poverty. I am aware that the Minister has introduced the Youthreach scheme and for this she deserves our congratulations but I have grave fears that this programme which is tagged on to the tailend of an unsatisfactory school experience will do little to help young people whose standard of education is deficient in the first instance.</P>
    <P>The problem must be tackled at source.  More resources must be put into primary education, especially in areas where long term unemployment has become endemic.  In many local authority housing estates the unemployment rate is as high as 80 per cent.  A generation of young people are growing up in homes which are dependent on the State, where they have never seen a parent, or even a neighbour, get up in the morning to go to work and where the concept of the breadwinner is as alien as the concept of a ballet dancer.  Our resources must be targeted at areas such as these as a matter of extreme urgency if we are serious about tackling poverty at source.  I appeal to the Minister for Social Welfare and the Minister for Education to draw up a package to help needy families with large numbers of school going children so that they would be able to cope when the time comes to fit their children out for school. The cost of uniforms and school books must be taken into account in any such package.  I also suggest that the free books scheme must be better targeted than it is at present and I appeal to the Minister for Education to ensure that no child is prevented from continuing in education because of the demand for examination fees.</P>
    <P>There are two very demanding periods for families with large numbers of school going children, the first is the first week in September when children have to be fitted out for school.  I appeal to the Minister for Education and the Minister for Social Welfare to be sensitive to the needs of parents during these two periods.  If we were to target many social welfare benefits much better much of the poverty we are now witnessing in housing estates <Col N="1212" /> could be alleviated.  Last September children went back to school one full week before child benefit moneys became due for payment.  I would argue that had these moneys become due for payment one week in advance of schools reopening much of the hardship experienced by mothers in trying to fit their children out for school could have been averted.  All that was needed was a minor adjustment but because this was not done a number of parents were forced to go to money-lenders for money to provide their children with books, uniforms and shoes. That money then had to be repaid along with interest.  Such a problem could be averted if our social welfare system was more sensitive to the needs of parents at the times when there are exceptionally heavy demands on them.  The second period when exceptionally heavy demands are put on parents is the time when examination fees fall due for payment, usually in February.</P>
    <P>There is now evidence to suggest that young people are dropping out of school as they see no reason for them to continue.  One reason they drop out is that do not think the examination, especially the intermediate examination as we knew it, is worth the cost, and rather than put up the money they are drifting away and dropping out of school, and these elements are leading to wide scale poverty.</P>
    <P>Throwing social welfare at that problem is welcome in the short term and no doubt will blunt the sharp edge of want in many homes, and that needs to be done, but it will do nothing to hit at the root source and tackle poverty and eradicate it bit by bit.  Therefore, my major appeal today is to the Minister for Education and the Minister for Social Welfare to come together to do exactly as I have recommended.</P>
    <P>The grant in the budget for the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre is very welcome, but it does more to highlight the financing problems of the centre than to solve any problem.  The Minister for Health and the Minister for Justice must face up to the fact that rape crisis centres perform <Col N="1213" /> an essential community service and their funding will have to be put on a statutory basis.  They will have to be brought in for funding either directly under the Department of Health or the health boards as part of a community care programme. We cannot leave to chance or to charity the work being carried out by the rape crisis centres.  No civilised country would do that; let it not be done in this Christian country.  I appeal to the Minister in framing his Finance Bill to provide for that and to talk to his colleague in the Department of Health to make sure that is done. The figure of £100,000 sounds great; it looks great on paper, but it means nothing in the long term.</P>
    <P>When I examine this budget from the point of view of its long-term effects and whether it will lead to a betterment of our society on social and economic levels, I argue that handouts of the nature given in it are only stopgap measures and indicate the main, most fatal flaw in it, that is, its lack of any central direction.  We are well poised to plan for the future. The onset of 1992 with all the obligations that puts on us as a country should spur us to put our plans in place for the kind of taxation system and regional policy we will have in five years' time.  What kind of regional policy will we have in five years?  What progress will be made in decentralisation in conjunction with the Structural Funds, or will the Structural Funds just be brought in to this country in a conspiratorial manner and will the moneys be spent in the same way as the millions of pounds from the Regional Funds were spent?</P>
    <P>We are being told the climate is right for growth now.  That is good, but that is only a precondition of growth.  Any farmer in the west who has experienced a very fine summer will say it is a great climate, we had a great summer but having a great summer on its own will not make grass grow in the fields of Connemara. The soil must be right and you must sow the seed, if you are to reap the harvest.  I see no seeds of growth, of job creations or of social justice in this budget, and for that reason it disappoints me.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to take the opportunity of congratulating publicly the new Minister for Finance on two counts.  First, his elevation to the post of Minister for Finance, a promotion richly deserved and well earned, and I have no doubt that he will bring the skill, flair and enthusiasm that has marked all his ministries up to now to the Department of Finance.  I am not entirely sure everyone in the Department of Finance will appreciate the Minister's industry, flair and enthusiasm, but I feel that Department could do with a little more of that type of skill and flair.</P>
      <P>The second congratulation is on the budget he presented to Dáil Éireann on 25 January.  Congratulations are due on the production of a very well balanced &mdash; in every sense of the word &mdash; budget which confronted the four major areas of concern &mdash; poverty, reform of taxation, creation of employment and control of the public finances.  Practically all independent and responsible commentators have welcomed the budget and acknowledged it as being reasonable and fair and that it will continue the progress towards economic recovery started by the Government two years ago.</P>
      <P>It is easy for any Member of the Opposition to highlight areas that should have got more attention or to say, as Deputy Quill has just said, that the Minister spread things evenly over a wide scale, and that, therefore, the budget was not effective.  If the Minister concentrated, for instance, on employment creation or on some other aspect of budgetary policy, the same Deputies would say he was neglecting every other area.  A Minister cannot win, but Minister Reynolds has produced a budget that is reasonable and has spread the fruits of our improved economic circumstances over a broad section of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One fact that underlines how well balanced and fair the budget is is that the Opposition parties have been able to criticise only two items mentioned in the budget speech, but not part of the budget. I am referring to the child benefit scheme and extending PRSI payments to public servants.  The Opposition parties have <Col N="1215" /> made a great deal of play on those two items which, as I say, are not part of this year's budget.</P>
    <P>On budget day and since then, we have seen the classic example of Opposition parties clutching at straws and desperately looking for something of which they could be critical.  Deputy Noonan in his prepared script which, as was pointed out to him, sounded surprisingly similar to the contributions he made here following the two previous budgets, used a sporting analogy to describe what he felt the Minister had done in the budget. Maybe a more fitting analogy in the Deputy's case would be that of the star player who showed much promise in a practice match and who got his opportunity on the first team but did not live up to his star billing.  Now the Deputy finds himself relegated to the subs' bench and, like most people who end up on the subs' bench cooling his heels, does his best to denigrate the man who has taken his place&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>The headlines were laid down for you.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash; who is having a star game and is a much more capable player.</P>
      <P>The criticisms and predictions Deputy Noonan and his party made about the budget should be seen in the context of his previous responses to the Budget Statements in 1987 and 1988.  In 1987 he predicted the fall in interest rates would not be sustained because of the budget that was introduced by the then Minister.  He also predicted that there would be no growth in the economy.  Further, he predicted that the Fianna Fáil Government would not sustain their programme to control public expenditure. He went back into the mists of time and mentioned precedents showing that Fianna Fáil would not maintain a tight rein on public expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1988 again he predicted that as a result of the budget there would be no growth and he said the budget would be deflationary.  He also said it would not inspire confidence in any sector of the <Col N="1216" /> community, nor would it inspire any kind of national consensus.  He said this too would deflate the economy.  I do not think there is any need for me to underline the fact that all his predictions in the last two years proved wrong and I have no doubt that he will be proved wrong in the coming year.  The Deputy's reference to the need for national consensus is rather hypocritical when one considers that he spent most of the last two years trying to undermine the national consensus that had been arrived at by the social partners through their <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i></P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan is aware that this has been the most successful Government in the history of the State, that they have achieved the stabilisation of the debt/GNP ratio two years ahead of the ambitious target originally set &mdash; one he said would not be achieved &mdash; and that the Exchequer borrowing requirement is the lowest for 30 years.  Deputy Noonan tried to claim credit for a reduction in the EBR but no matter how creative his mathematics are he must accept that the Coalition only succeeded in reducing the EBR from 15.5 per cent to just under 13 per cent in their four years in office.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>When we left office in 1987 the consumer price index was close to the EC average.  That was a real winner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring to the EBR, a different thing entirely.  In addition, the current budget deficit is the lowest for ten years but, more important, it is only half the level that pertained in 1986 after four years of Coalition Government. The achievements by the Government have led to a massive upsurge of confidence in our economy and the resultant boom experienced in industry and commerce has led to a greater degree of stability and realism not just among the business community but among workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of his contribution, in response to the speech of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan told us what Fine Gael stand for.  He told that they stood for social justice but I am sure he <Col N="1217" /> will accept we all stand for that.  He told us that Fine Gael expect the development of sectoral policies for agriculture, tourism and so on but I should like to ask him where he has been for the last two years. I thought he was an expert on all Fianna Fáil policy documents, from <i>The Way Forward</i> onwards&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheenan Mr. Sheenan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheenan</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the document, <i>There is a Better Way?</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think Deputy Noonan read any of the Fianna Fáil documents but based his comments on one or two lines from them.  In the course of the last election campaign Fianna Fáil produced policy documents for the sectors referred to by Deputy Noonan and many other sectors but the Deputy got so caught up in trying to knock the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>, and the element of the national pay agreement in it, that he neglected to take note of the initiatives taken in the various sectors to develop the economy.  I can only conclude that he did not read the document or that he missed out on the important items in it.  I suggest that, as Opposition spokesman on Finance, he should have a good look at that document.</P>
      <P>I should like to refer to the social welfare provisions in the budget.  The House will agree that one of the main aims of the budget was the launching of a concerted effort to tackle poverty.  Very often when people refer to the poor or to poverty they only think of those in receipt of social welfare or health board payments. I agree that those in purely monetary terms could be classified as poor and the thrust of the Government's policy is to make the maximum amount of resources available to help those people, but it can be fairly argued that in many cases they are not the poorest in our socoety.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Very often the poorest are those on low incomes, those who may be in receipt of an income in excess of social welfare recipients but who lose out on the benefits social welfare recipients obtain without question.  For example, what value can be put on a medical card given to a couple with four children?  In my view it is of <Col N="1218" /> considerable benefit to a family if they do not have any medical expenses.  We can put a monetary value on fuel vouchers, about £130, but we canot put such a value on reduced rents, reduced service charges, clothing and footwear vouchers and so on.  Those benefits are available, almost as of right, to those in receipt of social welfare benefits but not to those on low incomes, those who are slightly above the guidelines for medical cards.</P>
    <P>It is my experience, and I am sure it is the experience of most Members, that those on social welfare find it easier to obtain the supplementary welfare allowances paid by health boards through community welfare officers than those who are in employment, even if their income is the same.  Most community welfare officers say that the fact that a person has a steady income from a job, irrespective of the level of the income, means that they will not be given assistance under the supplemetnary welfare allowance scheme, footwear vouchers or clothing vouchers.  That raises a serious problem but I am pleased it has been tackled in some way in the budget.</P>
    <P>The family income supplement scheme, introduced by the Coalition, is a worthwhile one but I should like to know why the uptake under the scheme is abysmally low?  Why, from the outset, was that scheme never fully utilised?  Is there a problem about advertising it?  Do we need to give more information to employers?  In my view something will have to be done to publicise the scheme. I suggest that a mobile information unit, as was used to publicise the Single European Act, be used throughout the country to publicise the scheme.  I am pleased that the Minister intends to improve the benefits under the scheme but it should be publicised more.  I suggest that the Minister increase the number of children taken into account for payment under the FIS.  At the moment the limit is five children and there is no allowance for any further children.</P>
    <P>Despite the attacks that have been launched from various sides, this budget has been instrumental in assisting those especially in need.  I accept that increases <Col N="1219" /> in social welfare are never sufficient when poverty still exists, but the budget underlines the Government's commitment to tackling poverty.  The yardstick that should be used is how generous the increases are in relation to our economic climate.  Taking that as the yardstick, the Minister has been very generous.</P>
    <P>In relation to poverty generally, the school of politics that believes we can solve poverty by throwing money at it is very wrong and misleading.  Perhaps many of the amateur economists who were making submissions and statements prior to the budget, might have been better employed drafting a proper poverty programme rather than indulging in amateur economics.  Over the past week I have listened with some amazement to the contributions by Opposition Deputies relating to social welfare increases and the general thrust of the budget towards helping the poor.  I could be forgiven for wondering it any Opposition Deputies had actually read the budget speech.  In a time of major cutbacks the Minister has succeeded in putting together a package costing about £71 million.  That is a significant figure because the submission made by the Catholic Social Services Council prior to the budget suggested that 20 per cent of the windfall tax amnesty payments that came the Government's way last year should be devoted to the alleviation of poverty.  That figure of £71 million is approximately 20 per cent of the windfall to which they referred.</P>
    <P>It is clear from the budget that the Government have been mindful of the various responsible submissions made prior to the budget.  In the CSSC document to which I referred earlier, concern was expressed about those on low incomes and special treatment was recommended for them.  This was acknowledged in the budget by way of a new scheme of tax exemption limits for familities on low incomes.  The same document expressed the opinion that public servants should be brought within the PRSI scheme.  The Minister indicated that he would hold talks on that matter over the next few months.  These are just <Col N="1220" /> a few examples of where recommendations made prior to the budget have been considered.  These examples adequately illustrate and underline the Government's commitment to tackling poverty.</P>
    <P>Poverty cannot be tackled in isolation from the remainder of Government policies. Over the past two years the Government have shown their commitment to tackling the problem by implementing a wide range of measures to alleviate poverty.  Many of the groups who made submissions prior to the budget recommended the implementation of the recommendations in the Report of the Commission on Social Welfare, but most groups seem to have only read the recommendation on a minimum income level.  If they read the whole report they would see that the Government, not just in this budget but in other budgets and in social welfare legislation, are implementing many of the recommendations and are committed to implementing all the recommendations in this report.  The criticisms levelled at the Government relate not so much to the implementation of the recommendations as to the fact that they have not committed themselves totally to all the recommendations and to a time scale for introducing them.  It is unreasonable to expect the Government in the current circumstances to say that all the recommendations will be implemented by a certain date.  We are in a very volatile situation with 1992 fast approaching. Changes will take place and many of the recommendations, if implemented, may not even be relevant in two or three years' time.</P>
    <P>Many groups have been calling for tax reforms in the context of social welfare increases and have advised that increased expenditure on social welfare by widening the tax base is desirable.  They suggested that the corporate sector should be more heavily taxed, that accelerated capital depreciation, section 84 relief and export sales relief should be abolished, that we should increase the 10 per cent corporation tax rate, reintroduce the wealth tax and a variety of measures <Col N="1221" /> aimed at increasing the tax take.  There is merit in the proposal to widen the tax base or to get greater tax from the corporate sector, but if we were to implement all the recommendations made by these groups, who would pay for the increased unemployment when many firms go to the wall or decide to invest where the tax régime is much more favourable?  We cannot isolate certain areas without looking at the wider effects.</P>
    <P>Only two and a half years ago when people with money to invest lost confidence in this country a sum of £1.5 billion was leaving the economy annually.  Do we want to return to that?  We cannot afford to return to that.  While I am not against increasing and widening the tax base it would be impossible to do all the things that have been called for.</P>
    <P>Some of the statements made in relation to tax reform have amazed me. Fianna Fáil made one commitment in their last election manifesto in relation to tax and that was that two thirds of taxpayers would be put on the standard rate of tax.  Last year as a result of changes in the tax system 63 per cent of taxpayers were put on the standard rate. That percentage is held this year but the important change is that the standard rate has now been reduced to 32 per cent for the first time in 20 years.  One can juggle with tax reform proposals but what really counts is the proposal that puts money into the taxpayer's pocket.</P>
    <P>Some of the people criticising the Government were in Government previously and their record is nothing to boast about.  They abolished the 25 per cent tax rate, created a 65 per cent tax rate and now they are lecturing us about the disincentive of a 58 per cent tax rate. This rate was reduced and although 56 per cent is still too high a tax rate, it cannot be changed overnight.  The Government's policy of a steady reduction rather than a hasty reduction to 25 per cent, as some parties are advocating, is the appropriate one for this country.</P>
    <P>The main Opposition party criticised the 1988 budget on its one short reference <Col N="1222" /> to unemployment and employment. There was criticism of the then Minister for Finance that those budgetary provisions would do nothing to alleviate the problem of unemployment, another prediction proved wrong because, in the year to end April 1988, 6,000 additional people were employed.  All the indications are that that growth will be sustained throughout the year.  Whether that figure be 6,000 or 3,000 is important because it constitutes the first increase there has been in employment since 1980. There were 20,000 jobs created in industry last year and the budgetary initiatives taken this year are likely to increase that figure.</P>
    <P>Confidence in our economy is being restored, underlined by the fact that over 500 small industries were established last year generating increased employment. The sectoral initiatives and developments proposed in this year's budget will also help to increase employment.  One of the new features of this year's budgetary provisions is the initiative announced by the Minister with regard to young entrepreneurs seeking bank loans.  That announcement is most encouraging and should be of great assistance to such people.  I would appeal to the banks to adopt a more entrepreneurial attitude to prospective participants in that scheme. My fear is that that initiative will be drowned in the bureauracy of paperwork in the banks, and be lost or buried by a plethora of bank managers who, having been stung in the early eighties or late seventies, may be most reluctant to incur any chance or risk.  My major criticism of the banks is that they are reluctant to incur such risk.  They are somewhat similar to insurance companies who will insure one as long as one does not lodge a claim.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to the banks to make every effort to ensure the success of this scheme.  I would go so far as to suggest that the Minister might encourage them to err on the side of the young entrepreneur rather than engage in a book-keeping exercise.  Indeed the Minister might encourage banks to offset any losses that might be incurred under the <Col N="1223" /> provisions of this scheme against the bank levy now obtaining.  In other words, if, after two years' operation of this scheme, it transpires that banks have suffered losses of, say, £1 million, there would be notice taken of that fact and the bank levy correspondingly reduced.  Some such provision might encourage banks to take a broader view of young people's suggestions.</P>
    <P>Much of the talk we hear about the creation of employment reminds me somewhat of what has pertained with regard to tackling poverty.  Of course, some people contend that the solution to all of these problems is merely to throw money at them and they will disappear. But real sustainable jobs will arise only as a result of economic expansion.  Since the early seventies there has been a stable relationship between variations in economic output and jobs.  Experience since then underlines the fact that a growth rate of approximately 3 per cent is essential merely to maintain employment.  It has also been well established that every 1 per cent growth above that level creates approximately 10,000 extra jobs; the relationship is clearly defined.  That link has been established not merely here but within the EC generally and in Japan. Therefore, a growth rate of 2 to 3 per cent annually is essential in order to maintain employment levels and that will have to be augmented further if we are to eat into the problem of unemployment.</P>

      <P>I am obliged to Members. This debate affords time not only to look at the future but also to reflect on the financial realities we face at present and how we got here.  Having listened to numerous speakers on the budget giving what is now, from the Government side, <Col N="1224" /> their new version of financial orthodoxy, it does one a degree of good &mdash; indeed it brings the debate back into the realm of reality &mdash; to put on the record of the House again that the foundations of our current financial difficulties were laid by Fianna Fáil, in Government, in the period 1977 to 1981.  In 1982 they came into Government and failed to confront the issues again within that brief period of administration.  Between the years 1982 and 1987 Fianna Fáil, in Opposition, did everything possible to aggravate our economic difficulties.</P>
      <P>It is very curious to listen to the protestations of innocence at the problems we have on the part of members of the party opposite and indeed Government Ministers at the highest level.  Shortly after his appointment as Minister for Finance we had the proud boast from Deputy Reynolds that in 1977 he had not actually read the Fianna Fáil Election Manifesto. That was an interesting public admission. I wonder how many other Members of this Government will have to make similar public admissions?  For example, will we hear from the Ministers for Social Welfare, the Environment and Health, will we hear from the current Minister for Defence, when he makes an offering on the budget, as to whether he read the 1977 Fianna Fáil Election Manifesto?  I suspect it is an essential prerequisite to be a member of this Cabinet to swear that one was politically illiterate in 1977 and that from then onwards all the way through to 1987, like the three monkeys, one heard no evil, spoke no evil and saw no evil.  What Members of Fianna Fáil were actually telling this House during the years 1981 to 1987 apparently is to be removed from political consciousness. That is a very curious approach to Irish politics but, of course, it has a precedent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would recommend as essential reading to all members of the current Cabinet George Orwell's book entitled 1984 which, despite its title, is not out of date. In the appendix to that book &mdash; which I particularly commend to the Ministers for Finance, the Environment and others &mdash; there is reference to what are known as the principles of &ldquo;new speak&rdquo;.  &ldquo;New <Col N="1225" /> speak&rdquo; was a language invented by Orwell for a particular political régime that could turn facts on their head, in effect providing a formula for pretending that everything they did in the past never happened.</P>

      <P>It would seem to me that &ldquo;new speak&rdquo; is the order of the day from the Fianna Fáil Party.  Fortunately the Official Report for the period 1977 to 1987 is littered with comments by the present Taoiseach and his Cabinet colleagues confirming &mdash; lest there by any doubt about it &mdash; that the difficulties we experienced derive from their behaviour. We have been led to believe that there is now a revolution in Fianna Fáil economic thought.  There is a sort of political double think now.  The creators of our problems have become our political heroes because they are now doing something to solve those problems.  The reality is that what they are doing to solve the problems is being done solely because of the approach taken by Fine Gael in Government and in Opposition and because Fianna Fáil are in a minority Government and are forced to face the economic realities.  Occasionally this new political philosophy escapes them, and on occasions when Ministers in this Administration are let loose and when this House is not exercising controls, they regress to their old ways in the best traditions of Fianna Fáil of <i>circa</i> the seventies and early eighties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We now have another incipient financial scandal that no one has as yet taken any major notice of.  I was very interested to hear the contribution made to this debate by the Minister for the Environment. What was curiously lacking in his speech was any reference to lottery moneys.  Lottery moneys were disbursed and promised at a great rate during 1988 by members of the current Administration. Indeed the way they dealt with lottery moneys became such a scandal that the matter had to be brought into <Col N="1226" /> this House and, if the Labour Party had not bolted on the night in question, the Government would have lost a vote in regard to the manner in which they were dealing with lottery moneys.  There were proposals that were supported by all parties other than the Labour Party to force the Government to take a different approach.  The Labour Party got a deal which was that an all-party committee would be formed to look at how future lottery moneys would be disbursed and this committee have now reported.  The Minister for Finance has been very careful to avoid confirming that Fianna Fáil in Government would implement any of the recommendations made by that committee and was notably evasive on that issue during Dáil questions that he had to deal with this week.  What has not yet publicly emerged is the reason Fianna Fáil would be willing to set up a committee at all.  Once they had their hands on the loot, were they not going to distribute it around the country in whatever way they thought was politically beneficial and expedient to their own party? Why, all of a sudden, this new approach, the holding of hands with the Labour Party?  Of course, we have now sussed out the reason.  I am reliably advised that the Minister for the Environment in 1988 not merely spent all the lottery moneys that accrued to the State in 1988 but has already spent any moneys that might accrue in 1989 and 1990.  I am told that the Minister for the Environment has overspent on lottery funds to the extent that any group who now approaches the Department of the Environment in any part of the country, even in County Mayo, seeking lottery moneys for a worthwhile local project are being advised that there is no point in making application because in 1989 the Department of the Environment will have no new funds to allocate from the lottery and will probably have no new funds in 1990, because the 1988 allocations cover the projected income from the lottery that would be siphoned through the Department of the Environment for the years 1989 and 1990.</P>
    <P>I want a Government Minister to come <Col N="1227" /> into this House to explain how it is that the Minister for the Environment has, in 1988, spent the total projected lottery moneys not just for 1988 but for 1989 and 1990.  I want to know what other Minister in this Government has been so profligate with lottery moneys.  I want to know if any new organisation, through any particular Department, will get any assistance through lottery funds in 1989 and 1990.  Has it all been promised?  What happens if there is a reduction in the income from the lottery?  Will it be the case that some of the promises will not be met because the funding will not be there?  Will some of the European structural funding be siphoned off to meet lottery promises already given?</P>
    <P>This is an extraordinary situation. Could it be the Government are now willing to agree to new procedures for the disbursal of lottery funds because they know some Departments will have no lottery funds to disburse this side of the next general election?  I want an explanation. Before this debate finishes in this House at 5 o'clock this evening I want an explanation as to why groups and individuals who are contacting the Department of the Environment are being told there is no point in seeking lottery moneys for any projects.  I want to know if there is a similar problem in other Government Departments.  I want to know exactly what new moneys this Government project will be available for new disbursement through lottery funding in 1989 and 1990; or I want confirmation that they have so overspent lottery money that there will be no new allocations in 1989.  That is not a difficult one for the Government to respond to. It is not a difficult one for the Minister for the Environment to explain himself on.  We have had no mention of the lottery from any Minister in any speech delivered on this budget debate to date. The absence of any such mention indicates to me that the problems of the Department of the Environment are replicated in other Government Departments.</P>
    <P>This budget which was so well hyped <Col N="1228" /> on the day it was published and which appeared to give all things to all people has now collapsed like a lead balloon.  It is a budget that will be remembered for one thing and one thing only.  It will be remembered for the attempt made by Fianna Fáil to abolish child benefit.  We have heard in the last few days different Ministers saying different things as to what the Government's intentions were. Yesterday we heard the Taoiseach's so-called clarification.  We have had seven days of Government confusion and the Taoiseach's clarification of yesterday simply added to the confusion.  Who are we to believe at this stage?  Are we to believe the Minister for Finance, the Minister for the Environment, the Minister for Social Welfare or the Taoiseach? What really are the Government plans as regards child benefit?</P>
    <P>Outside this House child benefit is recognised as the only substantial recognition of the expense incurred in families rearing young children.  For many mothers it is a symbolic, albeit financially inadequate, recognition of the work they do in the home.  For people in employment it is the only major recognition of the fact that it costs more to support a family with children than a family without children.  The couple who have £15,000 gross per annum and no children and the couple with £15,000 gross per annum and two or three children currently pay exactly the same tax.  Even in the very modest proposals made for those on incomes of £6,000 or less, the vast majority of young couples will get no recognition of the expense of rearing a young family.  I believe it is the policy of this Government to phase out and abolish child benefit.  I believe the Government have given no consideration to the social implications or the implications of that for mothers in the home.  We have heard that various limits will be fixed.  The latest limit is £30,000.  Any family with a gross income over £30,000 per annum will not get child benefit next year and will not get child benefit the following year, if and when the Government make a decision; anyone under this limit will continue to get it.  The reality is there are so few <Col N="1229" /> families with incomes over £30,000 that any financial saving from not making payments to families over that limit would be offset by the administrative costs of implementing a new system to stop making child benefit payments to such families.  Administratively it could cost more to change the whole system in that context.  The £1 million that would be saved would be offset by major administrative expenditures in restructuring the child benefit scheme.  If it was truly the Government's intent to affect only those in the £30,000 and upwards bracket I do not believe this would have been suggested or floated at all.</P>
    <P>What the Government intend to do with child benefit is what they also intend to do with mortgage interest allowance. Mortgage interest allowance was reduced to 90 per cent in the 1987 budget.  It has been reduced to 80 per cent in the 1989 budget.  Presumably next year it will come down to 70 or 60 per cent.  If one starts abolishing child benefit for people in the higher income groups it is a very easy thing, having put the legislation on the Statute Books to come into one's next budget and reduce the limit to incomes of £20,000 or more, and then reduce it to incomes of £10,000 or more.  At the end of three budgets the child benefit would be effectively abolished.  What we should be doing is ensuring that we have a coordinated social welfare and tax system which recognises the reality that families with children incur more expense than families without children and ensures that families with children have some additional leeway financially.  This Government have not addressed that issue just as they have not addressed most of the issues that are relevant to this area.</P>
    <P>A number of other matters arise.  As I said, I wish to give my colleague Deputy Sheehan an opportunity to speak.  One area in which there is ongoing concern &mdash; and which was not in any way offset by the contribution made by the Taoiseach yesterday &mdash; is that of the European Structural Funds.  There is an extraordinary veil of secrecy hanging over the specifics of what the Government are going to do in this area.  The Taoiseach, <Col N="1230" /> in his speech yesterday, listed a series of objectives for the Structural Funds.  The Minister for the Environment, our super-Euro co-ordinator, said nothing of substance in his speech about the European Structural Funds.  He made a vague mention of roads plans that he has not yet published.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach listed a series of objectives, but they are not the specifics, or the meat of the integrated national programme that must go to Europe by 31 March.  They are not the meat or the specifics of the seven designated regional programmes.  It is not acceptable that secret plans be submitted by the Government to Europe for the expenditure of between £3 billion to £4 billion on the economic development of this country without this House having an opportunity to see those plans, debate them, identify priorities in them, amend them if necessary and ultimately, after the plans have gone to Europe, conduct a monitoring role to ensure that the objectives laid down for the Structural Funds are being met.</P>
    <P>It is not acceptable that seven sub-regional groups, working parties, advisory groups, and a group of consultants in Dublin are preparing plans without knowledge as to whether any of the content of those plans will ever see the light of day in Europe and whether they will ever form part and parcel of the submission the Department of Finance will make on 31 March 1989.  It is not acceptable that local authorities throughout the country will be excluded from playing any monitoring role after 31 March 1989. It does not all stop on 31 March.  There is a need to ensure that the objectives and the priorities laid down are truly being met during the four to five year period of operation of the different integrated programmes, be it the national programme or the regional programmes. The Government, for reasons best known to themselves, want to keep the whole matter secret and that is not acceptable in a democratic society.  Contrary to what the Taoiseach said, it does not comply with the strict criteria laid down in Europe that there be a degree of local <Col N="1231" /> input and democratic debate as to the content of plans.</P>
    <P>An extraordinary admission was made by the Minister for Finance in reply to a Dáil question regarding the Dublin consultancy programme.  About £300,000 of public money has gone into appointing consultants to prepare a draft integrated programme for the Dublin region.  The Minister of State with responsibility for European Affairs announced in October that those plans would be completed by the end of December.  This week it emerged a brief plan had been put together which was leaked to <i>The Irish Times</i> and it has not been officially published.  We do not know to this day whether that is the total plan or whether more is available. That brief draft plan was leaked, indicating certain identified priorities for Dublin.</P>
    <P>We are now told that the full plan the consultants have been instructed to prepare will not be available until some time in March 1989.  What input can a plan prepared by consultants, which will not be completed by the middle of March have into a national plan or the Dublin regional programme that has to go to Brussels by 31 March?  What public debate can take place on that?  What political priorities can be identified?  What will happen in some of the other regions? In Cork and Waterford considerable work has been done by the local authorities in putting together draft programmes. Some local authorities have gone to the trouble of employing consultants to assist them in preparing proposals for their own integrated sub-regional programmes.  What input, in reality, can any of these programmes have to a national programme that is to go to Brussels by 31 March?</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance was confused in this House as to whether or not the sub-regional programmes had to be completed by 31 March.  The reality is that they do if they are to have any relevance to the national programme.  Otherwise the sub-regional programmes will become incidentals of the national programme. In so far as there is something <Col N="1232" /> in them that coincides with a Government or Department of Finance decision, they may have some chance of being implemented; in so far as they vary from the national programme, they will have no chance of being implemented.  My belief is that a cosmetic exercise is being conducted by the Government.  Local authorities, county managers and consultants are working at a great rate to give an appearance of democracy to the planning process that the Government have put together, but the reality is that Government will take absolutely no notice of any of the plans that are being prepared.  It is absolutely scandalous the way the plans for the structural programmes are being dealt with.</P>
    <P>The ineptness of the Government is seen in the context of something that is of very great importance in regard to the national plan and the sub-regional plans. The National Roads Authority were formed in the summer and advised by the Minister for the Environment that the Government wanted their recommendations for the national roads programme by September because a blueprint for roads was to be published in the autumn.  The blueprint for roads is relevant to the major infrastructural building works that are required and that were referred to by the Taoiseach in the context of the structural programme.  The blueprint did not appear before the end of 1988.  We were told by the Taoiseach yesterday that it may be published in June.  The plans have to be in Brussels by 31 March.  What relevance will that blueprint have to the national programme or the sub-regional programmes? How will any county manager or local authority know what the Government's roads priorities are in the context of putting together the programme that is to go to Europe?  They will not know. This is another example of the totally insane secrecy that is attached to the Government's approach.</P>
    <P>The profligate nature of the way the Government and some Ministers have dealt with lottery funds gives rise to great concern that the Structural Funds will be <Col N="1233" /> misused and abused, ultimately, in the same way.</P>

      <P>I would hope, in the weeks coming up to 31 March, this Government will reconsider their position and their approach and will allow a true democratic input into the proposals to be made to Brussels.  I also hope they will recognise that, in the area of a major economic programme such as this, this Dáil has an input, is entitled to an input and is entitled to see in draft form the proposals the Government intend to furnish in the name of this State to Brussels for financial help.  That is absolutely essential.  If it is not done the State will be clearly at a major disadvantage compared with the regions in the rest of Europe which require structural funding.</P>
      <P>In the context of roads, we have already seen the Government's inability to come to terms with what is necessary in Brussels.  Speakers on the Government side have been boasting about the additional allocation to roads made in the budget.  What nobody has said is that the Government reduced the 1988 capital allocation on roads to £120 million.  In 1987, when this Government inherited Estimates prepared by Fine Gael in Government, it was £136 million.  The £120 million allocated in 1988 was again repeated in the 1989 Estimates.  The additional financial allocation makes up the difference between the inflation rate in 1987 and the value of money today.</P>
      <P>When the Government Ministers went to Brussels a couple of weeks ago they discovered that if they did not make an additional financial allocation, we would not get additional funds from Europe for our roads.  They learned that you cannot replace the normal domestic expenditure, the roads expenditure we had in 1987, with European funding and that the Structural Funds are all about additionality and allowing infrastructural development to take place for which otherwise there would be no funding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1234" /> An alarming report which, apparently was confirmed by a Government Minister, appeared in <i>The Irish Times</i> on Friday last where a spokesperson for the Department of Finance confirmed that a 5.4 per cent allocation to Ireland was the allocation out of 80 per cent of the total funds for the EC Regional Fund.  This grossly inadequate allocation due to the Government's failure to publish their road plans and their failure to have a clear view of what matching finance could be provided <i>vis-à-vis</i> regional funds coming from Europe has resulted in less moneys being allocated under the Regional Fund than would have been available if the Government had done their job properly.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In the area of taxation and social welfare in this budget the Government have clearly failed to make the radical choices they should have made.  The need for a total overhaul of our tax and social welfare system, if we are to truly boost employment and take major steps towards the elimination of poverty, was not recognised.  The essential need to <Col N="1235" /> remove inbuilt poverty traps within our system and to eliminate employers disincentives to job creation was not confronted. The failure of the Government was very adequately summed up by the Conference of Major Religious Superiors in their response to the budget which states:</P>
    <P>In its 1989 Budget the Government has failed to grasp the possibilities of this historical moment.  All Government decisions can be judged on the gospel guideline that &ldquo;By their fruit you shall know them.&rdquo;  The Budget is no exception.  Evaluated on this basis we believe that Budget 1989 will result in a third of our population continuing to live in poverty.</P>
    <P>Reflecting on Budget 1989 we are forced to the conclusion that poverty was not given the priority it required. As a result of this Budget the Justice Office of CMRS believe:</P>
    <P>there will be very little impact on the numbers of people living in poverty.</P>
    <P>and there is no real evidence of a comprehensive, integrated programme to eliminate poverty.</P>
    <P>The steps taken in the budget will have very little impact on employment creation at all, if any, it will be marginal.  I think it is very sad that the Minister for Finance did not have the imagination to take the radical steps necessary to ensure that in the area of taxation and social welfare a very real contribution will be made, both to job creation and to the elimination of poverty.  He identified three priorities which he wished to address: to reduce poverty, to increase jobs and to transform taxation.</P>
    <P>This budget has abysmally failed to meet any of those priorities or objectives. It is my belief that when we come to the 1990 budget &mdash; if this Government are still in office &mdash; and we look back over the 12 months we will see 12 months of lost opportunities, 12 months sacrificed by a Government afraid to make imaginative decisions, a 12 months sacrifice by a Government afraid to allow a real input <Col N="1236" /> by elected representatives in this House and outside to the development of the EC structural programmes.  They have tinkered with the system and have run away from taking decisions that could have dramatically tackled the problem of unemployment.  In other areas they have reneged on their social responsibilities. In the area of housing, for example, the lack of funding means that this Government are relying on emigration to solve the housing problem.  To those who are unemployed they are saying, we cannot provide you with the jobs and we will not provide the economy with the stimulus necessary to create jobs &mdash; the Government cannot provide jobs but they can stimulate the economy by economic decisions taken; when we do not have the imagination to do that we will not even guarantee you will have a roof over your head.</P>
    <P>This is a very sad budget and one of lost opportunities but within it there are worries and dangers as to what will happen to us in 1992.  If this Government do not get their integrated programme correct, if the wrong decisions are made, and if the wrong priorities are identified, instead of 1992 proving to be a major opportunity for this country it will prove in the end to create additional economic difficulties for us.  That must not happen and we, on this side of the House, will do everything possible to seek to ensure that it does not.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJNoonan" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. Noonan, Limerick West) Michael J. (Limerick West) Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick West</i>): There is an old adage which has particular relevance to the economic strategy being pursued by the Government: &ldquo;If it works don't fix it&rdquo;.  I can think of no more appropriate response to those who feel that the budget introduced by my colleague, the Minister for Finance, on last Wednesday, should have pursued some different course.  The 1989 budget is part and parcel of a strategy which will restore this country to prosperity.  There is no point in anybody contending that they support the Government's overall strategy on the <Col N="1237" /> one hand while disagreeing with the specific measures necessary to pursue that strategy on the other.</P>
      <P>There is always a danger that success can go to your head.  In this instance, the danger is that the Government's success may have such an effect on the Opposition. It is true that our borrowing requirement has been reduced; that unemployment has begun to fall; that exports are booming.  It is also true that the national debt remains at a staggering £24 billion; that emigration continues at an unacceptably high level; that this coming year the deficit will be £819 million.  The Government's room for manoeuvre remains limited.</P>
      <P>The cornerstone of the Government's economic policy is, of course, the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i>  In order to succeed in the task of rebuilding the economy, it is essential that the programme be adhered to.  I am confident that it commands widespread support among all parties in the House and that no responsible Deputy would wish to undermine it either directly or indirectly. One of the central factors of the agreement is the procedure for settling public service pay claims.  My colleague the Minister for Finance has already spoken of the need to maintain strict control of the public service pay bill which currently stands at approximately £3,000 million. Should cost of pay in the public service run out of control, all of the gains which have been made in the last few years would be eroded.  Our economic targets would become unattainable and all of our sacrifices would have been in vain.  For this reason, the programme strikes a fair balance between the legitimate right of public servants to just pay levels and the need to control spending.</P>
      <P>This issue is of particular importance in my own area of responsibility.  I would like to take this opportunity to set the record straight with regard to the issue of Defence Forces pay and how the recent special pay award fits into the Government's overall budgetary strategy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before saying any more I would like to say that I fully understand how Defence Forces personnel and their families may <Col N="1238" /> have become thoroughly confused over this issue.  Never has the settlement of rates of pay for any group of State employees become the focus of such a barrage of ill-informed and, at times, contradictory comment.  I am sad to say that certain Members of this House have played prominent roles in generating the fog of confusion which surrounded the whole issue of Army pay.</P>
    <P>Prior to the setting up of the interdepartmental review, Defence Forces pay had been linked to middle management civil servants for many years. This arrangement was adhered to throughout the last Coalition Government. Apparently Deputies Bell and Connaughton had no trouble supporting this arrangement between 1982 and 1987.</P>
    <P>The following statement was made in the Dáil by my predecessor on 23 May 1986 (Volume 366, No. 11, Column 2186):</P>
    <P>The pay and conditions of members of the Defence Forces continue to be maintained at a high standard.  The remuneration of the Defence Forces has kept pace with that of other sectors of the public service.  The pay of a recruit is now almost £121 a week rising after about 14 weeks basic training to just under £140.  On advancement to Private 3 Star, which usually takes place during the first year of service, gross pay rises to more than £145, while after 3 years' service the gross pay of a private is more than £159.  I am sure that the House will agree that these rates of pay are reasonable</P>
    <P>The year before, on 10 July 1985, (Volume 360, No. 6, column 1329) his predecessor expressed similar sentiments. Deputy Connaughton was a member of the Government on whose behalf those statements were made and Deputy Bell was a supporter of that Administration as his party participated in it.  What was said on those occasions about public services increases being passed on to the Defence Forces was of course true, in other words the Defence Forces maintained their relative position in the pay area.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1239" /> Similar statements were made in 1984 when the Minister for Defence of the day said in the Dáil on 27 June 1984, (Volume 352, No. 14, column 948):</P>
    <P>I think we can safely say that the rate of pay and allowances is better than adequate.  I would consider it to be good.</P>
    <P>Over the years all standard and grade awards provided for the Civil Service have been passed on to the relevant ranks of the Permanent Defence Force.  The last special review &mdash; over and above those increases which were routinely granted &mdash; was undertaken in 1979-80, again by a Fianna Fáil Administration. That review culminated in substantial increases being given by the Government in April 1980.  The next special review was the one undertaken by the present Government.  In between, I repeat, all other awards were as a matter of routine passed on.  The net effect of this was that the Defence Forces maintained their relative position and as stated by the Minister for Finance in his Budget Statement, the Defence Forces in the recent review have been treated as a special case and indeed rightly so.  Suggestions to the contrary are misleading and indeed irresponsible in the circumstances.  The extra cost this year will be £12.5 million; in a full year it will amount to £25.7 million. This puts in perspective the special position of the Defence Forces.  On two occasions, in 1979 and again this year, Fianna Fáil have made special awards to the Defence Forces over and above the awards that have been passed on routinely. It rings very hollow that Members of the Opposition parties are criticising the present pay awards.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael spokesman on finance in his contribution on the budget referred to Army pay.  He talked about the Army being treated disgracefully and asserted that the situation is dangerous.  If it were &mdash; and I do not accept that it is &mdash; it would be due to the sort of disgracefully irresponsible nonsense put out by the Deputy and some others of his party. The genuineness of his concern may be <Col N="1240" /> gauged against his record on behalf of the Defence Forces while in Government. Playing politics in this matter is deplorable and is not in the best interests certainly of the Defence Forces.  The Defence Forces have served this nation and successive Governments nobly and well.  They are not to be treated as a political football.</P>
    <P>Considering the sensitivity of the issues involved I would have expected that Deputies opposite who have been condemning the recent award would have exercised some restraint and would have at least ascertained the facts and put them in their correct national perspective, instead of trying to make political capital out of the Defence Forces and doing so on quite wrong assumptions and interpretations. The assertion that Defence Forces pay was allowed to fall way behind that of other public servants during the eighties is untrue.  Indeed, to say so is an unfair criticism, of the last Coalition Government.</P>
    <P>In June of last year, as I have said, the Government decided to set up an inter-departmental review to consider the whole area of Defence Forces pay.  The recommendations of this committee have been implemented in full, with one minor exception.  In addition to the committee's recommendations, Defence Forces personnel will also receive the general round increases provided for by the public service pay agreement.  All in all, the average total remuneration of other ranks personnel was increased by about 9 per cent from 1 January 1989.  By 1 July 1989 the cumulative increase will be around 10 per cent rising to slightly more than 21 per cent on full implementation.  This then is the factual position with regard to Defence Forces pay.  I would like now to deal with some of the myths and allegations which have grown up around this issue.</P>
    <P>The first of these myths is that the Defence Forces pay award is really worth only 2 per cent because they would have received 10 per cent in any case under the system of linkages which already applied.  Deputies will be interested to know that to implement the <Col N="1241" /> system of increases which would have been granted had the pay committee never existed would have cost £2.5 million in 1989.  To implement the committee's recommendations will, in fact, cost £12.5 million in 1989.  To suggest therefore that a package of measures costing five times as much is worth only 2 per cent is certainly pure nonsense. Given the persistence of the misrepresentation on this point, I must conclude that those responsible know nothing about the system of pay and allowances in the Defence Forces and that, having been told the facts, do not wish to acknowledge the true position.</P>
    <P>The second myth that I should like to dispel is that there was some alternative open to the Government on the issue of phasing.  All but one of the increases in allowances for duties of a military nature are being implemented immediately and have been paid, as have all arrears from 1 January last.  In the area of basic pay, the Government do not have the complete freedom of movement implied in many of the comments which have been made.  Deputies either support the provisions relating to public service pay set out in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> or they do not and are prepared to tolerate a free for all on public service pay.  The Government's position is clear. We stand for restraint, tempered with fairness.</P>
    <P>It has also been alleged that, by increasing the cost of obtaining discharge by purchase, I have sought to make prisoners of the Defence Forces.  This is utter rubbish.  The decision to increase these charges was taken in principle at the end of last year.  The cost of discharge by purchase was last increased in April 1981 and I am sure that a review was long overdue.</P>
    <P>Much has been made of the decision to increase the maximum rate of discharge by purchase from £1,200 to £5,000.  I would point out, however, that this rate applies only to personnel who have received full-time apprenticeships with the Defence Forces and who wish to leave before their term of engagement is completed.  These are personnel with <Col N="1242" /> very valuable skills.  The cost to the taxpayer of training these personnel greatly exceeds £5,000 and in some cases can reach £70,000.  Again I want to emphasise of course, nobody is obliged to buy his way out of the Defence Forces; the personnel concerned are entitled to free discharge once their terms of engagement expire.  There are, therefore, no financial prisoners in the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>It has been alleged that because of the controversy surrounding pay, there is a crisis in the morale of the Defence Forces.  Many commentators, both inside and outside this House, have sought to inject the maximum amount of drama into the situation.  Many inaccurate and indeed misleading statements have been made using intemperate language. Today, for example, a national newspaper carries a completely misleading statement about numbers leaving the Defence Forces.  The factual position &mdash; and I want to place on the record of this House that I must deal in facts &mdash; is that during January the total number who left was 81.  To add to this the number who applied for discharge, that is, those who may leave in February, is to engage in double counting.  I have to deal in facts and I intend doing so.</P>
    <P>I would strongly ask all who feel obliged to make public statements on this issue to stop and consider the consequences of their actions.  I would particularly appeal to Opposition spokesmen to reflect on the wisdom of using the Defence Forces as a platform from which to attack the Government.  The Defence Forces occupy a unique position of importance.  They should not be used as a political football.  This principle has been accepted since the foundation of the State.  I hope that it will continue to be observed.</P>
    <P>Since the Government announced their decision with regard to Defence Forces pay, I have refrained from commenting on many of the more absurd allegations which have been made.  I have felt constrained, not because I regard the issue as unimportant but, on the contrary, because I regard the Defence Forces as too important to be dragged into a party <Col N="1243" /> political dog fight.  I would ask Deputies to reflect on this.  If they are sincere in their protestations about Defence Forces morale, they should weigh carefully the long-term effects of their own actions in that regard.</P>
    <P>The root cause of the economic problem which faced the Government when they came into office was a form of impatience which had refused to accept economic reality.  Yes, Deputy Kelly, that is true.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">

        <i>(Limerick West):</i> Now that the Government have succeeded in repairing much of the damage to the economy, we need patience as never before.  I hope Deputy Kelly will understand that.  There has been talk that, since the immediate crisis in the public finances has been overcome, the agenda needs to be broadened.  I fear this could very easily become a pressure to increase spending beyond affordable limits, or to reduce the level of taxation below what is necessary to pay for State services.  I repeat, we must remain patient.  The economy is not yet in a position to afford substantial give-aways to any group.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> In the budget, the Minister for Finance has had to reconcile many conflicting objectives. He is to be particularly commended for making an extra provision of £57.5 million to ensure that the most vulnerable groups in our society are protected.  It goes without saying that in order for more resources to be deployed in this area, restraint is required in others.</P>
      <P>We in Government are besieged by claims that the system of taxation in this country is unduly harsh on ordinary working people with modest incomes.  In this year's budget, further improvements are made, particularly with regard to those in the low or middle income groups. Increases in the income tax exemption limits, with a particular emphasis on families with children, will remove 24,000 taxpayers from the tax net completely. In addition, the standard rate of income tax will be reduced below 35 per cent for the first time in decades.  To those who would ask for more relief and sooner, I can only reiterate the need for patience. There is no denying the fact that there are many people in this country who pay a higher level of taxation than they can comfortably afford.  The Government cannot solve all problems at the same time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is, of course, more to economic management than financial reform at the centre.  There are many specific initiatives which a Government can encourage at local level to encourage employment.  In this year's budget the Minister for Finance has announced a number of such measures.  These include a special scheme of bank loans for young people who are innovative, measures to encourage urban renewal and initiatives in the area of tourism. I am particularly pleased with the allocation of £100,000 towards the cost of restoring King John's Castle and its environs in Limerick.  This project is of major importance to the Limerick area. When completed, I am certain it will help <Col N="1245" /> in the development of tourism throughout the mid-west region.</P>
    <P>All in all, the general economic outlook has improved enormously since this Government introduced their first budget in 1987.  At that time the entire country was in a mood of despair.  People were beginning to believe that the economic stagnation of the early and mid eighties was a permanent feature of life in Ireland.  Business confidence was at an all time low and many despaired of our ability to correct the mess which had been created.  However, the results of three decisive budgets, coupled with many other initiatives, have transformed the situation.  Public spending has been reined.  Interest rates have been brought down and held down.  In 1988 average registered unemployment fell by almost 6,000 compared with 1987, the first such decline since 1979.</P>
    <P>We can face 1989 with a certain degree of optimism.  The level of inflation is set to remain below 3 per cent.  Interest rates are likely to remain reasonably stable &mdash;at levels below UK rates.  The world economy should continue to grow, albeit at a slightly reduced rate.  Exports should continue expanding.  All in all the forecast of a 3 per cent growth rate for 1989 seems quite reasonable.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I would point out that when considering the economy we must judge both its condition and its direction. The condition of the economy may be deficient in some respects.  However, the direction is correct.  If we persevere in the right direction, then the condition of the economy will inevitably improve.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister eloquently exhorted the Irish people to patience.  I was the first of the Irish people to hear his exhortation and I must confess to feeling fairly impatient at the terms in which he expressed this pious desire.  He said that in the seventies and eighties we as people were unwilling to wait until our economy could afford to provide the standard of living and social services we observed in wealthier countries.  The poor old people of Ireland have to take the blame for the prodigality of those <Col N="1246" /> years.  The old sow has to get another lash across its back for sinking to its knees under the burden of debt laid on it in those years.  Who were to be seen, photographed shaking hands with, clapping on the back, flattering, sluthering and pandering to every section and group who wanted a few extra quid during those years but members of the Fianna Fáil Party when they were out of office?  Now they are in and we are all to be patient. When they were out there was no talk of patience.  If a Fine Gael Minister spoke about patience or restraint he was told he was a Thatcherite, obsessed with book-keeping. In the interests of a dead ideology he was planting his foot on the neck of the Irish people and destroying the hopes of the younger generation.  That is the kind of language we heard from the far side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope it will be seen to the credit of this party&mdash;I suppose it is a vain hope because in politics there is no gratitude &mdash;that at least the Government are not getting that kind of talk from us this time. We are not identifying with every pressure group who come to the door, agreeing with them that the Government should produce a few more million and that they are Thatcherite and book-keeping obsessed to refuse it.  We do not flatter them. I had an intimidatory group of teachers on my doorstep&mdash;I call them that not because of their manners, which were impeccable, but because of their excessive numbers, in the region of 30 or 40. This did not happen when Fine Gael were in Government but rather when the Minister opposite and his colleagues were in office.  I did not give them one inch, nor did any of my colleagues.  I fought the Government's battle for them.  I said I considered the Government had done all the country could afford at that time and that I did not consider they should go any further.  I refused to go into the lobby against my own party merely to embarrass a Government who, for once, were trying to do the right thing.  When did a Fianna Fáil Deputy ever treat people on his doorstep like that?  When did he ever tell them the truth, although he probably had the same kind of insight about the <Col N="1247" /> conditions of the mid-seventies or the mid-eighties when he was out of Government? Such considerations go to the wall when it is a question of doing down the other side, getting them out and getting one's own party in.  That is the kind of village pitch and toss school political morality which, if we are not very lucky, will leave this country in the hands of the Cubans before we are finished.</P>
    <P>We are back on the old budget debate again.  I have often complained about the budget fetish which, needless to say, is due solely to the fact that the English have it.  The Chancellor of the Exchequer in the old days used to show up with his silk top hat, his spats and his striped pants and his battered despatch box.  It was a lady's day in the spring.  Spring breezes fluttered the silks and muslins of the ladies as they crowded through the visitors' entrance at Westminster.  Naturally, the Irish Free State and the Irish Republic when it followed on the heels of that polity had to ape the same manners. There is not a battered despatch box but no doubt if Ministers leave it behind for their successors it will become battered in time.  The current Minister for Finance and his predecessors are not above the old fetish concerning budget secrets in a little box which will have to wait until the afternoon.  The gallery is filled with their families, the ladies not wearing silks and muslins at the beginning of the year but certainly dolled up for the day.  It is a big occasion because the English treat it as a big occasion.  No other country in Europe has this absurd fetish of budget day when the entire Government programme in fiscal terms has to be put on paper and delivered in the course of a speech.  It is an idiotic fetish which we should get rid of.</P>
    <P>Not a single measure announced in the budget could not as easily be announced on any other day of the year, including Christmas Day, as far as the law of the State is concerned.  There is not a single financial resolution imposing excise duties which could not be imposed on any other day of the year.  In the past such resolutions have frequently been <Col N="1248" /> imposed.  No law and no clause of the Constitution prevents an infinite number of Finance Bills, one amending or modifying the other, introducing changes in income tax, VAT rates or any of the financial measures which require a legislative basis.  These could be spread through the year and we would not be brought here for this big occasion on budget day when people fight for tickets to hear a dull speech for an hour and a half.  The most recent was as dull as I have ever heard.  They have all been dull, from both sides, since I became a Deputy almost 20 years ago.</P>
    <P>The mentality of producing the Government's measures for the year on a particular day is damaging.  The Government should realise that they are in control of a much more finely tuned set of mechanisms and should not feel committed to producing the whole thing on a particular day.  They should say at the beginning of a year and for reasons of convenience to do with calendar and so forth, that they will make a certain number of changes and that they are not pre-empted from making further changes later as they could make changes of a beneficent kind or of a kind which will profit the economy or whatever the perceived necessity at the time may be.  This idea that everything has to be forced into this single big occasion of Westminster dimensions is something we should get away from.</P>
    <P>A budget debate is useful because, by tradition, one can talk about more or less anything which either approximately or remotely has to do with the economy and its management.  The Minister is a reasonably taciturn Member of the House and&mdash;I must admit&mdash;he does not bore the ears off us very often or offer to speak unless he has to.  He does not intrude wantonly on the time of the House either in Government or Opposition. Since I do not know him very well, he may genuinely be under the impression that people on this side of the House object to what he calls &ldquo;the Government's overall strategy&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1249" /> I have no objection to the Government's overall strategy so far as that consists of controlling expenditure.  That cannot be done without hurting people and it may be&mdash;I do not want to appear to be indifferent to this&mdash;that some of the hurt is being borne by the wrong people.  If that were&mdash;and is&mdash;the case I would be anxious to see it corrected. However, in general terms, I have no objection at all to it.  The only objection I have&mdash;and it is one I have had in and out of season no matter which party are in Government&mdash;is to the callowness of the effort which a pure budgetary operation represents.  We need something a great deal more in the nature of deep ploughing of the economy and of the society which subtends the economy, to use a word which I know Deputy McCartan is fond of&mdash;I remember it from my days of learning geometry.</P>
    <P>The society subtends the economy, it stretches beneath it so to speak, and the economy is built upon it.  Many of the weaknesses in our economy essentially arise through the disposition of our society, some of them related to demography, family size, life patterns and so on, which are not amenable to Government interference &mdash; nor do I suggest such a thing&mdash;but more of them are matters related to the national psychology which can be turned around and changed over a period.  Huge changes can be achieved in people's outlook and the way they look at the world in a short period.  I do not want to produce an instance which is too disastrously and exaggeratedly larger in scale than what I am talking about, but let us, for example, look at an event in European history like the Reformation.  I am not taking sides, all I am saying is that there is a huge difference between the European world as it was before the Reformation and&mdash; certainly a very large section of it, the Protestant section&mdash;afterwards.</P>
    <P>In the 15th century European man was terrified of this shadow.  He thought there were devils, witches and beasties around the place and crazy old women were burned as witches.  He savagely persecuted any lack of orthodoxy according <Col N="1250" /> to his own frequently extremely ignorant, superstitious and ruthless precedent.  He believed things that no one now believes, whether they wear a clerical collar or not. However, during that time, man not only believed in these things but he was terrified of their shadow and sound.  He celebrated about one day out of three as a saint's day, he went on pilgrimages and worshipped relics of a kind which, if they were all gathered together, would have represented one thousand times the bulk of the original saint's body or bones for which they were being sold, bartered and marketed.  That was medieval man.</P>
    <P>One hundred years later the spell was broken, at least for a large part of Europe, and these were the same people, the same blood, the same Germans, French and English, their minds had been changed, they were no longer willing to believe things which were absurd and were no longer willing to enforce those beliefs by cruelty.  The burning of witches and all these things went out of fashion although they were the same people with the blood of their grandfathers and greatgrandfathers coursing through their veins.</P>
    <P>I am not pretending that we are faced here with a problem which is in any sense &mdash;except an absurd one&mdash;comparable with the immense convolution I have just referred to in talking about the late Middle Ages.  Of course, I am not making any such suggestion but I am saying that it is possible to change a people's mentality, not by blood, fire and sword, but by careful Government and by inspired and understanding Government.  That is something of which I am afraid I saw no sign in the Minister's budget last week. Equally, I saw no sign of it in the budget produced by this side of the House when we were in office.</P>
    <P>At present there is huge emigration.  I have frequently said inside and outside the House that I see no harm in emigration provided it is rational and not permanent.  In particular I have advocated that we should look towards the European Continent which is only an hour or an hour and a half away by air, and flights are getting cheaper all the <Col N="1251" /> time.  We should almost think in terms of commuting there because there is a centripetal tendency in the Community, against which we have to fight.  We are on the outer periphery of it and no amount of investment will counteract that.  We must understand our position as being on a periphery which, like all the other peripheries of the Community, tends to become drained of its resources towards the centre.  We should not fight it but roll with the punch as it were and try to make the most of it.  If we cannot employ our people here at home except at an unacceptably low standard, let us think of the possibilities there are for them an hour to the east so that we can see them at weekends and not merely once a year.</P>
    <P>I heard our Deputy Noonan make an excellent speech delivered at no notice in response to the budget.  He talked about a commentator&mdash;I knew immediately who he meant&mdash;who is a great admirer of the Taoiseach and has been shouting &ldquo;hurrah&rdquo; for him for the last 20 years. This commentator gave the last Government an unmerciful lashing day in day out because of their presiding over a sinking economy and so on, and who is chiefly remarkable and notable in the literary sense for having documented the decline of an Irish town back in the fifties.</P>
    <P>Only a couple of days before our Deputy Noonan made his speech, I had read articles&mdash;as it turned out he had also read them&mdash;which ran for two or three days in <i>The Irish Times</i> about the human desolation in the eastern parts of County Mayo at present.  I am rather out of touch with rural Ireland living where I do but my colleagues in the party tell me that it is the same everywhere else. There is a great silence over the place and Knock Airport is used mostly for returning emigrants and for funerals.  The big hospitality dispensed by the publicans in that area is to funeral parties.  The remains of loved ones are brought in from abroad.  I am not producing this as a stick with which to beat the Government, I am quite certain that the underlying causes were there in our time too, but if that is so, we should try to understand why it <Col N="1252" /> is so.  It is not all because of financial economic necessity.</P>
    <P>I can quite understand it where you suddenly get a factory closure and the people in the district have been conditioned to expect employment only in terms of being found a place in a factory. Naturally there will be devastation, human as well as everything else, and naturally the only thing people can think of, if they cannot easily get another job, is to emigrate.  The descriptions of the awful rushing and clambering to try to get any kind of a little job in whatever other little business might be nearby are heart-rending.  I am sure the Minister had the same reaction if he read the articles. However, it is not all like that.</P>
    <P>I saw the response of the Conference of Major Religious Superiors to the budget.  It was a very disappointed response and they assert&mdash;I do not question their sincerity&mdash;that the big end of emigration is involuntary emigration.  I question that, I am not contradicting it because I do not have the facts necessary to do so authoritatively.  The truth is that nobody really knows why this or that percentage of people emigrate.  My two elder sons, in their early and mid-twenties, are abroad, one in London and one in America.  They were not driven out of the country by economic necessity and neither of them ever looked for a job in Ireland.  The temperament of one is such that he finds it more exciting, interesting, amusing and promising to live in London while the other is pursuing further studies in America which he cannot pursue here. These are two perfectly ordinary boys who are not distinguishable from tens of thousands of others of their age but they are not involuntary emigrants.  I hope that one or other of them will come back. If they do not return they must be counted as emigrants but no one has driven them out.</P>
    <P>What then leads to such people leaving the country?  That is the sort of question the Government should ask themselves. It is not simply a matter of putting a factory at the end of every boreen so that every mother can have each of her sons home for tea but rather of delivering a <Col N="1253" /> country which is exciting, interesting and open enough, with frontiers within itself which recede into the distance, which will excite young people and get them to see that this is a country which has a buzz of a different kind from that in England or America.  If our young people want to look abroad I think they should look towards continental Europe where they can go as of right.  We do not have to skulk around Germany or Holland as illegals waiting for someone to make up ballads such as the one about the illegals of 1988 which, incidentally, has a grand truculent ring to it.  We do not need to skulk around Europe as illegals as we are entitled to go there but who thinks along those lines? If one were to visit a school they could say, statistically, that between 30 per cent and 40 per cent of the leaving class will be abroad in Baltimore or in Camden Town in 12 or 18 months' time.  If one were to ask the students why they do not think in terms of going to Eindhoven or Frankfurt, natural politeness would prevent them from saying this, but they would think that one was taking leave of their senses.</P>
    <P>A Government should try to discover what exactly it is that makes people leave as in most cases it is not economic necessity and they should ask themselves whether a silent judgment is not being passed on the style and atmosphere of the society over which they so smugly preside and see whether something can be done about it at that level.  People find this country boring, which it does not have to be and which it is not for those who have been lucky to find a fulfilling niche, occupation or profession but for many it is.  Why is it boring and what can a Government do to enlighten themselves about what they are doing wrong, and about the way in which they are steering their society and presiding over it?</P>
    <P>There is another dimension which the Government ought to address.  There is a resistance to anything which is not employment of a kind in which you do what you are told or of a kind which traditionally is of the middle class, white collar professional sort.  No Government have ever made a serious attempt to bring <Col N="1254" /> forward a tradition of craftwork, of skilled and highly individual work done by hand.  I am not talking about the making of souvenirs but rather about the whole range of individualised craftwork on which the modern world is placing an increasing importance.  The Waterford Glass enterprise is the one big exception to the rule but what is happening with that company?  Their order books are full and their customers are angry and disappointed because they cannot get deliveries. That company do not seem to be able to get their act together.  I am aware that there are other crystal factories but there should be 100 such different trades and specialised, individualised enterprises. The modern world is becoming homogenised, everybody now uses the same makes of sports equipment, listens to Walkman radios and drives the same types of car.  This is something that the human spirit rebels and revolts against. When people have any discretionary income they are willing to spend it on things which are not homogenised and they value something which is individual and produced by hand.</P>
    <P>At the beginning of January I spent three weeks in Germany.  I have an old Aran sweater which one of my sons gave me.  It is now getting a bit seedy and run down as it has been washed and worn so often but I wear it when I am working. More than one German spotted me wearing it&mdash;it was dilapidated in the sense that perhaps they would not be seen dead in it&mdash;but they recognised it as being hand made and that gave it a value quite independent of its calorific or aesthetic qualities.  It was the work of an individual human eye and hand and this raised it above the homogenised level of industrial products.  That is a perception which was documented about 15 years ago by Dr. Kieran Kennedy who was then head of the ESRI in an absolutely marvellous report on the Danish economy.  In many respects the Danes have to contend with some of the peripheral problems we have to contend with but they have thrived as a result of concentrating on what was individual, small scale and high quality. They are associated in people's minds <Col N="1255" /> with those values and that is a large part of the secret of their success.</P>
    <P>An Irish Government ought to put their minds to that matter seriously and in doing so they should run their eye around the things in this country which prosper and which get written about in the inflight magazine, <i>Cara</i>, such as the making of harpsichords in some out of the way place, or making an unusual kind of sheep's cheese.  Such activity may be easy to sneer at and laugh at but these are the high quality products which mean prosperity.  More than likely they are being made by foreigners&mdash;an English woman running a hotel, a German raising a herd of deer, a Canadian running a shall fish farm or a couple of Belgians producing quality woollen products. Very rarely will it be a person of native Irish blood who sees an opportunity such as that and makes the most of it.  This is not because we are worse than anybody else or are defective in any way but rather that we are not trained or encouraged to think like that and are shy about inviting people in, as we should do and which is what many countries have done in the past, to show us how these things are done.  A Government who are struggling &mdash;I suppose the Government with their awful record in creating the problem must be struggling&mdash;with the problems of unemployment and emigration ought to ask themselves whether there is a level in the Irish psychology which needs to be addressed and to see, as a consequence, whether our education system, including linguistics education and industrial education, needs to be, in a crash programme, rapidly overhauled before we have the social and psychological infrastructure on which a healthy economy can be built.</P>
    <P>In half an hour I am by no means able to draw up a complete list of the things I think are important to mention but perhaps most damaging of the items is our idiotic complacency, the formal official complacency of the Irish.  We are not, as individuals, complacent.  Talking over a drink or in conversation with our friends or family we are not complacent but we <Col N="1256" /> feel publicly and officially that we have to be complacent.  There is an awful lot of second to noneism in this country. Publicly we say that everything here is second to none.  We say that the streets of Dublin are second to none.  About three years ago I remember making a very disparaging speech about the vile, dilapidated and run down condition of this city which is certainly the scruffiest between here and Calcutta, and I was attacked by a colleague of mine in my own party, a member of Dublin Corporation, who said that Deputy Kelly was an elitist and spends too much of his time abroad in the university cities and does not understand that Dublin is second to none in this, that and the other.</P>
    <P>I know that it is not second to none and as long as the public keep me here in the Dáil I will go on saying it and perhaps somebody will have the modesty to say no, it is not second to none.  We ought not to run millennia when we are a public reproach and when one cannot walk 100 yards in any direction from O'Connell Bridge without seeing something which would make one cry with shame and which ought to make a city councillor hang himself with shame.  We ought not to be running millennia when that is still true, but the complacency, the second to noneism, does not allow us to look at it like that.</P>
    <P>At the other end of the scale we had an example here of a miniature but very illuminating thing two days ago.  In mentioning the Minister, Deputy Reynolds, I do not want to single him out because I am certain he did only what he was recommended to do by his officials or what another Minister in his position would have done.  I put a question down here about the leprous condition of the bank notes, particularly the £1 notes.  Let me show the House what I got in change in the restaurant of Leinster House this afternoon.  Look at that.  That is the place where they sell food.  Look at that £5 note.  I sometimes get a bundle of £1 notes into my hand and I can smell them and I am perfectly certain, though everybody else here in the House may be <Col N="1257" /> laughing at it, I am only repeating an experience everybody else here has had. Do you know the answer I got from the Minister, Deputy Reynolds?  He rejected my use of the word &ldquo;insanitary&rdquo; to describe the banknotes.  He said they are circulated more now than they used to do.  That is perfectly true, but he would not use the word &ldquo;insanitary&rdquo;.  What word would he use when banknotes smell up at you from your hand?  They stink from your hand.  What kind of impression can that create on tourists when they come in and produce a glittering, clean German 100 DM note and get a filthy, leprous, crawling pile of these horrible little filthy rags into their hands in exchange?  But no, we are second to none.  Our currency is second to none and if any consideration is being given to improving the matter it will be all the better when the consideration is complete. They are thinking now of a £1 coin. It is harder to make a coin permanently filthy than a piece of porous paper.  They are thinking of it because the English, of course, have a £1 coin.  We should be thinking ahead of them; we should be thinking of £2 and, yes, £5 coins because that is where we are going to end at the rate of the depreciation of currency.</P>
    <P>Many people will think this is just eccentric elitism once again.  It is not.  It is a scandal that a Minister could pretend or think it was his job to pretend that our currency is not a reproach to us.  Let me add as a footnote to this complacency that it is backed up and made worse by a streak of mandarinism, official and ministerial.  I put that question about the banknotes down in this form: &ldquo;To ask the Minister for Finance if he has noticed the increasingly insanitary condition of the paper currency.&rdquo; When the question appeared on the Order Paper that had been changed to read &ldquo;To ask the Minister for Finance if his attention has been drawn to the increasingly insanitary condition of the banknotes&rdquo;.  Therefore, a Minister is not allowed to notice.  The silly ass solemnity which is part of this complacency is such that somebody feels it his job not to allow a Minister to notice <Col N="1258" /> things.  He is not supposed to touch currency himself.  He is like old Queen Mary in England or another of the Royal Family who would saunter up through Harrods or Marshall and Snelgrove's picking up an umbrella here, a reticule there, and ten steps behind went a detective discreetly paying.  He had the banknotes in his pocket.  The Queen, naturally, must not be allowed to touch or even see money; or, as is the case in this country, to smell it, and the Minister must not be allowed to notice it.  He has to have it at best drawn to his attention. That is the kind of silly ass solemnity and complacency I want us to get away from, and until Government go into retreat and examine their consciences about the psychology from which we all spring and which we all have to fight &mdash; I the same as everybody else &mdash; and ask about our level of imperviousness to proper standards of cleanliness, punctuality, delivery, of being at a place when you say you will be there, keeping something tidy, we need not be amazed when tourism does not explode or explodes only in terms of returning emigrants.</P>
    <P>That is nothing like all I have to say but it is all I have time to say.  The budget debate is useful enough and I have no objection to the overall effort of the Government to save money, but if they think that strategy by itself is going to rescue this economy they are making a serious mistake.  Only when they address their minds to education in particular and to whatever other levels on which it may be possible to approach the national psychology in order to achieve our turn around in as deep and radical a way as, for example, the Reformation in the 16th century in regard to the psychology of the European Continent, will we be able to look forward, situated as we are on the rim of the world, to the prosperity we all talk about.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Minister for Finance on his first budget.  He is in a unique position because fully 80 per cent of this House accept the main thrust of the budget, according to their comments now.  All the debate, therefore, is about small details of the budget.  It is a good budget.  It is responsible.  It is sympathetic towards those on very low incomes and those with particular problems. It started on the road to getting personal income tax down to a reasonable level.  That is only a start, it is true, but it is the first move in that direction for many years.  We have had an effort to whip up concern about a proposal that the better off families, probably those with an income over £30,000 per year, would lose the children's allowance.  I doubt if many tears will be shed in the majority of homes if such a proposal were to be implemented.  It is not the function of the Minister for Finance to share out between husband and wife the income of the country's top earners.  If that is the most serious criticism of the budget then it is away and flying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Opposition have complained about changes in house loan interest relief but, to be fair, their protest has been very muted.  Well it might be, as an examination of the proposals under this heading will show.  The scheme was never intended to give relief to a well off person purchasing a luxury property.  Such a person is not entitled to help from the ordinary taxpayer.  If the purchaser is moving upmarket just to keep up with the Joneses he should pay for such a move and not expect support from the taxpayer, the ordinary man.  The interest relief is intended to help the taxpayer in the purchase of a decent three or four bedroomed house and that type of relief will never be at risk from Fianna Fáil. We must keep in mind the easement on loan repayments arising from the present low level of interest here as a consequence of very low inflation.  Low interest is a much better contribution than interest relief.  The economy has <Col N="1260" /> steadied, as is recognised at home and abroad.  Irish interest rates are holding independent of the repeated increases in Britain and are a clear indication of the healthy state of the economy.  The Government's steady handling of the economy explains the state of the economy, and the budget and its benefits are a logical result.</P>
    <P>Sir, I should have said at the commencement that I propose to share part of my time with Deputy Denis Foley.  If we can afford more benefits we can treat ourselves to more benefits, but only then. Our greatest single need is the creation of real, productive jobs in industry, tourism, service industries and anywhere a productive job can be created.  The atmosphere is coming right; indeed, the creation is now in hand.  Like everyone else, I find the pace too slow but we are on the right road.  The budget is an essential part of the recovery plan.  It provides a sound base from which to move.  The most important thing is confidence and we have at present partly restored belief in ourselves.  Many industries lost in recent years could be revived. It is incumbent on us to make the most of our resources.</P>
    <P>When I was first elected to this House in 1973 I sought support for an ailing tanning industry which at that time was providing more than 100 jobs in County Monaghan.  I continued my fight for that industry over many years but the concerns collapsed.  Since then we have produced a better quality of animal hides because of the success of our warble fly eradication scheme but in excess of 90 per cent of them are exported.  At the same time we import more than 90 per cent of our footwear requirements.  The manufacture of footwear has been a tradition in my area for generations.  We had many small family concerns and some of them continue to flourish.  It is our duty as public representatives to bring to the attention of Ministers any industry that is capable of even providing one job.  If we do that we will succeed in creating many small industries throughout the country.</P>
    <P>In the course of his speech the Minister <Col N="1261" /> dealt with the development programme and the aid from the Structural Funds. He told us that it was the Government's intention to make maximum use of the increased funding decided at the Summit Meeting of February 1988 in preparation for the single market in 1992.  It is appropriate that we should examine the allocations under the Structural Funds and compare them with those paid out under the ERDF since it was established in March 1975.  The criteria under the ERDF are laid down in Regulation 724/75 of the Council of 18 March 1975 which established that fund.  That regulation states:</P>
    <P>Whereas regional development requires investment in industrial or service activities ensuring that new jobs are created and existing jobs maintained on the one hand, and on the other, investment in infrastructures directly linked to the development of these activities; whereas it is necessary to contribute to the creation in certain less-favoured agricultural areas, of adequate, collective facilities to ensure that farming is continued and a minimum population maintained;</P>
    <P>Whereas the principle should be adopted that the fund's assistance should be allocated according to the relative severity of regional imbalances; whereas account should also be taken of other factors determining the interest of investments from the point of view of the region concerned as well as from that of the Community;</P>
    <P>Since 1975 we have received £565 million under the ERDF.  Counties Cavan, Leitrim and Monaghan, which have been seriously affected by the Border troubles, fared worst of all of the 26 counties with a total allocation of £12.7 million.  That amounts to about £1 million per year for the three counties or a little more than £300,000 per year per county.  It is interesting to note that 14 other counties received more than the combined total of those counties, including our neighbours in Louth whose representatives are complaining that they are not getting an adequate share.  There is no doubt that <Col N="1262" /> we have grounds for complaint in regard to the distribution of those funds.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the distribution on a regional basis.  The entire province of Connacht and the three counties of Ulster received £105 million as against £98 million for Cork and £127 million for Dublin.  The total for the six Border counties represents 10 per cent of the £565 million while that allocated to the counties of Connacht and Ulster represents less than 20 per cent of the fund. There is no basis, in regard to the population or the location of the counties, for the grossly unequal distribution of those funds.  The Directive clearly states that special recognition should be taken of peripheral and disadvantaged areas.  That was also the conclusion of the EC Social and Economic Committee following their visit to and survey of the Border region in 1983.  However, their conclusions, and the terms of the Directive, were completely disregarded.</P>
    <P>We are entering a new era and we are being told that the EC will be concerned with programmes rather than projects. We have advisory groups, working groups, regional and national plans but in my view they will amount to no more than the same as before.  Now is the time to set guidelines so that there will be a fair distribution of EC funds in Border counties.</P>
    <P>The Regional Fund to date has provided 50 per cent of estimated project cost.  At the Summit meeting in February last is was agreed that not alone would additional funding be provided &mdash; a doubling of the fund was mentioned &mdash; but that the percentage would be increased to a maximum of 75 per cent in some cases.  The problem with matching funding, be it 25 per cent or 50 per cent, is that it has to be provided from three sources, the Exchequer, local authorities or private subscription.  The applications must come from development agencies in the region and local authorities.  We must remember that double nothing does not amount to anything.  In my view the EC have a responsibility to ensure that these funds are devoted to areas most in need of them.  The EC study stated that <Col N="1263" /> Leitrim, Cavan and Monaghan were the most disadvantaged counties in a disadvantaged region.  Particular attention was paid to the town of Clones and the group singled it out for special attention because trading in it had collapsed due to the Border troubles.  A project has been put forward for the area and I hope it is given sympathetic consideration.</P>
    <P>We have heard a lot about studies but in my view too many studies are being carried out.  We can rest assured that the EC will provide money for all the studies we want to carry out but I wonder if we need to carry out any more.  I have the results of many studies carried out in the Border region in my possession but what we want now is money and action.  Local sources are not in a position to provide money for the matching funding scheme and as a result of that we are losing out heavily.</P>
    <P>I compliment Deputy Seamus Kirk on the work he has done in relation to An Bord Glas.  When reviewing the year's activities it is seldom that a Minister can look back and say that he has met the job targets which he set himself.  It looks as if An Bord Glas with a five year plan are well positioned to reverse the trend of massive fruit and vegetable importation. No one has been more critical of the importation of fresh vegetables and fruit than I have been.  When we were in Opposition a number of Fianna Fáil Deputies travelled north and south of the border to study fruit and vegetable growing techniques and it is on those studies that the Minister has based his plan.  The Minister has had a terrific measure of success.</P>
    <P>Recently Monaghan Mushrooms announced development proposals which should lead to an expansion by more than 40 per cent in mushroom production. This, together with other expansion plans currently in preparation, indicates that the mushroom industry will double in the next three to four years.  This will result in exports valued at about £20 million and it will give increased employment of about 300 in the mushroom companies and of another 1,200 in the growing and <Col N="1264" /> harvesting of crops.  In relation to the nursery stock, over the next five years it is hoped to create an additional 400 jobs giving an increase in production worth £7 million.</P>
    <P>In 1986, 104,000 tonnes of potatoes valued at £12 million were imported. Over the last two years the imports have reduced dramatically and we are now importing only 30,000 tonnes of potatoes. There was a weakness in this sector with regard to chipped potatoes but Donegal Foods are now hoping to capture 30 per cent of that market.  The Government are looking to the EC with regard to producer group regulations and for assistance in providing storage for potatoes.  We need storage capacity for 80,000 tonnes of potatoes.  I support the Government in that aim.  I was involved in the potato business and 20 years ago I visited Scotland to look at their storage facilities.</P>
    <P>An Bord Glas has recently taken over Lairds of Drumshanbo and this can be interpreted as a vote of confidence in the soft fruit industry.  As a result of meetings in Monaghan and Cavan it has been ensured that there will be enough growers to substantially increase the throughput there.  We visited orchards in Kilkenny and we saw great opportunities there also for expansion in production.</P>
    <P>In my constituency we have a thriving poultry industry which is continuing to expand.  This industry is giving very good employment and we have a wide range of products for the export market.</P>
    <P>On a number of occasions over the last few years there were media scares about disease, the most recent, a month before Christmas about salmonella in eggs.  This was a false alarm because no trace of it was found in commercial eggs.  Since that scare producers suffered heavy losses due to reduced prices because they had to export much of their products as they could not sell them on the home market. Most of these producers have to make repayments on housing, equipment and replacement stock.  The Department should ensure that there is no media hype in relation to allegations of disease in future.  Unless an allegation is well substantiated it should not get the damaging <Col N="1265" /> publicity which salmonella got on the last occasion.</P>
    <P>In my constituency replacement and new poultry sheds are being built on a continuing basis.  All of those poultry sheds are imported.  I have raised this with the IDA.  The sheds have a very sophisticated system of ventilation and so on.  The Confederation of Irish Industry are moaning about lack of work.  They should apply themselves to this area and they should arrange with the IDA for the manufacture of those sheds.  This is a very obvious need which I have brought to the notice of the authorities and I will continue to bring it to the notice of the authorities until action is taken.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have this opportunity to speak on the budget and I congratulate the Minister on introducing his first budget.  The budget confirms the commitment of this Government to bringing order to the public finances and to build up the economy.  This commitment is consistent with the overall strategy set out in the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i>  That programme which has the support of the major social partners will continue to provide a framework for economic and social development and thus will reduce the burden of taxation and provide extra resources for those most at risk in our society.  In under two years in office the Government have succeeded in lifting the country from doom and gloom.  We are in a new phase of growth and we have confidence in our ability to succeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government have once again demonstrated their commitment to tourism in real and practical terms in the budget.  The Government came to office two years ago with a programme to develop tourism &mdash; the first Government to recognise the potential for tourism and treat it seriously.  The policies have been specifically geared to free tourism from some of the fetters which limited its capacity to grow.  There has been a dramatic improvement in the fare structure from Britain and from some European countries.  This has been reflected in major increases in the number of visitors <Col N="1266" /> coming to Ireland.  The fact that we have dramatically reduced inflation has helped restore competition to the industry. Additional incentives matched by extra funds have meant a dramatic improvement in the quality and level of marketing being done not just by Bord Fáilte but by individual operators.  We have got the message across that tourism is competing in a very difficult world.  We must be competitive and aggressive in our marketing. Bord Fáilte have been given new direction and are providing sound leadership to the industry.  The results are being seen.</P>
    <P>In the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> the Government set clear targets for tourism &mdash; to double tourism numbers in five years, to generate a further £500 million in foreign revenue and in the process to create 25,000 new jobs.  At the end of the first year of that programme tourism has achieved a growth of 13.5 per cent.  It is very close to the target and it is almost double the international rate of growth.  While revenue figures are not yet available it is evident that there will be a substantial growth in foreign earnings. The review of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> has stated that industry has created 25,000 new jobs in the year.  This performance should be applauded and welcomed.  The prophets of doom and gloom seem to take more pleasure from decrying what this country does well rather than applauding our achievements.  Tourism has suffered more than most industries in this respect but despite the problems &mdash; rapid inflation, high costs, the damage done by the situation in Northern Ireland and the absence of product renewal or improvement, not to mention the growth of international competition, the tourism industry has continued to attract foreign revenue and create new jobs.  That is not to say we have any reason to be self-congratulatory or complacent, far from it.  The tourism industry constitutes an integral part of the solution of our economic problems and the rate of progress towards achieving the requisite targets must be accelerated.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will recall I announced on 4 November last that I had instructed my Department to expedite the preparation of a development plan for inland fisheries and, in particular, for sport angling in the <Col N="1268" /> context of the preparation of programmes to be linked to the EC Structural Funds.</P>
      <P>The preparation of these plans is proceeding apace in consultation with the regional fisheries boards and the central fisheries board.  Local development requirements are being identified and brought to the notice of the regional groups that have been charged with preparing regional plans for EC Structural Funds purposes.</P>
      <P>The recent ESRI report is an extremely welcome document as it provides valuable background material and insights into the economic characteristics and benefits of inland fisheries.  The challenge now &mdash; and this is the task of the plans which are being prepared &mdash; is to develop the specific policies and programmes, to carefully cost these and identify the benefits so as to provide the justification for increased investment from whatever source in the sector.  Any progress in this area will, of course, require the full cooperation of all the interests involved.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister be more specific: is he in a position at this stage to outline to the House the details of the proposals submitted by the coastal regions in relation to marine sport angling?  What is the precise approach being adopted by his Department in this area?  What plans have the Department and what are the guidelines they recommend be adhered to by those interested in sport angling in the different regions? Furthermore, would he be more specific in relation to inland fisheries because, since he assumed office, this matter has been discussed on numerous occasions? Could he outline in detail the development plans within his Department for inland fisheries development?  It is a contentious issue which has been raised on numerous occasions.</P>

Long before then I had clearly identified the necessity for drawing up an overall development plan for inland fisheries and sought the views of the regional fisheries boards and the central fisheries board in its preparation.  I am not prepared to be specific at this point because the plan has not been finalised. I can say that work is in progress on it.  If the Deputy has any valid proposals she thinks should be incorporated in it, we would welcome receiving them.</P>

      <P>I have received the proposals referred to by the Deputy.  I have welcomed this as a reasonable and positive contribution to the debate on the licensing issue.  The alterations in licence fees announced before Christmas last were in part based on the views of the National Anglers Representative Association. The implementation of other proposals put forward by that organisation would, in the main, require new legislation. Those proposals are the subject of ongoing examination by my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister is aware of the extreme urgency in this matter having regard to the fact that a new angling and tourist season is beginning? Having regard to the enormous losses arising from this dispute incurred in the last tourist season, would the Minister assure the House he is doing everything <Col N="1270" /> possible to bring about a settlement of this dispute?  Since the proposals he now welcomes were received by him some three weeks ago &mdash; and having regard to the urgency of the matter &mdash; would he not consider that he should have finalised consideration of all of those proposals in order to ascertain whether they contained the basis for a settlement of this dispute?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I moved very positively on the proposals and discussed them with the various representative associations and others.  We decided to reduce the composite licence &mdash; which is in line with the recommendation of the National Anglers Representative Association &mdash; that is the overall licence which covers all species, salmon, trout and coarse fish, from £40 to £25.  There has been a negative response from a certain element in this controversy to all our efforts.  I should say that the regulations and the licensing arrangement which will apply for the coming season are in place and will not be altered.</P>

Always we have been prepared to be flexible in the operation of this legislation.  In spite of all our efforts to resolve the issue there appears to be a minority intent on perpetrating this ill-advised campaign.  I might refer briefly to the ESRI report referred to by Deputy Taylor-Quinn.  An independent survey undertaken by the ESRI clearly indicated that in October &mdash; before the relevant legislation was <Col N="1271" /> introduced here which led to this controversy &mdash; 80 per cent of anglers supported the principle of a licence fee and indicated that, if it were introduced, they would be willing to buy one.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCoy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Marine the reason he has refused a company (details supplied) a licence to replace <i>MV Dolores D 182.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>As far back as September 1987, I decided to limit entry of additional beam trawlers on to the Irish fleet to tonne for tonne replacement.  This was, and remains, necessary because the number of such boats on the Irish register has grown significantly while the quotas available have not.  Beam trawlers are geared specifically towards fishing for sole.  In 1988, I was forced, in fulfilment of my duty as Minister as the sole quota had been exhausted, to prohibit sole fishing in the Irish Sea and off our south-east coast.</P>
      <P>This was to the detriment of smaller, locally based boats because beam trawlers were in a position to travel to other areas.  In 1989, a management regime was instituted for beam trawlers in the Irish Sea and south-east coast for sole to prevent such a scenario recurring.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The person referred to approached my Department informally with his proposal to replace <i>MV Dolores</i> and was informed of the policy requirements.  He <Col N="1272" /> then wrote outlining his plans to replace <i>MV Dolores</i> with a larger boat and was informed that this was not acceptable as the replacement boat was larger and involved greater fishing capacity.  The smaller capacity is geared to meeting the sole quota which we have available and we cannot entertain any further applications for these trawlers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnSMcCoy" hpid="Mr. McCoy Mr. McCoy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCoy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that not alone is tonnage at issue here but capability?  As the Minister rightly pointed out, larger boats can go further.  The person here had in mind a boat with refrigeration on board which would have added to the capability rather than the capacity.  I would add that the <i>MV Dolores</i> which he was replacing was to be sold to an English fishing company which would have taken it out of the tonnage of the Irish fleet.  Further, this proposal was self-financing and would not have been a strain on BIM grant funds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Marine if the Government intend purchasing a salvage tug or entering a joint venture with the private sector to provide such a facility, in view of the extensive pollution threats around the Irish coastline in recent times from abandoned ships.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate all those involved in the control and management of the <i>Yarrawonga</i> incident.  The co-operparticularly, the successful management of the <i>Yarrawonga</i> incident.  The co-operation between my Department, its Marine Survey Office, the CRS in Valentia, MRCC, the Department of Defence, the Navy and Air Corps, the UK Coastguard and the US Air Force was an example of how things should be done.</P>
      <P>Despite this success, it is the policy of my Department to review every incident to see if any lessons can be learned from incidents in which we are involved and this is being done.</P>
      <P>I have certain reservations about the Deputy's suggestion.  In the first instance, the responsibility for a vessel in difficulties and for any subsequent pollution it causes is that of the owner, not the State.  The cost of chartering a tug which would be capable of handling most emergencies would be substantially in excess of £1 million a year.  Specific emergencies would have specific requirements. Possession of any particular tug would not guarantee our ability to deal with all emergencies.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that to have a tug lying idle at the State's expense would place a burden on the taxpayer which would be difficult to justify.</P>

      <P>I would like to be associated with the Minister's congratulations to all those involved in the air and sea rescue of the <i>Yarrawonga.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can appreciate the Minister's position in relation to this matter.  Is there any possibility that the State would get involved with the private sector to in <Col N="1274" /> some way grant-aid a private operation because recently we experienced a very serious problem and the coastline could have been very badly polluted if the <i>Yarrawonga</i> had hit the coastline.  It is just fortunate that it was not 100 miles closer to the coast.  If it had been the Dutch tug might not have reached it in time and we would have had major pollution.  The Minister and the Taoiseach were quick to acknowledge that on the occasion.  I understand that the insurance involved in salvaging ships is quite considerable, so a private operation would be self-financing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The present arrangement whereby tugs, equipment and expertise can be chartered as required is probably more suitable, given the relatively small number of incidents.  One has to consider whether we would be better advised and better equipped if we spent the kind of money that would be needed to provide additional equipment.  There are two such tugs in the north-west area and our experience has been that it is less expensive and more efficient to charter what we need in particular circumstances.</P>

Since this matter was last raised in the House, has the Minister included in a claim any compensation to cover the general loss to the tourist and fishing interests in the west Cork area?  The itemisation of the £1.7 million includes departmental loss on expenditure.  Has the Minister sought a claim for general loss to environmental and tourist interests in the area?</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 12 together. Sea-fishing boat licences are issued on the direction of the Minister for the Marine under the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1983.  A fishing boat is not eligible to be registered with the Revenue Commissioners if it does not possess a licence.</P>
      <P>The development plan for the industry prepared by BIM does not depend on increased quotas to fulfil its aims.  The thrust of this plan is to exploit unused quotas for whitefish and prawns as well as increased landings of both demersal and pelagic species not subject to quotas, as well as shellfish.

      <P>My specific question was to inquire what steps have been taken to increase quotas.  I appreciate that the Minister's answer is to suggest that the plans of BIM are based on non-quota species.  Nonetheless, would the Minister not agree that a lot of the existing fleet, that must also be expanded and defended, rely upon quota species and that there must be an active campaign to improve upon the disastrous quotas that have been fixed for us since they were introduced in the EC?  Would he confirm that his Department have active plans to put matters right there?</P>

      <P>There has been an active campaign in this Department since both the Minister and I were appointed in March 1987.  Shortly after our appointments we met former Commissioner Cunha and impressed upon him the necessity if the industry were to develop, to increase quotas.  There is a perception &mdash; and I spoke on this subject on an Adjournment debate in reply to the Deputies opposite &mdash; that unless there is an increase in the mackerel quota there has been no success in Brussels.  This year we had success almost right across the board, apart from the mackerel quota and we have a régime this year&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I put it to the Minister that if we are to double the quotas in the BIM proposal, we will need to have factory type ships that will be able to go out into deeper international waters and catch non-quota type species as is indicated in the development document.  Will it be the policy of his Department to give licences for factory type ships, crewed by Irish people and under Irish ownership?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Most of the questions ask for details but this one does not. I cannot argue with the Deputy but I would be very anxious to receive a copy of the document he mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy referred to non-quota species such as horse mackerel for which there is a market in Japan, blue whiting and argentines.  We have got to put the horse before the cart rather than, as suggested by the Deputy, the cart before the horse.  There is exploratory fishing.  We are pursuing this matter very vigorously. Last year we ensured that moneys were made available for research both from the State and from Europe.  That gives us an opportunity to carry out research and development in relation to the markets and to establish if this type of fish is <Col N="1285" /> suitable for fish stick blocks.  If that is so, we will have to look at it.</P>
    <P>As yet, there is no established market, and I would advise any individual who is looking at a factory ship exclusively for non-quota species, to tread very carefully. Some ten years ago the same situation prevailed with horse mackerel.  It took some time for the market to develop, but as it developed the fishery industry also developed.  The Department, BIM and the industry themselves are now actively engaged in this research.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCoy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 55 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not accept that the development <Col N="1286" /> of the Irish sea fishing industry is being hindered by the Department's policy in relation to the issue of boat licences.  I referred to this matter earlier.</P>
    <P>Under section 222B, inserted by section 2 of the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1983, of the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act, 1959, the Minister for the Marine may issue or refuse applications for sea fishing boat licences.</P>
    <P>In view of the quotas allocated to Ireland for various stocks and the need to generally reduce the fleet size in terms of gross registered tonnage (GRT) under the EC structures programmes, there has been a tightening up of the issuing of licences with preferential treatment for cases where replacement on a tonne-for-tonne basis occurs.  Such a policy has already existed for some time for pelagic vessels and beam trawlers.  However, all applications are being considered on their own individual merits.  My concern is to ensure that any new entrant will be economically viable and will be so without unreasonably displacing the vessels already in the fleet.</P>
    <P>As far as our development plan for fisheries is concerned, the Deputies will be aware that the main emphasis of the plan is in non-quota species and aquaculture with a determined approach to both management of quota fisheries, and improved handling and fishing techniques. A number of exploratory fishing initiatives are being undertaken this year, in line with the programme prepared for us by BIM and approved and funded by the Government and the industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>The BIM report is based on non-quota and demersal species. The question refers specifically to pelagic vessels and beam trawlers and was raised earlier by Deputy McCartan. We are talking about two different types of fish pelagic <i>versus</i> the unused demersal quotas and the non-quota species which I referred to earlier.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>The concept of allowing new boat owners on the sea must be linked to a proper scheme of decommissioning existing trawlers, and trawlers being taken out of commission must not be made available either in these waters or elsewhere for fishing purposes.  Would the Minister care to comment on that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Decommissioning grants are available in some European countries, and some of those boats are finding their way into this country.  There is no room in this country for decommissioned boats because if they are not up to standard for other countries, then they are not up to standard for Ireland. Certainly, I can look into the matter but there are serious financial implications. It is a question that we would not continue to ignore.  We are looking at what can be done to assist the fishermen to bring boats out of the fleet and replace them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley" hpid="Mr. McGinley Mr. McGinley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I to understand that the fishing fleet engaged in demersal type fishing are not subject to the limitations of tonnage?  Also, does the Minister see that there may be a certain conflict between what is stated in the BIM plan of 70 extra boats and the present State policy which seems to be for containment? The EC want a complete reduction.  There appears to be a conflict between those three agencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no great conflict, but there is a problem in so far as we found ourselves in a very difficult situation when we took office.  I take the liberty of repeating this.  On our assuming office, the previous Adminstration had recorded and made available to Brussels the fact that there were 32,000 tonnes of GRT in the country when actually there were in excess of 60,000 tonnes.  When they could not get even these simple figures right, we should not have been surprised that they could not get the economy right.  That is what has us in the present situation.  We continue to negotiate with the Commission to have this <Col N="1288" /> increased to what we would call a reasonable level.  I would not be prepared to play these cards in public.  We are negotiating and doing reasonably well, though not extremely well, particularly after finding ourselves with such a low base as 32,000 tonnes.  The negotiation is for well in excess of that, but not near what we believe it should be.  I believe that further negotiation will leave us in a better position. However, Deputy McGinley will take a different view of demersal type boats as against pelagic type.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 11 and 35 together.</P>
      <P>The detailed information on rod licence sales in 1988 is contained in the attached schedules, which have been already given to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The alterations I made in the licence fees for 1989 as compared with 1988 were as follows: the composite licence was reduced from £40 to £25, the 21 day salmon licence was reduced from £21 to £10, and the 21 day trout licence was reduced from £10 to £5.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These changes resulted from wide <Col N="1289" /> ranging consultations I had with the fishery boards, angling groups and tourist interests including Bord Fáilte.  The purpose of the changes was to simplify the licensing structure and to remove anomalies which had emerged in the cost of the short term licences which were adversely affecting tourist angling.</P>
    <P>The purpose of reducing the composite licence was to move in the direction of simplifying the licensing structure.  I made this change on the basis of a very strong case made to me that the licence categories should, as far as possible, be rolled together into the one licence.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1290" /> As regards the short term rates, it was strongly argued by tourist interests that the level of the previous fees might inhibit the tourist or casual angler who wished to avail of only one or two days' fishing.</P>
    <P>I have always said that I would adopt a flexible approach to the licensing issue provided the principles were not infringed.  In making the changes which I made, I demonstrated in a very tangible fashion that I am prepared to respond reasonably to well reasoned and balanced arguments by anglers who are prepared to pursue their case in a reasonable manner.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister in a position to give an overall figure, for the coming year of the expected reduction in revenue intake as a result of this reduction?  Could he explain to the House how he can reconcile this revenue reduction with his strong argument, when introducing the trout licence and coarse fish licence in 1987, about the need for additional revenue for development purposes? Is the fact that he has now introduced this reduction not a total contradiction of his original argument for the introduction of a trout licence?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I believe that the reduction will make the whole system more manageable, more successful and more acceptable to the general body of the angling community.  Rather than losing any revenue, I anticipate that we could substantially increase revenue provided, of course, that we get the constructive support of the Opposition and the Deputy and others involved in this area.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, there were clear indications that up to 80 per cent of anglers were willing to pay for a licence and would buy a licence and would support the measure provided that the revenue from licensing would go direct to development of fisheries.  This is precisely the situation.  In the event of the revenue not materialising, the only area that will suffer as a result will be the development of the fisheries.  I have indicated very clearly on more than one occasion that the revenue which will accure from this mechanism will go direct into further investment in fisheries.  Any shortfall would represent a shortfall of money into the overall development funds.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not answered my question which was concerned with the figures on the intake last year.  Has he not an overall figure of the reduced amount for this year?  He anticipates an increase but does not give reasons for his optimism.  He has started that over 80 per cent of anglers were prepared to pay for a licence &mdash; he is quoting from the ESRI Report on the Economic Evaluation of Irish Angling published in 1987.  Under the heading of &ldquo;Gain&rdquo; the figures include salmon, sea trout and brown trout.  The issue is the brown trout licence.  Does the Minister not agree that the figures which he has circulated indicate that the introduction of the brown trout licence has proved most unsuccessful in that only 3,598 fishermen out of 100,000 trout anglers actually purchased licences?  The Minister commends this ESRI report and the figures given as being comprehensive and the report indepdendent&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The figure which is relevant for me is that under the previous voluntary system which was in operation in 1987 the sum total of £21,576 was collected.  In the western area the amount was £181.  Under the new legislation last year almost £150,000 was collected, an increase of up to 600 per cent.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnSMcCoy" hpid="Mr. McCoy Mr. McCoy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCoy</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the failure to have the trout licence accepted nationally in addition to the reduction of the short term licence fee the Minister has outlined today, is it not a fact that the amount of revenue required for the fishing development package will be greatly depleted? Are the people who pay the licence fees not entitled to the benefits of the development package the Minister proposed? Are the Government prepared to make up this shortfall to create the situation that was promised when the Minister originally brought the legislation to the Dáil?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I anticipated when I introduced the scheme last year, that we would receive £500,000.  We have actually got £400,000.  There is substantially more money available, if there was general agreement on the system of collection, yet nobody from the Opposition benches has come up with an alternative system which would be acceptable to the board general body of anglers.  One of the difficulties we have found is that while we have hundreds and hundreds of formulae to find solutions to this issue, no formula would get 98 per cent support <Col N="1296" /> right across the board.  In the absence of that kind of support, we took the measure we have taken and I think it is a useful one.  It can be operated very successfully and will benefit the overall development of inland fisheries if we get some support for it.</P>

In my view we are not helping the situation by having a further review taking place here.  The review body's findings have been published in a detailed and comprehensive document.  I understand that the group afforded an opportunity to the various interest groups, organisations and individuals to make their representations.  I think Deputy Desmond availed of that opportunity to make a submission.  At this stage I await the Government's decision on the findings.</P>

So far as I am concerned the Government have given me the responsibility to promote the development of marinas and to promote the development of recreational and leisure amenities in many of our harbours &mdash; in fact we have an excellent marina proposal up and running in Kilrush. From the point of view of the development of marina and leisure facilities, it would be my wish that there would be no undue delay in reaching a final conclusion.  As to the matter of further applications, we are constantly in receipt of applications.  At present we have 25 to 30 applications for marinas in various locations.  Any application for the proposed marina in Dún Laoghaire will await the Government's decision on their over-all position in relation to the development of the marina.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the previous Government's decision of October 1986 to set up a harbour authority together with the clear recommendation by the planning review group that a harbour authority should be set up &mdash; an endorsement of our decision &mdash; can the Minister say whether he is favourably disposed to those two decisions and recommendations at this stage, without pre-empting a Government decision?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The group recommended that the management and development of the harbour should be entrusted to an authority consisting of a chairman and six ordinary members appointed by the Minister for the Marine on the basis of their competence to contribute to the running of the harbour.  The authority should prepare a detailed management plan for the harbour with the kind of development outlined in the report.  The authority should act as a commercial semi-State development agency with the power to borrow and attract funds to implement this plan.  That recommendation would broadly fit into line with the policy I am following in the Department.  This is the type of small, commercially-orientated body to which we propose to entrust by legislation the management of the Shannon Estuary, for instance.  Deputy McCoy will be familiar with this matter.  There is to be an estuarial authority replacing the 40 or 50 commissioners.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of catch quotas both at EC and national level is to properly manage and conserve fish stocks in the long term interest of fishermen. There is no doubt in my mind that the absence of management systems would lead to a free-for-all and the rapid wiping out of the stocks that at present exist.  For a small country such as Ireland it is absolutely vital that catch quotas are properly complied with in the EC as a whole.  I am most anxious that all countries should comply with catch quotas.  In recent times there is clear evidence that both the Commission and other member states are putting much greater emphasis on proper enforcement and this is much to be welcomed.</P>
      <P>The Deputy can be assured that I will continue to keep a close eye on any development in other countries which could affect our fish stocks and that I will take whatever action is required in the best interest of the conservation of stocks and the Irish fishing industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnSMcCoy" hpid="Mr. McCoy Mr. McCoy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCoy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied with the controls as they operate at present?  Does the believe some reports in circulation that fish catches of species whose quotas are filled are being landed at foreign ports where vigilance in such matters is not as strict as it might be?     <Col N="1303" /><b>Mr. P. Gallagher:</b> I would be pleased to have the type of information available to Deputy McCoy.  Perhaps he is referring to demersal or pelagic species.  I presume he is referring to mackerel.  The Minister and I will insist that we are treated as well as any other country.  The Deputy asks if I am satisfied that we are adhering strictly to the regulations.  We are fully familiar with those regulations and do our utmost to comply with them. I am most anxious that all other countries should comply.  There are reasons for boats landing in other countries.  Boats are fishing some 48 hours from the north-west coast and weather factors are a consideration, as well as the size of the boat. Some boats may not be able to travel back, much as we would like them to do so, thereby providing jobs ashore.  It can be dangerous.  The prices available in Ireland are much greater.  I would remind the House how developed the industry is. Ninety-five per cent of mackerel landed here are processed, whereas 95 per cent of mackerel landed in the United Kingdom are put into luggers and there is no job creation.  Of course we have a factory ship and it would be a futile exercise for that ship to land its fish in Ireland and have them transshipped to the Continent. They must land directly on the Continent.  I am not certain what the Deputy has in mind.  Is he suggesting that the <i>Veronica</i> with its frozen fish should come back for the love of the country and transfer its fish into refrigerated containers which would be sent from Larne to Stranraer and down through England and perhaps eventually through the channel tunnel when it is constructed?  Is the Deputy suggesting that this should be done, creating jobs only for those loading the containers?  If the Deputy has some matter in mind which he does not wish to raise in the House, I will be pleased to discuss it with him.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that Irish fishermen are extremely concerned that when they land in Europe they are subject to strict EC regulations, whereas native trawlers coming into those ports are not subject to the same vigilance and the same strict rulings? Would the Minister consider lodging a complaint with the EC in relation to this matter?  I am concerned that there is not the same type of strict vigilance throughout Europe as we apply.  While we comply with the regulations there are other nations who are not as honourable in the manner in which they comply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter for the member state and secondly for the Commission to monitor and control catch quotas.  If we find that other countries are not adhering to the regulations we will make this known to the Commission. There is only one boat which could be landing in mainland Europe and that is the factory ship.  They are landing their tonnage of frozen fish.  It is not a question of dipping the tanks.  The mackerel are in blocks of 20 kilos.  When fresh fish are landed an entry is made in the log book as to what is believed to be in the tanks; eventually the real figure is entered.  We will be treated as well as any other country. I hope that Deputies will make their information available to me, and also that they are not suggesting, as Deputy McCoy appeared to be, that Irish boats should be controlled more vigorously off the west coast of Scotland.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Marine if he will make a statement on the most recent revelations that more than 50 trawlermen have lost their lives in and around the Irish fishing waters due to submarine activity; and whether he has had any negotiations with either the British Government or EC Heads of State in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Despite much media comment and other statements, only on one occasion was it established that a vessel was sunk in and around Irish waters by a submarine, that is, the <i>Sharelga</i> on 18 April 1982.  No lives were lost on that occasion.</P>
      <P>Speculation on the involvement of submarines in fishing vessel casualties is fuelled by the apparently unaccountable sinking of many such vessels.  Preliminary inquiries into such incidents have shown, however, that fishing vessels may sink for a number of reasons such as, structural defects, human error and unfavourable weather conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following widespread concern at the danger posed to fishing vessels at sea by submerged submarines the Irish authorities brought the matter to the attention of the International Maritime Organisation which is the London-based United Nations specialised agency responsible for safety at sea.  A resolution was as a result passed by the IMO Assembly, and, therefore, accepted by the United Kingdom and European Community maritime states, in November 1987, <Col N="1308" /> recommending that a submerged submarine, if information of the presence of a fishing vessel and its gear is available, should, as far as possible keep out of the way of that fishing vessel and any gear connected to it unless the submarine is disabled.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister tell the House how he arrived at the conclusion that there was only one incident in which a vessel was sunk?  He said that only preliminary inquiries were made arising from this complaint.  Will he agree that much more than preliminary inquiries are necessary to establish these kinds of incidents? Is the Minister further aware that the submarines of the states involved in this activity operate secretly?  It is extremely difficult to get any admission of guilt, involvement or admissions from any of the countries in question that they were even in the area concerned because this is part of their policy.  Will the Minister agree that it is necessary for the Government, in the light of the consistent reports about these serious incidents and the fact that 50 is a conservative figure by those who closely monitor this situation, to look into this matter urgently?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to venture too far into this water because the Minister for the Marine has no function in regard to submarines.  By and large, that is a matter for the Minister for Defence or the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  Of course we have a very practical interest in submarine activity in so far as we have responsibility for safety of life at sea and we would obviously be interested in knowing whether any submarine activity could pose a hazard to other shipping.  We would be most anxious that all these submarines would adhere to the resolution passed by the IMO Assembly to which I referred and which was accepted by the Government of the United Kingdom and Community maritime states.  The resolution recommended that submerged submarines should as far as possible, unless they are disabled, keep out of the way of fishing vessels and any gear connected to them. <Col N="1309" /> The Deputy referred to the question of preliminary inquiries.  We did carry out a preliminary inquiry into the <i>Sharelga</i> and eventually there was an admission that it was sunk as a result of a submarine towing it backwards for some distance at a speed of four or five knots.  As soon as we obtain any information we pursue matters of this kind.  The House should know that we were advised at one stage that a submarine which holed a vessel off the north west coast of Ireland had done so when the vessel was beside the pier.  This was not realised until the vessel put to sea. Information was passed to a local journalist at the time and of course he assumed that a submarine had done the damage. That is the other side of the coin but the Deputy can be assured that we will do our utmost to pursue this matter with the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Defence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>The key to job creation is adding value here to what we sell abroad. That applies to the agricultural industry and is certainly true in the case of tourism. Tourism adds a remarkably high value and almost all its input comes from the Irish economy.</P>
      <P>Very little is imported by way of raw materials as happens in the manufacturing area.  Tourism is now a £1 billion industry and its earnings are worth the same in terms of job creation as £2 billion in an industry with 50 per cent import content.  We must start looking at tourism in this light.  It is a major economic activity but too often it is seen as something simple and mundane.  It is not simple, it is a complex industry or rather an accumulation of industries which must compete in a very crowded and expensive world marketplace in the same way as Irish butter, beef and other commodities we export.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unlike the market for many traded products, the market for tourism and leisure is rapidly on the increase.  World tourism is expected to expand at the rate of 8 per cent a year, and almost half of all international travel is between the countries of Western Europe &mdash; a huge market on our doorstep.  There is no guarantee whatever that Ireland will get an automatic share of this growth.  Our record to <Col N="1339" /> date shows how difficult it is to get a share of that business, especially when one considers we are a little known island off the mainland.</P>
    <P>Approximately 65,000 people are employed in this industry which accounts for approximately 9 per cent of GNP. When one gets that big one faces a major task to hold one's own against one's competitors. Getting a growth of 15 per cent per annum is a major challenge but it is one that the tourism industry has taken on board because, as I said, the Government are now prepared to back them, to provide leadership, to assist where feasible and to provide funding to support the industry's initiatives.  Late last year in order to get the marketing of this country underway early in 1989, the Government allocated £5 million to Bord Fáilte to be matched by the industry.  We are now seeing the fruits of this investment.  For the first time holidays in Ireland are being advertised on television in both Britain and America.  Promotions involving a much larger number of Irish traders have been held in America and others will be held in continental Europe and Britain in the coming weeks.  Never before has there been such a co-ordinated attack on our main markets by Bord Fáilte, fully supported by the industry.</P>
    <P>The challenge facing us is not simply how best to market this country.  When we speak of marketing we think of sales and promotions but in its full sense, marketing is identifying and satisfying customers' needs, even to the extent of revamping the tourism product, if necessary. It is in this respect that this budget represents a significant step forward. When we add the allocations for such projects as the restoration of King John's Castle, Limerick and the provision of a data base for Bord Fáilte to promote special interest holidays to the funding for tourism projects under the Office of Public Works and the funds we receive from the ERDF for new tourism product development, we see £18 million is being made available for capital works which will vastly improve and upgrade the range <Col N="1340" /> of tourism attractions we can offer potential customers.  When we consider that Bord Fáilte only had £500,000 last year for development works we get some idea of the massive leap forward these funds represent, and that is only the tip of the iceberg.</P>
    <P>Anyone involved in tourism or who has seen what some of our competitors have to offer, knows that Irish tourism has been badly under-capitalised for many years.  There are reasons for this.  We should not forget that our industry is made up of small operators who have found it difficult to compete on the international market.  Profits have been few and far between for many operators with the result very little was available for reinvestment in, let it be said, a climate in which the tourist industry was treated as a Cinderella activity industry.  There was no real incentive for people to invest in the type of facilities which are essential.</P>
    <P>The Government have identified the potential in tourism and made a commitment to the industry by the business expansion scheme.  In the first year, this brought forward tourism development projects costing £40 million more than manufacturing industry have been able to attract.  Mr. Martin Dully, chairman of Bord Fáilte, speaking at a conference organised by the Commerce and Economic Society at UCC recently, said we are now seeing a level of interest in major tourism projects that is quite unprecedented. He said many of those projects are large scale, providing facilities which are weather proof &mdash; something we have been crying out for.  He also noted that Bord Fáilte are currently holding discussions about projects worth £1 billion. Whether this interest translates into projects will depend, to some extent, on the support they will get from EC Structural Funds, but this is a dramatic development which we should not under-estimate. It indicates there is great confidence in Irish tourism at home and among potential investors abroad.  It is crucial that EC funding for tourism infrastructure is made available because the industry need investment.  If this funding <Col N="1341" /> is made available, I am satisfied that 25,000 new jobs will be created.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that we can look forward to achieving essential growth.  It will not happen automatically.  We need new facilities and we look like getting them. A new approach to packaging and marketing is needed and in this respect much is being done.  Apart from catering for the general tourist, we have tremendous potential to develop a much wider range of special interest holidays.  Bord Fáilte are doing that.  Within the last year many new high quality products have been developed for activities such as golf, fishing, walking, cycling, horseriding and cruising.  In all about 30 new products will be marketed in the coming year, and Bord Fáilte have identified about 100 new activities which can be catered for in this country.</P>
    <P>The new chairman of Bord Fáilte is anxious to get rid of the &ldquo;them and us&rdquo; attitude which afflicts so many aspects of Irish life, including tourism.  Usually the &ldquo;them&rdquo; are the Government and their agencies who are expected to do everything and deliver the business to the doorstep of the &ldquo;us&rdquo;.  Many people seem to think they have a divine right to that business.  There is a need for more co-operation between the State agencies, the regional tourism organisations and their representative bodies, as well as the individual operators.  This is happening but there is room for improvement.</P>
    <P>There are many sectors who benefit in a big way from tourism but who put precious little back into the industry.  I saw in a newspaper recently that the Dublin Chamber of Commerce alleged that not enough was being done to promote the city as a tourist centre.  They should ask themselves what have they done to encourage people to come to the city.  As chairman of Cork/Kerry Tourism I know how difficult it is to get the commercial sector to invest in tourism promotion or to cater for the tourist market. Sniping at others will not bring in extra business; we should try to put that attitude behind us.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like to compliment the Minister for Tourism and <Col N="1342" /> Transport, Deputy Wilson, and his Minister of State, Deputy Lyons, for the tremendous job they are doing in regard to the programme set down by Government. I have no doubt that they will see this programme through and that all those involved in tourism and the country in general will benefit.</P>

      <P>In the 1989 budget this Government failed to grasp the possibilities of this historical moment.  All Government decisions can be guided on the gospel's guideline phrase: &ldquo;By their fruits ye shall know them&rdquo;.  When the basis of this budget is evaluated it will be found that one-third of our population still continue to live in poverty.  The Minister identified three priorities he wished to address in his Budget Statement, (1) to reduce poverty (2) to increase job creation and (3) to transform taxation.  The Minister failed to tackle any of the three problems comprehensively.  Certainly poverty was not given the priority it deserved in the 1989 budget.  Taxation was reduced from 35 per cent to 32 per cent, a step in the right direction. However, this has been offset by the reduction in mortgage interest relief from 90 per cent to 80 per cent.  This Government have reduced the mortgage interest relief by 20 per cent since they came into office in 1987.  One fifth of the mortgage interest relief has been completely swept off.  That is a cruel blow to the people who took steps to house themselves.  This is not a step in the right direction.  It is a policy of robbing Peter to pay Paul. Everybody knows that mortgage holders are young people who got married and had the initiative to take on their own shoulders the building or purchase of a house.  What has been the result?  They have been dealt a cruel, deadly blow by this uncaring Government who have taken one-fifth of their mortgage interest relief out of their pockets completely. What advantage is the three per cent reduction income tax to that category of people?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We see increases in the duty on beer, spirits, cigarettes, tobacco and petrol. We now have the highest rate of duty on those commodities in the EC.  What attraction is there for tourists to come <Col N="1344" /> here with that kind of exorbitant taxation? What does the budget do for tourism? In south-west Cork and Kerry what did we get for tourism?  We got a paltry £500,000, half a million, for a ferry service that played a Trojan part in 1988 in increasing tourists numbers to that area. The people of that region had to beg the rest of the money from the small shopkeepers, businessmen and hoteliers who are hard pressed to keep that ferry service going.  At the end of the day we got an assurance from the Government that they would give us a further loan of a paltry half a million pounds &mdash; big deal. The loan is to be paid back by a company who were nearly strangled last year by other companies trying to cut their travel rates to grab tourists into their net.</P>
    <P>What have the Government done on the other hand?  They have given £11 million to B &amp; I to run a service from Dublin to Holyhead as compared to a mere half a million pounds to the Cork-Swansea ferry.  Is this equality for citizens in all parts of the country?  If B &amp; I are entitled to such a heavy subsidy from the Government last year, why did the Government not insist that they stay in the Cork-Swansea service and give the people of the south-west an opportunity to make a living from tourism?  Remember the south-west region is known internationally as the Riviera of Ireland.  We are not getting much assistance from the Government to keep this valuable service going.</P>

      <P>I was prepared to put my money where my mouth was as well.  I hope the Deputy did too.</P>
      <P>The budget made no significant change to the vast majority of farmers.  Forty-four per cent of all households headed by a farmer now live on the poverty line, according to statistics published recently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1345" /> What did the Minister for Agriculture and Food do in Brussels?  He bungled the recent discussions there on agriculture and sold the farmers down the drain, instead of using his veto to make sure he would bring home a package worthy of our farmers.  What did he bring home?  A Mickey Mouse package, nothing more.</P>
    <P>What did the budget do for horticulture? We have a Minister for Food, a colleague of mine from my constituency and a good man.  Alas, the poor man's Department is treated as the hind tit of the Department of Agriculture and Food.  He is a Minister for Food without one pound, shilling or penny to spend on food production or the food industry.  His department are not getting fair play in the Department of Agriculture and Food.  We have the finest climate in the world for vegetable and horticultural production, yet we are importing millions of pounds worth of vegetables.  I am amazed when I hear about the drive that is to be made to expand our horticultural and food processing industry.  We all know the drives that have been made.  The co-operative in Skibbereen closed its doors a decade ago and has not been reopened, all because the powers that were at the time did not see fit to step in and ensure that that worthwhile factory would be kept going.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>If we are serious about tackling the problem let the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach give some money to Deputy Joe Walsh's Department to get him off the ground.  Do not have him on the poverty line.  His hands are tied.  He is muzzled completely and nothing can be done to improve the horticultural industry with that spirit and initiative from the Department of Agriculture and Food.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are told there will be a major drive to improve the export of agricultural products to other countries within the EC.  It is well known that one cannot buy a bottle of Cork Gin in another European country or a pound of Irish rashers or <Col N="1346" /> sausages.  Does that amount to progress in the right direction?  There is a growing demand for Irish products on the Continent, particularly in Spain, Italy, Greece, the Canary Islands and the tourist resorts that Irish people frequent.  We must establish a centre on the Continent from which our products will be distributed throughout Europe.  We cannot afford to sit idly by and let the opportunity of exploring those markets pass us by.  We have a glorious opportunity to boost our exports of bacon, beef and mutton.  I cannot understand why the Department, and the Government, are so naive in regard to the export of those products.</P>
    <P>What incentive is there for our farmers to expand?  Our young farmers cannot get advice on how to do so.  What have Teagasc done for our farmers since they took over from ACOT?  We should ask ourselves if ACOT was a good substitute for the county committees of agriculture who provided a tremendous service for our farmers over decades.  For 25 years I was a member of a county committee of agriculture and I am aware of the progress that was made under the old system. Such committees nursed the agricultural industry for years.  However, some bright chap in the Department of Agriculture thought fit to axe those committees and replace them with ACOT.  Seven or eight years later a similar idea was put forward and some bright person suggested that the Minister should axe ACOT, form a new group and call it Teagasc.  They are the farmers behind closed doors but they do not give much advice to our young farmers.  I invite the Minister for Agriculture and Food, and the Taoiseach, to visit my constituency to judge if that body are giving any advice to our young farmers.</P>
    <P>There are many shortfalls in the Government's agricultural policy.  Why are off-farm incomes taken into consideration under the cattle headage scheme?  Where off-farm income does not exceed the magic figure referred to by the Taoiseach yesterday, £30,000 annually, such farmers should not be excluded from that scheme.  The Taoiseach has told us that those with an <Col N="1347" /> income of less than £30,000 will not be excluded from the child benefit scheme and the same should apply to the cattle headage scheme.  Many small farmers on the western seaboard are forced to take off-farm jobs to augment the meagre income from their holdings.  Some are forced to work on the roads or engage in fishing to augment their income and rear their families.  The Taoiseach should tell farmers that those whose income does not exceed £30,000 will be entitled to a grant under the cattle headage scheme. Such a move would increase the national herd and improve the lot of many small farmers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask Government Deputies to tell me about the better way that Fianna Fáil promised Irish people in the last election campaign. During that campaign they displayed an Irish passport on advertising hoardings between Dublin and Cork and Cork and Skibbereen and suggested to the electorate that there was bound to be a better way than a passport from the country. Under Fianna Fáil in 1988, 32,000 people emigrated, the greatest number since the State was founded.  What about the codology Fianna Fáil went on with two years ago?  The Government have failed miserably to curb emigration.  The only solution to emigration is the creation of more jobs and the improving of living standards for our people.  We must prepare a long term programme to increase jobs and tap the unlimited markets for our products abroad.  I would describe the budget as the birdie song budget, a little bit of this and a little bit of that, ending up with a little bit of nothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. Wallace Mr. Wallace">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickOMalley" hpid="Mr. P. O'Malley Mr. P. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>At the conclusion of his interesting contribution Deputy Sheehan described the budget as a birdie song budget and earlier he said it was a case of robbing Peter to pay Paul but I suggested to him that it was more a question of robbing Peter to pay Peter.  Any benefits to taxpayers, arising out of the tinkering with the taxation system, were taken back under the cut in mortgage interest relief and the relief on life assurance premiums.  We should also remember that the PRSI ceiling was increased. I am not aware of any sector that will benefit to any extent from the budget. It has been suggested that the average family with two children with an income of £14,000 per annum and subject to the usual outgoings for mortgages and insurance policies did not gain anything under the budget.  We have been told that the budget did a lot for the lower paid and other speakers pointed out that a single person, earning £3,000 per annum, or approximately £59 per week, would be better off under the terms of the budget to the extent of £3 per week.  Are the Government suggesting that that amounts to looking after the poor and improving their lot?  It will be easy for the public to make up their minds on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An important point to make about the budget was that the Government have lost an opportunity to introduce changes in view of the consensus that exists here and throughout the country.  All are agreed on the action that is required to tackle the problems in the economy, in particular unemployment.  We are all aware that unemployment figures are at a horrific level.  The Government had an opportunity in the budget to do something fundamental and radical about that problem and the Minister was assured of <Col N="1349" /> the support of the parties on this side of the House if he made such a move.  It was an opportunity that was lost, unfortunately. A sustained programme for really tackling the fundmental problems in the economy should have been initiated this time round.  From that point of view the budget is a severe disappointment.</P>
    <P>We were also told that the social welfare recipients had a major improvement conferred on them as a result of the budget proposals.  The only good thing in the budget was the optics of it and the way it was presented.  The presentation was good.  At first sight it appeared that a lot was being done for the taxpayer, for those on lower incomes and for people on social welfare but when one got down to analysing the budget one found that circumstances were not being improved for anyone.</P>
    <P>In terms of social welfare, this year we are proposing to spend less in real terms than we spent last year.  In 1988 social welfare accounted for £2,644 million or 27.4 per cent of total spending.  In this area in 1989 we propose to spend £2,692 million or 27 per cent of total spending. That is a reduction and if we allow for inflation, spending on social welfare will be 1 per cent less in real terms.</P>
    <P>In relation to some of the developmental proposals in the budget &mdash; I am reluctant to call them developmental because development was almost non existent particularly in the tourism industry &mdash; the Government have set very ambitious targets for tourism.  They propose to double the number of visitors and revenue and to create 25,000 new jobs in that sector over five years.  This is all set out in the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i>  These targets have not been maintained despite claims to the contrary by the Government.  The Government claim they met their targets but will not publish the statistics that will enable us to judge accurately whether these targets are being met.  The Government's claims are being shot down by the people in the tourist industry.  The Irish Tourist Industry Confederation which is the representative body for all our tourist <Col N="1350" /> interests have stated that the Government targets for last year cannot be achieved. They know what is happening and that is their assessment at this point.  If the Government are to achieve the targets set they have to achieve a 15 per cent growth each year in compound terms.  They have had a very good start to their programme in the sense that there was a marvellous kick start given to it by virtue of the fact that the access fares to this country have been so dramatically reduced, particularly the access fares between here and the UK.  The point about that is that we must look at that as a once off contribution to the attainment of these targets, because the access fares between Ireland and the UK will not continue to go down.  Already there are applications for increases from Aer Lingus and British Airways.  Where is the next segment of growth to come from?  How will the Government get their 15 per cent this year and the year after in order to attain the targets set?  These targets set by the Government are really nothing more than aspirations, no more than a wish list.</P>
    <P>The Government have not published a plan that the tourist industry can regard as a plan that will assist in attaining these objectives.  This industry is always held up to us as being an industry with major employment potential.  If that is the case it behoves the Government to look at it seriously and to do something serious about it.  What have they done?  In the budget the Minister announced a number of grants for the tourist sector.  He announced £100,000 for the restoration of King John's Castle in Limerick.  The balance of the £3.6 million required to complete that project will come from national lottery funding and from the European Structural Funds if we get them.  The Minister also mentioned that he was giving a grant of £250,000 to enable Bord Fáilte to develop a data base system.  I welcome that as it would enable Bord Fáilte to target their marketing properly.  The other grant announced was an allocation of £500,000 to the Irish Racing Board to help them with ongoing refurbishment of various race courses. The total Exchequer grants announced <Col N="1351" /> in the budget for the tourist industry which is supposed to be one of the major employment industries and the one that the Government are looking to for the most growth amounts in the budget to £850,000.  The Minister for Finance said that if he gets £75 million from Europe he will allocate £14.5 million to the tourist industry, but he might not get it.  The Minister for Tourism has not outlined how this money will be spent nor has he consulted with the tourist industry or given them a blueprint so that they will know that there will be continuous funding in a planned way over the balance of the programme set out in the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i></P>
    <P>There were some anti-tourism measures in the budget.  They were not described as such but they will definitely have a very adverse effect on the tourist trade.  I refer to the increases in excise duties on petrol and drink.  We know that we have a very high cost environment here and at the same time we go ahead with these increases.  This is contrary to what the Government are trying to achieve in terms of growth in the tourist sector.  The petrol increase has wider implications because it affects industry and increases costs to the consumer in a whole range of areas.  The Minister confirmed that because of the movement downwards in the price of oil on world markets we had been due for a decrease of 5p per gallon at the pump but that he was now taking away that advantage and was putting a 5p increase on excise on petrol.  The cost of petrol here is at a disgracefully high level.  It was most unfortunate, not just from the point of view of tourism but from the point of view of every other industry and of consumers, that the price of petrol is now at a level beyond which it should not have gone. We should have got the benefit of the decrease that would have been coming to us as a result of the movement downwards in the world markets.</P>
    <P>The high cost of petrol is partly due to the compulsory off-take regime that is operated by the Irish National Petroleum Corporation.  There is no justification for <Col N="1352" /> that regime continuing in existence.  The only way that the performance of the INPC can be measured is by considering if it does a job that reduces the cost of petrol to the consumer.  The system whereby all distributors have to compulsorily off take 35 per cent of their requirement from Whitegate at a cost that Whitegate determine and which does not necessarily bear any relation to world market costs cannot be supported any longer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The INPC subsequently acquired an interest in the Whitegate refinery.  Whether the INPC should be in the refining business at all is highly questionable because their main function was to ensure supply.  There was no necessity for them to become involved in refining.  The fact that they did become involved in refining has definitely resulted in petrol costs being much higher here. If one looks over the last five-year period one will see that that can be proven in that the spot market prices, on average, have been 15 per cent cheaper than the price the Whitegate refinery charge the Irish consumer for petrol delivered here. That is a disgrace.  I am a member of The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Commercial State-sponsored Bodies. On many occasions the committee have required that company to come before them to justify their existence, to tell them what they did and spell out to them why it is they should continue to be in the refinery business.  They have refused on spurious grounds.  They say they are tied up legally.  In any event they have never answered satisfactorily the allegations I have made.  Undoubtedly <Col N="1353" /> the INPC are increasing the cost of petrol to the Irish consumer.</P>
      <P>This budget constituted a lost opportunity. Had the Government had the courage to radically tackle the major problems obtaining, particularly in the area of taxation reform, they would have had the support of this House.  Taxation reform is essential if we are to make any real inroads into the huge unemployment levels obtaining.</P>

      <P>Last year saw a continuation of improvement in economic performance. Both output and exports continued to grow, inflation rates remain historically low and the substantial reduction achieved in interest rates has been maintained.  The level of annual borrowing has been substantially reduced and the national debt is close to stabilisation. This in turn has reinforced the mood of economic recovery that is reflected in output and investment trends and is again visiable in many areas of our economy and generally in people's attitudes.  Hope has now replaced despair and we are better prepared for the challenges ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These challenges remain formidable: the adaptation of our industrial and commercial strategies to our strengths, the creation of employment opportunities for our growing labour force and continuous preparation for and response to the opportunities and challenges that are arising <Col N="1354" /> with the approach of 1992.  However these all continue to indicate to us the necessity to continue the policies we have been adopting over the past two years.  It is imperative that we continue our efforts to reduce the national debt to more manageable proportions.  There can be no turning back from this task.  All of us have learned a hard lesson from the experiences of the last two decades.  We must never again allow short-term issues or pressures to deflect the State from pursuing the proper long-term goals and policies or objectives.</P>
    <P>There has also been positive advancement and development in marine matters during the past year.  That work will be continued during the remainder of 1989. Bord Iascaigh Mhara have completed and published a report on the development strategy for the seafish industry and have launched an ambitious programme for the full realisation of the industry's potential.  We are intensifying our campaign to improve the image and status of Irish fish and fishery products, both nationally and internationally.  The Government have recognised the importance and potential of this industry and have provided an additional £1.7 million to BIM in 1989.</P>
    <P>The aquaculture industry was targeted for investment because of its potential to create jobs and wealth, particularly in areas which are lacking in other resources.  We have been able, through our promotional agency, to prime the industry which has now developed a momentum of its own.  During 1989 I intend to sustain if not accelerate the growth this sector is now achieving.</P>
    <P>The Government remain committed to the development of inland fisheries despite the destructive campaign of some angling groups and individuals over the last year.  We are pressing ahead with the preparation of a new development programme.</P>
    <P>The Government policy for the development of the harbour infrastructure of five major fishery harbour centres, supplemented by a number of strategically located secondary harbours, has been enhanced by the works carried <Col N="1355" /> out last year and those planned for 1989. Major works were carried out in 1988 in Greencastle, Killybegs and a number of other small harbours and landing places. The 1989 allocation of approximately £3 million will provide for major development works at Greencastle, Rossaveal, Dingle, Killybegs and a number of other locations.</P>
    <P>Government policy in relation to commercial harbours is that we have an infrastructure of effective, cost-efficient harbours located at strategic points in the country to ensure that our exports and our essential imports can be handled in a manner which meets the need of economic sectors.  As part of this policy I hope to initiate a review of the legislative code within which commercial harbours operate. Some of my ideas are evident from the Shannon Estuary Development Corporation Bill which I introduced last year and which I hope to be in place in 1989.</P>
    <P>The final step in bringing the Ringaskiddy freeport into being was taken with my appointment of a manager supported by an advisory committee to run the freeport.  An order defining the land area had been made by me in June 1988. I am confident that the new arrangements will generate new economic activity in the area.</P>
    <P>Marine safety has been a priority of my Department since its establishment.  The programme of improved communications has been implemented and will be substantially completed during 1989.  I have also placed increased emphasis on ferry safety and supervision.</P>
    <P>Work has commenced within my Department on identifying potential marine related leisure projects, facilities and activities which can be targeted for development and promotion.  Every effort will be made to facilitate and accelerate maritime and aquatic sports and activities.</P>
    <P>The Attorney General's Office is currently finalising the draft of legislation for the setting up and operation of the Marine Research Institute.</P>
    <P>Bord Iascaigh Mhara have now completed and published a development <Col N="1356" /> strategy for the seafish industry.  We aim by 1991 to virtually double fish production; to more than double exports; and create 4,400 new full and part time jobs.  It is the Government's intention that the plan will revitalise all sections involved in fishing and, above all, instil a new confidence and competitiveness into the industry.</P>
    <P>The fish processing industry is a vital element in any strategy for the fish sector. Supplies have been a major constraint to the development of the sector.  It is intended to pursue every possibility &mdash; quota fish, non-quota fish, fishing in third country waters, imports and aquaculture to maximise the supplies to the country's fish processing industry.  Marketing, processing and related product quality issues feature prominently in the plan.  It is apparent that, with increased landings and expansion in fish farming, it will be imperative that we adopt a much more co-ordinated and dynamic approach in the market place.</P>
    <P>Finally, the Department of the Marine have recently finalised arrangements designed to put the national ice supply network on a more rigorous and commercial footing.  I am satisfied that as a result of these arrangements, the availability of ice nationally to fishermen, so vital in ensuring a quality product, will be significantly enhanced during 1989.</P>
    <P>In the EC context, the Common Fisheries Policy continues to be the frame-work within which we continue to operate.  Obviously the most important aspects of the Common Fisheries Policy are the quota allocations made available to the Irish fishing fleet.  While the mackerel quota obtained for 1989 last December in Brussels was lower than in 1988 because of conservation requirements, other increases, especially in herring, provide for continued expansion and development in the industry.</P>
    <P>I should like to place on record the regular and constructive liaison between my Department's officials and the various branches of the fishing industry.  Again I pay tribute to the responsible and positive attitudes adopted by the industry over the last year towards the management <Col N="1357" /> and conservation of these valuable stocks.  This will be essential in the future if we are to keep the maximum benefit from that resource.</P>
    <P>Regarding structural and research projects, I will continue to press for maximum uptake of EC funds.  These financial contributions will help the industry meet the challenges facing it in the future.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to say that the problems experienced in recent years arising from the activities of so-called &ldquo;flag of convenience&rdquo; vessels should ease during the coming year.  An amendment to the control regulation adopted by Fisheries Ministers at their Council meeting in October last now comes into operation.  New controls are now being imposed on such vessels, which will greatly assist us in managing our quotas more effectively and generally protecting stocks which again is essential if we are to fully develop the industry.</P>
    <P>I would like now to discuss briefly progress in the development of aquaculture in the State.  I have advised the House already on a number of occasions about the potential of this industry to create jobs and wealth, especially in areas which are often lacking in other resources.  The aquaculture industry has come under a more critical eye over the last year or so with more concern being expressed about its potential environmental impact.  I want to take the opportunity to affirm my confidence in the aquaculture industry. That confidence is based on the fundamental fact that it is an industry which is uniquely suited to this country because it is based on one of our natural resources, clean water.  We have the capacity to produce the goods, the markets are there, linkages are being made with the rest of the economy in that feed-stuffs and cages for the salmon industry are now manufactured in Ireland, while the processing sector for aquaculture products is set to grow and to become more sophisticated, in tune with market demand.</P>
    <P>Our salmon farming industry, for example, was worth over £25 million to the economy in 1988 in primary output <Col N="1358" /> alone, with approximately 1,300 full and part-time jobs available.</P>
    <P>In addition, we are working closely with the two State agencies who promote aquaculture directly &mdash; BIM and Údarás na Gaeltachta &mdash; and the European Commission to see that the State and EC support which is available for aquaculture development is used to best effect.</P>
    <P>I want to return briefly to environmental concern.  One of the positive features which assists us in marketing our aquaculture produce is the perception abroad of our environment, especially in Donegal, the west and the south-west, where most of the output is farmed.  We have an aquaculture industry because we have clean water and we will continue to have an aquaculture industry only if we maintain the standards.  As Minister for the Marine, I accept my responsibilities towards the environment, and my Department will work with the industry and all relevant agencies to ensure that aquaculture is developed in a way which is consistent with maintaining water quality. There is no other way.</P>
    <P>Inland fisheries is widely acknowledged as one of our finest natural resources.  This Government are committed to developing the resource with a view to creating additional employment.</P>
    <P>The fisheries boards at my behest have been involved during recent months, in consultation with angling interests, in preparing programmes for inclusion in the development plan for EC structural funding.</P>
    <P>I must emphasise however that progress can only be made through co-operation and that obstructive or destructive action will be harmful for all of us.</P>
    <P>The Government's commitment to the development of inland fisheries continues. To achieve the desired results however all interested parties must be prepared to make a meaningful and constructive contribution towards the financing and management of the fisheries structure and particularly in identifying, preparing and implementing planned improvement programmes.  I want to re-iterate that the contributions which anglers will make to the over-all <Col N="1359" /> finances of inland fisheries will go directly into that fisheries development.  Returns will match investment.  Any shortfall in investment will mean shortcomings in our development programme and lack of development in fisheries.</P>
    <P>The development philosophy for fishery harbours is the concentration of resources in five major fishery harbour centres &mdash; Castletownbere, Dunmore East, Howth, Killybegs and Rossaveal. These in turn are supported by a network of strategically sited secondary harbours. This centralised approach enables proper provision to be made for landings, handling, storage, processing and distribution. It also permits the provision of facilities for the maintenance and upkeep of the fleet and for a whole range of ancillary services.  The Government have allocated approximately £3 million for this work in 1989.</P>
    <P>The bulk of this amount is proposed to be spent on four major works at Dingle, Greencastle, Killybegs and Rossaveal with the remainder being spent on a number of lesser harbours where for many years they have been awaiting developments.  We should be able to undertake some work on those this year.</P>
    <P>The importance of the commercial harbours to the economy is high-lighted by the level of total trade-in volume terms, 80.0 per cent, and value terms, 65.0 per cent handled by seaports in 1987.  In 1987 these ports handled over £12,000 million of Ireland's total external trade of £19,000 million and almost £7,000 million of our total export trade of £10,439 million. This makes it imperative that our harbours take all proper measures to ensure the safe, efficient, cost effective movement of traffic and cargoes through their system for the overall benefit of the Irish community in a manner responsive to customer requirements.</P>
    <P>The established Irish ports policy is that each port should, in principle, be operated as a commercial undertaking and be financially self-supporting with State grants intended to be made and requests for EC fund assistance supported only where improvements are <Col N="1360" /> essential to meet well defined commercial needs.</P>
    <P>Because of the financial constraints under which we operate at present Exchequer assistance for commercial harbour projects has had to be reduced and the 1989 Public Capital Programme contains provision for the payment of State grants totalling £429,000.  The majority of this money is earmarked for Drogheda harbour where major quay reconstruction works are about to commence.</P>
    <P>However, the Government decision of July 1987 that European Regional Development Fund assistance may now be sought for public sector entities other than the Exchequer is already proving of major benefit to future necessary harbour development.  The Commission of the European Communities has recently approved commitments in regional aid totalling £3.5 million for two projects in Cork and Dublin harbours.  With the coming into operation in 1989 of the EC's Regional Structural Funds system harbour authorities were requested to submit their harbour development plans for the next five years.  These plans, indicating the minimum requirements over the five year period, have been forwarded to the Department of Finance with a view to having them included in the national development plan which Ireland is required to submit to the European Commission in order to qualify for assistance from reformed and enlarged Structural Funds.</P>
    <P>The Government are anxious to see the development of marine leisure facilities and are therefore pursuing a policy of encouraging the development of marinas so that they can contribute fully to the tourism and leisure facilities in Ireland. The Department of the Marine in co-operation with the Department of Tourism and Transport and Bord Fáilte will facilitate private investment in marinas and will encourage suitable development plans.</P>
    <P>Ireland is vulnerable to marine pollution in the form of distressed ships and their cargoes, including oil.  This is due <Col N="1361" /> to our geographic location near busy shipping routes and the stormy climate of the North Atlantic.</P>
    <P>Our experience in recent years has made us aware of the cost of pollution to the environment and the economy, through damage to fishing, aquaculture, tourism and clean-up costs.  These experiences have made this Government determined to remove the threat of pollution by enforcing the wide range of national legislation and international agreements, by legal actions if necessary.</P>
    <P>All stages of the Oil Pollution of the Sea (Civil Liability and Compensation) Act were passed last year.  The introduction of the Local Government (Water Pollution) (Amendment) Bill 1989 is a major breakthrough in the fight to protect Ireland's aquatic environment and especially its valuable inland fisheries resources.  The Bill considerably strengthens powers of fisheries boards and the levels of penalties are substantially increased.</P>
    <P>My Department are at an advanced stage in preparing legislation to deal with the problem of disposal by ships of garbage, sewage and other pollutants, and we shall continue to take whatever action is necessary for the protection of the community and the environment, through legislation and enforcement.</P>
    <P>Safety of life is a major preoccupation of my Department.  One of the most cost effective means of reducing the risk of loss of life at sea is the provision of a chain of remote controlled VHF radio stations around the entire coast.  VHF transmitters are relatively inexpensive and do not require specialist knowledge to operate.  They are already carried on almost all fishing vessels and many larger yachts.  A 24-hour listening watch for emergency calls is provided by VHF radio stations.</P>
    <P>A major expansion of VHF emergency communications is being carried out.  In continuing this development a station at Mine Head, County Waterford will be completed shortly.  An additional station around the Galway-Mayo area is also planned for the first half of 1989.  These <Col N="1362" /> developments will complete the marine VHF network.</P>
    <P>To meet our international commitment to safety of life at sea, the up-dating and replacing of medium frequency radio telephony equipment at the two coast radio stations, Valentia and Malin Head, will continue during 1989.</P>
    <P>Telecom Éireann have been requested to install, as a matter of urgency, a leased line linking the Marine Search and Rescue Co-ordination Centre at Shannon with Valentia Coast Radio Station.</P>
    <P>Computerisation of the two Coast Radio Stations &mdash; Valentia and Malin Head &mdash; should be completed by the end of the year.</P>
    <P>I have given a detailed list of the initiatives we are at present involved in and the action we propose to take during the present year to press ahead with the over-all development of our marine resources. It has been said in the course of this debate over the past few days that there was lack of co-operation on the part of Fianna Fáil when in Opposition, with the then Government.  During the course of most of my speech this afternoon there was no one on the Opposition benches.  I totally reject the complaints about lack of co-operation from Fianna Fáil when we were in Opposition.  I would remind Deputies who made this complaints of the kind of co-operation that I have received on these benches in regard to legislation which they supported when it was going through the House before Christmas. Parties supported legislation in the House and then, because there was a particular grievance from one section of the community, they were prepared to give in to all kinds of pressures and make so many U-turns that they do not know where they stand.  I would remind those Deputies who criticised Fianna Fáil's position in Opposition that we never left the House empty during our period on the Opposition benches.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate very much my senior collegaue, the Minister, Deputy Daly, being so generous as to give me some of his time.  As my time is severely limited I will just refer to a couple of <Col N="1363" /> points.  Everything that this Government have done in the past few years in the economic sphere has been geared to ensuring that the correct climate should exist for the creation of solid sustainable jobs and thereby reducing dramatically the huge unemployment figure.  The unemployment problem together with its twin malaise of emigration is and has been a blight on our land.  It is therefore more than gratifying that in the past year 20,000 new jobs have been created.  The Government have committed themselves, as their main objective for 1989, to continue to ensure this further and ongoing job creation policy.</P>
      <P>In this context I would mention my own constituency and county of Wicklow. The ESRI in their report have identified Wicklow as a county in need of special attention in the context of job creation.  Consequent to this the Minister for Industry and Commerce &mdash; I sincerely thank him for it &mdash; deemed Wicklow to be a designated area, thereby ensuring its attraction to industrialists.  We in Wicklow have been expecting great things by way of industry and jobs coming to our county.  However, to date this has not materialised and I am getting progressively more irate on that account.</P>
      <P>The town of Wicklow, particularly in the aftermath of the closure of the Veha factory, has serious economic and unemployment problems.  With the run-down of the pottery and fertiliser industries, Arklow has lost over 2,000 manufacturing jobs in recent years and the rural south and western areas of the county have been also badly affected.  I compliment the Government for identifying County Wicklow as an area requiring special attention and I thank them for providing us with the designation instrument and indeed for providing the appropriate economic climate on a national basis.  However, my anger and bitter disappointment are directed towards the State development agencies, particularly the IDA.  Their gross inaction and apparent ineffectiveness in addressing this problem in Wicklow are to be highlighted and condemned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1364" /> The economic climate is there; the designation instrument is there; the infrastructure is there; the co-operation and support of the local authorities and particularly of the county manager in Wicklow and the county development team is there and, God knows, the work-force is there.  I make this strong appeal to the Minister for Industry and Commerce that he instruct these State agencies to avail of what he and the Government have laid at their disposal and to take positive and speedy action to tackle the unemployment and emigration problems in County Wicklow.</P>
    <P>The construction industry is going through a difficult period &mdash; indeed, this has been the case for years.  While an improvement in this industry will inevitably follow the uplift in the economy generally, it is important that all efforts be made to expedite this.  The construction industry is so important in the context of providing jobs, both directly and as a spin-off, that this cannot be over-stressed. However, the signs are now good for the industry in that the forthcoming additional EC Structural Funds will certainly be instrumental in providing a substantial number of jobs in the industry.</P>
    <P>In the area of agriculture I must mention the Government's positive action during the year in extending the terms of the western package to all areas of the country which are deemed to be disadvantaged. This had the effect of enabling two-thirds of the country to qualify for the benefits contained in that western package.  Consequently, many grants to which people were heretofore not entitled are now accessible to those in the disadvantaged areas of Ireland. Grants of 45 per cent for animal housing and 55 per cent for anti-pollution measures have been available to farmers, and I understand that similar funding in areas such as agri-tourism is in the offing.  This level of funding emphasises the importance of the disadvantaged areas structure both to the farmers concerned and to the economy of the country in general.  It is important therefore that the exercise of <Col N="1365" /> extending the areas deemed to be disadvantaged be proceeded with expeditiously with a view to every possible acre being included in the interests of our farming community and the country's economy generally.  I know this is the intention of the Minister for Agriculture and Food.</P>
    <P>The excellent news that particular attention is to be given to the roads of Ireland, both county and regional, is more than welcome.  For years the county roads in particular have been allowed to deteriorate.  Negligible funding was allocated for the purpose of maintaining these roads.  I have always felt that even in the context of the nation's severe financial difficulties, this neglect was false economy.  To allow a project, into which many millions of pounds of taxpayers' money had been poured, to crumble and deteriorate would have to be viewed in the category of a national scandal.  It is gratifying to see that the Fianna Fáil Government are now tackling this problem in a major way as evidenced by the announcement that £150 million will be spent in the next three years.  This will be greatly welcomed by the public generally and by industry in particular.  The proposed expenditure makes good, sound economic sense.</P>
    <P>Forestry is another area in which the Government can be seen to be making significant progress.  In 1987 the level of State plantings was the highest in history at 11,000 hectares.  This was further surpassed in 1988 with 15,000 hectares being planted, 5,000 hectares of which were planted by the private sector.  The Government's action in setting up a new State company to manage and develop our publicly-owned forests is a welcome and innovative measure.</P>
    <P>This new company, Coillte Teoranta, will have as their objective the achievement of profit for the nation from a national resource that has been reglected and under-managed in the past.  That is not intended in any way to downgrade or diminish the excellent work carried out by the foresters and forestry workers in the past several decades.  We have the cream of talent and expertise in this area <Col N="1366" /> in the persons of our qualified foresters who have been regularly turned out year after year from our forestry colleges. These people are directly responsible for the wealth that has been planted in the lands and hills of Ireland.</P>
    <P>It is my sincere hope that, whatever we will see unfold in the plans of Coillte Teoranta in the coming months and years, there will continue to be a role for these highly capable and qualified people who have served Irish forestry and the people of Ireland for so long and whose labours and achievements have been perhaps under-appreciated.  It is extremely lamentable that our Irish foresters, despite their studying, their schooling and their vast experience in their profession, are left at the end of the day without any degree or other certification of their expertise and qualifications.  Perhaps even at this late stage this extraordinary oversight could be addressed and rectified.</P>
    <P>With the changes currently taking place in the area of agriculture it is necessary that farmers look to new methods and new alternatives.  In this context forestry is an obvious and realistic choice. The Government are taking positive action to promote and encourage private tree planting with the increased domestic grants for broadleaf and coniferous trees which were introduced last year.  This measure will be complemented by the extraction from the EC of greater financial incentives for the promotion and encouragement of private planting.  This increased funding will no doubt continue to be forthcoming as the Europeans are only too aware of their own disadvantages and limitations in the growing of trees as compared to the wonderful, God-given, agronomic climatic and environmental advantages that Ireland enjoys.</P>
    <P>This particular measure has great significance for my own county of Wicklow which percentage-wise has more of its area planted than any other area in Ireland.  Forestry and the timber business in general plays a huge role in the county's economy.  The industry in providing <Col N="1367" /> more than 1,000 jobs is, in fact, the county's largest employer.  It is gratifying to note that Irish timber has now a new level of acceptance and currently accounts for a 60 per cent share of the domestic market.  The top sawmills are now doing extremely well and are achieving record throughputs.  However, while this latter situation is ultra welcome, it is of vital importance that the small operator in the timber business be assisted and facilitated in every way.</P>
    <P>In Wicklow there are many small operators, mostly family concerns, who have been involved in the timber business for generations.  The livelihood of these traditional operators is of paramount importance. They must not be neglected or maltreated in the progress towards improvement for the larger operators.  In this context the regular availability of timber of the type necessary for their particular operation must continue to be guaranteed to the small family-type concern.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Paddy Harte gave me notice of his intention to raise on the Adjournment the subject matter of the road between Lifford, County Donegal and Strabane, County Tyrone, which has been closed to traffic due to a suspect bomb.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to you for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  I am doing so because of the concern among people on both sides of the Border who cannot use this very important road between Donegal and Northern Ireland and between Donegal and the capital city of Dublin using the main road from Strabane to Aughnacloy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The background to this is that the IRA, or some of their fellow travellers, left a bomb in a local shop along that Border road and a bomb in a motor vehicle.  The <Col N="1368" /> bomb in the motor vehicle exploded a few hours later but the suspect device still remains in the shop putting that young man out of business and leaving the road closed.  People are put to great inconvenience because they have to use either the Craigavon Bridge in Derry or the Clady Bridge, between Clady and Donegal, which is three or four miles further up the River Finn.  The Clady Bridge is very old and narrow and heavy vehicular traffic, buses and heavy lorries cause great congestion.  There are long delays from traffic queues going through Clady. It seems to be against all the laws of commonsense that people who live in Lifford and work in Strabane, who could walk to work, or people who live in Strabane and work in Lifford, who could also walk to work, are now put to great inconvenience and must arrange transport to do a six or seven mile journey.  I am not satisfied that everything is being done to clear this road.  I fully appreciate the security involvement and the safety precautions which the security forces have to take.  I am not aware of any road being closed for a full week because of a suspected bomb device which cuts off the North at the Lifford Road that leads to Strabane.</P>
    <P>There is a strong rumour in the area that the authorities in Northern Ireland are not clearing this road because of the lack of security on the Donegal side of the bridge.  Being a native of the town of Lifford and living in Raphoe, which is six miles away, I am very familiar with what happens there.  If this was as claimed I could not defend it.  There is no Garda or military presence at the Lifford side of the bridge.  What happened last week could happen every night of the week. The IRA could simply come across the Border without being obstructed or checked to a part of the road between the bridge and the military checkpoint and abandon a vehicle or leave a device sitting there.  That could happen day after day.  I am appealing to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who I know has a great interest in this and who will do everything in his power to help the people of the area, to have the Northern Ireland office <Col N="1369" /> issue instructions to have that road cleared as quickly as possible.  The question of having better security at the Donegal side of the Border is a matter between the Government here and the authorities in Northern Ireland.  I would support any demand for increased security there.  Any person with a knowledge of the area would agree that there is a lack of security at the Lifford side.  It may be that the random security checks, which are operated at present, would be carried out in different parts of the county but at a major cross-Border checkpoint such as Lifford Bridge that is not sufficient. Apart from the Craigavon Bridge in Derry and Pettigo, this is the main entry to Donegal including one or two minor roads also.  The Minister has been in the Lifford area a number of times and is familiar with it and I do not doubt his sincerity in trying to have this road opened as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>It is inexcusable that a bomb left along the road on Thursday night of last week should cause the road to be sealed off and people to be inconvenienced.  These people are against the violence of the IRA and are appalled by their actions. Because the IRA or other fellow travellers have left this bomb there, decent law-abiding citizens, some of whom have not been able to cross the Border, are now put to grave inconvenience.</P>
    <P>In addition, most of the buses travelling to Dublin use that bridge coming through the main road through Omagh, Aughnacloy and Monaghan.  That traffic has also been inconvenienced.  I urge the Minister to get in touch with the Northern Ireland Office in the interests of commonsense, good community relations and allowing people to go about their work and recreation as they can do in other parts of Ireland.  I have made my plea and I will leave it with the Minister to do what he can to have this road opened as quickly as possible.  I have agreed to share some of my time with Deputy McGinley.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley" hpid="Mr. McGinley Mr. McGinley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleague, Deputy Harte, for allowing me a few minutes of his time.  Also I thank the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs <Col N="1370" /> for coming into the House at this hour on a Thursday evening.  We appreciate his presence here to hear at first hand what the position is.  I had the opportunity of alerting the House to this difficulty this morning.  I first became aware of the difficulty and the obstacle last Thursday night on the way home from this House when I could not get over the bridge between Strabane and Lifford and had to go by Clady.</P>
      <P>There was a report the following morning that an explosive device went off at 2 a.m. on Friday.  As Deputy Harte has said, there appears to be a suspect device in some premises between the two bridges on the Northern side since then.  As the Minister is well aware, Donegal is virtually cut off from the entire Republic apart from the only land entrance from the Republic at Ballyshannon and Bundoran.  This particular bridge from Strabane to Lifford is the main thoroughfare for traffic from Dublin and the South for going into west and north Donegal.  There is constant traffic every day of the week and every hour of the day.  CIE coaches are using this road into Letterkenny and the private coaches from various parts of Donegal which are not serviced by CIE, use it constantly.  Some companies have four and five coaches leaving Dublin every evening for Donegal.  When they get to Lifford or Strabane they are shunted down to Clady which, with all due respect to Clady, is a difficult town to get through.  It has experienced many difficulties in the last few years.  On the Donegal side of Clady there is a long winding bridge, I do not know how many turns there are on it but traffic congestion causes very long delays.  The only alternative is a 20 or 30 mile journey to Derry and back, and, indeed, some people are doing that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to ordinary traffic and coaches to and from Dublin every day of the week, articulated trucks which are servicing a number of industries in County Donegal, and in particular in my own Galetacht area in west Donegal, use the roads.  All products have to be transported through Northern Ireland, to <Col N="1371" /> either the ports or indeed to Dublin.  The radiator factories, the crios factories and various other factories in Letterkenny are handicapped by the delays in transport. As the Tánaiste and Taoiseach &mdash; whose presence in the House is appreciated &mdash; know, this all costs money.  Indeed the fishing industry is also affected, because any waste of time when dealing with fish can be very harmful.  Every hour is crucial.</P>
    <P>No one in this House supports or condones the placing of bombs.  However, I do not think there is a proper urgency employed by the people in Northern Ireland to get to grips with the suspect car that is there, and to open up the road. They seem to be taking a long time to deal with the situation.  So far as I can remember it is the first time that it has taken a week or more, in fact it is in the eighth day, to get this obstacle removed and to open up the bridge again.</P>
    <P>I join with my colleague, Deputy Harte in appealing to the Minister to make representations to the Secretariat and to the Northern Ireland authorities to have this vital link between County Donegal and the rest of the country opened up as soon as possible, to facilitate the flow of traffic that has been using this road and which will continue to use the road in the future.</P>
    <P>Again, I thank the Minister and the Taoiseach for being present to listen to our plea and I am sure they will do everything possible to have the matter put right as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>The Government are fully conscious of the importance of cross-Border roads for the communities living and working in the adjoining regions.  In the case of Lifford Bridge there is the added factor that it serves as a main arterial road linking the Donegal and Derry region to the rest of the country.  It plays a vital role in the economic life of the region; it is a very important road for heavy duty vehicles as alternative routes are not suitable for them.  It also serves families living on both sides of the Border.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For all these reasons the Government are concerned at the disruption and <Col N="1372" /> serious inconvenience caused by the temporary closure of this road, though we understand the reason for this.  The road is closed because of suspect bombs placed by people who have no interest in the welfare of the local community and the serious effects of their actions.</P>
    <P>The following is the up-to-date information available to me.  Lifford Bridge was closed on the Northern Ireland side by the British security forces on Thursday night last, 26 January and has remained closed since.  The background to the closure is as follows: At 10.30 p.m. on Thursday, 26 January, a youth left a package at Dolans petrol station in Strabane, located about a half mile from Lifford Bridge, saying that it was a bomb and that the occupants of the station had five minutes to clear the area.  The area was sealed off and traffic was diverted on both sides of Lifford Bridge.  In the event the package did not explode.  Sixty minutes later, at 11.30 p.m. gardaí at Lifford observed a red Ford Escort, with side lights on, parked approximately 50 yards from Lifford Bridge, on the Northern side.  The car appeared to have been abandoned.  The location of the car was about a quarter of a mile from Dolan's petrol station.  It subsequently transpired that the car had been hijacked in the vicinity by three men earlier that evening. At 3.48 a.m. on Friday, 27 January, an explosion took place in the hijacked car.</P>
    <P>It is believed that all three incidents are inter related.</P>
    <P>We have been staying in close touch with the British Authorities about the matter through the Anglo-Irish Secretariat. While we appreciate fully the need for a thorough clearance operation, we have also conveyed the concern of the community about the hardship caused by a prolonged closure.</P>
    <P>Today we were informed by the British side in the secretariat that the security forces believe that there is another bomb in the car.  Every effort is being made to clear the area and reopen the bridge as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.15 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Friday, 3 February 1989.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Minister for the Marine (Mr. Daly) Brendan Daly">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Daly)</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset let me stress that there are no powers available to me to require boats to land fish in Irish ports or to discriminate in favour of boats landing in Ireland.  Where boats land depends primarily on economic factors and in particular, steaming times between the fishing grounds and ports and the prices available in different ports.  Other significant factors are the social and community ties in fishing communities and the longer term interest of fishing communities in an integrated industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1310" /> The vast bulk of the Irish catch is in fact landed in Irish ports reflecting the fact that the main catching opportunities occur close to Irish ports, the competitiveness of the Irish onshore sector, and the other factors mentioned above.</P>
    <P>The recent trends referred to by the Deputy presumably relate to mackerel landings by Irish vessels into British and European ports.  This is of course, not a new trend.  For example, over 30,000 tonnes of mackerel were landed by Irish boats outside of Ireland in 1985.  This compares with around 22,000 tonnes last year.  A large proportion of landings in the early weeks of this year have been abroad.  However, this essentially reflects an apparent shift in the migrating pattern of the western stock mackerel which is now tending to stay longer in distant northern waters and within considerably shorter steaming times of non-Irish ports. This problem should ease over the next few weeks as the migrating fish come closer to our shores.  I am very mindful of the supply needs of the Irish processing sector.  In my view it is also in the long term interests of the Irish catching sector to support the development of Irish processors. These needs figure prominently in all our dealings with the interests involved and in our policies for the development of the catching sector, the management of fisheries and for the building up of a competitive processing sector which will ultimately be an important factor in the prosperity of Irish fishermen.</P>

      <P>It has been long-standing policy that new mackerel vessels may only be licensed on a replacement basis; this policy was explained to the applicant prior to his making formal application.</P>
      <P>The reason for this restriction is that the capacity to fish mackerel is substantially greater than the available quotas.  It is my duty as Minister for the Marine, to take a responsible attitude and gear our fleet development towards available fishing resources.  It would make no economic sense to allow new boats enter the pelagic fleet at this time. It would merely undermine the viability of the existing boats.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 30 and 31 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The key issue which has not been determined with the EC is the reaching of agreement on the base figure at end of 1984.  Given the targets set by the Commission in the multi-annual programme, the range within which the final 1984 figure may fall, and the clear excess capacity in certain segments of the fleet, the option of allowing open-ended new entries into the Irish fleet is no longer <Col N="1314" /> available either from an EC or a national perspective.</P>
    <P>My concern in the management of the fleet is to ensure particularly where there are quota restrictions that any new entrants will be economically viable and that they will be so without unreasonably displacing other boats remaining in the fleet.  As regards segments of the fleet where excess capacity exists, withdrawals of older boats are to be expected in the normal course of events due to economic pressures, age of boat, safety requirements etc.  I should stress that one of my main objectives will continue to be to identify new fishing opportunities so that the overall viability of the Irish fleet is pretected and enhanced.</P>

      <P>The Salmon Review Group report was published in January 1988.  The report covered all aspects of salmon fishing and made a number of major policy recommendations as well as putting forward a wide range of specific suggestions.</P>
      <P>Submissions were invited from interested parties.  In all 77 submissions were received.  These revealed a lack of consensus on some of the central elements of the report's recommendations.</P>
      <P>Examination of the report by my Department has also shown that implementation in many instances would require increased finance, other resources and, in respect of some of the main items, complex amending legislation.</P>

      <Col N="1315" /> I am, nevertheless, determined to press ahead as rapidly as possible and in so far as the resources available to me will allow, with the implementation of as many elements of the report as is feasible.</P>
    <P>Significant progress has already been made in tackling pollution issues and the protection capability has been improved.</P>
    <P>Together with some of my Cabinet colleagues, I was involved in the ministerial group who considered the problem of water pollution.  Following our deliberations my colleague the Minister for the Environment set about the preparation of the Local Government (Water Pollution) Bill which was recently published. In addition the fisheries boards, together with bodies such as Teagasc and local authorities were involved in a task force designed to increase public awareness of and to prevent pollution where possible.  I am glad to report that their efforts were rewarded by a significant improvement in the situation in 1988.</P>
    <P>The Navy has recently purchased two new vessels.  Their suitability for inshore work such as salmon protection duties should allow a significant improvement in enforcement thereby ensuring the better conservation of salmon stocks.</P>
    <P>On development and conservation aspects generally, I have initiated the preparation of a comprehensive development plan in consultation with the fisheries boards.  Proposals for salmon will be fully integrated with plans for other fresh water species.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Marine the reason the fish quota for sole in the Irish Sea (Block V IIa) for 1989 is down by 35 tonnes; if the reason is related to overfishing in previous seasons; the reason his Department allowed such excesses to go unpoliced; and the steps he intends to take to ensure that such overfishing is not repeated.</P>

      <P>The Irish quota for sole in (Area V IIa) for 1989 is 180 tonnes and is a reduction of 35 tonnes on the 1988 level.  This quota is based primarily on advice available to the EC Commission from its scientists on the current state of the stock.</P>
      <P>In addition, Ireland has been obliged to compensate the United Kingdom because of overfishing by Irish registered vessels during 1988; thus, the actual quantity available to Irish fishermen for this year is 125 tonnes.</P>
      <P>My Department does not countenance overfishing.  The overfishing occurred because the richest sole grounds do not fall under Irish jurisdiction and, due to landings abroad, there were delays in receiving the necessary logbook returns.</P>
      <P>The Community has now tightened the reporting provisions in an attempt to solve this type of problem.</P>
      <P>I have made the Sole (Control of Fishing in the Irish Sea) Order, 1989, laying down a management regime for this stock during 1989.  This followed full consultation with the industry.  The main elements of the regime are intended to restrict the quantity of sole which may be landed by Irish vessels at any one time and to divide the quota between beam-trawlers and conventional vessels.  In addition, the order prescribes a closed period for beam-trawlers in the area north of 52 30' North.  I have made it quite clear that I will further restrict fishing effort if the level of catches warrants it.</P>
