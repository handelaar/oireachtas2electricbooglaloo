      <P>asked the Taoiseach the number of occasions on which the Central Review Committee of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> have met since the election of the present Government; if he will outline the main topics discussed and any decisions arrived at; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Central Review Committee of the <i>Programme for <Col N="2" /> National Recovery</i> has met on three occasions since the election of the present Government.  The meetings took place on 27 July, 21 September and 19 October 1989.</P>
      <P>At these meetings a wide range of issues covering employment, education, social welfare and EC Structural Funds were discussed and progress evaluated.</P>
      <P>It is a matter for the committee to report publicly on their own deliberations as they see fit.  A report was published by the committee in December 1988 on the progress made in meeting the job targets of the programme and I understand the committee are currently preparing a further report on employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I intend to suggest to the committee that they now consider publishing a report on the progress made under all <Col N="3" /> headings of the programme.  From the Government's viewpoint as a partner in the programme, the main targets in new jobs, income tax reductions, social welfare increases, pay and hours of work are being fully met and in some cases exceeded.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach if he is aware, as I am sure he is aware, that there is serious concern in the trade union movement at the continued high emigration levels and the lack of progress on serious job creation?  Is he aware that it is expected there will be 15,000 redundancies this year under the Redundancy Act &mdash; that is not counting those who will not be covered by that Act &mdash;and that the job creation rate for 1989 is expected to be below target?  Has he any proposals which would lead to a rectification of this situation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The principal feature of the situation is that unemployment figures are falling every month.  There is a very clear indication that there is a resurgence in the number of people at work.  The general economic policy of the Government, of course, is to secure economic growth and, as I have said quite a number of times recently, our main problem now is to translate that economic growth into jobs.  That is something to which we give constant attention.  The Deputy will be aware that quite recently the Minister for Labour announced a number of measures which are designed to improve the employment situation but the overall objective of the Government at present is to endeavour to see that to the greatest extent possible economic growth is translated into more jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach confirm that while the unemployment figures are reported as having fallen by 31,000 in the past year, the emigration figure has risen to 47,000 and that it is estimated that 75 per cent of the fall in unemployment figures is accounted for by emigration?  What specific measures is the Taoiseach proposing to <Col N="4" /> take to stop the haemorrhage of the emigration of some extremely skilled people, emigration that is causing problems with economic development and the creation of jobs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>A reduction in the emigration figures, indeed the ending of emigration, is central to everything the Government do and, as I have said, is the principal objective of Government economic policy.  The first requirement, of course, was to get the public finances into order and then to secure economic growth.  These two targets we have succeeded in achieving.  That is the basis of getting the employment situation under control.  Right across the spectrum our endeavours are to create more jobs and by specific measures to reduce the numbers on the unemployment register through various schemes while at the same time, now that we have a very satisfactory rate of economic growth, to translate that into jobs.  I am sure the Deputy will agree that it is not possible to create jobs unless we have economic growth. We now have reasonably favourable economic circumstances and the basis is there on which we can, under all the different policy sectors, endeavour to create more jobs which is the only real answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach not aware that at their annual conference in Bundoran, uncharacteristically, Congress decided to have a special conference in January to review the programme precisely because the economic growth to which he refers is not taking everybody along with it?  Furthermore, is he not aware that the current measures for employment stimulation for which the Minister for Labour is currently responsible have been effectively reduced and that we now have large areas of structural unemployment in our urban communities? Does the Taoiseach propose to direct the agencies of the State, including the various Government Departments, to specifically and directly intervene in areas that are resistant to any kind of <Col N="5" /> private sector development, notwithstanding what levels of growth there might be, so that there would be State-led employment creation in those areas which are defying all other efforts to create employment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I think the Deputy would agree that we have a very vibrant public sector at present with a number of our State companies recording considerable success in their particular sphere of activity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>All State companies have a brief, in so far as they possibly can within the ambit of their activities, to create more employment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Would you not agree that notwithstanding the positive signs which everybody in this House welcomes, there are areas of structural unemployment in our urban communities that are resistant to any kind of private sector development? Therefore, the responsibility falls directly on the Taoiseach to propose specific measures.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that structured unemployment is at issue and, as the Deputy is aware, we have from time to time taken special measures to relieve the situation of the long-term unemployed who perhaps are the principal sufferers in this area.  I want to assure the Deputy that the entire thrust of Government policy in the State sector and in sections of the private sector is to deal with the fundamental problem of unemployment. I accept &mdash; I have said it a number of times &mdash; that the core problem <Col N="6" /> now seems to be how we can translate economic growth into more jobs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. G. FitzGerald Dr. G. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. G. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that his reply shows no awareness of the existence of a severe shortage of skilled workers in the construction industry, leading to the danger of excessive increases in pay which could generate inflation across the economy?  What steps are the Government taking in this sector &mdash; where there are jobs available &mdash; to encourage people with these skills in Britain to return here to take up these jobs by conveying to them the fact that there is a possibility of sustained employment here?  The Government should get away from ideology and get down to brass tacks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of steps have been taken to deal with that precise problem.  I would remind the Deputy that the construction industry is in a far healthier condition now than when he was responsible for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. G. FitzGerald Dr. G. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. G. FitzGerald</NameTxt>

      <P>A final brief question from Deputy De Rossa.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that this House debated the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> prior to its implementation and that it is due to expire approximately this time next year, will the Taoiseach allow the House to have a debate on the programme, not necessarily in this session but perhaps in the next?  Will he also indicate whether it is intended to initiate discussions for a renewal of this programme for a further period of years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be quite prepared to facilitate the House at some stage along those lines.  As I have stated on a number of occasions, we are very anxious to start discussions with a view to having a second programme to take over from this one when it expires.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach the number of women who are currently members of the boards of semi-State companies or State bodies; the percentage of the overall membership of such boards this represents; if the Government have any plans to increase the number of women appointed to such positions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Currently there are 298 women serving on the boards of semi-State companies and State bodies, which represents 13.5 per cent of the total board membership of 2,205.  Of the total membership of 2,205, Government appointees number 1,476, of which 235 or 16 per cent are women.</P>
      <P>The appointment of women to the boards of State-sponsored bodies is probably the most effective means open to the Government to incorporate women into the decision making process.  Ministers take account of this as a significant factor when nominating candidates for appointment and the Government are committed to a policy of appointing qualified women to these positions to the greatest extent possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Have any people been appointed to boards since last January when I last asked this question because there seems to have been very little progress regarding the appointment of women to boards based on the figures given by the Taoiseach on 25 January 1989 and those given today?  There has been no movement in the appointment of women to boards by the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The position this year, as the Deputy knows, was interrupted by certain events and, therefore, the number of appointments did not follow the normal pattern.

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>In the light of the lamentably slow process of increasing the percentage and proportion of women on State and semi-State bodies, will the Government agree that a plan of affirmative action should be seriously considered by every Government Department and that a directive should be conveyed to the other nominating bodies in regard to this matter?  In view of the Taoiseach's reputation I ask him to acknowledge the lack of female personnel in these areas and as he has not nominated his members for the Seanad, that there will be a high level of female appointees.</P>

      <P>I think it is more satisfactory to proceed with matters on an all-party basis through the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.

      <P>The point I am endeavouring to make is that, as a result of the agreement signed by the Taoiseach and the Leader of the Progressive Democrats, we were promised a programme of Dáil reform by the Government.  I am endeavouring to ascertain whether the Government are now addressing themselves to this question of Dáil reform or whether they are simply side-tracking the issue, pushing it into the area of responsibility of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, who, of course, are quite capable of examining Dáil procedures. For instance, there arises also the question of the commission on constituencies. Does the Taoiseach intend that the Committee on Procedure and Privileges will deal with that matter also?</P>

      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that the programme circulated by the Government Chief Whip, for example, does not include any legislation in relation to the establishment of an environment protection agency about which we have heard a lot from the Minister for the Environment and the Minister of State at that Department?  There is no reference to that in the Government programme. Is the Taoiseach aware that there is no reference to any equality legislation in the programme although the Taoiseach, in 1987, inherited the heads and quite a deal of work done on a new equality Bill? Is he aware, for example, that there is no <Col N="15" /> proposal among those circulated by his Chief Whip for reform of the health service, or of our social welfare service, although there have been specific proposals on both before this House for quite a long time?  For example, is he aware that the programme circulated by the Chief Whip includes no legislation for the review of Dáil constituencies?  Would the Taoiseach not agree that, in those five areas at least, all the talk engaged in by himself and his Ministers over the past two and a half years &mdash; not just over the last couple of months &mdash; has been to the effect that they were about to bring in legislation, that they were just on the point of bringing in legislation, yet they cannot even say now whether we will have such before next Christmas?</P>

      <P>Even though we have 19 fairly important measures before the House, if the circumstances permit other legislation can be introduced and perhaps given priority.  Alternatively, as the Deputy knows, in every session there are matters which come up which need urgent attention and which have to be coped with.  If the Deputy studies the list of items put forward by the Chief Whip he will find that it is a very major programme of legislation for any one session of this Dáil.</P>

      <P>It is not the practice to make statements of this nature while the current Presidency has still so much time to run.

      <P>The Taoiseach will agree that every Member of this House is anxious to assist the Government in their responsibility in the forthcoming Presidency. In order for us to do that fully, would the Taoiseach not consider that it would be useful for this House to have a debate before the end of this session which would clarify clear priorities for the oncoming Presidency?  Is the Taoiseach now in a position to indicate to the House that a one day debate along the lines I am suggesting would be an appropriate mechanism?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not averse to that at all but, as the Deputy knows, what we will have to undertake in our Presidency will to a large extent depend on the progress made in the French Presidency.  A number of the dossiers may have been completed and implemented so it is a bit early in the French Presidency to chart a programme of activity for our Presidency. We will now be discussing the NESC report on the Community and Deputies will have an opportunity in that debate to indicate their preferences for action.  The Deputy's suggestion about a debate on the matter towards the end of this session is valuable.</P>

      <P>Is the Taoiseach not aware that over half-way through the current Presidency it is not at all unusual for the incoming Presidency to have indicated a number of areas to which it wants to pay particular attention?  Can the Taoiseach indicate to the House if, for example, reform of the Common Fisheries Policy <Col N="21" /> will be a matter which his Presidency will pursue with some vigour, given the fact that there is a great deal of confusion about it, and not just here?  Will he indicate whether the major changes which are being proposed in relation to the GATT will be a matter of concern to his Presidency or whether the pursuit of an environmental policy in the Community would be something that would be pushed by the Presidency?  Will the Taoiseach give us his thinking on what the Community might do in relation to the area of indirect tax harmonisation, which seems to be stalled now?  Will the Taoiseach also give us an indication as to whether during the Irish Presidency we will see a more constructive approach by his Government to the poverty programme, in contrast to their recent effort, which was to turn down £8.5 million worth of Community funds that we could have?  It would be useful if the Taoiseach could indicate those areas of Community policy, if there are any, to which he and his Government would be particularly attached?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be invidious to do that at this stage of the French Presidency because it would be presuming that some dossiers will not be actively pursued and perhaps even completed before the French Presidency ends, and that has not been the tradition in the Community.  Of course I am anxious as soon as possible to outline to the House the priorities we will have during our Presidency and the dossiers we will wish to advance.  I am sure the Deputy is as much aware as I that this is a period of extraordinary activity in the Community.  There are at least five major issues on the table at the moment which will have to be pushed forward by the French Presidency to the best of their ability and subsequently by us and then by the Italian Presidency.  It is a very fluid situation with major issues on the table. At this stage our approach is to keep in the closest possible touch with the French Presidency and evaluate progress.  In due course we will decide on our own priorities. The Deputy, if he is reasonable, will <Col N="22" /> agree with me that to a large extent priorities are decided for us in this area. There are five or six major issues which will have to be tackled and dealt with immediately.</P>

Does the Taoiseach not think at this stage that it is about time he showed some of the zeal that he recommended to the rest of this House and gave his Government some kind of flavour or character about what they are doing in the European Community rather than the bland nonsense they have been going on with for the last two and a half years?</P>

It is the wish of the French Presidency to have that completed before the end of their Presidency. That is one issue on which I cannot comment at this stage.  It is very likely that the French will succeed &mdash; I hope they <Col N="23" /> will &mdash; in completing that dossier.

      <P>The information sought by the Deputy in Question No. 10 is contained in a statement which I propose to circulate in the Official Report.</P>
      <P>The numerous reports produced by the Law Reform Commission cover extensive and complex areas of law.  They are most valuable and useful and are carefully studied by the Government Departments concerned with a view, where appropriate, to implementing them by way of legislation.  Many of them, including a number of those referred to in the statement being circulated in the Official Report, are already incorporated in legislation or in Bills before the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>The grant-in-aid to the commission for each of the last three years which corresponds closely to the cost is as follows: 1987, £300,000; 1988, £310,000 and 1989, £330,000.</P>
      <P>The following is the statement:</P>
      <P>(1)  Reports produced by the Law Reform Commission during the last three years:</P>
      <P>(a)  Report on The Statute of Limitations: Claims in Respect of Latent Personal Injuries.</P>

    <P>(n)  Consultation Paper on Child Sexual Abuse.</P>
    <P>(o)  Report on Land Law and Conveyancing Law: (2) Enduring Powers of Attorney.</P>
    <P>(2)  Action taken or proposed in respect of Law Reform Commission Reports published since October 1986:</P>
    <P>(a)  Report on the Statute of Limitations: Claims in respect of Latent Personal Injuries</P>
    <P>A Bill to give effect to the commission's recommendation is being drafted and will be introduced in the Oireachtas as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>(b)  Report on Rape and Allied Offences</P>
    <P>Legislation to implement the majority of the recommendations of the report is currently before the Dáil having been passed by the Seanad.</P>
    <P>(c)  Report on the Service of Documents Abroad re Civil Proceedings &mdash; The Hague Convention</P>
    <P>The Superior Courts Rules Committee have been asked to draw up the rules of courts necessary for the implementation of The Hague Convention on the Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or Commercial Matters.  Legislation will not be required to implement this report.</P>
    <P>(d)  Report on Receiving Stolen Property</P>
    <P>(i)  Legislation to implement the main recommendations of the report &mdash; the Larceny Bill, 1989 &mdash; is currently before the Dáil.</P>
    <P>(ii)  The recommendations on the admission of business records in evidence in criminal trials is being considered by the Minister for Justice for inclusion in a Criminal Evidence Bill which is being prepared.</P>
    <P>(e)  Report on Malicious Damage</P>
    <P>A Bill to implement the recommendations of the report is being drafted.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 13 together.</P>
      <P>The Ministers for Cultural Affairs of the European Community have already agreed to designate Dublin as &ldquo;European City of Culture&rdquo; for 1991.  I have had detailed discussions with a number of persons concerned, including Dublin's city manager, as to how an effective organisational framework for this event can best be put in place.  Following these, I have given a mandate to Dublin Promotions Organisations Limited, which were so successful in promoting the Dublin Millennium, to plan and organise the necessary cultural events in Dublin for 1991.  The board of that organisation are at present being reorganised to meet the particular needs of the situation.  It is hoped to appoint a chief executive within the next few weeks to assist the board in their new task.  Full details relating to the names and designations of the augmented DPOL board and their chief executive will be announced at that stage.</P>
      <P>The level of the State assistance available for Dublin's tenure as &ldquo;European City of Culture&rdquo; will be determined in the light of its proposed programme of events.  It is expected that a considerable amount of commercial sponsorship will also be secured.</P>
      <P>I envisage that the chief executive for this project will undertake extensive consultations with all interested parties, including members of the three local authorities in the greater Dublin area, Members of the Oireachtas representing Dublin, the Arts Council and other representative groups as well as the general public.  The timing of the publication of an interim programme of events in this context is primarily a matter for consideration by DPOL and their chief executive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that all sides of the House were <Col N="28" /> unanimous in their praise for the successful manner in which celebrations were organised by DPOL to mark Dublin's Millennium.  I have every confidence that their work to organise our tenure as &ldquo;European City of Culture&rdquo; will be equally successful.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Taoiseach's statement but I regret that so little seems to have been done.  Is the Taoiseach aware that Glasgow, which will be the cultural capital in 1990, has been preparing for this for three and a half years with salaried people and with a structure and Madrid which will be the cultural capital in 1992 has already set up its structure?  Would the Taoiseach not take this whole issue with a greater degree of urgency given the importance of it not only to the city but also to the country?</P>

      <P>I am not sure if I understood the Taoiseach's reply correctly, so perhaps he might be able to advise me.  I understand this task has been given to a body, the board of which has to be reorganised, that the board have yet to appoint a chief executive, that the chief executive has yet to come forward with a programme, that until such time as the programme comes forward we do not know how much money is going to be available, that it would be for the chief executive, when he or she is appointed, to perhaps take into account discussions with Members of the Oireachtas and others, and that maybe the Arts Council will be involved.  Have I understood the Government's position correctly?</P>

      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach if the Government will be making provision in the budget for 1990, from whatever subhead, for a capital sum to facilitate this project and, if so, if he could indicate the scale rather than the precise sum? Will thousands of pounds or millions of pounds be provided in 1990 for this project?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Adequate provision will be made.  As the Deputy will understand, until we have a fair assessment of the extent of the programme I do not think we can decide what the exact provision should be but I assure the Deputy that adequate provision will be made. The situation will also be affected by the amount of private sponsorship forthcoming. As the Deputy will remember from the Millennium celebrations, this particular organisation were successful in securing a great deal of very valuable private sponsorship.  I assure the House that this matter will be pressed forward and that we will do ourselves credit in Dublin as the European City of Culture in 1991.</P>

My understanding is that the intention is that the nomination of cities as cultural capitals is to develop the cultural life of these capitals and, hopefully, of the country concerned.  Can the Taoiseach indicate what kind of cultural infrastructure will be developed to cope with <Col N="30" /> the year 1991, which will remain following that year to enrich the lives of the people of this city?</P>

      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 15, 16 and 17 together.</P>
      <P>There was no communication by the Government to the British authorities of the decision of the Director of Public Prosecutions prior to its announcement by him.  The Director of Public Prosecutions issued his public announcement on the evening of 12 October.  As that announcement indicated, he had earlier that day informed the British Crown Prosecution Service of his decision.</P>
      <P>While it is not the practice to disclose communications between the Attorney General and his British counterpart, I can say that on the day and prior to its being announced the British Attorney General was informed of the director's decision by the Attorney General, who had been informed of it by the director that day.</P>
      <P>As the House will be aware the Director of Public Prosecutions is, by virtue of section 2 (5) of the Prosecution of Offences Act, 1974, independent in regard to decisions taken by him whether or not to prosecute in any particular case. Accordingly, while I do not accept that there is any apparent discrepancy such as the questions suggest, it would be quite inappropriate for me to comment on the director's decision in the case referred to by the Deputies.</P>
      <P>It would also be inappropriate for me to comment on the statement issued by the Attorney General in December 1988, in connection with the exercise of his independent functions or on the decision recorded in that statement.  I emphasise that it was the Attorney General's statement and it will be recalled that I read that statement to the House because I considered it desirable that the statement should be on the record of the House. On that occasion I did not, however, offer any comment on the statement and I do not propose to do so now.</P>

      <P>My understanding of the events which took place last December is that the Attorney General refused to endorse a warrant for the extradition of Patrick Ryan on the grounds he would not get a fair trial, which would seem to have been reasonable.  However the Taoiseach, who read a statement to this House, whether he likes it or not, must now stand over that statement and indeed take responsibility for that statement. Unless the Taoiseach is answerable, then in effect the Attorney General is answerable to nobody.  The Taoiseach by making that statement in this House must now stand over that statement and take responsibility.  I would remind the Taoiseach that at that time he read to the House what the Attorney General said &mdash;&ldquo;In respect of two of the charges I am satisfied that there is an intention to prosecute and that the intention is based on a sufficiency of evidence&rdquo;.  I would like the Taoiseach to clarify how he can reconcile that with the decision made by the DPP last week.</P>

      <P>I would emphasise here that certainly neither I nor anybody I know in this House would wish to interfere with the independence of the DPP, or in the decisions that the DPP makes, but there is clearly a discrepancy between what the Attorney General said in relation to a sufficiency of evidence and what the DPP has said &mdash; which was that he did not think there was sufficient evidence to bring this man before an Irish court.  Can the Taoiseach clarify the basis on which that decision was made?  Was it because witnesses from Britain were unwilling to come to Ireland to give evidence, that the evidence was there, but, that witnesses were not willing to come here to give the evidence?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think I should go into that ground.  These are two statutory officers who have specific statutory responsibilities in regard to which I have no function and, indeed, in regard to which I think it would be undesirable and wrong for me to have a function or to interfere, or appear to interfere in any way.  As I said, the statement of December 1988 was a statement by the Attorney General in his capacity as a constitutional officer.  I read that statement for the information of the House, and for no other reason.  I did not comment on it then and I am quite certain that I am precluded from commenting on it now. Exactly the same applies with regard to the DPP.  The DPP was established by statute by this House precisely to be independent and totally removed from political influence of any kind, and removed from the political process, so that these very important matters which are within his ambit can be decided by him strictly in accordance with his statutory duties.  I am quite satisfied and clear in my mind that it would be wrong of me to comment on either of these two decisions or statements by these two officers.</P>

      <P>Would the Taoiseach not <Col N="36" /> accept that the rest of this House is bound to be very sceptical in the future about any statements the Taoiseach reads in this House which are attributed to somebody else?  Would the Taoiseach not agree that what we are really asking him to do here is not to comment on the Attorney General's statement, or on what he said at that time or to comment on the DPP's statement but simply to explain to the House why there is such a difference between the view the Taoiseach reported to this House last December and what has actually turned out in fact?  May I remind the Taoiseach that not only did the Attorney General go to the length of saying that there were two serious charges and that they were founded on a sufficiency of evidence, but he also went to quite some lengths to recall to the House the means that this jurisdiction has for dealing with cases of that kind?  He went to the trouble of pointing out that heavy penalties are prescribed by Irish law for those offences, by which we must assume he meant the offences with which the person could be charged.  He also went to the trouble of saying&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The Deputies cannot have it both ways.  If we want these officers to be totally independent in the administration of justice and adhere strictly to their statutory functions independently, then Deputies cannot seek to drag me into it as Taoiseach and try to have me either comment on or criticise or do anything else in regard to statements made by the two officers in full and complete discharge of their statuory duties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 28 and 54 together.  In May 1989 the EC Commission tabled revised proposals for approximation of VAT.  These provided for a minimum standard VAT rate of about 15 per cent, a reduced rate in the range 4-9 per cent, and the option of a zero rate in respect of a limited but unspecified range of goods.  The Commission's excise proposals have not yet been tabled but I understand that these will be available shortly.</P>
      <P>Discussions on the VAT proposals are proceeding.  Agreement has been reached in the Council of Ministers on certain structural aspects, in particular, the continued application of zero-rating to exports and the charging of VAT in the country of consumption.  However, the whole question of rates of both VAT and excises remains to be settled.</P>
      <P>The Government's policy in this area is to participate fully in the realisation of the internal market while at the same time ensuring that this does not entail any unsustainable loss of revenue or serious damage to the economy as a result of tax approximation.  We are continuing our efforts to find solutions to these problems with our Community partners.</P>
      <P>Since matters have not yet progressed to the point where the shape of an agreed package is clear, it is not possible to say whether persons on low incomes will require protection from indirect tax harmonisation. Deputies can take it, however, that this aspect will be considered carefully by the Government.</P>
      <P>There are no live proposals to harmonise deposit interest retention tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="39" /> Proposals were put forward last February by the European Commission for the introduction of a minimum Community-wide withholding tax on interest income; member states would have been free to impose a higher rate on their own residents. The proposals, which Ireland broadly supported, were opposed by a number of member states and, although they have not been withdrawn by the Commission, they seem very unlikely to be agreed.</P>

The arrangements for amalgamating the amenity grants scheme with the recreational facilities scheme in a single consolidated scheme to be administered by the Minister for the Environment, to which I referred to in my reply, differ from those recommended by the all-party committee who envisaged the continuation of two separate schemes.  Under the new arrangements grants will be allocated by the Minister for the Environment on the basis of recommendations made by the local authorities, who will be responsible for processing the applications.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if his attention has been drawn to the report prepared by two ESRI economists and delivered at the recent Conference on Poverty and Taxation which estimated that between 11 per cent and 18 per cent of those living in poverty paid income tax or PRSI; the measures, if any, the Government intend to take to eliminate the tax burden on people in this category; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the report he refers to is based on a survey carried out in 1987.  In the 1989 budget, I increased the general <Col N="45" /> exemption limits by £250 for a single person and £500 for a married couple, to £3,000 and £6,000 respectively.  The age exemption limits were also increased.  In addition, in recognition of the difficulties faced by low income families, a special addition of £200 per child to the exemption limits was introduced.  Taxpayers who continued to be assessed under the normal basis benefited from my reduction of the standard rate of income tax from 35 per cent to 32 per cent.  The family income supplement scheme also was substantially improved by, among other things, increasing from five to eight the number of children in respect of whom an additional supplement is paid and by increasing the rate of supplementation from 50 to 60 per cent of the difference between actual family income and the statutory income limits.</P>
      <P>The Government continue to be concerned to improve the lot of those on low incomes.  In this connection, I would point out to the Deputy that the steps taken in the 1989 budget are being continued in the <i>Programme for Government 1989-93</i>, which contains a commitment to continue to reduce the standard rate of income tax to 25 per cent by 1993 and, in order to provide targeted help for the special needs of the lower paid and their families, undertakes to make further improvements in tax exemption limits and the family income supplement scheme.</P>

Based on that, the report I referred to estimates that between 11 per cent and 18 per cent of them are actually taxpayers and that the elimination of tax on that category would assist something in the region of 100,000 people, lifting them above the poverty line, whether one takes the low threshold or the high threshold.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 50 and 53 and Priority Question No. 57 together.</P>
      <P>The <i>National Development Plan 1989-1993</i> submitted to the European Commission in March last sought EC Structural Fund assistance of £3.7 billion.  On 20 September last the Commission of the European Communities allocated a total of 36.2 billion ECU to the Objective I Regions of the European Community. Ireland's share of this initial allocation amounts to £2.86 billion.  An allocation of a proportionate amount from the reserve retained by the Commission for Community initiatives would give Ireland an amount in excess of £3 billion which would be consistent with a doubling of our EC commitments by 1993.  The Government will be seeking to maximise Ireland's share of the unallocated reserve.</P>
      <P>Over the period 1989-93 Ireland will receive a higher level of EC aid per head of population than any other Objective I Region.  Ireland will also achieve the highest <i>per capita</i> increase in aid over the 1987 levels.  I am happy that the allocation made to Ireland will represent a major boost for our economic development prospects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="48" /> As the Deputies will be aware, discussions are now at an advanced stage on the completion of the Community Support Framework for Ireland.  The Community Support Framework will set out the priorities included in the <i>National Development Plan</i> for which Community assistance will be given, the aggregate amount of assistance to be given annually through the three Structural Funds, the amount of assistance for each priority over the whole period and the form the assistance will take.  Discussions are also taking place between the EC Commission and the various Government Departments in regard to the content of the national, sectoral Operational Programmes. At this early stage, it is not possible to predict exactly which individual projects will be selected for assistance until the negotiations on the Operational Programmes are concluded. The Community Support Framework will be published after it has been approved and will incorporate the revised expenditure and aid figures for the programmes included in the <i>National Development Plan.</i></P>

      <P>No. 6 is a proposal <Col N="312" /> to extend the time in which the sub-committee of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges will report on the televising of the Dáil proceedings.  It also includes an additional section calling for a more general programme of reform of Dáil procedure covering limitations on the length of speeches, procedures for dealing with urgent matters and the admissibility of parliamentary questions.  There is a number of points which merit a debate on the issue.  The question of televising Dáil proceedings has been under consideration for some time and there have been constant referrals back and extensions of time.  We are seeking to have the extension reduced to the end of this year because we consider that the whole question of televising the Dáil should not need to be extended for a further period to the end of March, which in effect would probably mean that the televising of the Dáil would not take place until about this time next year.  The question of general reform of the Dáil has been added in to this issue.</P>

Earlier today the Taoiseach indicated that the committee were already dealing with the proposal in the programme for Government agreed with the PDs for a wide range of reforms such as the passage of legislation through the Dáil, the Seanad, the committee system, Question Time, the <i>sub judice</i> rule and so on.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, I welcome this opportunity for the Dáil to discuss NESC Report No. 88 on &ldquo;Ireland in the European Community: Performance, Prospects and Strategy&rdquo;.  I recently had the opportunity to elaborate some views on the content of the report at a seminar organised by the Irish Council for the European Movement, and I am glad to avail of this opportunity in the new Dáil session to repeat and develop these views to the House.</P>
      <P>From the outset, I would like to convey the Government's gratitude to the members and secretariat of the NESC for the very comprehensive manner in which they undertook this important study.  The report's findings are both authoritative and detailed.  They represent an important addition to our fund of knowledge on the complex issues which they address &mdash; issues which will have a fundamental impact on Ireland's performance leading up to and subsequent to the completion of the internal market by 1992.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before dealing with the report in detail, I would like to announce that, in the context of renewing the mandate of the NESC for another five years, President Delors has accepted an invitation from me to nominate to the NESC an observer from the European Commission. This observer will participate substantively in the deliberations of the Council and will be able to make available to the Council first-hand knowledge of Commission research and experience relevant to topics being considered by the Council.  This development represents a further significant increase in the importance of the NESC as a forum where the principles of economic and social development can be discussed in a nonpolitical atmosphere by the social partners leading to constructive proposals and recommendations for ultimate economic and social change by the political process.  The involvement of the European Commission in this forum will be extremely valuable, providing a two-way exchange of knowledge and experience <Col N="331" />&mdash; the Commission gaining closer knowledge of our problems and potential, and our social partners being continually in touch with relevant developments throughout the Community.  I would like on this occasion to thank President Delors for his decision to take this step, which can be seen as being taken in the interests of greater cohesion of our economic and social progress with that of the Community as a whole.</P>
    <P>While the report will clearly be of particular interest and relevance to all sections of our society, I believe that it will also be of interest to our partners in the Community, if they are to understand all the economic and social forces which will be at play &mdash; for large and small, central and peripheral countries in the Community &mdash; in the run-up to the completion of the internal market.  For this reason, I have sent copies of the report to my fellow heads of State or Government in the European Council, as well as to the President and Members of the Commission. This is because I believe that the detailed and authoritative nature of the report, coming as it does from a distinguished body representative of all key sections of our society, can give them a keen insight into both the concerns and the goals, which determine Ireland's negotiating position within the European Council in the run-up to 1992 and beyond.  I also had an opportunity to refer to the report and some of the points made in it, when I met with President Mitterrand of France last Friday.</P>
    <P>The report responds to specific terms of reference set by the Government in the economic and social areas which are germane to the NESC's general remit. The report is of the same importance as the earlier report from NESC entitled &ldquo;A Strategy for Development 1986-1990&rdquo;. This provided the kernel of the <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> which has proved to be the catalyst for a dramatic and sustained improvement in the economy over the last two and a half years.</P>
    <P>The report originated from a request issued by me to the Council of the NESC <Col N="332" /> in May 1987, to study Ireland's comparative performance in the European Community since joining.  As a result of this request, the terms of reference decided for the report were:</P>
    <P>(i)  to undertake an in-depth study of Ireland's comparative performance in the EC, incorporating an assessment of the impact on Ireland of membership of the Community;</P>
    <P>(ii)  to assess the problems and opportunities inherent in unification of the internal market;</P>
    <P>(iii)  to put forward and evaluate the policy options available to help mitigate the problems, capitalise on the opportunities and consider what countervailing measures may be necessary.</P>
    <P>If I were to attempt to paraphrase the conclusions of Report No. 88, I would say that the NESC's stance is clearly that Ireland's future lies in the fullest participation in the European Community. The central argument in the report is that full economic, monetary and social integration is in Ireland's best interests. However, the NESC are fully aware of the problems and difficulties that have been and will be experienced in the process of integration.  Indeed, the Council's report provides a comprehensive analysis of these problems.  Having considered the benefits of advanced integration and the difficulties which can arise at various stages of integration, the Council concludes that there are two prime requirements for Ireland:</P>
    <P>(i)  a clear national strategy for European integration which will provide a guide to external negotiations and domestic decision-making;</P>
    <P>(ii)  continued consensus among the social partners, at the national level and at the level of the firm, to ensure a swift and flexible response that is most conducive to the objectives of fuller employment, higher living standards and a better social framework.</P>
    <P>The Council is confident that, if these <Col N="333" /> requirements are met, Ireland should be well placed to maximise the developmental opportunities of the current phase of European integration.  Otherwise, there is a strong likelihood that Ireland's performance over the next decade will fail to show a significant improvement over that of the 1973-86 era.</P>
    <P>While the Government do not necessarily agree with every hypothesis advanced and every conclusion reached by the NESC, we are in agreement with their basic thrust, i.e. that Ireland's best interests are likely to be served by the fullest measure of economic integration, provided that this is accompanied by the necessary measures to strengthen cohesion in the community.</P>
    <P>The analysis in the NESC report of Ireland's economic performance since joining the Community focuses attention on how we as an economy and society responded to the challenge posed by membership.  In particular, domestic economic policy is an issue of critical importance in this context.  The Community is now firmly committed legally and constitutionally to greater cohesion between all regions of the Community. This authoritative evaluation of our performance to date, set out in the NESC report, gives us clear guidance for a strategy which will ensure that our policies and actions and those of the Community can achieve the stated objective of cohesion.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate, at this juncture, to introduce a note of caution, which is acknowledged by the NESC, at the analysis in the report on the question of the impact of EC membership for Ireland to date.  Deputies will also acknowledge that the facts of our economic performance since 1973 were not solely the result of our membership of the Community, but also due to a host of other factors such as technological change, shifts in global trading patterns and two major oil induced recessions in the world economy as a whole.  Indeed, an attempt to isolate the effects of EC membership since 1973 is particularly difficult, given that our <Col N="334" /> accession to the Community coincided with a major and prolonged change in the world economic climate brought about by these recessions, which had a particularly profound impact on a small open economy such as that of Ireland's.</P>
    <P>This is not to say that the NESC's analysis should be ignored.  It should instead be seen as an indication of the complexity both of past trends and of any attempts to analyse likely future trends in the run up to 1992.  In addition, it is clearly difficult to disentangle the effects of EC membership in itself from those of our own behaviour and policies during our period of membership.  Clearly, there is no immunity for any country from the implications of shifts in global demand for products, developments in technology and changing patterns and terms of trade. The need to adapt is a continuing fact of life for every open economy, regardless of the trading bloc or group to which it belongs.</P>
    <P>To recognise this is not to imply that we have no control over our economic destiny.  On the contrary, it means facing the fact that economic performance is ultimately determined by our capacity and willingness to confront change boldly.  Our experience over the last two and a half years offers ample proof of this contention.  By responding flexibly, correctly and in time to events and trends in the international market place we can weather unfavourable changes and build on new opportunities as they arise.</P>
    <P>EC membership over the past two decades, accompanied by huge technological advances and significant adverse changes in key international factors such as inflation, interest rates, energy costs and employment, was always bound to pose an immense challenge to Government, industry, trade unions and the farming community.  As a society, we must accept that, since our accession, insufficient progress in closing the income gap and on the employment front derives in part from our own actions or inaction as well as from any inadequacies or failures of Community policies.</P>
    <P>We have, however, learned over the past two decades some useful and at times <Col N="335" /> costly lessons about how macro-economic policy should be conducted in an open economy.  One lesson, in particular, is that expansionary fiscal policies financed by massive external borrowing that were practised after our EC entry in 1973 do not work.  During the last two and a half years reductions in Government expenditure and borrowing enabled us to achieve lower inflation, lower interest rates, greatly improved public finances and, more recently, increasing employment. It also enabled us to derive the real benefits from EMS membership, by enabling us to maintain lower inflation and interest rates than Britain and closer to those in Germany.</P>
    <P>The clear evidence of our determination to tackle the budgetary problem restored confidence in the economy and has improved our international credit rating.  As interest rates began to fall, inflation reached a 30 year low, international competitiveness steadily improved, employment started to expand and unemployment to fall.  This process has gathered momentum in 1988 and 1989, to such an extent that the recent OECD Survey on Ireland refers specifically to a &ldquo;remarkable turnaround in both domestic and foreign confidence in the Irish economy&rdquo;.  This quite remarkable turnaround is reflected, for example, in the fact that in both 1988 and 1989 the amount borrowed by the State has been cut by considerably more than had been planned, so much so that we are already well ahead of the target set in the National Development Plan of lowering the Exchequer borrowing requirement to 3 per cent of GNP or less by 1993.  This major improvement has come about because of progress on both sides of the national accounts, reducing spending and improving revenue.  Government expenditure as a percentage of GNP has been cut by a full 10 per cent in three years, from 55 per cent in 1986 to approximately 45 per cent this year.  At the same time economic growth and a vast improvement in the level of tax collection greatly <Col N="336" /> increased the revenue returns.  The combined result has been a dramatic improvement in the public finances.</P>
    <P>I would draw Deputies' attention in particular to the fact that the severe corrective financial measures taken over the last two years did not result in a major depression of economic activity.  In fact, the reverse was the case.  The remedial action actually established a climate for investment and business expansion, for confidence and for optimism.  Even in the year of the toughest measures, there was GNP growth of 1.6 per cent, while in the years 1982 to 1986 when the national debt was rising rapidly there was no growth at all.  This year, GNP is likely to grow by 4 per cent or more.</P>
    <P>As a result, employment is set to grow significantly.  Between April 1987 and 1988 employment rose by 11,000 and unemployment fell to 224,000 compared with the period up to 1986 when both unemployment and emigration were climbing sharply at the same time.  While employment growth will have been retarded by the fall in public service numbers, we expect a strong resumption of the upward trend this year, particularly in the productive industrial and service sectors.  Increasing employment, reducing unemployment and emigration, is the central objective of Government policy to be achieved both by macro-economic policy measures as well as by sectoral development measures.</P>
    <P>The key factors for economic success in a small open economy are competitiveness and flexibility.  The more competitive an economy, the more output it can sell and the more investment it will attract, generating further increases in economic activity and more jobs.  While NESC rightly point to the fact that the stance of Government policy is a crucial determinant of competitiveness, it is not the only consideration; the response of the other social partners is an equally vital ingredient. With most of the economic fundamentals in order we are now poised to reap the benefits in terms of sustained growth and a substantial increase in employment.  That crucially depends on <Col N="337" /> maintenance of social partnership and consensus, which has enabled us to make such rapid progress so far.</P>
    <P>The co-operation and involvement of the social partners in the Government's economic strategy in the context of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> has been a key factor in helping bring about the dynamic recovery of economic growth since 1987.  I am sure that Deputies from all sides will join with me in acknowledging and commending the social partners for their crucial role in this process.  I cannot emphasise enough, however, that the progress we have made over the last two and a half years in restoring confidence and growth to our economy has been possible only because we all worked together.  Trade unions, employers, industrialists, farmers and Government combined in a concerted <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> which has been a unique endeavour with remarkable results.</P>
    <P>We have a unique opportunity to develop a successful, disciplined economy, that in good times and bad will perform so as to protect to a large extent employment, incomes and living standards. There is a number of models in Continental Europe and further afield of this type of economy that performs consistently and successfully.</P>
    <P>This is a small open economy, with a limited domestic market on an island some distance from our main markets, emerging from a state of underdevelopment. We will only succeed in raising the living standards of our people and giving them the social services and cultural amenities they are entitled to, if we combine all our resources and work together in an agreed strategy toward common objectives.  For over two years we have shown the enormous success that can be achieved in this way.  We have demonstrated that, while becoming internationally competitive in our goods and services, we have also managed to improve our standard of living.  We must not let this valuable consensus fall apart now.</P>
    <P>The pursuit of sectoral interests, without regard to the wider national interest, <Col N="338" /> would rapidly undo most of the hard-won progress that has been achieved.  Any short-term gains would soon prove illusory.  It should be acknowledged that the social partners have a far wider and more important role in society than merely pursuing narrow sectoral ends, and that policies relating to inflation, employment, social welfare and taxation have as much impact or more on the welfare of the community than short-term financial gains.</P>
    <P>Indeed, the experience of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> perfectly illustrates the point.  <i>The Programme for National Recovery</i> has ensured, by a combination of pay increases and tax concessions, that average take-home earnings have increased in real terms during the lifetime of the programme by between 3.5 per cent and over 7 per cent in 1988 and 1989.</P>
    <P>The programme has enabled us to sharply improve our international competitiveness, as evidenced by our outstanding export performance, while at the same time improving our standard of living.  I believe, therefore, that we must all learn the lessons of the last 16 years; confrontation brings failure and setback; co-operation brings progress and success. Maintenance of consensus is therefore vital to our prosperity.  Consensus requires discipline, patience and compromise. But it is a faster route to increased employment and other shared economic and social objectives than any other.</P>
    <P>It follows from what I have just stated that the Government fully endorse NESC's view that the maintenance of a domestic environment conducive to growth and enterprise is vital to our success in post-1992 Europe, and, that this environment requires continuation of the sound macro-economic management that has been pursued since 1987.  But the challenge posed by realisation of the internal market means that important sectoral decisions and initiatives also need to be taken, and I propose to look at these now.</P>
    <P>It is fair to say that the greatest effects of EC membership were undoubtedly felt in manufacturing industry.  This was <Col N="339" /> because barriers to trade in industrial goods were removed with membership much more so than barriers to trade in services, and agricultural trade was regulated by the Common Agricultural Policy.  The restructuring which has taken place in Irish industry as a result of this process is well documented at this stage. The relative decline of the indigenous sector, and the growing concentration of foreign firms, especially in some sectors of industry, reflect the very substantial changes which have taken place in manufacturing activity.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the approach of the single market combined with our greatly improved economic performance has increased Ireland's attractiveness as a location for industry.  The attraction of companies like Intel and Motorola, the growing interest in Ireland of Japanese and other Far Eastern companies are very encouraging developments.  The Government will continue to give every support to our industrial promotion policy abroad.</P>
    <P>But there are other encouraging features within our outstanding export performance of these last three years.  One has been the export performance of the reduced indigenous sector.  Surveys conducted by Córas Tráchtála indicate that exports from this sector grew by 23 per cent in 1988 and that an additional 4,400 jobs were created in the process.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding these trends, the central issue relating to industrial policy in the future will be how, in the light of the impending removal of barriers to intra-Community trade, we can ensure that indigenous industry in particular adapts and performs better in the next ten years than in the past decade.  An important strategy towards this end is the national linkage programme operated by the IDA, which is developing a core of top-class Irish supply companies to the global multinational corporations based in Ireland and throughout the Community. Adequate preparation for the internal market has also been the key theme in <Col N="340" /> the Government's National Development Plan and in our 1992 information and awareness campaign, Europen.</P>
    <P>On balance, there seems to be a certain degree of cautious optimism about the impact of the single market on Irish industry.  If one of the main direct effects of the single market is the reduction in costs to industry through the elimination of customs and frontier controls, tax harmonisation, common technical standards and increased competition, Irish industry stands to benefit.  In addition, the removal of non-tariff barriers and other obstacles to trade in our principal export markets should give Irish products and services access to markets from which they have previously been excluded.  The challenge and the resultant opportunities are clear: it is now up to Irish industry to respond to them.</P>
    <P>I would not disagree with the NESC report that greater specialisation in certain industries will be required, and that this will involve a greater concentration on the scale of firms.  Our industrial promotion agencies are already focused on these aspects.  The Government agree with NESC that industrial policy must also assist innovation in products and design, as well as processes, if it is to succeed in furthering self-sustaining industrial development.  Already, there is a far greater emphasis on aid for R&amp;D and new technology.  This is fully reflected in the industry programme set out in the National Development Plan, and indeed this aspect has attracted favourable comment from other member states' representatives on the Advisory Committee on Regional Policy.  These aspects will be pursued vigorously, particularly in the context of the forthcoming review of our industrial policy, which is due in 1990, and which will deal with new initiatives called for in this area.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that the NESC report rightly underlines the importance of the financial services sector in the development of the economy.  Worldwide, financial services have been the fastest growth industry of recent years. The Irish financial sector exhibits many of the characteristics identified in the <Col N="341" /> report as necessary elements for dynamic growth.  It is competitive, innovative and, in many respects, already attuned to the international market place.  A further positive aspect of the sector is that the domestic market has long been accustomed to the presence of major international firms competing with local enterprise.  Irish institutions have shown their ability to succeed as important players in sophisticated international lending, foreign exchange and securities markets. The Government have built on these strengths in the successful promotion since 1987 of the International Financial Services Centre in Dublin.  A most encouraging sign for the future is the participation there already of over 70 enterprises including many of the leading EC, US and Japanese banks.  As a result, the centre will be the most significant addition to the city of Dublin and, indeed, to the Irish economy for many decades.  It will serve as a flagship project designed to consolidate the economic gains of the recent past and to act as a catalyst for future sustained growth.</P>
    <P>The Government agree with the report that we must not handicap our financial sector by an inappropriate regulatory environment.  At the same time, it is vitally important to realise that prudent and effective regulation is a critical factor in successfully maintaining a country's financial reputation.  The Government envisages regulation that will meet this need without being cumbersome or excessive; regulation that will assist rather than inhibit the development of the industry.  The guiding themes in the recent legislation on banking, building societies and insurance are the need for sound and sensible regulation, the removal of restrictions on competition and the centralising, as far as practicable, of the regulatory powers in one supervisory body, the Central Bank.  Furthermore, a useful and constructive dialogue has been taking place between the financial services representative bodies and the official authorities.  It is important that the sector provides an appropriate input to policy-making leading up to 1992.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="342" /> How well our financial institutions fare in the completed internal market rests ultimately with individual firms.  Interestingly, NESC's report makes it clear that the relative levels of efficiency between competing institutions is a much more critical factor for success than is size.  The Government can provide the framework for development of the financial sector, but the success of the strategy will depend on the enterprise of individual firms themselves.</P>
    <P>On agriculture, the main thrust of the NESC report is the need for Community policies in regard to price support and production control to give greater priority to the problem of low income farmers; and for long term policies to solve structural problems, particularly as regards the areas of policy still largely subject to national decision-making.  I take the point fully that it is incumbent on the Government to use all their negotiating skills to ensure that Community policies are supportive of Irish farmers and relevant to the new problems of Irish farming, because, clearly, the internal market process and the keener competition it will bring is as relevant to our farming community as it is to the rest of us.  Clearly, the goal of 1992 is to improve the living standards of all our citizens and, in our negotiations in the Agriculture Council, I can assure the House that the Government will seek to influence the evolution of Community policy along the lines recommended by the NESC.</P>
    <P>An important development is that the Commission recognise the structural problem posed by a relatively small number of large, efficient producers and a much greater number of farmers on very low incomes.  The Commission is now moving to address the problem posed by this situation.  We are fortunate that the brief of the Commissioner for Agriculture now extends to responsibility for rural development.  This new approach signals a recognition on the part of the Commission of the importance of rural development, and this will be of positive significance for us in the future. I agree with the NESC that Ireland <Col N="343" /> should be to the fore in promoting constructive developments in this area. Already, the work carried out in the pilot areas for the integrated rural development scheme provides an important basis for future action.</P>
    <P>At national level, the House will agree that a major factor in solving the problem of low incomes in agriculture will be to put the fundamentals of the economy right.  The agricultural industry has benefited considerably from the success of the Government's economic policy and in particular the reduced interest rates of recent years.</P>
    <P>Progress in developing the food sector has been somewhat disappointing.  For example, in the past the CAP encouraged farmers to produce beef for intervention and assisted companies to store beef, which was then sold in a relatively unprocessed form to non-EC markets.  The long term future for the beef industry lies in supplying commercial markets in Europe, while the problem of seasonality in production and supply will also have to be resolved.  The food sector is nevertheless undergoing major structural and financial development at present.  The flotation of some of the major co-operatives on the stock market indicates a new confidence.  Substantial investment is taking place in the sector.  I am confident that this investment and the new market-led approach will stimulate the food industry and eleminate many of the problems, mentioned in the NESC report which have retarded growth in the past.</P>
    <P>In addressing the issue of harmonisation of indirect taxes in the Community, NESC's task of reaching conclusions was greatly complicated by the emergence in May 1989 of an incomplete outline of the Commission's new approach in this area.  At that time, the Commission saw its new approach &mdash; avoiding specific rates or bands and opting for a &ldquo;minimum&rdquo; rate formula &mdash; as giving greater flexibility to the member states.  In principle, this approach would allow countries to settle on the tax rates which they wish.  The Commission <Col N="344" /> thereby hoped to avoid the budgetary and other adverse effects, which were at the root of the controversy about the Commission's original proposals tabled in August 1987 by Lord Cockfield.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the flexibility suggested in the Commission's proposals may be more apparent than real.  NESC's analysis of the implications of the new proposals for Ireland is realistic and perceptive. NESC takes the view that under the Commission's approach, and without frontier controls, Ireland would be forced by market pressures to move very close to UK excise and VAT rates.  The alternative would be a severe distortion of our trade.  However, approximation of our VAT and excise rates with the UK would, on very reasonable assumptions, entail an annual revenue loss to Ireland of some £600 million or 3 per cent of GNP.  As the NESC rightly indicate, such a loss would create a real dilemma for the development of our fiscal policy over the medium term.  If we had to sustain a loss on this scale, our ability to effect essential reforms in income tax, and to continue to curtail State borrowing and reduce the debt burden, would be very seriously impeded.  This would not be what the Single European Act intended nor, indeed, would it be in line with the Community's own advice to us about the imperative need to continue the Government's present economic and fiscal strategy, including tax reform and restoration of sound public finances.</P>
    <P>However, there have been some recent and interesting developments in this area. Following the tabling of the Commission's proposals last May, the council established an <i>ad hoc</i> group on the removal of fiscal frontiers.  This group reached unanimous agreement on a report which was considered by the Ecofin Council on 9 October last.  Significantly for Ireland, the conclusions agreed at that meeting came out in favour of a system of VAT payment in the country of destination, and not in the country of origin as had been proposed by the Commission.  Thus, exports would continue to be zero-rated, and imports would be charged at the domestic rate <Col N="345" /> in the importing country, upholding the existing destination principle.  The conclusions indicate that this will apply for a limited but unspecified period.</P>
    <P>This approach would reduce the dangers of deflation of trade.  The Ecofin Council also agreed that, in regard to the limits on purchases which travellers may take across frontiers, special arrangements might be necessary for two member states, Ireland and Denmark.  It was also agreed that VAT on cars should be chargeable in the country of registration. There is a great deal still to be discussed and the Commission has reserved its position on these conclusions of the Ministers, but I believe these developments have endorsed the Government's prudent and responsible approach to adjustment of our own tax system to Community developments, which it now appears may be quite different from what was originally proposed.</P>
    <P>This was far from taking adequate account of Ireland's concerns, and it is, therefore, still incumbent on the Commission to bring forward proposals which will enable us to participate as fully as possible in the benefits of 1992, while at the same time continuing the present thrust of our fiscal policy, which is the bedrock of our recent economic recovery. The solution will require further modification of the latest proposals or the adoption of other measures, and the Government are actively engaged in discussions with the Commission and our Community partners towards that end. Indeed, recent comments would indicate that there is recognition of the seriousness of the problem for us in the Commission.</P>
    <P>In general, NESC have produced a perceptive chapter on the problems of indirect tax harmonisation and its implications for other parts of the tax system. This Government have already undertaken far-reaching reforms of the tax system in relation to self-assessment, collection and enforcement, the planned reduction of the standard rate, and corporate taxation.  Far more has been achieved in terms of spreading the burden, rationalising the system and <Col N="346" /> reducing tax in the last two budgets, than was achieved for many years previous to that.  The all-party committee on the financing and funding of local government will provide an opportunity to test how far the Deputies and parties in this House are really prepared to go on fundamental reform.  The recent opportunistic call by the Fine Gael spokesman on finance to restore full mortgage interest relief can hardly be seen as the action of a courageous reformer.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are well aware, taxation decisions are made at budget time and in the Finance Bill, not at this time of year. Five criteria will govern future changes in taxation; to maintain a fair and equitable system; the paramount need to sustain the continuing improvement in the public finances and to reduce the national debt; the need to encourage continuing wage restraint, while at the same time promoting an improvement in real incomes; the need to improve the competitiveness of our economy and to retain our skilled people at home; and finally, the need to maintain a balance in the economy by keeping consumer spending growing at a reasonable pace that does not jeopardise low inflation or our positive balance of payments situation.</P>
    <P>Under the provisions of the Single European Act, the pursuit of economic and social cohesion is now a principal objective of the Community.  The Structural Funds are only one of the several instruments needed to pursue this objective. Even after the recently agreed doubling, the Structural Funds will represent considerably less than half of one percentage point of Community GDP.  In any event, cohesion is now an obligation of the Treaty, to be taken into account in the implementation of common policies and of the internal market.  Member states are obliged to conduct and co-ordinate their economic policies to attain greater economic and social cohesion and to reduce regional disparities in the Community. The Government agree with the NESC that sustained growth of the European economy requires growth-oriented management of economic policy at Community level.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="347" /> NESC recommend that the Government support the Commission and the European Parliament in the broad thrust of their policies for the development of Community regional policy.  The Government certainly wish to see and will work for the development of a more clearly articulated and more effective Community regional policy.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate to place on record here that agreement has now been reached on the Community support framework for Ireland, namely the context in which the greatly increased structural funding for Ireland will be invested up to 1993.  The contribution of the Commission to the national development plan for the period 1989-1993 will be £2,860 million.  Taking account of additional funding for new Community initiatives in which Ireland will share, the total support to Ireland over the five years in question should exceed £3 billion.</P>
    <P>The achievement of this amount is the outcome of protracted, intense and carefully conducted negotiations with the Commission.  In relation to our economy it is a significant addition to our investment resources, and a not inconsiderable achievement.  The overall total amount for the community was fixed, and our share of that total had to be decided in relation to the shares of other member states.  In fact, Ireland has secured the highest <i>per capita</i> share of the less developed regions of the Community.  By 1993 we will be in a position to have doubled the 1987 allocation from the Structural Funds in today's prices.</P>
    <P>There has been some misunderstanding about the regional aspects of the national development plan and our submission to the Commission in support of our application for assistance from the Structural Funds.</P>
    <P>I would remind the House that, from the very beginning of our membership of the Community, a principle was clearly established that all of this State would be treated as one region.  This principle has never been departed from in our relationship with the Community or the Commission, nor has it ever been called in <Col N="348" /> question on either side.  It represents an entirely rational approach.  After all, the population of Ireland as a region is just over three million.  In other European countries such as France, the FRG, Spain and Italy, individual regions may have populations of up to nine and ten million.</P>
    <P>So the concept of Ireland as one region has always been accepted and acted upon.  Nevertheless, on this occasion, the Government, entirely on its own initiative, decided in drawing up the national development plan to break it down into seven sub-regions and to carry out extensive and detailed consultation with economic and social interests in the sub-regions.</P>
    <P>This was the first time ever in this country that any national economic plan was broken down into sub-regional sections and that full-scale consultations at local level were undertaken.  It was entirely in keeping with the definite regional policy implemented by this Government, which includes such concrete aspects as decentralisation of the public service, the establishment of regional airports and many other similar elements.  Our specific initiative in regard to sub-regional consultation was publicly welcomed by the Commission, who stated that they were impressed by it.  For the first time ever in the preparation of a national economic plan, ideas for projects and developments were sought from every area of the country and, through a structural mechanism specifically established for the purpose, were incorporated in sub-regional plans for subsequent inclusion in the overall national plan.  In these circumstances, it is simply untrue to suggest that there was any lack of consultation on sub-regional input on this occasion.</P>
    <P>I would like to make it clear also that the sub-regional process will continue. We had made this clear from the time we published the national development plan. The two groups &mdash; the advisory and the working groups &mdash; which have been involved in the preparation of the national development plan at each sub-regional level will now be merged in each <Col N="349" /> sub-region into one unit, which will monitor the implementation of the operational programmes and advise and comment on them.  The merged groups will elect their own chairperson and secretary, and will have a representative from the Commission.</P>
    <P>A crucial aspect of the national development plan and the operational programmes is the manner in which they will be implemented.  This goes to the very basis of our ability to succeed in improving our infrastructure, our competitiveness, and the productive capacity of our economy.  We have in this country fully adequate administrative mechanisms and systems for administering economic and social policies.  These have been built up over the years in accordance with our particular requirements, in a way that is appropriate to our economic and social circumstances and the size of our country and population, without too many tiers of bureaucracy.  These instruments of policy are flexible and directly related to the development needs of our economy and society.  They involve different approaches in different sectors.  For instance, industrial development policy is in the main centrally administered but with an input from local regional offices. Roads and sanitary services programmes are implemented on a county basis by local authorities.</P>
    <P>There is no question but that the requirements of efficiency, effectiveness, and expediency all demand that the national development plan and its operational programmes be implemented through the structures which already exist, with which everyone is familiar, and which have evolved to meet the particular circumstances and population structures of this country.  These structures have, since we joined the Community, successfully administered the Structural Funds without any difficulty or complaint from the Community.  I am glad to say that in discussions I have had with the distinguished President of the Commission he fully agrees that, in the case of a relatively small region such as <Col N="350" /> Ireland, the system of national programmes we have adopted with sub-regional monitoring and co-ordination was by far the most effective, if not the only way, to successfully organise the implementation of the national development plan.  I am also pleased to note that the NESC report itself agrees with the treatment of Ireland as a single Community region, and accepts the consequent role of national government in the formulation of structural plans and policies for the country.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that the NESC report contains an implicit criticism of the strategy for development spending supported by the funds which is set out in the plan.  It is true that the report cautions against an unbalanced pattern of expenditure which promotes infrastructure to the neglect of the directly productive sectors of the economy, but the national plan does not do so.  It envisages massive support for areas other than infrastructure, areas of spending designed to exploit the indigenous development potential of the economy in industry, tourism, agriculture, forestry, fisheries, aquaculture and so on.  This is quite apart from the encouragement to some of these sectors through tax incentives and other policies that do not involve expenditure eligible for EC support. The plan fully respects the balance recommended by the NESC.</P>
    <P>The NESC also say the Government should address a wide range of infrastructure programmes to ensure that every sector of the economy is in a position to take full advantage of the opportunities now unfolding.  In fact, the Government's approach in the plan has been to address infrastructural needs right across the board in an integrated way, so that each area will complement the other and contribute to creating the conditions in which the productive sectors of the economy can operate efficiently on the domestic and international markets.  Let me also recall that access and transport infrastructure are precisely the areas which have been identified by the representative organisations in industry, agriculture and tourism, as <Col N="351" /> most pressing in the need for major improvements as the single market is progressively created.</P>
    <P>The debate on EMU at Community level is still at a very early stage.  The ultimate form of economic and monetary union will only be determined by the detailed negotiations which have yet to take place.  In this context, the findings in the NESC report are timely and relevant.</P>
    <P>I clearly set out our attitude to EMU as recently as at the European Council in Madrid last June.  I pointed out that we have a positive approach to EMU and will work for its accomplishment, but I have also made it clear that progress must have regard to two essential requirements. There must be a balance between advances in the economic and monetary areas, and there must be a balance between the development of EMU and the strengthening of the economic and social cohesion of the Community.  There is no integrated economic area which has not had to take strong interventionist measures to ensure that the economic and social benefits are distributed fairly throughout its different regions, but economic analysis and history shows this is essential, if the cohesion, stability, and durability of the integrated area are to be sustained.</P>
    <P>In my discussions with President Mitterrand last Friday, I reiterated our view that EMU could not work without convergence. The reports of both NESC and the Delors Committee clearly recognise that, if sufficient consideration is not given to correcting regional imbalances, the prospects of lasting economic and monetary union will be seriously at risk. Where the reports differ is in the degree and, possibly, the nature of the effort, on the part of the Community, which requires to be made towards strengthening economic and social cohesion.  In making this comparison, however, we must bear in mind that the Delors Committee consisted of individuals of differing nationalities, experiences and philosophies.  Indeed, given these differences it is most significant that the <Col N="352" /> committee came forward with a unanimous report which acknowledged that particular attention would have to be paid to promoting balanced development throughout the Community.</P>
    <P>That being said, I agree with the view of the NESC that the report of the committee is unduly hesitant and conservative in respect of the assignment of policy functions to the Community in an EMU, and also with the NESC view that the extent of economies of scale, and particularly spill-over effects from public policy, are such, and will be such, that responsibility for many more functions and policies than is envisaged by the Delors Committee will have to be shared between the Community and national tiers of government.</P>
    <P>Among those policies, I would number measures which would modify in an automatic fashion the adverse impacts which the process of structural change can have on regions within the union.  Such instruments already operate in existing unions. Tax systems are structured so that a drop in the income of a region results automatically in a reduction in its contribution to the higher level of government.  Similarly, there are positive mechanisms for supporting incomes in the regions affected in this manner.  The totality of such measures are a powerful force for cohesion.</P>
    <P>Such mechanisms must, of course, be complemented by common structural efforts to aid the advancement of less-developed areas.  The basis for such action has already been laid by the decision to make a substantial increase in allocation of the Structural Funds for the less developed regions of the Community, but I agree with the NESC that there is no guarantee that structural measures on their own will bring about the required degree of economic convergence. That reality is recognised, however tentatively, by the Delors report, which for the third stage of EMU envisages the Council of Ministers having authority to take &ldquo;decisions to make discretionary changes in Community resources (through a procedure to be <Col N="353" /> defined) to supplement structural transfers to member States ...&rdquo;  Both types of measure are, therefore, essential to the durability and stability of a union, and they must operate in a mutually supportive fashion.  They are not alternatives, and to suggest otherwise is, in my view, misguided.</P>
    <P>The sharing of the Community of responsibility for a wide range of policies including both automatic adjusters and specifically targeted structural measures, would inevitably mean the enhancement of the Community budget. We are in favour of such a course, which would intensify the internal solidarity of the Community and its ability to maintain major economic stability and sustainable economic growth.  The size of the EC budget at about 1 per cent of Community GDP is far too small to make a really significant impact in achieving economic and social cohesion.  In 1992, the budget will still be no more than 1.2 per cent of Community GDP, even after the doubling of the Structural Funds.  This falls, as the NESC report brings out, well short of what economic authorities consider necessary as a basis for progress towards a durable and stable EMU.  The report of the McDougall group, cited by the NESC, considered that a budget of 5-7 per cent of GDP, though much smaller than in mature federations, would be adequate if it was high powered.  By high-powered they meant fulfilling to a high degree the redistributive and macro economic functions that are to be expected of an economic union, but at the same time aiming at minimum Communtiy-level public expenditure and minimum centralisation in the supply of goods and services.</P>
    <P>We have to be aware, however, that there are some other member states who may not view the requirements of the future in this light, and who are, in fact, opposed to any further development of the Community budget.  It will be our aim in the negotiations before us to advance our vision of the Community to the greatest extent possible.  I believe the McDougall approach of minimum centralisation but maximum leverage from Community <Col N="354" /> spending offers the most hopeful approach.</P>
    <P>I would agree with the conclusion of the NESC report, which suggests that the Cecchini report on &ldquo;the European Challenge 1992 &mdash; the Benefits of a Single Market&rdquo; was flawed in certain respects, including the suggestion that it was based on an inaccurate and incomplete account of the theories of international trade and integration.</P>
    <P>I cannot fully accept what the Cecchini report says about the potential distribution of gains.  The recent work on international trade shows that, although the total potential benefits of trade to the EC as a whole are greater than was conceived in the traditional theory, these benefits are unlikely to be shared evenly and the possibility exists that a country could lose in significant ways from economic integration, unless there are countervailing measures and policies. The Cecchini report creates the impression that the trend of economic thinking is towards the view that the gains from integration are automatically more certain and more evenly distributed.  This is not our view of how thinking is developing, and we will be pressing the need to ensure that cohesion must be at the forefront of all Commission study and thinking in developing the internal market.  This means that, as provided in Article 130B of the Treaty, inserted by the Single Act, all decisions by the Community affecting a less developed economy such as ours must take full account of the extent to which these decisions will accelerate or hinder cohesion.  The analysis in the NESC report supplies the deficiencies in the Cecchini report.</P>
    <P>The NESC considers that the development of the social dimension of the single market merits considerable and more urgent attention, that this dimension is especially significant for small, less developed economies like Ireland, and that the active development of specific policies which are implicit in the social dimension would contribute to the stability and cohesion of the Community as a whole.</P>
    <P>The report emphasises that the social <Col N="355" /> dimension is an important aspect of positive integration, and, applying their analysis of the requirements for integration of both inter-regional and interpersonal redistribution, they conclude that the principles of public finance suggest that there are now grounds for partial centralisation of specific programmes in the broadly social area.  Thus, their conclusions reinforce those reached in their analysis of Economic and Monetary Union.</P>
    <P>The Government welcome the fact that the NESC have been able to agree on forward-looking and helpful conclusions in regard to the social dimension.  From the outset, the Government have taken a positive and constructive attitude to this aspect.  For us, the most important social dimension is the creation of sufficient jobs to meet the needs of our people.  We have stressed this crucial aspect in the past and will continue to do so.  Our priority now is to translate economic growth into increased employment.  We want the Community of 1993 to be one in which conditions of work and employment will be further improved and in which training will be expanded and upgraded.  We naturally support the strengthening of social dialogue, which at national level has been so central to our progress in recent years, and which, as I have already mentioned, must now be continued and reinforced.</P>
    <P>The issue attracting the greatest attention at present in the social context is the proposed European Social Charter.  The Commission has now approved the final draft of a charter, which it is hoped to have adopted at the European Council meeting in Strasbourg, in the form of a Solemn Declaration by the Heads of State and Government.  At the Social Affairs Council and the European Council, we have supported the principle of the charter.  We have informed the French Presidency that we support a charter incorporating political commitments, subject to certain concerns being met.  As recently as last week, we reiterated our position to the current President of the <Col N="356" /> European Council, President Mitterrand, and to the Commissioner for Social Affairs, Vasso Papandreou, during her visit to Dublin.</P>
    <P>We wish to ensure that, as endorsed in Madrid, only those tasks that can be better achieved at Community level will be subject to Community regulation, with other tasks left to national legislation and collective bargaining; and we wish the charter to have regard to possible effects on cost competitiveness and, therefore, on employment prospects, particularly for small and medium sized enterprises.  We are satisfied, however, that it will be possible to strike a reasonable balance between these considerations and the need for basic protection for those at work.</P>
    <P>Before concluding, I would like to respond to certain demands from some Deputies opposite that the Government should establish an all-party committee to review the implications for Ireland of 1992, following the publication of the NESC report.</P>
    <P>I would remind the House that, as soon as the previous Government came into office in 1987, I appointed a Minister of State in my Department, charged with full time responsibility for the co-ordination of Ireland's approach in the Community. This arrangement still applies under the present Government.  In 1988, I established a Committee of Ministers and Secretaries of Departments, which have been meeting weekly, chaired by myself, to oversee our preparation for the internal market.  In July 1988, we also launched a major national campaign to promote awareness and preparation for 1992, which is continuing.  In the drafting of the <i>National Development Plan 1989-1993</i>, as I have alreday mentioned, we initiated detailed consultation at sub-regional level for the first time ever. These consultations, and the subsequent plan, form the basis for the Community Support Framework for Ireland up to 1993.  The NESC report which we are discussing today and tomorrow was prepared on the Government's initiative.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that this Government's <Col N="357" /> record in disseminating the fullest information and promoting the maximum discussion and consultation on issues pertinent to the 1992 process has been full and adequate.  Furthermore, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the Communities have a specific brief to examine draft Community legislation, including that on the internal market &mdash; to keep a close watching brief on developments leading up to 1992 and beyond, and to exercise their powers in this context as they see fit.  As the Government's energies are increasingly absorbed in preparing for and later managing the Irish Presidency with effect from 1 January next, I cannot see any useful role for a further committee along the lines suggested.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would again like to commend NESC for preparing this report.  I am confident the House will agree that it is a matter for satisfaction that the various economic and social interests represented on the Council were able to come to such fruitful conclusions on issues of great complexity and controversy. It is a lesson to us all how difficult choices in economic and social development can be identified by analysis, discussion and dialgoue in a spirit of objectivity and public service.</P>
    <P>It would be my wish that our problems can be approached in the same constructive spirit in this House.  I readily acknowledge that there are many problems to be solved and that progress is needed on many fronts, above all, in relation to employment.  But we should also be encouraged by the tremendous progress made in dealing with our underlying problems in the last two and a half years.  Continued progress must not be put at risk by abandoning the consensus that has worked so well.  We have to determine our priorities as we have done in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>, in the <i>National Development Plan</i> and in our programme for Government. Responsible opinion in this country wishes us to continue along our present course and to redouble our efforts.  We will not be deflected by unrealistic <Col N="358" /> demands or by short term political pressures from pursuing the steady progress which is required to secure a prosperous future for the Irish people in the Europe of the nineties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> This is the most significant economic report to be published by any individual or agency in recent times.  NESC, in this report, have effectively rubbished the bulk of Irish macro-economic and micro-economic policy and proposed a future strategy whose implementation would require not only the most fundamental policy changes but also radical constitutional changes involving an unprecedented transfer of sovereignty from this House to European institutions.</P>
      <P>I do not intend to rake over the ashes of the past by restating the NESC analysis of our comparative lack of progress in Europe from 1983 to the present.  It is sufficient to state that we have fared worse under almost every relevant heading than any of our European partners. Neither do I intend attempting to apportion blame for this among the policital parties.  All the main political parties and virtually all the main political figures in this House participated in one way or another in the formulation and implementation of the policies which have proved inadequate.  They were advised in this by the senior civil servants, the heads of the State agencies and economists from businesses and the universities who were the foremost men and women of their day in their capacity and function.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The past is another country and visits to the economic past of a country should only be made if one wants to learn from the mistakes of the past.  Everyone in this House and everyone in the public and private sectors who is in a position to influence policy should read this report. Ireland had not done well since we entered the EC in 1973.  We have done well in neither absolute nor comparative terms.  We are further from the average European living standard now than in 1973.  We have by far the highest rate of unemployment, the highest level of <Col N="359" /> emigration, the greatest flight from the land and the lowest living standards of all the original members.  The NESC points out that if we continue with our present European policies, despite the increase in structural funds, we will make no real progress towards convergence right into the next century.</P>
    <P>If the NESC had left it at this they would have done a good job but they have gone further.  They have proposed that this country should follow a pro-active European policy and have proposed the main planks of this policy. Whether we agree or disagree with their views, the NESC have identified the themes around which economic and political debate will revolve for the next ten years, and we in this House owe it to ourselves and the nation to adequately respond.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that a series of statements here today which remove the report from the political agenda are an adequate response to the magnitude of the issues raised.  I believe that a committee of the House should examine the report and report back to the House.  I suggest that a sub-committee of the foreign affairs committee or a special <i>ad hoc</i> committee constituted for that purpose could deal with this report in a manner which it merits.  I propose such a committee to the Government and I further propose that they report back to this House within four months.</P>
    <P>Our best opportunity to influence European policy will be during the Irish Presidency which commences in January 1990.  If, however, this country's European policy is merely to react to the proposals of others, to defensively seek derogations and special arrangements for Ireland when faced with new issues, to seek to hide rather than to explore, to run away rather than to lead, then our Presidency will be a failure and we will also fail to solve our fundamental economic problems because it is only in Europe and through Europe that we can solve them.</P>
    <P>In this respect I am disappointed with <Col N="360" /> the Taoiseach's speech.  With the exception of one area he has broken no new ground and has simply restated his claims to progress and his attitude to the main macro economic policies within this country.  It was an adequate speech for a Taoiseach at the start of a Dáil session; it was a very inadequate speech from the future President of the EC who is now in negotiation with the present President and Commission and who intends taking over in 1990.  Where is the vision?  Where is the Irish policy?  Where is the pro-active approach to European affairs recommended by NESC without which we will make no progress towards convergence, as NESC say, and the Taoiseach agrees with these sentiments?  Why do we always hide in a corner only to emerge defensively when somebody else proposes something and say: &ldquo;We cannot have that, we must derogate here, we must make a special arrangement for Ireland there&rdquo;, and as we continue we are still out of line with the rest of our partners.  We have done worst of all since 1973, 48,000 of our young people are still leaving the country through emigration and almost 250,000 of our people are still on the dole.</P>
    <P>There is one area where I believe the Taoiseach broke new ground, that is, the area of European monetary union.  I was interested in what he said but he delivered that portion of his speech in a most hesitant fashion as if he had not fully absorbed the implications of what he was saying.  I was never one of the Members of this House who thought a lack of intellectual capacity was one of the Taoiseach's faults but I wonder to what degree that has been discussed in Cabinet, to what degree that is a considered view of his Government and to what degree it is simply an exercise in the flying of kites before this House.</P>
    <P>It seems very stange that the Taoiseach in saying what he said in those pages of his speech which deal with European monetary union, the strengthening of the cohesion on the need for intervention by a central governing authority and balancing mechanism where if tax revenue <Col N="361" /> falls off in one area it could be compensated by payments from the centre, did so without once referring to the whole question of sovereignty.  What the Taoiseach is suggesting in that area is an unprecedented transfer of sovereignty from this House to European institutions. I should like to return to that area shortly but I should like to deal first with some other aspects of the NESC report.</P>
    <P>I believe that the issues which NESC have put before us will be the main themes of economic debate in this country during the lifetime of this Dáil and probably during the lifetime of the next Dáil.  It is worth looking at what they say and trying to establish an attitude in this House to those issues.  It is also worth looking at aspects of the report to which the Taoiseach did not refer at all.  I should like to deal first with the question of harmonisation of taxes.</P>
    <P>There are various models which can be followed by countries which propose to co-operate closely in economic affairs. We can have a tariff-free zone or we can remove all the other barriers to free trade between now and 1992, which we are committed to removing and have a fully integrated market, or we can go beyond that and go for a full federation European monetary union with a central authority with the power and the function to intervene in the budgets of the member states. Whatever the outturn of what is happening in Europe will ultimately be, we know we are on a particular road and we have to face some of the issues immediately.</P>
    <P>One of these is the harmonisation of VAT and excise duties.  We had a proposal before us from Lord Cockfield but the Government did not state their attitude to that.  More recently, Commissioner Schrivener published her proposals in May.  She is, of course, a very able lady and she has decided that what countries are unwilling to do by negotiation and concession they may do when faced with the forces of competition. She is not saying we must have a banded system towards VAT rates.  She says that there will be a minimum rate of 15 per cent at the higher rate and that <Col N="362" /> competitive forces will bring countries closer together in their application of VAT.  Of course that is true because it stands to reason that if you have free movement of labour, free movement of capital and the right to establish anywhere in the Community that somebody trading out of Newry where there are VAT rates of 15 per cent would be very competitive when competing against people in this part of the country where there are VAT rates of 25 per cent.  At present the only reason these VAT rates have not entered into the competitive field is the existence of the Border and customs posts which prohibit the movement of large quantities of goods and services.</P>
    <P>It is a very simple concept that if 1992 means the removal of custom frontiers then competition will force VAT rates towards the lowest point and competition between a big and a small neighbour will certainly force the small neighbour to reduce its VAT rates to somewhere approaching the level of the big neighbour. Various studies into this matter have shown that one does not need absolute harmonisation and that an approximation of VAT rates would suffice to remove any prospective distortion in trade.  However, if we are talking about ourselves and the United Kingdom and the land frontier with the North, our top VAT rate will have to come down to about 17.5 per cent, otherwise there will be distortions in trade.</P>
    <P>Certainly this makes life rather difficult for the Government because if Europe goes on with this approach the veto on which the Irish have rested their negotiating position for some time will be circumvented, because how can one veto the exercise of competitive forces?  I would criticise the Government here because they seem to have no policy of their own.  They are doing exactly what the NESC report have criticised this Government and all previous Governments back to 1973 for doing: their approach has been reactive &mdash; we wait for the Commission, we wait for a bigger partner or neighbour to propose something and then we react and if we do not <Col N="363" /> like it we look for a derogation or do some special pleading.</P>
    <P>That is the approach which underpins the main recommendation of the critical analysis.  The NESC have said that is what is leaving us in the state we are in and that only a pro-active policy to Europe can cure that.  Yet, as recently as today the Government, through the Minister for Finance, gave me a summary of the two Commissioners' position in relation to the harmonisation of VAT but refused to say what is the Irish Government's position.  Of course, he refused to say what the Irish Government's position is because the Irish Government do not have a particular position.  They have a general position where they agree that harmonisation is a good thing and hope we all arrive there in 1992 but they have no proposals of the means by which to arrive at that end.  This is as good an example as we are likely to get of what NESC are criticising in this report.</P>
    <P>I know that Madame Schrivener's proposals are far more difficult for a Government to deal with than those of her predecessor.  She has said that there is no necessity now to impose a VAT rate on politically sensitive items such as food, children's clothes, pharmaceuticals, animal feedstuffs and medical supplies. That looked like a concession when the Minister first came home, but of course it is not a concession.  It removes from the Government the possibility of saying &ldquo;Sorry, lads, we had to do it because they forced us in Brussels&rdquo;.  If a Government now try to increase the zero VAT rate they will take the full weight of political responsibility on their own shoulders. Naturally I would expect the Fianna Fáil Government to run a mile from that.  The reduction of VAT at the top rate and the inclusion of the lower rates in a band between 4-9 per cent has been calculated to bring about a shortfall in revenue of about £600 million, even though the Department of Finance have not published the basis for that calculation.  It is something we must face.</P>
    <P>In dealing with this issue today the Taoiseach made three points.  He said <Col N="364" /> VAT can in future be applied in the country of import.  That is fine since it will allow our exporters to export goods VAT free.  It is satisfactory.  Secondly, the Taoiseach said some special arrangements will be made for Ireland and Denmark on the quantities of goods which may be brought across the border.  Again that looks like a concession but of course it runs counter to the whole idea of 1992. Are we and the Danes to be the only citizens in Europe who will not be able to trade freely across Community borders? Are there to be restrictions on our citizens when they go to Northern Ireland? Are we still to have customs posts at Newry and the whole way around the Border to Donegal?  Is ours to be the only land frontier with customs posts in the EC, apart from an area north of the Kiel Canal along the border between the Federal Republic of Germany and Denmark? If so, what will it mean?  What looks like a concession actually means that we will not be full beneficiaries of the integrated market since there will still be some unspecified restrictions on our citizens.  Yet the whole basis of the integrated market is that we should be players in the largest and richest consumer market in the world comprised of 320 million people and because of the free movement of services, capital, goods and the right of establishment, we should grow and converge towards the European standard.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach also announced as a further negotiating concession that motor cars can in future have VAT imposed in the country of registration.  This means we will continue to have outrageously high transport costs, the main contributor to which is the cost of motor vehicles and articulated trucks.  The Europeans will allow us to do that.  We can bring the Renault from France and slap VAT on it here.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach did not mention excise charges, which are a greater contributor than VAT to the cost of motor vehicles.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The proposals, according to the Minister, will be before the next Council meeting.  In discussing how the cost of motor vehicles relates to overall transport costs, I am pointing out that VAT is a smaller element than the excise component and I presume that a logical development of the policy of imposing VAT in the country of registration will be to impose excise duty in the country of registration of motor vehicles.  On the one hand, theoretically we want the benefits of European integration, but on the other hand we look for concessions, which actually subvert our own position and we will not be beneficiaries of the market.</P>
      <P>One of the greatest and most constant fears in Europe is that there will be two Europes, one on the fast track and one on the slow track.  All the Taoiseach has said in his speech today is that he is positioning Ireland for the slow track.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach made no reference to excise duty.  Why not?  Because he says there were no proposals.  This proves once again what I and the NESC are saying &mdash; that the Government have no policy on these matters, that their approach is to wait for proposals in Europe and then react to them.  This policy approach has left us as the most disadvantaged of the European partners with the highest rates of unemployment, the highest emigration rates and the lowest standard of living, which is actually further back from the European standard of living than when we joined the Community in 1973.  Has the Taoiseach read this report and taken on board the message that unless we lead from the front and mould European policy to our advantage by leading from the front we will drift on through the nineties exactly as we have since 1973 as the poor man of Europe?  All the fancy talk about structural Funds and convergence will get us nowhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="366" /> A very short section of the Taoiseach's speech referred to direct taxation.  He talked about the Government's commitment to the reform of income tax. Rather like a bad rugby centre he keeps kicking for touch rather than dealing with the issue &mdash; up along the wing all the time.  He said he would hear the views of other people in this House and test them all for their political and reforming wind because he intends to send the whole issue of the reform of local government to an all-party committee.  The Taoiseach stated:</P>
    <P>The all-party committee on the financing and funding of local government will provide an opportunity to test how far the Deputies and parties in this House are really prepared to go on fundamental reform.</P>
    <P>That was great when the Taoiseach led a minority Government and we on this side of the House, to put the show on the road and try to get some kind of economic progress, said we would work through an all-party committee.  Now the Taoiseach has a majority and in the Coalition which he now leads he has the six apostles of tax reform.  He should not hide behind an all-party committee of this House and pretend that there is a reluctance in relation to tax reform among the minority, which inhibits him from acting with his majority.  The Taoiseach has 83 Deputies and if he wants to reform taxation he should introduce those reforms in the budget and walk those Deputies through the lobbies.  If he wants to bring in a property tax, let him do the same thing. He should not hide behind all-party committees. I have seen that one before.</P>
    <P>The NESC report says that for a variety of reasons of which we are well aware there is merit in transferring the tax burden from what is mobile, like young workers going into well paid jobs in England, to what is immobile.  They leave it at that.  Does the Taoiseach agree?  Do the gentlemen who recommended this report &mdash; the representatives of the farming organisations, industry and the <Col N="367" /> trade unions &mdash; agree with that recommendation? If they do, does the Taoiseach intend implementing that recommendation in the NESC report or will he dodge it through the device of an all-party committee?</P>
    <P>Following on that the Taoiseach had a side-swipe at me when he said that the recent opportunistic call by the Fine Gael spokesman on Finance to restore the full mortgage interest relief could hardly be seen as the action of a courageous reformer.  I called for the full restoration of mortgage interest relief because, even through the Taoiseach does not seem to realise it, interest rates have gone up by 3 per cent across the board since the budget was introduced eight months ago. The Taoiseach is still regurgitating some of the economic speeches made last spring when the Government's main claim to prosperity and fame was that mortgage interest rates were going down. They have gone up and practically every bit of the ground that the Government won on reduced interest rates has been lost again.  When the Minister for Finance further reduced mortgage interest relief eight months ago he said he was doing so because he felt justified as the rates had gone down.  It follows from that that when the rates increase by 3 per cent I am justified in calling for the restoration of the interest relief.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> If we had a debate on political opportunism I would have far more stones to throw than the Taoiseach could ever find on me.  If the Taoiseach wants us to go down that road we will do so.  Does the Taoiseach realise that the average young couple, both working, have a mortgage of £35,000? Does he realise that the increases in interest rates over the last eight months have meant an extra £70 per month out of their pockets?  Does the Taoiseach realise that the earning power of such a young couple to produce £70 per month is <Col N="368" /> £1,600 or £1,700?  That is the gross earning they have to write off to meet the new mortgage interest.</P>
      <P>Some of the people who have latterly rejoined the Taoiseach's party seem to be giving him bad advice and removing him from the reality of Irish life if he regards mortgage interest relief as something which is merely a political football. The Progressive Democrats, when in Opposition, were the great advocates of tax reform.  I do not know what happened in the negotiations between their representatives and those of Fianna Fáil but it appears that they have dropped some of the more significant aspects of their proposals.  In particular, they have dropped their proposal to reform PRSI. There has not been a mention of that but I would advise the Taoiseach to put it back on the political agenda because all the arguments one makes about low marginal rates are only the tip of the iceberg unless the Government also deal with PRSI.  Most of the poverty traps, most of the structural difficulties in the labour market are not caused by high marginal rates of income tax, even though they create other difficulties and should be lowered, but are caused by the incidence of PRSI.  That happens for the simple reason that PRSI and the levies are applied to every pound of income and because of that the combination of employer PRSI at more than 12 per cent and employee PRSI, plus levies, of 7.75 per cent is an imposition of 20 per cent on every pound of income from the first pound of the lowest paid workers in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A man who called to me yesterday told me that he has an income of £145 per week and he asked me if I could help him get a job.  That man, who has a flock of children, told me that by the time he would have income tax paid he would need a job that would pay him about £250 per week if he was to be as well off.  Is it any wonder that there are poverty traps or that there is a shortage of workers in the resurging building industry?  The poverty traps are created by a combination of high marginal rates of income <Col N="369" /> tax and PRSI.  To attempt to reform taxation without addressing the question of PRSI is an activity that is doomed to failure.  The Taoiseach should examine this before the budget.</P>
    <P>In passing it might be worthwhile saying that if the Taoiseach, as he hints in his speech, wants to introduce a property tax he has allies in the Progressive Democrats.  Even the watered down version of former Deputy McDowell's proposals involve some form of local taxation which would bring in £300 million when fully implemented.  I am sure the Taoiseach realised in those heady days of July that 77 plus six makes 83 and that 83 works in this House with a little help from the honourable Member from Roscommon.</P>
    <P>The proposals on agriculture are interesting and when one compares what NESC say and what the Taoiseach said one finds them very interesting indeed. NESC, without putting a tooth in it, said that we do not have an agricultural policy, that we have transferred responsibility for agricultural policy to Brussels.  They said that we simply, to use a bad pun, seek to milk the system.  NESC, proposing that we should have an active agricultural policy, made one significant statement, and I was surprised the Taoiseach did not address it, to the effect that agricultural policy in the future should be based on land use considerations.  If we based agricultural policy on land use considerations we would wipe out the family farm.  If that takes place, family farms along the banks of the Shannon will be as rare as Indians on the Potomac.  NESC went on to say that those removed from the sphere of economic farming activity would have to have their income supplemented by off-farm income or, alternatively, by direct payments.  We have gone over that ground before and we know where that debate leads.  NESC also said that if that is to be the approach the Government should have the right to decide how farmers in receipt of direct payments should use their land.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, a former Minister for Agriculture, must understand the implications of that and I am not surprised <Col N="370" /> that he avoided the issue in his speech.  If the Minister for Agriculture and Food contributes to the debate I hope he will address those issues.  He should tell the House if Government agricultural policy will be based on the one criterion of land use and, secondly, if we are moving towards direct support of income on the family farm through some European mechanism it is the Government's view that they should have the right to decide on how farmers use their land if they are to qualify for that benefit.  We must develop an agricultural policy and I agree with the Taoiseach, and those who compiled the NESC report, that our progress in establishing a proper food industry has been very disappointing.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach was rather generous in his assessment of the NESC report on industry.  The section of his speech was familiar enough, a standard comment on industry by the Department of Industry and Commerce.  However, I did not read the sections on industry in the NESC report in the way the Taoiseach read them.  I thought NESC effectively rubbished industrial policy here in the last ten years.  They did it in the nicest way possible but economists at their best are also at their blandest.  If one was half asleep one might not realise what they were at but I thought the clear message was that the industrial policy we have been following has been inadequate and is inadequate.  NESC seem to say that we have not taken main factors into account such as the influence of scales, competition from Europe and new technology. One of the conclusions is that our manufacturing base has been reduced since 1973 and we have failed in effect to establish an industrial sector based on indigenous industry and indigenous products. They came very near to say the whole approach of having offices all over the world to attract multinationals to Ireland, while beneficial in the provision of jobs, is not necessarily an answer to our industrial problems.</P>
    <P>I sometimes wonder what has happened in the Department of Industry and Commerce.  I am old enough to remember <Col N="371" /> when the former Taoiseach, Seán Lemass, was Minister for Industry and Commerce and it was seen as the engine of the economy.  In Deputy John Bruton's time it was a Department that was productive of new ideas, yet in the past two years and the past two budgets there is not one identifiable concept, item, policy matter which has come out of that Department.  I was there for 12 months and I know the civil servants there are highly competent, but there must be some demoralising factor because they are not the productive Department they used to be.  I wonder if the public perception that in some way it is merely the Kildare Street office of the IDA is one of the factors which is demoralising the civil servants there.</P>
    <P>I believe policy should be centred in the Executive, monitored by this House and come through Government Departments. The proper locus for industrial policy in this country is in the Department of Industry and Commerce, in association with the Department of Tourism and Transport and the Department of Labour, and I would like to see it put back centre stage as the main motor of industrial policy.  It is difficult now to distinguish between an analysis of policy and marketing programmes, and any country that confuses its marketing with its policy is in a difficult situation.</P>
    <P>I thought NESC were rather nice about it, but industrial policy has not been successful in delivering the kind of living standards we thought would be delivered when we entered the Community, and I do not believe the suggestions in the Taoiseach's speech that we are now nicely positioned to be the new home for the Japanese attack on Fortress Europe are realistic either.  Certainly we will get some of the shakeout, some of the spinoff, but until we have an Irish industrial sector, an indigenous sector soundly based on our own products, our own competence and our own educated young people, where we have our own research and development and our own commitment, where decisions in the board <Col N="372" /> room are made with national considerations on the table as well as considerations of profit and the best location for promoting industry into Europe, we will still be in difficulty.</P>
    <P>I would like to move to the area of the Structural Funds.  The whole handling of the Structural Funds by the last Government was inadequate, arrogant and unsuccessful.  I think that is known to the Government, who certainly were signalled long enough and often enough by those who know in Brussels, and I think the Government would have got more funding had they had a different approach.  I know there is some extra money from the discretionary part of the Structural Funds which the Government will still get, maybe as much as £150 million, but there will still be a shortfall of almost £700 million.  Since some of the matching funds were not provided out of the capital budget here but were supposed to come from private industry, in exactly the same way as the matching funds in the capital budget trigger extra funds from Europe, extra funds from Europe trigger matching funds from the private sector here.  Therefore, I believe the loss in capital investment on the 70-30 per cent breakdown is £1 billion, and £1 billion is a big chunk of investment activity to be taken out of any programme. It is about a fifth of the whole programme.  As I called on the Minister for Finance today, I would like to repeat in the presence of the Taoiseach that the Government have to say very quickly what is being taken out of the programme.</P>
    <P>That would not be my main criticism of the Government's approach to the Structural Funds.  My criticism is simple enough.  I think the programme is focused on a series of projects, and the problem with the project-led approach to infrastructural development is that there may not be an economic return on the individual products at all.  You can run dual carriageways up the side of a mountain and down again and you can put down sewerage schemes, rural electrification and water schemes and they may have a marginal effect for the better, I hope, on <Col N="373" /> the quality of life of those who live in an area but also they would obviously have a kind of Keynesian effect at the time when these projects were in construction. If £100 million is spent putting down a bridge, a road or whatever in a region people are employed while the construction is going on, there is a great deal of sub-supply going on and there is activity, but when the JCBs go away and the Minister cuts the tape, the road is open, the cars flow through and there is not necessarily any lasting benefit.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> There is in some and not in others.  Let the Taoiseach not smile and shake his head. I will develop my point and I think he will agree with me.  The approach to the plan should have been a very simple question, by integrating a series of investment projects.  What disadvantages which at present exist in the Irish economy or in the economy of a region will be permanently removed?  That is the only worthwhile test.  What structural defects can be permanently removed?</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Fair enough, and certainly there is a great deal in the roads programme which is worthy. I am not suggesting the Government and their advisers are so inane that everything they suggest in the structural programme or in the spending is wrong.  Of course there will be a whole series of meritorious projects constructed right around the country, but my fundamental criticism is the same.  There was no attempt to analyse what the integration of projects would do for the economy of this country or of any region.  That is where the flaw is in the approach rather than the fact that you have £700 million less than you applied for and whether that was a negotiating strategy.  That is my major criticism and I would like to return to it when I have more time because I think it is very serious criticism indeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="374" /> If we are to talk about the roads, there are a couple of interesting remarks here. The development of a modern infrastructure, a roads infrastructure, is not necessarily beneficial if other structural defects remain, because roads run both ways.  If the multinationals with the economies of scale in Europe in footwear, clothing, or food regard all of Ireland simply as a distributive province &mdash; that is the way they look at it &mdash; there will be no Border.  They will have a manager for Ireland for X brand beer and in they will come and sell it.  Of course they need a good roads infrastructure because when they wheel the articulated vehicles off the boats if they have not an adequate road structure in this country they will not be able to deliver to the shops.  If we develop an economy which is uncompetitive and at the same time put in a very good roads structures we are facilitating the attack on the domestic consumer market by those who are highly competitive in the UK and in Europe.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach is shaking his head and his Minister of State is shaking his head and looking up at the ceiling.  This is not just Deputy Michael Noonan speaking. If the Taoiseach read the report &mdash; I am not saying he did not &mdash; and had the time to study it he would see they deal with that issue here and they say that is a major danger, that we put the structure together which allows the European competition to come in and destroy the Irish jobs, the Irish distribution business and the whole supply business in Ireland in the normal consumer market to the shops and supermarkets.  It is worth looking at. The Taoiseach did not believe it when Deputy John Bruton said it six months ago.  Maybe he will believe it when he appreciates it is from the report of NESC when they were set up at his request with his own terms of reference.</P>
    <P>There is a section which is also worth reading for the Minister for Tourism and Transport if he has time ever to read what is in the report and absent himself from photocalls in various parts of the country and get down to the real work of transport policy.  There is a very interesting section here on transport policy &mdash; on his old <Col N="375" /> ground again &mdash; which I have gone over several times with the Minister for Finance and before him with former Minister Mr. MacSharry.

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I would like in that time to deal, very inadequately though it must be, with a significant departure in the Taoiseach's speech and that is in the area of European monetary union.  The Taoiseach could have said much more but, of course, he might frighten his Deputies. It is very hard to keep calm Deputies who are used to a series of policy turns; you tell them now that you are going to seriously diminish the sovereignty of this State and transfer it to European institutions, not only is the Taoiseach suggesting that he would agree to a European central bank in Frankfurt, modelled on the Bundestag, but he is also saying that before he would agree to EMU, he would need budgetary mechanisms to compensate for any weaknesses in the economies of members of the federation, if I remember his phrase correctly. That is very interesting coming from a Taoiseach who opposed the Single European Act in this House.  That must rank with one of the great leaps forward of all time.  The Taoiseach delivered it in a most hesitant fashion but it worked.  I suppose we will see very quickly whether it is economic spoof or whether there is a reality behind it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first thing we have to do in this country to ready us for economic monetary union is to make sure we have a rigorous macro-economic policy at home.  I think we are tied now to the Deutsche Mark for the duration.  The Germans are importing inflation.  It is not engendered at home and as we all know inflation in West Germany is the greatest sin.  When they had to carry shoe boxes full of DeutschMarks around in the thirties to buy a packet of cigarettes they <Col N="376" /> learned of the dangers of inflation.  Ever since inflation which we would regard as acceptable is considered catastrophic in West Germany.  Their present inflationery trends are imported.  They are trying to deal with that by increasing interest rates.  They have done so three times in the last 12 months and we have had no choice but to follow.  They increased them three times and everybody followed, including those who could not afford to follow &mdash; the French and the British.  The Germans are getting tired of raising interest rates as a mechanism for controlling inflation.  Some of our innocent commentators in the newspapers here have only looked at the first half of the sentence and said there will be no more increase in German interest rates. If there are no more increases in German interest rates, as sure as day follows night there will be a realignment of the DeutschMark within the EMS, because what they cannot achieve by the interest rate mechanism they are going to achieve by a re-evaluation or a re-alignment or whatever we like to call it.  I believe we will have no choice but to stick with it. The implications of that will be, by mid summer or early autumn, the Irish pound being on a par with sterling.  I remember when the exchange rate&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> It is a very short recollection.  The exchange rate with sterling is over 90p again.  I remember when it reached the high nineties during the last devaluation.  It was a classically well organised devaluation by Deputy John Bruton and by the Taoiseach's Government when they came into office because it kept inflation down by having a moderate wage agreement and it kept a very rigorous fiscal control.  You will see the indigenous section of Irish industry up in arms by the middle of next year calling on the Government to bring down the exchange rate with sterling.  I would say to the Taoiseach that he should ignore the calls if he is getting ready for <Col N="377" /> the hard road he has outlined in the section of his speech which deals with EMU. The first test is to stick with the Mark when the Germans realign sometime in the spring or summer of 1990.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party I would like to extend our appreciation to NESC, the council of the secretariat, for this very detailed, extensive, analytical report they have presented to us for examination as to the likely impact on the integration that will take place in 1992 and the sort of things that need to be done.  They have put a great deal of work into that and it behoves us all to examine it critically, see what the recommendations are and each of us, in our own way, try to ensure that a maximum effort is made in the very critical times that face us.</P>
      <P>The NESC report that we are debating here today was published on 13 September last, almost six weeks ago.  It attracted relatively little public attention at the time, largely because the Dáil was in recess and the opportunity to debate this important report was denied to us. The lapse of time between publication of the report and this debate throws into very sharp relief the obsolete and outmoded practice of allowing the Dáil to adjourn for such long periods.</P>
      <P>On the day the report was published the Labour Party issued the following statement:</P>
      <P>The NESC report published today confirms essentially what the Labour Party has been saying for sometime. The Fianna Fáil Government in office up to recently was monumentally incompetent in its preparations for, and presentation of, Ireland's case in regard to structural funds and future economic development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely now that so authoritative a body as the NESC has essentially found that even a doubling of the structural funds may not be adequate to help us prepare for 1992, the Government will finally admit that their approach was all wrong in the first place.  The type and balance of projects submitted, the <Col N="378" /> lack of any community involvement or participation, and the enormous reliance on the private sector to achieve extremely ambitious targets &mdash; all of these gross miscalculations doomed the <i>National Development Plan</i> to failure from the start.  We know now that we will not qualify for a doubling of the funds, and that most, if not all, of the targets set out in the Plan will not be met.  Even if they were met, they would not be enough.</P>
    <P>It is still not too late for the Government to insist that the peripheral regions of the EC must get their fair share of economic growth and development arising from the Single European Market.  In this aspiration we share common cause with Spain, Portugal, Greece, and large parts of the United Kingdom.  As recently as a couple of weeks ago, the Labour Party began a process of working on this common cause with Neil Kinnock, the leader of the British Labour Party.  We know that there is a great deal to be gained through solidarity with the Governments and other political Parties of other countries on the margins of Europe.  It is a further mark of the failure of the Fianna Fáil approach that they have failed to make the slightest effort to develop this solidarity of common interests.</P>
    <P>In order to amplify on that statement it is necessary that we remind ourselves again of some of the main analytical conclusions in the report.  I summarise them below in the same order in which they appear in the report.  First, in the period since we joined the Community our economic performance has compared very unfavourably with that of other member countries.  One figure stands out in this regard.  Between 1973 and 1985 the increase in unemployment in Ireland was the second highest in the Community and Ireland now has the second highest rate of unemployment in Europe.  Our failure in this area has been compounded by the fact that in the same period we built up a huge burden of foreign debt. Our standard of living has grown less than <Col N="379" /> in the other EC countries and all this combines with a serious build-up of the public debt liabilities and responsibilities that are left for future generations.</P>
    <P>Secondly, part of the reason for our failure to perform on the jobs front was our failure to plan adequately.  The report makes the point that even though the Irish people as a whole were committed to European membership there was very little understanding of the things we would need to do if we were to compete effectively.  That was one of the reasons so much of our manufacturing industry base, already small at the time we joined the EC, disappeared altogether.</P>
    <P>The report in one of its central conclusions argues that in the longer term the benefits arising from the completion of the internal market are likely to be unevenly distributed.  The greater benefits are likely to go to those regions where industry is already efficient and highly competitive.  To put it another way, there is every possibility that the internal market will mean many apples being thrown into many already well stocked orchards.  This point was made again and again by those of us who have always been sceptical of the benefits of 1992.  It flies directly in the face of the Cecchini report, which found that smaller member states will gain the most from completion of the internal market.  That report is described by NESC as based on an inaccurate and incomplete account of the theories of international trade and integration, a polite way of expressing very little faith in the Cecchini report.</P>
    <P>Because of the central conclusion that the internal market by itself will not lead to evenly spread prosperity across the Community, the report's analysis of the likely impact of the doubling of the Structural Funds is of crucial importance.  That analysis is based on three salient facts leading to one inescapable conclusion. Those facts and that conclusion are well worth quoting here: (1) even doubled, the Structural Funds will still represent less than one half of 1 per cent of Community GDP; (2) in the past Structural <Col N="380" /> Funds have failed to achieve a narrowing of the disparity between regional incomes and (3) the recent reform of the Structural Funds is certainly likely to increase their effectiveness but does not mark a dramatic increase in their concentration on the most disadvantaged regions.  Therefore, it seems necessary to conclude that the Structural Funds as currently constituted will not be sufficient to create convergence, let alone establish equality in regional economic structures and incomes.</P>
    <P>Arising from all this, NESC go on to set out what they describe as their most fundamental conclusion, namely, that neither member states nor the Community will be able to meet the challenges if they view the current level of integration and the existing set of Community policies and arrangements as the limit of what is available to deal with problems.  It is difficult for anyone to disagree with this analysis.</P>
    <P>There are many recommendations in the report with which I agree but there are others with which I take issue.  The sections in the report which urge economic and monetary union &mdash; EMU &mdash; go too far because they largely ignore the counterbalancing social consequences that would flow from the economic adjustments required.  However, the report is a valuable document which sets forward its views honestly and which should enable and encourage a higher level of informed debate on this whole vital area.</P>
    <P>Particularly in the area of the Structural Funds it is clear that we have been badly let down by the Government representing us in the negotiations over these funds in the past couple of years.  As we said on 13 September last, the gross miscalculations of the type and balance of projects submitted, the lack of any Community involvement or participation and the enormous reliance on the private sector to achieve extremely ambitious targets doomed the national plan to failure from the start.  We now know that we will not qualify for a doubling of the funds and that most &mdash; if not all &mdash; the targets set out in that plan will not be met.  Even <Col N="381" /> if they were met they would not be enough.</P>
    <P>The real value of the NESC report lies in the fact that NESC are both an authoritative and representative body. Many people have argued over the years that the process of economic integration in Europe was one that required a great deal of public debate, preparation and planning.  Those arguments have in the main fallen on deaf ears as various sectional interest groups joined the headlong rush to secure whatever transitory benefit might flow from aspects of our European membership, the Common Agricultural Policy being a prime example.  Now, for the first time, a body &mdash; representative of workers, employers, farmers and the Government &mdash; is saying essentially the same thing.  It must be hoped that the call of NESC for debate and planning will not also fall on deaf ears.  Tragically, the signs are that already the report of NESC will be allowed to gather dust on ministerial shelves in much the same way as a great many other reports in the past.  The first straw in the wind is the Government's refusal to allow any Community involvement in the preparation of the <i>National Development Plan</i>.  The narrow-minded and blinkered approach has extended to the refusal of the Government to take up the sum of £11 million or so of funds available for projects springing directly from the local community.  The reason for that refusal is simple &mdash; the Government are afraid that once people in their own community get a taste of real involvement in decision making and are in a position, through direct contacts with the European institutions, to benefit their own communities they will want more involvement.  Fianna Fáil in particular have always been afraid of any real decentralisation of power since it undermines the triumphalist philosophy on which the entire Fianna Fáil ethos is built.</P>
    <P>That decision, bad though it is, pales into insignificance beside Fianna Fail's indifference to planning in the overall sense.  An examination of the <i>National Development Plan</i>, set beside the needs outlined in the NESC report, illustrates this quite clearly.  We need to improve <Col N="382" /> our infrastructure and those of our amenities which will help our tourist industry to grow, but these measures alone will not help us to deal with the major issue of economy of scale from which our industry, particularly our manufacturing industry, will suffer in the context of 1992.  The NESC report is very specific on this point; 1992 will lead to a radical restructuring of industry throughout Europe with larger, lower cost, more efficient producers swallowing up their smaller competitors.  There are only two ways in which we can thrive within this process.  The first is by encouraging the growth of larger, more efficient, indigenous industries, and the second way in which we can survive in an integrated Europe is by going for excellence in our products, innovation in our ideas and an absolute reliability in our delivery of products to the marketplace.  Our record in this area gives little reason to be confident.</P>
    <P>Our industrial policy for the last 20 years and more has been aimed virtually exclusively at attracting foreign multinational industry, precisely the type of industry which will be encouraged to gravitate toward the centre as the internal market nears completion and thereafter. Lip service has been paid to the need to build indigenous industry but the practice has seldom matched the sermon.  The building of indigenous industry requires new structures, methods and an entirely new attitude.  I will be returning to that attitude in a moment.  Given the history and our experiences of industry here in the past, I find it remarkable that we continue merrily to go down that same road.  There is no looking back, no assessment of the position into which reliance on multinational corporations has brought us.</P>
    <P>There are very grave dangers for us in the context of 1992.  I know we have to bolster ourselves and prepare or gear up but, quite frankly, based on the lack of planning, lack of policy shown in the course of the Taoiseach's remarks, shown in the lack of activity of Fianna Fáil Governments and this present Coalition Government, I am very pessimistic as to <Col N="383" /> what will be the outcome of industry here in the approach to 1992 and thereafter. We have committed ourselves almost exclusively to reliance on the Japanese, the Americans, the Germans, heavily into the area of electronics, computers and so on.  The Taoiseach had this to say in the course of his remarks:</P>
    <P>An important strategy towards this end is the national linkage programme operated by the IDA which is developing a core of top class Irish supply companies to the global multinational corporations based in Ireland....</P>
    <P>Is that what we are about?  Is it to be our role that we provide service companies to service the industry that the multinationals will come in here and set up? Is that to be our ultimate aim?  Is that to be our ultimate achievement in this country &mdash; to service companies to service the multinationals?  Do we not realise, can we not see, that the very mobility of those multinational companies, as appears from their very names, is such that they cannot be relied on to remain here after 1992?  These companies have many plants here, in Britain, Germany, Italy, in every country of the EC, and they can pick and choose; they can move here or move there at the drop of a hat.  They cannot be relied on in any way to give continuing worthwhile employment here.  Have not we seen that all too often in the past?  They have no commitment to this country.  Indeed, they have no commitment to any country, not even those in which they are based.  Rather it is commitment to their profits and they move where it suits them to do so.</P>
    <P>That is why the much-vaunted Telesis report, to which lip service is always paid, tried to engineer a change of direction there so that at least we would have indigenous companies which, if nothing else, would have a commitment to the country and its workers.  Where is the policy directive of this Government? Where is the policy directive in the Taoiseach's speech to try to aim us in that direction, to endeavour to say, here are our plans, our policies which will lead <Col N="384" /> us toward that end?  There is already a complete abandonment of any kind of responsibility in that direction.</P>
    <P>Within the last couple of years our industrial policy has been marked by three perceptible shifts in practice.  The overall effect of those shifts has been to render the policy even less useful in terms of the future.  The first shift led to a major concentration in the effort to attract those foreign companies in the financial services sector here.  The Taoiseach made much of that in the course of his remarks. I do not wish to enter into the merits or otherwise of the approach being followed in this debate.  However, the question will have to be posed: at a time when all the barriers to the utmost freedom of capital and money are being broken down, how long do our policymakers think a foreign financial services industry will last here, that is assuming it gets off the ground in the first place?  What steps are being taken to ensure that our native financial sector, for instance, building societies, will cope with that level of competition?</P>
    <P>The second shift in emphasis has affected the future prospects of some of our largest native wealth creating companies. I am talking here about public sector companies which have done so much over the years to contribute to the building of our economic base and the wealth of our country.  The shift in emphasis we have seen is best described as the creeping into being of a perceptible and growing bias against the public sector.  That bias has already ensured, in several instances, that those companies most affected will be less able to withstand the pressures of 1992, to go on to develop and provide the employment and resources we so badly need.</P>
    <P>I will give just one instance of what I mean.  The new air transport policy announced by the Government recently amounted to a cold-blooded attack on Aer Lingus, the national airline.  It is impossible to see that policy as any more than a thinly disguised effort to ensure that Aer Lingus are hampered in their <Col N="385" /> effort to successfully trade in an atmosphere of deregulation and growing competition. The rules of the game were altered overnight to suit other airlines at the expense of Aer Lingus.  Under this new policy Aer Lingus will lose several important routes, one of considerable strategic importance to the company, the Stanstead one.  The irony of the decision, or the importance of Stanstead, lies in the efforts of Aer Lingus to plan for the future.  Stanstead is not such a loss now but Stanstead is all about 1992.</P>
    <P>Our national airline has successfully traded its way out of enormous financial difficulties.  Staff have adopted new work practices.  The airline has become a great deal more efficient, standards have risen and fares have dropped.  Faced with new competition, Aer Lingus have responded magnificently and professionally.  Now the company is engaged in a major, expensive programme of fleet replacement in order to ensure that it remains an attractive and profitable State company into the future.  In the middle of that they are faced with this shattering blow which would be the equivalent of telling RTE that they could broadcast only at certain hours of the day in order to facilitate the emergence of commercial radio, or of telling CIE that they cannot run buses at peak hours to give private bus operators an even break.  That is not a policy aimed at strengthening the industry.  Its sole purpose is to facilitate the private part of the industry at the expense of the public part. The effect of what the Minister announced on this issue is to introduce a hidden subsidy from the people of this country for private air transport.  The announcement flies in the face of proper and fair competition.  I find it impossible to believe it is legal in the context of European laws on the subject.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand how the Leader of the Progressive Democrats, who argued so effectively for open competition in this area some years ago, can stand over the scandalous secret subsidy.  Of course, on this occasion the subsidy is being given to the private sector.  Perhaps that is the reason the advocates of fair competition will be silent on this occasion. <Col N="386" /> The fate of Aer Lingus at the hands of this Government is but one example of how an anti-public sector bias is distorting our ability to plan and prepare for 1992. The public sector commercial companies in Ireland are among the very few companies capable of meeting the challenge of the internal market, but they must be helped and not hindered.</P>
    <P>Earlier, I referred to three recent shifts in our industrial policy that have rendered that policy less than useful in so far as it was ever useful in our preparations for 1992.  The first two shifts related to the growing reliance on the multinational financial services sector and the anti-public services bias.  The third and perhaps most important relates to the &ldquo;hands off&rdquo;, <i>laissez faire</i> approach of the last few years.  NESC make it clear, as Telesis made it clear, that the development of strong indigenous industry is of fundamental importance and that this cannot happen without a strong interventionist Government approach.  Where is that approach?  I can see already in the way that the national development plan was drawn up that this Government and their immediate predecesors place an almost total reliance on the private sector, a private sector which never succeeded in providing the employment, resources and living standards that the people required. We have gone through good times and bad times but never have the private sector come any way towards meeting the requirements of ordinary working people.</P>
    <P>This Government pin their support on that ethos which has dominated policy-making in the last few years, this idea that all that private industry needs to grow is the right climate.  They say that when the climate is right the private sector will return to its divinely appointed task of wealth creation and that it will ensure that wealth is retained in Ireland and invested in risk-taking product manufacturing industry and that it is effectively and equitably distributed, leading to the creation of thousands of viable, sustainable, good jobs which we need.  This policy is built on the assumption that the private sector is in reality a good fairy <Col N="387" /> just waiting for the rain to stop so that she can wave her magic wand over our social and economic problems.  I cannot come to grips with the mentality behind the policy approach which is informed by such a monumental delusion.  Even when it is obvious to everyone that intervention is essential, this Government and their immediate predecessors cannot seem to grasp the point.</P>
    <P>NESC make it clear that Ireland cannot be indifferent to foreign take-overs of indigenous business.  To put it less bluntly, we have to be aware at all times that some of our enterprises will be taken over simply in order to be closed down.  In that context the apparent indifference of the Irish Government during the take-over of Irish Distillers, for example, is quite staggering, but perhaps that is all that is to be expected from a Government willing to sell Irish Steel to the Germans, Irish Sugar to the French and Irish Life to the Arabs as long as the price is right.</P>
    <P>There are many issues arising in the context of 1992 other than just the issues surrounding industrial policy.  If I have concentrated on industrial policy it is because we cannot just survive, we can thrive in a vastly more competitive Europe, but we cannot do it without the leadership that a radical industrial policy change can give.  The industrial policy we are following now is a recipe for inertia, and that will lead us to disaster.</P>
    <P>The NESC report points out &mdash; and it is important &mdash; that clear Irish policy aims and methods are essential.  Those policy aims must be written down, circulated and debated.  The notion runs through this Government that by some mystical system or method, because we are a member of the Community, Irish aims and methods are not required.  That is not so.  If that is the road we go down we are in for a potentially disastrous situation in 1992.</P>
    <P>In the run up to 1992 we have to face the dilemma of what NESC politely calls &ldquo;tax approximation&rdquo;.  For the purposes of this discussion we must recognise that the issue of whether or not there should <Col N="388" /> be VAT on food is, in essence, a social issue.  We know to an extent that no one can seriously deny the scale and the reality of poverty in this country.  We know that here in Ireland the problem of undernourishment in children is a growing crisis.  In that context it must seem to many to be absolutely ludicrous that we should be even discussing the possibility of increasing the price of many basic and essential items of food by perhaps as much as 15 per cent.</P>
    <P>It is ludicrous.  The imposition of VAT on food without very considerable compensation for those on low incomes would be a scandal of the highest proportions. The end result would be that the poorest mothers of the largest families would end up carrying the price of the Single European Act, and that can never be allowed. But neither can we tolerate the loss of £500 to £600 million in revenue that will inevitably result from the reduction of higher rates of VAT, without a spreading of the VAT base.  From bitter experience we know that such a loss of revenue would be recouped from our health and education services.  It is extremely unlikely, given the present complexion of forces in this House, that the owners of property and wealth will be asked to make up this shortfall.  In that context I want to use the opportunity of this debate to put down a marker on behalf of the Labour Party.  NESC make the case that Europe should be asked to make up the shortfall in revenue &mdash; perhaps by taking a hand in the financing of our health or education budgets.  Whoever makes up the shortfall, I want to say on behalf of the Labour Party that it will not be the poor.</P>
    <P>For too long already the poor of our country have been asked to carry the burden of our necessary adjustments.  It is they who have suffered most from cutbacks in health, they who have to pay the iniquitous health charges and queue for deteriorating access to services; it is the poor who have suffered from all the cutbacks introduced by stealth to our social welfare system; it is the poor who are increasingly denied equal access to <Col N="389" /> education; it is the poor who have suffered from the virtual elimination of the public housing programme.  They cannot now be asked to carry the additional and unjust burden we desire to adjust VAT rates.</P>
    <P>I want to register the alarm felt on our side of the House at the remarks passed by the Taoiseach in the context of his discussions with President Mitterand, in so far as those discussions referred to the social charter.  The Taoiseach was reported as expressing the reservation, if I may paraphrase him, that even though the social charter was all very well in principle, it could not be allowed to interfere with the essential task of job creation.  This is a classical right-wing response.  The logic of certain sections of the business community and of a large section of the ideological right is that deregulation creates jobs.  They point to America, where employment creation has been very considerable in the past few years, and they point out that deregulation was the key.  They tend not to elaborate on what deregulation means in this context.  It means no holiday entitlements until workers are in their third year of full-time employment, the right of employers to hire and fire at will, the absence of any sick pay or pension entitlements, a blank rejection of union representation and the loss of a host of other rights that workers in Europe take for granted.  It is clear from any examination of deregulated employment that there is a balance to be struck between quantity of employment and quality.</P>
    <P>For my part, I want to use this opportunity to emphasise the importance of the European Social Charter.  It must be the cornerstone of all plans to remove barners between now and 1992.  The Community we want to build must not be a Community of disparities but a socially cohesive one, and the social charter is as integral and vital an ingredient as any other.  The social charter demands the right to fair wages and hours of work, the right to information, consultation and participation of workers in plans concerning the future of their companies.  A Europe which aims to be cohesive must <Col N="390" /> see its workers and its unemployed as Europeans too &mdash; every bit as much as the financial speculators and the wealthy businessmen.</P>
    <P>The irony of the Irish Government's uneasy position in relation to the social charter is that that charter, if implemented in full, would only enable us to catch up to conditions in a number of other countries &mdash; countries like Sweden, Denmark, West Germany and Belgium. In all of these countries, many, if not all, of the elements of the social charter are already well established.  These countries have something else in common as well. They all have levels of unemployment a lot lower than ours and standards of living considerably higher.  It is hard to argue from that kind of comparison that a recognition of workers' rights is incompatible with high employment.</P>
    <P>There is one passage in the NESC report that struck me forcibly.  To those of us who have watched in anger as this Government have botched our preparations for 1992, it is hard to read the following passage from the report without feeling that NESC were trying to drop a hint:</P>
    <P>... the objective of regional convergence, like other objectives, to be accepted as a Community priority, must be advocated by argument of the highest quality and in the widest possible forum.  Ireland, both its Government and its people, must play a leading role in this debate.</P>
    <P>I would interpret NESC as saying in that passage that our Government have yet to get their act together in arguing Ireland's case.  It is not too late for proper planning, consultation, and leadership, but it will be too late soon.  The matter is urgent.</P>
    <P>NESC point out that ground lost now by businesses in preparation for 1992 cannot be made up later.  There is no idea that we can say we still have time, it is still only 1989 and we will do it later. Every month that goes by is time lost that we will not be able to make up.  As has been pointed out, uncertainty is a problem at present &mdash; uncertainty in regard <Col N="391" /> to what 1992 holds in store and also uncertainty in regard to the intentions of Government.  That is my major criticism. This Government have left industry, the public sector, the private sector, workers, all of us, in a complete state of uncertainty as to their intentions, and NESC confirm that.</P>
    <P>NESC acknowledge that the Government are constrained because some issues are not yet clarified at Community level.  That is understandable and fair enough, but NESC go on to say that there are many areas where the broad lines of Community policy are clear and where the Government here could thus set out their own position but that they have signally failed to do.  NESC state at page 545 that in order to reduce uncertainty the Council recommends that the Government should review and publish their intentions in regard to these issues. I had thought and hoped that the Taoiseach would come in here today with a long speech and perhaps would give some indication what these intentions are, but that was not to be.  There is no indication of that.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, it is essential that each party in the House should work with our sister parties in Europe to ensure that the country's needs in 1992 will be spoken for and advocated.  We in the Labour Party, jointly with the Socialist parties in Europe, have done just that and have produced a package for 1992.  Some of the items in that package are as follows. They would provide for a selective employment policy for disadvantaged regions with full local participation; they would provide emphasis on the job creation aspects of the structural funds, an active policy of environmental protection, a commitment to combat poverty, a charter of social rights for all workers covering health, safety, consultation and so on, and full worker participation in all aspects of policy development and change.</P>
    <P>There is an important aspect we must look to and that concerns the infringements on even existing Community rules that many of the States in the EC are <Col N="392" /> guilty of.  It is clear from the NESC report and from other reports that even existing rules of the EC for free movement of goods and services in many cases are not being observed and there is a backlog of prosecutions and cases pending in the European Court to try to get those straightened out.  Is that going to be repeated after 1992?  There is no doubt that that kind of situation militates very seriously against Ireland, and that must be one of the serious matters of negotiation that the Government must take up at Community level.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann condemns the failure of the Government to provide an adequate dental service to medical card holders, with particular reference to the lack of provision of dental maintenance and dentures for adults and the extremely long waiting lists for orthodontic treatment; and calls on the Government to meet its obligations under the Health Act, 1970, to urgently provide a proper national dental service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is regrettable, given that a large part of the time of the last Dáil was taken up discussing health issues, that we resume once again discussing more health issues simple because no progress was made on most of those issues.  It is interesting to note that during the period since this Dáil last sat an extra £15 million has been spent on the health services but every penny of this went to the general <Col N="393" /> hospital programme and none to other areas such as the dental service.</P>
    <P>In my view, the public dental service has virtually collapsed.  There are 1.6 million people who are eligible under section 67 of the 1970 Health Act to free dental care.  The breakdown of that figure is as follows: medical card holders and their dependants, 966,000; pre-school children, 344,000; primary schoolchildren, 564,000 and adolescent dependants, 90,000.  If these people require dental treatment, dentures, fillings, or orthodontic treatment they have to seek treatment at their local dental clinic.  They are told quite bluntly &mdash; this varies from one part of the country to another and I will go into this very shortly &mdash; that there is only one service available, that is emergency treatment, relating to levels of pain, for extractions only.  In my own constituency, and this is mirrored across the eight health board areas, if an old age pensioner wants dentures they are told &ldquo;I am sorry but you may go and get them privately fitted at a cost of up to £300.  If you need dentures repaired, this cannot be done as there is no money available&rdquo;. It is undeniably true that the pressures on the emergency service and the local dental clinic are such that they are providing a reduced service for children through primary schools.  People who are unable to afford private dental care have to suffer the pain and anguish of not being able to obtain treatment.</P>
    <P>If we look at each health board we will see what the position is.  This is a snapshot of what the position was in 1988; it is worse this year.  In the North Eastern Health Board area, the Minister's own health board, no adult service has been provided since 1985.  There is no priority for adolescents and a restricted service for children.  In the Mid-Western Health Board area no adult service has been provided since 1986, there is no priority for adolescents and only 40 per cent cover for children.  In the Eastern Health Board area, which has all the facilities of the Dublin Dental Hospital at hand, there is a very limited adult service, a waiting list of 16,000, no priority for adolescents and only 50 per cent cover for children.  In <Col N="394" /> the Midland Health Board area no adult service has been provided since 1987, there is no priority for adolescents and only 85 per cent cover for children.  In the Western Health Board area no adult service has been provided since 1985, there is no priority for adolescents and only 40 per cent cover for children.  In the North Western Health Board area no adult service has been provided since 1986, there is no priority for adolescents and 80 per cent cover for children.  In the South Eastern Health Board area, which covers my area and Deputy Howlin's, no adult service has been provided since 1986, there is no priority for adolescents and only 58 per cent cover for children in two areas.  In the Southern Health Board area no adult service has been provided since 1985, there is no priority for adolescents and an average of only 30 per cent cover for children throughout that region.</P>
    <P>Therefore, in practical terms, the dental service has collapsed for the people who depend on the public dental service, the poorest 40 per cent of our population who rely on their medical cards to ensure service.  As usual, the Minister decided there was a solution to these problems and that was to commission a report.  A report of a working party of the Department of Health &mdash; I have a copy in front of me &mdash; was never published&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but was ably leaked by all and sundry.  It has been regurgitated many times.  They reported in June 1988, which is now well over a year ago.  It was an excellent report.  That working party was chaired by the then Minister of State and comprised the chief dental officer, the deputy chief dental officer, representtatives of the dental hospitals and the dental section of the Department of Health.  They clearly stated that the Minister and the health boards were failing to meet their statutory obligations under section 67 of the 1970 Health Act. Despite this, nothing has been done to resolve the problem.  I will go into detail <Col N="395" /> on some of those excellent recommendations in a few moments but what point is there in commissioning reports if we are not going to take any action on them?</P>
      <P>The Minister commissioned another report from a working party on services for the elderly, who concluded in chapter 7, under the heading &ldquo;Care In The Community&rdquo;, of the report &ldquo;A Policy for the Elderly&rdquo; and I quote:</P>
      <P>In the interests of providing dentures to elderly people on low incomes the Dental Council should introduce a scheme to permit dental technicians to fit dentures.  Section 67 of the 1970 Health Act should be amended to allow health boards to make charges for up to half the cost of fitting and supplying dentures.  All elderly people should be entitled to an annual dental check-up free of charge.  Elderly people with medical cards should be offered treatment without charge for necessary dental care identified at the annual check up.</P>
      <P>Nothing whatsoever has been done about this.  If we go even further back and read the report of the Commission on Social Welfare, in particular the section on treatment benefits where the results of an analysis of the PRSI dental scheme are provided, one can see that it clearly concludes from a submission from the Department of Health on 22 August 1984 that the takeover by this Department of the administration of the social welfare treatment benefit scheme is part of the long-term policy of both Departments. Nothing has been done on this.  In their conclusion to the report, the commission state that since there appears to be acceptance in principle that treatment benefits should be administered by the Department of Health they recommend that the transfer of functions should be effected.  However nothing has been done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an appalling litany of neglect and inaction.  Waiting lists were so long that they were suspended.  It was futile putting one's name on a waiting list <Col N="396" /> because one had no hope of obtaining treatment.  There is still a waiting list for orthodontic treatment; at present there are 24,000 children awaiting such treatment. Because some of these will have to wait so long for treatment their eligibility will be lost.  In some cases the children concerned will have left post-primary school before they are called when they will no longer be eligible.  What will their options be then?  Because there are only 25 orthodontists in the country and because demand greatly exceeds supply, in manpower terms, we have to pay roughtly double the fees charged for the same treatment in Northern Ireland.  For major treatment families are asked to pay between £1,200 to £1,400.  Such charges are exorbitant and beyond their reach.</P>
    <P>What is even more depressing is that international experience shows that the one crucial investment in relation to dental care is in the area of prevention. As we have learned from the experience of the Scandinavian countries, if we have an effective programme of water flouridation, and where this does not exist a mouth rinsing programme, coupled with a proper programme of fissure sealants for the first and sixth classes of primary schools appropriately timed to catch the molars, we can almost ensure that dental decay is 100 per cent preventable.  For a very small investment of 37p per head on water fluoridation we can cut down on the need for treatment.  Yet we see that the health boards have huge debts and huge arrears in relation to water flouridation plants, that plants are being allowed decay and our coverage of water flouridation is decreasing instead of increasing with no capital provision being made.  There is not adequate staff to carry out mouth rinsing programmes in the 33 per cent of the population not covered by flouridation, such as in rural areas. There is no comprehensive programme for fissure sealants.  In fact, there is no movement worth talking about in relation to setting up a proper dental auxiliary of dental hygienists to carry out this work at low cost.  The latest information I have in relation to the dental council and the development of dental hygienists and <Col N="397" /> looking at the numbers that are going to come out is that the dental hygienists will be exclusively available for private practice.  That will mean there will be no prevention programme coming forward.</P>
    <P>I can conclude only that this Government have failed abysmally to meet their legal and statutory obligations under the Health Act.  Knowing the situation, they have failed to act, and that is an unacceptable situation.  There are remedies and we need to bring them forward now.</P>
    <P>The first thing we need to do is ensure that there is one national dental scheme. There is no good reason for having two schemes.  At present there is the inequity whereby the ratio of dentists to those who are eligible under the 1970 Health Act works out at one dentist for every 7,967 eligible persons.  When one takes into account that some people who are medical card holders are also eligible under the PRSI scheme that figure is revised down to 6,344; but the full 8,000 all have medical cards and have to depend on one public dentist.  In the PRSI scheme we have the iniquitous situation whereby there are 700 dentists providing dental treatment for 1.3 million people, some of whom are very well off &mdash; company directors and so on &mdash; giving a ratio of 1:2,000.  That means that the poor people of this country have a four times inferior service.</P>
    <P>The commission on social welfare brought clearly into focus the inequity of this situation.  In the interests of running an efficient sevice there is no reason the Department could not run one national dental service.  The PRSI fund should pay a credit of whatever the annual cost is to the Department of Health to administer that scheme and the officials of the Department of Social Welfare should be moved over.</P>
    <P>We will have to provide an extra £3 million or £4 million a year to ensure that in conjunction with one national scheme people can have access to private dental surgeons on a referral basis through their local clinics.  I am referring to the <i>ad hoc</i> scheme that was there from 1979 to the mid-eighties and which has been abandoned in all the health board areas. <Col N="398" /> Under that scheme one went along to one's local dental clinic who approved the need for the treatment, and one was referred on to the local dental surgeon of their choice, who was paid on a fee per time basis.  That scheme worked successfully and should be reintroduced. Under such a scheme the Minister could negotiate a much fairer scheme for the dentists, through the Irish Dental Association, and for the taxpayer by ensuring a single national fee, re-writing the eligibility circumstances and ensuring that people would have access to care.  That is the first step that needs to be taken.  It is clearly recommended by all who are directly concerned with this problem.  It would allow the resources needed for people to get treatment.</P>
    <P>The second thing we need to do to reduce dental costs is to introduce dental manpower changes.  We need to have an extensive coverage of dental hygienists who will carry out all of the work of fissure sealants, mouth rinsing programmes and so on.  Under the Fine Gael proposals for a revised national dental service the health board would have the exclusive responsibility for all preventative dental work and the referral work would be carried out by private dentists.</P>
    <P>The advantages of introducing auxiliaries are twofold.  First, less skilled work would be carried out at a cheaper rate and dental surgeons could get on with the more complex dental treatment.  Also in relation to auxiliaries, I would favour the upgrading of dental surgery assistants to assist dentists in less intricate work.  In relation to dental laboratory work, we can either upgrade the position of dental technician or introduce the new grade of denturist &mdash; I am not talking about allowing in any cowboy but something that would be effectively operated by the medical council whereby there would be a proper education and training programme to ensure that dentures were available at reasonable cost.  There are provisions under the Dental Act of 1985 for the Minister to take initiatives in all of these areas.  These areas have not been pushed as hard as they might have been. <Col N="399" /> We now move to the manpower situation in orthodontics.  The problem is that it is so lucrative to be in private practice that an orthodontic consultant would be out of his mind to be employed as an orthodontist in the public service.  It is no use for the Minister to throw his hands in the air and say that five posts were advertised that could not be filled.  It is obvious they could not be filled because the orthodontists are on to such a good thing with fee per item arrangements through the health boards and with the private fees they can charge that there is no incentive for them to work for the health board.  We need to change the grade from orthodontic consultant with seven years' post-graduate training to orthodontic specialist with four years' post graduate training who could do the basic amount of work.  We would employ some orthodontists who would train senior public health board dental personnel to do this work.  We must remember that orthodontics is not covered under the PRSI scheme so that very many in the country are crying out for an orthodontic service.</P>
    <P>The Minister has put forward a token amendment &mdash; and I will be as charitable as I can about it.  It makes a meal out of the fact that £300,000 is being allocated for 500 priority orthodontic cases.  Leaving aside the fact that the word on the grapevine is that these 500 cases seem to be taken in some kind of chronological order and not on the basis of priority &mdash; and there is some dissent about that &mdash; £300,000 for orthodontic services is a drop in the ocean, and it is a wrong drop in the ocean because, in my view, very basic dental treatment is not being provided for.  The Minister of State was at a recent conference in Wexford in relation to the public dentists who are members of the IDA who had a seminar.  I have to tell the Minister of State that they were very concerned to see that the total response to all these reports was a measly £300,000 for orthodontists when legal obligations were not being met for a basic adult service.  Someone somewhere has completely misunderstood the extent of <Col N="400" /> the problem.  I really cannot take that too seriously although I welcome it for what it is worth.</P>
    <P>It then goes on to say that it commends the resolve of the Minister for Health to concentrate further on improving the dental services generally in 1990.  I have seen very little evidence of this resolve. All I can say is I wish the Minister well in his resolve but I hope it extends to his colleagues in the Department of Finance, as they seem equally resolved to thwart any effort he has made to date in this area, because all efforts have come to nothing.</P>
    <P>It is important that we look at the dental career structures, introduce dental hygienists in the public health service, upgrade dental surgery assistants and introduce a new grade for dental laboratory work in the provision and repair of dentures by either upgrading the role of dental technicians or introducing a new grade of denturists, all of which would allow the backlog of work to be dealt with at lower costs.  Quite frankly, anything less will not meet the present basic requirements.</P>
    <P>I also note in relation to the publication of the health commission report that even before it was published the dental element was sabotaged by the Minister for Social Welfare, who went out of his way to say that the contents of the report <i>vis-à-vis</i> the PRSI dental benefit treatment scheme, were not on so far as he was concerned.  With regard to the Minister's resolve to try to sort out these problems, the first thing he might do is talk to the Minister for Social Welfare and ask him to show some common sense and reason in his discussions with the Irish Dental Association and furthermore to come to his senses and realise that one comprehensive national scheme is the only solution to the problem.</P>
    <P>Essentially we have no strategic plan for our dental services.  We had the <i>ad hoc</i> scheme and the cutbacks in the allocations by the health boards.  Some of those health boards decided that the dental service was not a statutory service and that relative to other needs, such as <Col N="401" /> the general and special hospital programmes, they could afford to abandon dental care.  I believe that decision was not based on sound legal judgment but the people we are dealing with are so poor they are not in a position to go to the High Court to fight for their theoretical rights under the 1970 Health Act.  That is the way this problem has evolved and quite frankly it has got worse.  All of us in this House have people coming to us saying they have to go to hospital in three weeks' time to have a number of teeth extracted.  They ask if they can get dentures and are horrified to hear they cannot.</P>
    <P>With regard to the children's service in schools, there is a new recommendation that there be one check-up for children to be co-ordinated in primary schools.  I believe that recommendation in the health commission report can be tied in very effectively with the other recommendation so that hygienists can carry out the work of fissure sealants.  Effectively this is new technology we are talking about &mdash; painting a plastic gel on children's back teeth to ensure that they do not get caveties.  Why is it that we cannot make a small investment in this new technology and fluoridation which would ensure that large, longer term saving can be made?  I understand that in the Scandinavian countries dental hospitals which train dental surgeons are being closed down simply because there is no requirement for them any more.  As a result of an adequate prevention programme dental and tooth decay is a thing of the past there.</P>
    <P>I should like to see the following: a reorganisation of our dental services so that they would all be under the Department of Health; what is being done by the Department of Social Welfare to be continued but administered by the Department of Health, and paid for by the PRSI credit fund as is the case already; the health boards given an exclusive role for prevention work and the 246 dentists to get on with that work; the appointment of new hygienists who can do some emergency work; the introduction of a referral scheme so that public <Col N="402" /> patients can go to their local dental clinic and be referred, as was the case under the <i>ad hoc</i> scheme, to get that work done; orthodontic services to be reorganised and public provision made through the health boards where there would be a national orthodontic service.  There will always be waiting lists for orthodontic treatment and I am advised that some elements of orthodontic treatment is perhaps cosmetic and is not as urgent as other dental work.  Maybe out of the 24,000 cases there are 10,000 very urgent cases but at present the urgent cases are not being seen at all.  Once there is a new grade of specialist &mdash; I understand that is totally in conformity with the 1992 position &mdash; we will be able to attract back on reasonable terms specialists for that programme.  We should be able to put in place a proper capital programme for fluoridation work and auxillaries for a very small amount of money.  Out of a total State health expenditure of something in the order of £1,300 million, I am talking about £3 million or £4 million, which could be saved on drugs in a week. It is a very simple equation.  We could introduce modest charges for orthodontic treatment.</P>
    <P>What we have had from this Government and the previous Government is a litany of neglect and failure.  Unless there is a radical departure, this problem will fester and worsen and the next generation will have as many dental problems as the present adult population because preventative work was not done.  This situation is worsening.  I hope this motion will bring a new focus to this area and that the Government provide adequate money in the Estimates next week.  We will be putting this motion to a vote tomorrow night and will be asking for the support of other parties for this reasonable motion.  I hope the House reaches a consensus that this is an area which cannot be neglected any longer.</P>

      <P>I commend my colleague Deputy Yates on his very comprehensive contribution.  I believe he has covered the major areas of need in this prevailing crisis in health care.  I shall not go into the same detail in my contribution, but I support his approach and the things he said.</P>
      <P>As part of this Dáil's aim to deal with the crisis in the health service, I hope serious consideration will be given to providing adequate and fair dental programmes for all who need them.  We have to see dental care as an intrinsic part of the total health care for all our people.  It seems that for years successive Governments have had struggles with the dental profession &mdash; sometimes disagreements and rows broke out in public, but not always, and the relationship was perpetually on the brink of collapse.  It seems that representatives on each side have done little more than snarl at each other over the years.  I was particularly aware of the bad relationship some years ago during efforts to bring in that category of spouses, the wives of insured workers, who had sought for so long to be brought in under the social welfare scheme.  None of this conflict is conducive to the operation of a satisfactory service.  Of course, the victims of this disagreement are those who can least well help themselves &mdash; those who have entitlements under the 1970 Health Act, people who are medical card holders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a great deal wrong with our dental service and I believe the main fault is that it is unavailable for thousands throughout the country.  Dental care is a very basic need and I hoped it would have gone beyond the status it had 30 years ago.  When I was a child dental care was seen as a luxury, it was something the rich availed of.  Poor people never went to the dentist and consequently huge <Col N="404" /> numbers of our population, those over 50, lost all or most of their teeth because of a lack of care and treatment.  Even though the fluoridation scheme has significantly reduced decay, if preventive measures in dental care are not put in place now, further generations will be condemned to using dentures at too early an age and will suffer great pain because of neglect and inadequate local service.</P>
    <P>The waiting lists are appalling and unacceptable.  Again and again during the recent general election, most of us heard at first hand details of the problems people are having with the health service but the main problems I heard about dealt with dental care &mdash; parents felt frustrated trying to get dental care for their children.  In my constituency two mothers brought their children out to the door to meet me.  One was 13 years of age and the other 15 years and they are waiting for orthodontic treatment.  They have been on a waiting list for two years and one was 550th and the other something like 420th on the waiting list.  It is absolutely horrendous to think of the time it will take for these two young boys to get treatment.  Neither of these young people needed this care for cosmetic or trendy reasons &mdash; I believe it is often alleged that that is what orthodontic treatment is all about.  These young people need treatment for the proper spacing of their teeth and they are suffering psychologically because they look so disfigured.  I and the mothers I spoke to have little hope of early treatment for these boys and they certainly will not be able to afford the kind of fees being charged privately.  I recently was at the dentist and was charged £100 for one filling.  It took about 45 minutes and it was an expert job, beautifully done but I question how anybody can justify charging £100 for a filling. On the basis of an eight-hour day one can earn £800 or £4,000 for a five-day week.  Can we ever hope to have a scale of fees which would give some idea of what it would be reasonable to pay for different types of dental care?</P>
    <P>We must question why we have such a dearth of dentists to deal with this crisis. <Col N="405" /> Why can we not give jobs to our graduates? Are we simply educating them to supply the National Health Service in the United Kingdom?  When I inquired I was told that there are about 70 dental graduates per year, of whom 80 per cent go in the first instance to Britain where they are absorbed into the system under which everyone is entitled to dental care.  Most are lost forever to this country but a few come back, usually the female dental graduates.  How can we allow this to happen?  They go because they cannot afford the £30,000 or £40,000 it would cost for the equipment to set up in private practice.  The State scheme is not able to embrace them.</P>
    <P>A great deal is wrong and we must look seriously at the lack of availability of dental services throughout the country. The Minister's backbenchers will tell him of the appalling conditions in some health board areas.  I support the appeal by Deputy Yates and ask for a programme for the training and appointment of the necessary dentists to make a proper attack on the waiting lists.  We must also train and appoint dental auxiliaries to operate as they do in other countries. They can play a most important role in the promotion of dental health in schools. This is an area of serious neglect and radical measures such as outlined in this motion are necessary to redress the position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne1" hpid="Mr. Browne (Carlow-Kilkenny) Mr. Browne (Carlow-Kilkenny)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> This is becoming a question of theory as against practice, ministerial theory against dental practice.  Everything can appear to be fine by saying that we have a very good dental service.  I cannot but recall the phrase that there is nothing either good nor bad but thinking makes it so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been a member of a health board for a number of years.  We are told there is a service but we know that in practice there is not.  Positive thinking is a help unless one happens to be a person waiting for treatment.  People in receipt of medical cards are entitled to get a service but they cannot get it.  This is leading to problems for health board clinics dealing <Col N="406" /> with emergencies consisting of extractions. They cannot deal with fillings or the provision of dentures.  As a result of people crowding in for emergency services the staff are over-worked trying to catch up on children's cases.  I have seen dentists visiting schools on a regular basis and deciding what has to be done but then we find there is a queue and a waiting list.</P>
    <P>There is a national problem in regard to orthodontics.  The queue is very long. Treatment is expensive and many people entitled to free treatment have to get it privately.  There is a limit on the amount of money that can be made available by the State but we have to measure the scarcity of money against the problems being caused.  We are either providing a service or we are not.  I have been told of a woman in her thirties whose teeth have been extracted and who cannot get dentures. She describes herself as a nervous wreck, being embarrassed to appear in public.  In theory she could have had her teeth filled and is entitled to dentures but in practice neither option has been available.</P>
    <P>Deputy Yates mentioned the grading of consultants.  I proposed at the health board that we should face the truth that we will not be able to attract consultant orthodontists into the health service. Three appointments were made in the South Eastern Health Board.  One person asked for six months to wind up his private practice and the other two also wanted time.  Finally none of the three entered the public service.  We cannot ask people to give up what is readily theirs and to accept a much lower salary.  It is not fair to ask dentists to treat public health patients for a much lower fee than they can get from private patients.  The Department might not be able to pay the same amount as private patients but they must pay some figure approaching it, otherwise dentists will have no particular interest in helping.  They have the same overheads and the same expenses and they will be working twice as hard to make as much money.  All these people must come together and we must devise <Col N="407" /> a service which will give the best value for the money available.</P>
    <P>My sympathy goes out to those who have no money to pay for dental treatment. Some who are entitled to a free service can get relief if they opt to pay for it but for many others there is no way out.  They either get treatment through the dental service or they suffer.  Many people are suffering.  If teeth are not filled when necessary these teeth will eventually have to be extracted in an emergency operation.  It is criminal that anyone should need to have teeth extracted when they could have been kept in good condition for years.  It is also criminal that people who need dentures have to suffer the shrinking of their gums and the digestive problems which are caused by the inability to chew food properly.</P>
    <P>The service we have in theory is not matched by the service in practice.  If our children are being left aside simply because we are treating medical card holders in public health clinics and the children cannot get the treatment to which they are entitled, it is time we examined our conscience and did something about it.  It would be a pity if, to use an analogy, like Nero, the Minister fiddled while teeth decayed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;notes the recent announcement by the Minister for Health of the distribution of £300,000 in the current year to commence the treatment of 500 priority orthodontic cases and commends the resolve of the Minister for Health to concentrate further resources on improving the dental services generally in 1990 and subsequent years&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened to the contributions of the three Deputies opposite.  Deputy Fennell suggested that I should ask my backbenchers about the dental service while Deputy Browne gave the impression that I had said we had a good dental service and <Col N="408" /> that everything was fine.  Deputies will agree that I have never defended the dental service as being a fine service.  In fact, in my 25 years in general practice. and my 16 years as a member of a health board, I was only too well aware of the deficiencies in the dental service.  It is important to point out that the deficiencies are not new.  I should like to pay tribute to Deputy Yates for his frankness in pointing out that six of the eight health boards did not have an adult dental service for a number of years.  The North Eastern Health Board and the Western Health Board had no adult dental service from 1985.  The North Western Health Board and the South Eastern Health Board had no adult dental service from 1986.  There was no adult dental service in the Southern Health Board region from 1985.  It is important to point out that the Coalition were in office during those years.  It was when they were in office that the dental service deteriorated.</P>
    <P>I should like to inform the House of the number of adults who were on the waiting list when the Coalition Government were in office.  At the beginning of 1983 there were 2,744 adults awaiting treatment in the South Eastern Health Board area and by the end of 1986 that number had increased to 8,717.  That is an indication of the problem that existed before we came into Government.  I accept that we have not made any great improvement in the dental service but Deputies will be aware that in recent weeks we provided extra money to commence a programme which I am satisfied will improve the service.  That programme will bring the service up to a standard that we will all be proud of.</P>
    <P>There are some aspects of the public dental service which do not achieve the level of provision which we would all like to see.  The public dental service does not provide, nor indeed has it ever provided, on a readily available basis the full range of treatment procedures which eligible persons may demand.  It is doubtful if such a level of service could ever be attained given the need to prioritise essential services in the context of finite resources.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="409" /> It was in recognition of the fact that there were problems with the public dental service that early last year I commissioned Deputy Leyden, Minister of State, to chair a small working group to look into all aspects of the dental services for eligible persons and, where appropriate, to make recommendations for improving them.</P>
    <P>The working group produced a report which gave a full and frank account of the existing dental services and highlighted those areas where improvements were required.  The report covered the four major areas of public dental services as follows: (i) children's dental services; (ii) orthodontics; (iii) adult dental services and (iv) water fluoridation and prevention.</P>
    <P>The dental service for children is povided almost exclusively by the salaried dentists employed by the health boards.  Over the past ten years there has been an increase of about 25 per cent in the numbers of dentists employed by the health boards.  A notable feature of the dental service for children is that the health boards have managed to maintain dental staff numbers up to strength despite the cutbacks of recent years.  I understand that there are about 240 dentists working in the public dental service at present.</P>
    <P>Some years ago there was great difficulty in recruiting dentists into the health board service but the situation has now changed dramatically.  Every competition for dentist posts in the health board service is now keenly contested. Many of the young dentists entering the health board dental service are doing so with a genuine enthusiasm for the task in hand.  In association with the increase in health board dentist numbers over the years there has been a continuing improvement in the quality of the clinical facilities available to them.  In this regard it should be noted that in 1983 the number of children treated was more than 296,000 while in 1987 the figure was just under 319,000.  That represents a sizeable increase in the number of children treated under the public health dental service in the last six years.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="410" /> All of these developments augur well for the future of the health board dental service.  In regard to the working group report, what emerged in relation to children's dental services was not so much a criticism of the service itself as of the different approaches and procedures that have developed in different health boards.  It is clearly unacceptable that there should be wide fluctuations in the availability of dental services for school children between one geographic location and another, given that all the children have the same eligibility and the same entitlement to treatment.  The question of standardising the approach and procedures and of achieving a greater productivity in all the health boards is being pursued with the boards by my Department.</P>
    <P>Deputy Yates referred to dental hygienists.  I should like to tell him that one proposed development that will have a significant effect on the public dental service is the introduction of dental hygienists.  Prior to the enactment of the 1985 dentists' Act this would not have been possible because under the old dentists' Act it was illegal for anybody other than a registered dentist or a registered medical practitioner to practice dentistry. The 1985 Act contains provisions which permit the Dental Council, with my approval, to make schemes for the establishment and registration of classes of auxiliary dental workers.  Schemes made by the council under the Act can determine the nature of the dental work an auxiliary worker may undertake and the circumstances under which it may be undertaken.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to be in a position to say that progress is being made by the Dental Council, in consultation with my Department, on the formal establishment of the grade of dental hygienist.  It is our intention that, when established, dental hygienists will be recruited into the health board dental service where they will be particularly useful.  Deputy Yates said he had information to indicate that those dental hygienists would only be available to the private sector but that is not the case.  I have taken a personal interest in <Col N="411" /> this matter and have spoken about it on a number of occasions to the President of the Dental Council.</P>
    <P>When dental hygienists are available they will be recruited into the public dental service and will be available to health boards.  At present health board dental surgeons may find themselves spending valuable time on oral hygiene and instruction.  That is something that can obviously be adequately done by a less qualified person such as a dental hygienist.  The use of dental hygienists therefore will free the dentist to devote his time to the more specialised work for which he is trained.  The economic sense of this arrangement is obvious.  In addition, dental hygienists will be able to take part in the provision of fissure sealants &mdash; a preventive measure which has been proven to be quite effective in reducing the risk of dental caries.  I would see the introduction of dental hygienists in the health boards as supplementing the existing service rather than replacing any element of it.  There would certainly be no question of the new grade being used to replace dentists.</P>
    <P>The question of providing orthodontic treatment for eligible persons has been a source of much aggravation for the health boards over the years.  The main difficulties have been the scarcity of persons qualified to carry out orthodontic treatments, particularly the more complicated ones, and the relatively high cost of treatment by orthodontists in private practice. Indeed, Deputy Yates was correct when he said an effort was made to recruit five orthodontists and only one of the posts was filled from that competition, but it is an indication, first of all, that orthodontists are in scarce supply, even in the private sector.  There is a scarcity of orthodontists in the country.  The creation of a number of posts of consultant orthodontist in the health boards seemed to offer a solution to the problem but with one exception it was not possible to fill these posts, as I said, and to a great extent the health boards must rely on the services of private practitioners to provide orthodontic treatment.  However, <Col N="412" /> the prospects for the future look distinctly brighter.</P>
    <P>In view of the difficulties being experienced by health boards in filling posts of consultant orthodontists, my Department are currently examining a number of proposals which have been made for amending the conditions of employment for consultant orthodontists under the health boards.  We have looked at a number of possibilities, including the possibility of orthodontists being able to divide their time to make a commitment to the health board and perhaps do some private practice themselves.  We are particularly anxious to make the posts attractive so that we will be in a position to recruit orthodontists to the health boards within the next year.  My Department will be having discussions with the health boards concerning this matter; in fact, we are in discussions with the health boards about this issue.</P>
    <P>An active training pathway in orthodontics has been established with the co-operation of the health boards and it is expected that the orthodontic manpower problem will be greatly relieved in the coming years.  For example, the Eastern Health Board in the absence of their own consultant orthodontists have reached an arrangement with the Dublin Dental Hospital whereby the senior lecturer consultants in orthodontics assess and treat eligible children on a sessional basis.  The Eastern Health Board are also funding a registrar post in orthondontics in the Dublin Dental Hospital while the senior lecturer consultants are also providing training in orthodontics for a number of health boards.  The Department recently approved the sending of one of the dentists from the North-Eastern Health Board to the dental hospital to train in orthodontics.</P>
    <P>One problem in relation to orthodontics that has been tackled successfully is that of identifying those children whose condition merits treatment by the health boards.  There have always been problems arising from the difficulty in deciding about the priority needs in orthodontic treatment, cosmetic, for example, the functional reasons for, the various <Col N="413" /> aspects of, orthodontic treatment.  The guidelines on orthodontic treatment needs were issued by the Department of Health in 1985 and have given the health boards a yardstick against which the merits of different cases can be measured.  The criteria to be applied in assessing degrees of priority for orthodontic treatment, listed in decreasing order of priority, are as follows: (a) patients with cleft palate and/or cleft lip, or with oral pathology, or with an orthognathic survey requirement (b) patients with extreme handicapping malocclusions (c) patients with non-handicapping malocclusions associated with a definite treatment need.</P>
    <P>Let me say a word on the special allocation for the 500 priority cases.  The training and recruitment of sufficient qualified orthodontists into the health board dental service will undoubtedly provide the solution in the long term. Meanwhile the problem of those who require orthodontic treatment now or in the near future has to be addressed.  I am very pleased to say that the Government have recently made available an additional £300,000 this year to help reduce waiting lists for orthodontic treatment. This will enable the health boards to initiate programmes of treatment for 500 priority cases.  It is expected that treatment of all these cases will have commenced within the next few weeks.  This is merely the beginning and from now on it is my intention to see some significant and steady movement in the waiting lists for priority orthodontic treatment.  The money has been provided, and we will be taking up the capacity available from now to the end of the year with private orthodontists mainly to ensure that the 500 children who need orthodontic treatment will have their treatment commenced within the next few weeks.</P>
    <P>Over one million adults and adolescents have eligibility for dental services provided by the health board.  Of that number between 300,000 and 400,000 would also have entitlement to the dental treatment benefit scheme administered by the Department of Social Welfare.  I am interested in <Col N="414" /> Deputy's Yates's comments about having a single dental service between the Department of Health and the Department of Social Welfare.  I have always had an open mind on that issue, but what surprises me is that from 1973 until 1986, for at least two-thirds of which time a Coalition Minister was in power, the Department of Health and the Department of Social Welfare were under the same Minister.  If there was such a commitment from the Coalition partners I am surprised that when one Minister was in charge of both Departments that issue was not addressed.  Between 600,000 and 700,000 adults and adolescents are relying exclusively on the health boards for dental treatment.</P>
    <P>The joint working party on dental services who reported in 1979 recommended that where health boards are unable to provide an adequate primary care service for all eligible persons, any spare capacity in the private practice area should be availed of in order to improve the level of service for public patients.  As a result the health boards introduced the new <i>ad hoc</i> arrangements in 1980, when the present Taoiseach was Minister for Health, to provide dental services for medical card holders and their adult and adolescent dependants.  Under the scheme dentists in private practice provided routine dental treatment for eligible adults referred to them by the health boards at the same rate of charges as applied under the social welfare dental benefit scheme.  At its peak in 1982 and 1983 about 32,000 adults received treatment annually under the <i>ad hoc</i> scheme at a cost of about £2 million.  The scheme is quite expensive to operate, possibly due to the high average age structure of the medical card population, which increased the demand for dentures, and to the volume of dental treatment need that has accumulated over the years. However, available resources at the time could not sustain this level of expenditure, and as far back as 1984, which Deputies will appreciate was the second year of the Fine Gael-Labour Coalition, <Col N="415" /> one by one the health boards either suspended or curtailed their use of the private dental practitioners.</P>
    <P>At present large numbers of persons are awaiting routine dental treatment to which they have statutory entitlement. The health boards continue to make emergency treatment for the relief of pain available to eligible adults.  Emergency care is provided almost exclusively by the dental staffs of the health boards. It was mainly in the context of the growing waiting lists for adult dental services that I asked my colleague, Deputy Terry Leyden, Minister of State, to chair the working group to whom I have already referred.  It is clear from the working group's report that part of the solution to the problem with the adult service lies in additional funding.</P>
    <P>It is evident that, to enable the further developments in the dental services which we all desire, additional funding must be found.  I need not remind this House of the radical steps which, of necessity, had to be taken to reverse the downward slide of the economy and the effects these measures had on public spending but I would remind Deputies that the problem experienced in the health services did not occur only in the past two years.</P>
    <P>On taking office, I was faced with the task of re-orientating a service which on the one hand was expending more and more resources and on the other required a major assessment of the priorities and how they were managed.  This I have been attempting to do within the overall constraints on resource availability. Unpalatable but vital decisions had to be taken to ensure that the basic fabric of the services were preserved, on which we could build for the future.</P>
    <P>I accept that there are a number of areas within the dental services which now need attention.  I have already referred to the additional £300,000 made available this year to help reduce waiting lists for orthodontic treatment.  Also, the services for eligible adults need to be <Col N="416" /> improved.  This I intend to do as part of the strategy for 1990.</P>
    <P>However, I do not accept that the solution to the problems as regards the dental services is simply and only the provision of moneys.  How those moneys are expended and the effectiveness of the services as a result must also be evaluated. This, too, is being addressed.</P>
    <P>In regard to dental health generally, we here in Ireland have reason to be thankful to those who, in the face of considerable opposition, had the courage to introduce fluoridation of water supplies nearly 30 years ago.  That the fluoridation programme has been a success is without doubt.  Several surveys, most notably the national survey of children's dental health carried out a few years ago, have proved conclusively that fluoridation does work in reducing the incidence of dental disease in the population.</P>
    <P>Of course the fluoridation process has not been without its problems.  Over the years there have been difficulties in maintaining the correct dosage rate in certain water supplies and there have at times been interruptions to the supply of hydrofluosilicic acid.  It is well know that fluoridation is most effective when administered to water supplies at the recommended dosage rate of 0.8 to one part per million.  There had been a proliferation of bad results from the water supplies over the years but I am pleased to say that there has been a marked improvement in recent times.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the enormous benefits of fluoridation and its cost effectiveness as a preventive measure it is essential that the ongoing programme of fluoridating new supplies and updating and improving existing installations be maintained.  In view of this I have allocated a sum of £200,000 to fluoridation projects in the current year and I will continue to support these projects.  This will alleviate to a significant extent the problem in relation to new and replacement fluoridation equipment.</P>
    <P>I was surprised at Deputy Yates when he contrasted what is happening now with a few years ago because a few years ago funding was allocated on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis <Col N="417" /> by the previous Coalition Government when equipment broke down.</P>

      <P>When Fianna Fáil came into office we decided because of the importance of ensuring that the flouridation programme was effective to allocate £200,000 to the flouridation projects and have promised to continue to finance the flouridation projects to ensure a proper and adequate flouridation of the water supplies.</P>
      <P>Just as in all aspects of health care, it is now accepted that a structured preventive programme is an essential element in service provision.  It is all the more so in relation to dental care.  I have already mentioned the flouridation as one of the main preventive measures, but it is necessary to look further and wider than that.  I am at present examining ways and means of strengthening the existing oral health promotion approaches.  This will have to be done at a number of levels.</P>
      <P>The Health Promotion Unit within my Department will be concentrating in particular on drawing up appropriate programmes with the health boards and the Dental Health Foundation, but, as with all aspects of health promotion, effective campaigns in oral health must totally involve every level of administration and service.  The involvement of individual dental surgeons and other professionals who have a day-to-day contact with the population must be at the forefront of this approach.  I am very pleased, from my own contacts with the dental profession, to note the wholehearted enthusiasm to co-operate in this direction.</P>
      <P>To summarise, the health board dental service for children is in pretty good order and has not been affected to any great extent by the cutbacks of recent years. This is because the health boards have managed to maintain their dental staff numbers at full strength.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of achieving uniformity of the level of service for children in the different health boards we are pursuing this with the boards.  We believe that it would be appropriate to target two classes in the national schools in the first instance and believe that second and sixth <Col N="418" /> classes are the most appropriate.  These classes have been selected because in most children in second class it could be expected that the first permanent molars would have erupted while we would like to target sixth class to ensure that children are dentally fit when they leave the national school.</P>
    <P>Demand for orthodontic services is far in excess of what the health boards can provide.  Nevertheless progress is being made.  Present arrangements for the training of orthodontists should ensure that in a few years time the health boards will have a number of full time consultant orthodontists on their staff.  The £300,000 which the Government have recently allocated to the boards will permit 500 of the top priority cases to commence their treatment within the coming weeks.</P>
    <P>The £200,000 per annum which is being allocated to flouridation will safeguard the flouridation programme for the next few years.  In regard to other preventative measures, mouth rinsing programmes and the provision of fissure sealants are being carried out in certain areas.  The problem is lack of manpower.  However, the introduction of dental hygienists will have a considerable impact on these services.</P>
    <P>The question of allocating more funds specifically for routine dental work for adults is one I am addressing at present.</P>
    <P>I would like to say, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, that I recognise there are deficiencies in the health service.  We have already shown in a number of areas that we are dealing with some of those problems and I can assure the House that we will continue to deal with them and we will not be satisfied until we have in place a first-class dental service for the needs of our people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>As I rise I cannot help but get a feeling of <i>déjà vu</i>&mdash; the same people sitting in the same seats and playing the same tunes.  It is almost as if we had not gone through the past four or five months, that we have not had a general election and that the voice of the people of the country had not been heard on the issue of the health services when the cant which we have listened to again from the <Col N="419" /> Minister can be regurgitated again as if it was new.</P>
      <P>The timing of this debate is particularly appropriate and, indeed, I commend Deputy Yates for putting this down as the first motion in Private Members' Business this session.  It comes on a day when one of our national newspapers publishes a report, prepared in the Department of Health, which clearly recognises that the dental scheme in all its aspects has collapsed.  Although the Minister has had this report for more than a year and there has been selective leaks of it in the past he has as yet decided not to publish it.  Presumably, once everybody has read all the newspaper articles about it he will eventually decide that it is safe to let the public have the total copy of the Leyden Committee.  At least we may be able to draw some comfort from what is happening now.  The comfort I refer to is that at least tonight the Minister for Health, in dealing with this particular motion, will not be able to fall back on the hoary old excuse he has used for two and a half years in this House in response to any crisis in the health area that he will establish yet another commission, yet another committee to look into the problems.  In this case he has his committee, his commission and his report and what is required is his solutions. From the script we have just listened to it is clear that solutions will be very slow in coming.  There is a realisation of the degree of crisis, especially in the dental service, by independent bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from the appropriateness of the motion, it was also appropriate to commence the session with one put down by the Fine Gael Party.  I said that little has changed since we last met.  Perhaps one thing has changed, the willingness of Fine Gael at last to face up to the crisis which has beset the health services in recent years.  This is indeed a welcome &mdash; if belated &mdash; change.  Members on these benches who have been trying to force a debate on the inadequacy of our health services have been frustrated all too often by the willingness of the largest of the Opposition parties in this House to swallow any medicine prescribed by the Minister for Health.  It is refreshing, even if <Col N="420" /> it is nearly three years overdue, to see a Private Members' Motion from Fine Gael that is not hedged with a mass of qualifications about the public purse, public finances and acting within the constraints of published figures.</P>
    <P>For three years, three budgets and three sets of Estimates the Labour Party sought to bring home the extent of the depth of the crisis to the previous Fianna Fáil Government and all the other parties who were part of the consensus that maintained that Government in office for two and a half years.  It was not until the Dáil was dissolved and Members began to knock on peoples' doors that they began to realise that what we had been saying for two and a half years was the reality although it had been glibly dismissed, week in, week out, by the Minister for Health and his Government colleagues in the previous administration. The hardships which people were enduring were not fabrications of the Labour Party but the reality for the majority of people.</P>
    <P>It is all the more remarkable, given the Taoiseach's extraordinary admission during the course of the last election campaign, that the response of this new Government to the crisis has been so pathetic.  It can only be described as pathetic in the light of the publication of the document <i>Lets Look Again</i> by the Joint Health Commission of the Catholic Church.  That document unequivocally described health care as a basic human right, so basic a right that there is an explicit obligation on the community to discriminate positively in favour of the poor in relation to health care.  The last Government discriminated positively against the poor making it increasingly difficult for people on low incomes to secure any access &mdash; let alone equality of access &mdash; to health care.  The sum of £15 million which the new Government have allocated as an extra increment in health spending will not reverse that trend.  It is a sop to the cry from the heart that the people made during the course of the last election campaign.  At very best the £15 million will stave off some of the worst consequences of the cutbacks in a narrowly defined area, geographically and medically, for a short period.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="421" /> We will never have equality of access and, therefore, we will never be able to describe health care as a basic human right until we face up to the need for a proper level of resources.  No final decision can be made on how much we should spend on the health services until we decide collectively whether health care is a basic human right.  If we decide it is then we must make the necessary decision to give effect to that fundamental principle.</P>
    <P>In a document published during the last election campaign the Labour Party committed themselves to some short and medium term measures based on a total acceptance of the principle that health care is indeed a basic human right.  While our ultimate aim is the development of a comprehensive, unified national health service, we recognise that in the interim action must be taken to ensure that the service provided is capable of meeting the needs of the community.  To that end the Health Estimate for 1989 must be increased by £48 million as the sum of £15 million in the Government's programme is totally inadequate.</P>
    <P>We said that we would seek in this Dáil in the context of the 1990 Estimates and next year's budget additional health spending on top of the present allocation of £70 million.  We will take similar action in respect of the Estimates for 1991 and 1992.  This objective would mean that £245 million more will be spent on the health services by the end of 1992.  Health spending, with its additional allocation, would then be restored to the equivalent of 7.2 per cent of GNP.</P>
    <P>We also spelt out very clearly the immediate needs of the health service in current and capital terms.  A sum of £20 million is needed immediately for the reopening of public beds functioning during holiday periods and a substantial proportion of the 7,000 staff currently employed on a temporary basis should be made permanent.  There should be more community care in the following areas: additional public health nursing staff, additional social work staff in the child care area and a reinstatement of transport service for the elderly.  At least 300 long stay beds in health board areas should be reopened, there should be <Col N="422" /> additional staff in the provision of services to the adult mentally handicapped and all the health charges introduced in the last Dáil by Fianna Fáil should be abolished.</P>
    <P>We spelt out all these and costed them in detail in various documents published in the last number of months.  In relation to the dental scheme which is the subject of the motion tonight&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to focus sharply on this scheme.  In relation to the dental scheme, which is the subject of the motion, the Labour Party have pointed out several times that the sum of £6 million saved in the social welfare budget arising from the dental dispute must be reallocated.  We advocated that this money should be used to hire additional public health dentists and orthodontists to deal quickly with the enormous waiting list for dental services.  The crisis in the dental service is real and acute.  Some of the parameters of the crisis were outlined by Deputy Yates in his initial comments. Almost two million people are eligible for services under the medical care scheme, category 1 eligibility.  The fact that it is simply not available to the vast majority of people is recognised, not only by the Leyden report but, more recently, by the report of the Commission on Health Funding.  The Minister has a statutory responsibility under section 67 of the Health Act, 1970, to make dental, opthalmic and aural treatment and appliances available without charge to category 1 patients and their dependants and also to pre-school and national school children referred from child health examination. These services are provided by <Col N="423" /> 250 salaried dentists employed by the health boards.</P>
      <P>I might quote from the Report of the Commission on Health Funding, page 281, paragraph 14.12 under the heading &ldquo;Evaluation&rdquo; where it says:</P>
      <P>Two major areas of concern are apparent in the provision of these services. The first is the wholly inadequate level of service available in the health board system.</P>
      <P>In the next paragraph 14.13, under the heading (i) Provision it says:</P>
      <P>Health board services cater for a relatively small proportion of those statutorily entitled to them.  Certain categories, including pre-school and national school children, expectant and nursing mothers and the handicapped, are accorded priority; the great majority of persons with Category I eligibility are effectively without public dental care other than for emergencies.</P>
      <P>That is an indictment of the Minister and his responsibilities.  He has a statutory responsibility in law for the 1970 Act. How can he justify his inaction in this regard?  The Minister has now been in office for nearly three years.  When will he assume the responsibilities of his ministry? When will he stop blaming somebody else?  When will he decide that he is responsible, that he must answer to this House for the state of the health services? Will he do so when he has been five years in office?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a thick file on health care problems, a huge proportion of which relates to the narrow area of orthodontic care for children.  All of them are heart-rending and constitute indictments of the Minister's inaction in this regard.  I will quote some of these letters for the benefit of the House.  One is a letter dated 16 October 1989 from a principal dental surgeon in the South Eastern Health Board area in relation to a case I had referred to them, and which says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="424" /> I have received your letter concerning a patient.  His recent examination &mdash; last month &mdash; was for the purpose of assessing his eligibility for treatment under the Department of Health guidelines which we are now obliged to implement.  Approximately two-thirds of patients called from the waiting list for assessment have conditions which are not of a severity to warrant treatment under these guidelines.</P>
    <P>I might add that these are the new guidelines issued by the Department of Health. The letter continues to say:</P>
    <P>Great as our sympathy is for these patients &mdash; almost 700 on the current waiting list &mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash; and 700 on the waiting list in the one area puts the Minister's recent allocation in some degree of perspective.  To continue the letter:</P>
    <P>or for their disappointed parents, there is nothing which can be done in the present situation.  This waiting list was initiated and maintained in the expectation that (1) a regional health board consultant orthodontist would be appointed and (2) an orthodontic specialist would visit the area on one day per month.  Neither has materialised and it is now no longer acceptable to delude patients and parents with the illusion offered by a place on the waiting list.  I enclose a copy of a letter which I have now sent to parents of children who are being called for reassessment.</P>
    <P>I might quote from the letter referred to being sent to each parent which reads:</P>
    <P>Dear Parent,</P>
    <P>Your child is presently on the waiting list for orthodontic treatment. Demand for such treatment has greatly increased in recent years.  At the same time the capacity of the dental service to provide basic treatment has become so restricted that the only service now available to eligible adults and post-primary school children is an emergency one to provide relief from pain. Any improvement in this situation is <Col N="425" /> extremely unlikely in the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>As it has become clear that there is no reasonable prospect of affording treatment to all those on the waiting list we are now obliged to implement recommendations issued by the Department of Health which restrict treatment to children with very severe defects.  Patients on the orthodontic waiting list will be called for reassessment in the near future with a view to making a priority listing of those in greatest need.  It is a matter of regret that a substantial number of children will, of necessity, be excluded from treatment, but in the present circumstances it has become inevitable.</P>
    <P>That is a letter dated 16 October 1989.  I will not read all of these letters but each constitutes a litany of misery for individual families.</P>
    <P>There is a letter to one constituent of mine, referred for orthodontic treatment when in fourth class, who was put on a waiting list, who has now awaited treatment for four years.  I have another letter about a boy, aged 12, who was seen by an orthodontist last month after a four year wait.  Apparently the result of that visit was that a brace was prescribed but his mother was informed that a brace will not be provided for him.  There is no possibility of private treatment in this case as the father has deserted the family. Another child in my constituency was informed by the orthodontist who assessed her condition that, although she needed a brace, she would have to wait for it until she was working and could buy it herself.  Yet another child has been informed by a nurse that there are now two books full of names of people awaiting orthodontic treatment in the South Eastern Health Board area.  I could continue to cite this litany of despair.  I am sure all of those people would take cold comfort from the statement the Minister made in the House this evening that virtually all is well, that the health board dental service for children is in pretty good order and has not been affected to any great extent by the health cutbacks of recent years.  That is cold comfort indeed for all those people awaiting basic <Col N="426" /> treatment from the Minister, his Department and the health service he is statutorily obliged to maintain and oversee.</P>
    <P>The crisis is only one of a number. The overall crisis in our health services continues unabated.  It has not been abated by the General Election, nor by the £15 million the new Government allocated on assuming office.  Neither was it helped by the publication of the Report of the Commission on Health Funding. When that report was published I said it was particularly disappointing.  Any rational analysis of the crisis in our health services must lead to the conclusion that the main cause of the crisis is lack of adequate funding.  I am relieved to note this evening that that realisation is beginning to dawn on the Minister also when he says that additional funding must be found, whereas his only response to the publication of the document was to regurgitate the £300,000 for the 500 emergency cases.  I have said that there are 700 in my health board area alone. Welcome and all as is the £200,000 allocated for a flouridation programme, it hardly constitutes a response to the scale of the crisis obtaining.  The Minister must now be aware of that fact.</P>
    <P>It is possible to construct a universal health service in this country, efficiently run, managed and free, at the point of need, to every citizen.  We regard that as a right of every citizen: this level of care must be provided.  It is gratifying to note that the Commission on Health Funding agree with that belief.  The Commission, having accepted that health care is a right, then go on to argue that the quantity and quality of health care can be determined only by what the Exchequer can afford.  This type of argument undermines the whole approach of the commission. It effectively places them in the position of arguing that people have a right only to whatever the Government decide to give them.  I indicated, when published, that that section of the report had all the marks of having been published, indeed written, by the Department of Finance.  The commission then go on to compound that fatal flaw by advocating, in what they describe as the kernel of their report, a new administrative structure which, in practice, will <Col N="427" /> vary from the present structure only by adding yet another layer of bureaucracy.</P>
    <P>There are good things contained in their report.  However, they can be seen as pious aspirations only for as long as they are fatally undermined by the evidence of what must be secret writing instructions which clearly controlled the deliberations of the commission.  In overall terms the implementation of this report would not improve the quality of our health services or its efficiency.  It would condemn us to the maintenance of a health service provided on the cheap and add confusion to the delivery of care.</P>
    <P>It is instructive to look at what the Commission have to say about the dental services.  Basically, the Commission recognise that the scheme is in crisis, that the health boards are failing in their statutory obligation to provide dental treatment for eligible adults.</P>

      <P>Deputy Liam Kavanagh gave notice of his intention to raise on the Adjournment the subject matter of the proposed closure of Ergas Limited in Arklow.  The matter is in order and in accordance with our new Standing Order the Deputy has some 10 minutes to make his case and the Minister has five minutes to reply.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to raise a very serious problem that has arisen not just in my constituency but in a few other areas of Dublin as well.  A public announcement made last Friday on behalf of the company, Flogas, indicated that they intended to acquire the shares of another LPG company, Ergas.  For the benefit of the Minister I will quote from <i>The Irish Times</i> report of 21 October where it says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Flogas, the publicly quoted liquid petroleum gas (LPG) company yesterday confirmed that it is to acquire the entire issued share capital of Ergas and Ergas (NI), two companies within <Col N="428" /> the Royal Dutch Shell Group for £12.7 million. The acquisitions will be funded by a rights issue to shareholders to raise £10.06 million.</P>
    <P>The deal involves a major rationalisation at Ergas.  The company's plant in Arklow and its office in Dublin are to be closed.  The rationalisation is expected to result in 50 redundancies.</P>
    <P>Further on it says:</P>
    <P>The acquisition is subject to re-conditions which include the receipt of relevant government and regulatory consents.  It involves the granting of options to a Shell company to acquire 770,000 shares in Flogas at a price of 260p over a five year period from the completion of the acquisition.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows the difficulties for the town of Arklow in relation to unemployment. The Minister visited Arklow during the course of the general election campaign and no doubt he was made well aware of the devastating situation with regard to employment in Arklow and in the whole of County Wicklow.  This further news that an industry is to close in Arklow adds to the many blows which this town received over the last decade. I hope that in considering the preconditions to this takeover of Flogas the Minister will bear in mind the seriousness of the problem that will occur in Arklow as a result of this takeover, and the problems of the unemployed in Arklow.</P>
    <P>Arklow is a distribution point for Ergas who also have a distribution point in Ballymount industrial estate in Dublin and offices in Dún Laoghaire.  The statement says that about 50 jobs in these three areas, 25 in Arklow, are to be discontinued. The material for filling the gas bottles is imported through Arklow and the dock workers there work on the boats in which the raw material is imported.  As well as that there is considerable revenue to the harbour board in fees and dues as a result of this trade.  All these sectors will be affected by this decison.  The Minister should be aware of the repercussions this will have.</P>
    <P>Arklow is an unemployment black spot.  The latest figures I have is that there are about 900 people unemployed in the town and in the immediate area covered <Col N="429" /> by the unemployment office the total unemployment is about 1,400.  This is an increase of about 100 in a year, from November to November.  The percentage of employable people who are unemployed in Arklow is at 30 to 40 per cent. Since the last census was taken in 1986 emigration from the town of Arklow has been enromous and so it is difficult to get a base from which to apply the unemployment figure in Arklow <i>vis-à-vis</i> the present population.  Arklow had a population of about 8,000 men, women and children and assuming that about 50 per cent of them would be employable, my figure of one in three being unemployed in the town is not excessive.  A television debate which took place in connection with the European election showed Arklow as being one of the unemployment black spots.</P>
    <P>In the last decade, as the people in this House know, local industry in Arklow has been devastated.  Noritake, a Japanese industry which makes high class pottery, closed their Arklow plant with the loss of about 400 jobs in the early part of this decade.  In 1982 Avoca Mines closed with the loss of about 200 jobs and the old traditional industry, Arklow Pottery, has seen the numbers employed reduced by over 50 per cent.  The Irish Fertiliser Industry, the big industry in the area, formerly know as NET have seen the numbers employed drop from a high of 1,400 to about 300.  That industry was one of the main employers in the area and the reduction of jobs there was a devastating blow to Arklow.  These are the big loss leaders in the Arklow area but many more small industries including service industries that depended on the big industries have gone to the wall or are in difficulties.  Although the loss of 25 jobs in Ergas may seem small, in the light of all the jobs lost in Arklow, it is another serious blow to the south-east Wicklow area.</P>
    <P>The Minister may say in his reply that he will probably be in Wicklow in the next few weeks opening a small new industry there, Servier Limited, and that is welcome. Had we been able to maintain employment and expand employment in traditional industries there, we would have welcomed Servier but they do not <Col N="430" /> in any way replace the huge losses in employment, most of it male employment, in the area.  As a result of unemployment we have experienced an unusually high level of emigration in a time of bad emigration.  School leavers have no hope of gaining employment in the area.  School leavers who cannot get into universities have a very bleak future indeed.  Local industry, be it traditional industry like fisheries or the shipping industry in the area, can provide only a very small number of jobs in any one year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am at present considering a proposal under the Mergers, Take-Overs and Monopolies Act, 1978, which involves the takeover of Ergas by Flogas.  I might say at this stage that I am somewhat surprised that an announcement was made publicly by the acquiring company to the effect that they had acquired the purchased company without any clearance having been obtained from me.  This is very unusual and not the normal practice in commercial activity.  I am aware they made it clear that it was subject to Government approval but nonetheless it is unusual that they should have acted as they did and I will be inquiring as to why they acted in that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that under this proposal it is envisaged that the existing facility in Arklow will be closed.  I understand the concerns expressed by Deputy Kavanagh <Col N="431" /> and others about the employment implications of the proposal and will take account of what Deputy Kavanagh has said here tonight before coming to a decision on the matter.</P>
    <P>As the House will be aware, merger control in Ireland is governed by the Mergers, Take-overs and Monopolies (Control) Acts, 1978 and 1987.  The legislation sets out to control take-overs and mergers involving any two or more enterprises. The Act applies to every proposed merger or take-over where the value of the assets or the annual turnover of each of two or more of the enterprises involved is not less than £5 million in terms of value of the assets or £10 million in terms of the turnover and that apparently applies here.</P>
    <P>A merger or take-over is defined as being taken to exist when two or more enterprises, at least one of which carries on business in the State, come under common control.  Where a merger or take-over is proposed which falls within the scope of the Act, notification of the proposal to the Minister for Industry and Commerce is obligatory.  A merger or take-over cannot be concluded until the Minister has stated that he does not propose to prohibit it either absolutely or conditionally, or in the absence of such a statement until a period of three months has elapsed from the date of notification or from the date of receipt of such further information as the Minister may require.</P>
    <P>Under the 1978 Act there are a number of criteria which are taken account of in reaching a decision.  In addition to employment, which is an important one, the other significant criteria are the effect on competition; continuity of supplies; the extent to which a proposal is in harmony with Government policy relating to the rationalisation, in the interests of greater efficiency, of operations in the business concerned and any benefits likely to be derived from the proposal in areas such as efficient distribution.</P>
    <P>The market for the Ergas product is very competitive because of the possibility of customers switching to alternative energy sources.  I understand that this intense level of competition is what <Col N="432" /> prompted the current owners of the company to sell.</P>
    <P>Given the availability of alternative fuels I do not see that there will be adverse implications arising in the area of competition from the proposal, nor is there any real threat to continuity of supplies.</P>
    <P>If an industry requires rationalisation and this is brought about as a result of free competition that is not unfair it is not the job of Government to interfere. In this case I have no evidence to suggest that the competitive forces at work are anything other than fair.</P>
    <P>I am very conscious of the employment difficulties in the Arklow area particularly during the eighties and I would like to emphasise to the House that the IDA have earmarked Arklow as a priority area for industrial development.  Indeed, it is encouraging to note from a recent employment survey that the earlier job loss trends in Arklow are now beginning to be reversed and that the trend now shows a small but welcome increase in employment in the area.  I am confident that the IDA's continued efforts to promote industrial development in Arklow will show significant and tangible results in the not too distant future when I expect some worthwhile announcements to be made.</P>
    <P>As I have indicated at the outset, I am currently considering the proposal involving the take-over of Ergas.  I would like to reassure Deputy Kavanagh and the House that in taking my decision I will give the proposal a rigorous examination under the Mergers, Take-overs and Monopolies Act.</P>

      <P>I hope the Ceann Comhairle will note I have lost a couple of minutes already.  The fact that the Ceann Comhairle gave me permission to raise this matter on the Adjournment is an indication of the importance which he attaches, and which we must all attach, to the need for smoke control in the city of Dublin.  There is no need to go into detail on that matter because we discussed it at length last year.  Smoke emission in Dublin was five times greater than <Col N="433" /> the EC limit and on one occasion last year it was seven times greater.</P>
      <P>There is a lot of confusion regarding this matter.  Nobody knows the position. The people in Ballyfermot do not know what in God's name is happening.  An Act was passed in September 1987 and the corporation moved into action.  They designated Zone A for survey this time two years ago.  The survey was carried out in the winter of that year.  The corporation issued their first smoke control order in March 1988 and designated the fuels which were to be used.  CDL then lodged an objection and an oral hearing took place in June 1988.  The report was issued to the Minister in September 1988 and the Minister issued the order in October 1988.  In issuing that order for Zone A the Minister added one fuel and one appliance.  He added peat briquettes as an extra fuel which was not included by the corporation and he also added the full burning fire as a legitimate appliance. At the same time he issued the list of grants which were to be given and gave six months for Zone A to comply with this order.  In other words, by 31 May 1989 we should have had Dublin's and Ireland's first smoke control zone.</P>
      <P>In the meantime Eolas carried out a survey on the full burning fire and shot it down.  Instead of the Minister making a decision in regard to the full burning fire, he postponed the date for implementation of the order from 31 May to 30 September.  He then had the whole summer to make a decision on the matter but he did not do so.  In early October he again postponed the date to 31 December. In the meantime Dublin Corporation were proceeding with their orders for Zone B.  They issued a confirmation order for Zone B last February.  Again CDL made an objection and again there was an oral hearing.  That matter has been with the Minister for over a month and he is now in a position to make an order in regard to Zone B.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The corporation have also issued an order in relation to Zone C, concerning 3,000 houses.  There was no objection by CDL to that and therefore the Minister is now in a position to issue an order for that zone.  The orders for Zones B and C should now be issued and the Minister <Col N="434" /> should also make a decision in regard to the full burning fire.</P>
    <P>Dublin Corporation have also included the final part of Ballyfermot and Chapelizod in Zone D.  I am not quite certain, perhaps, the Minister of State can clarify this for me, but I think an objection has been lodged against it and the county council have issued an order covering Neilstown while the corporation are proceeding with orders covering Crumlin, Drimnagh, Walkinstown, Inchicore and other areas.  However, the Minister has fallen way behind and has made no decision yet in respect of the first 840 houses.  In the meantime the price of coalite, the only smokeless fuel available on the market, has jumped in price.  It is now 40 per cent dearer than coal and it was only 16 per cent dearer initially.  The Minister was shocked by this price increase and said he was going to ask his colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce who has just left the Chamber, to initiate an urgent investigation into the disturbing differential in the price of coalite and smokeless fuel.  I ask the Minister of State to tell us tonight if her colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce has done anything about this huge increase in the price of coalite which now costs £10.70 a bag as against a price of £7.60 for a bag of coal.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister of State to tell us what is meant by this increase in the price of coal.  The Minister's solution is to increase the price of coal so that people will not be able to buy it and will end up having to buy coalite.  The cost of coal and coalite is way too high at present.  The Minister should look at the price of coal landed in the docks in Dublin and then look at the price being charged in Ballyfermot and other parts of the city and throughout the country.  There should be a reduction in the price of coal, not an increase.</P>
    <P>What is required by at least 200 householders out of the 840 is a solid fuel option they can offord.  They do not want big gas or ESB bills.  They want to be able to use solid fuel.  The Minister of State must tell us how she is going to make this option available to these people at a price they can afford.  They want a smoke free <Col N="435" /> zone.  They cannot afford it and the Minister must provide them with a solid fuel option.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Mac Giolla for allowing me to come in on this matter.  I also sought to raise it on the Adjournment.  All the public relations smog screen in the world cannot conceal the fact that the Government have behaved with complete and gross incompetence in this area.  This time last year the Minister on a similar Adjournment Debate, in which I and other colleagues raised this issue, promised there would be a number of additional smoke control zones in Dublin by this winter.  However, not one additional smoke control zone has been provided in Dublin.  If breathing in Dublin this winter damages people's health responsibility for this will rest with the Government.</P>
      <P>I find it inexplicable that the additional orders that Deputy Mac Giolla referred to have not been made.  We have invited the Government to bring new legislation before the House so that far broader smoke control orders can be made and no single company, such as CDL, can in effect attempt to prevent the proper operation of the Air Pollution Act to safeguard people's health, but the Minister would not do that.  It is interesting to note that the Minister of State Deputy Harney, is here.  I congratulate her on her appointment.  This is the first time she has come into this House in her capacity as junior Minister on the Environment to deal with an issue.  I think she has been handed a smoking chalice by her senior colleague.  It is notable that it is not her senior colleague, Deputy Flynn, Minister for the Environment, who is here this evening because it is he who has to make these orders under the statutory provisions, not Deputy Harney.  Why do we not have Deputy Flynn explaining this incompetence and negligence to this House this evening?</P>

The Minister should tell us if she will provide fuel vouchers of increased value to enable the people of Ballyfermot and other parts of the city and county of Dublin, such as Neilstown, to acquire the more expensive coalite product and other less smoky fuel products during the coming winter in an effort to reduce the level of smog?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The basic cause of smoke pollution in Dublin is the burning of coal in domestic open fires across the city.  It is clearly not <Col N="437" /> a problem which is amenable to instant solutions or a wave of a ministerial wand. Neither is it one that can be solved without the commitment of substantial financial resources.  The basis of the Government's remedial strategy is the establishment of smoke control areas in the most seriously affected parts of the city, obliging residents in such areas to change to an acceptable form of home heating.  The Air Pollution Act, 1987, established a detailed procedure which must be followed before smoke control orders can be confirmed.</P>

      <P>If the Deputies will listen they will hear.  Let me remind the House of the basic developments to date with regard to Ballyfermot.  The Minister for the Environment confirmed the area A order with modifications in November 1988.  The main modification in effect permitted the continued use of bituminous coal in conjunction with an appliance known as the full burning fire. However, having regard to issues which arose in that hearing, the Minister was concerned to obtain comprehensive, independent evidence regarding the smoke emission characteristics of fuels <Col N="439" /> and appliances available in Dublin. Accordingly, in November 1988, the Minister commissioned EOLAS to conduct an intensive test programme for such fuels and appliances, including the full burning fire, and to recommend practicable criteria for determining the suitability of fuels and appliances for general use in smoke control areas.  It was made clear that further confirmation of special control areas would have to await this report.</P>
      <P>A Ballyfermot area B order was made in December 1988; an area C order in March 1989, and a final Ballyfermot area D order on 1 May 1989.  In each case, other than for Ballyfermot area C, there were objections to the orders, thereby requiring oral hearings to be held.  In addition, the validity of the area B order was challenged in the High Court making it impossible in any event to proceed on foot of this order until a court decision became available in April 1989.</P>
      <P>EOLAS submitted an interim report in early May 1989.  Given the availability of the report, an oral hearing on area B was held in early June 1989.  The test procedures used by EOLAS, the smoke emission performance results obtained and the suitability criteria recommended, together with various other test results, were all the subject of lengthy and complex technical argument over the eight day hearing, with expert witnesses present from the UK, Federal Republic of Germany and New Zealand.  The inspector's report and recommendations on the hearing were submitted to my Department on 21 September 1989 and are currently being considered by me.</P>

    <P>It must be understood that the area B oral hearing was in the nature of a test case addressing certain basic issues which, once resolved, should allow rapid progress with the special control area programme. I confidently expect to be in a position to confirm the Ballyfermot area B and C orders within a matter of days, bringing a total of over 5,000 houses within smoke control zones.  The way will then be cleared, as an objection has been <Col N="440" /> raised, for the necessary oral hearing in relation to Ballyfermot D at an early date.</P>

      <P>May I finish, please?  As regards the general problem of smoke pollution, I believe that we must speedily put together a more effective programme of action designed, as a minimum, to reduce smoke levels below the maximum set by the EC Directive.  I believe that we should, in fact, aim to achieve far more than that.  We should aim, in effect, to make Dublin a smokeless zone.  There is, of course, no accepted legal definition of such a zone but I think that we could take such a zone to be one where the very stringent EC guide values are consistently complied with.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 27 and 52 together.</P>
      <P>Over recent years extensive works have been undertaken by the Office of Public Works in the National Museum. These form part of an ongoing programme of improvements.</P>
      <P>The complete renewal of the electrical wiring was completed last year.  Understandably, most of the exhibition galleries had to be closed to the public during the work in the interests of the safety of the public and for the protection of the artefacts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An exhibition entitled &ldquo;The Millennium Exhibition Dublin 1000&rdquo; featuring materials recovered in the various archaeological excavations around Dublin especially the one in Wood Quay was opened in the aisle of the Central Court in August, 1988.  Work has been completed on the redecoration of the 1916 room, the Ceramics Room and the Chinese Room and on the installation of suitable exhibition lighting in these <Col N="57" /> rooms.  Limited improvement works which were required in the Japanese Room and the Music Room have also been completed.</P>
    <P>The Ceramics Room, the 1916 Room and the Japanese Room have been re-opened to the public and an exhibition has been mounted on one balcony at first floor level.  I understand that the preparation of the exhibitions for the Chinese Room and the Music Room is in hands and these rooms will be re-opened to the public at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>An extensive outbreak of dry rot was discovered in the building and the necessary treatment work and consequent making good has been carried out.</P>
    <P>A contract has been placed for the development in the Rotunda area of an improved and expanded Museum Shop and better Visitor Reception and information facilities.  Full regard was had to the high architectural quality of the Rotunda in the design and specification for the proposed work which will be completed in December 1989.</P>
    <P>Works are in hand for the improvement of the entrance approaches to the National Museum from Kildare Street. The proposed works include the provision of an invalid ramp, which has already been installed; the re-erection of antique lamp standards; the widening of the existing entrance gates, and the provision of new notice boards.</P>
    <P>Work has commenced on the restoration of the roof of the Central Court (or Great Hall) of the Museum.  The contract includes for the redecoration of this area.  It is due for completion in February next year.  Specialist fitting out works will then be carried out to the Central Court to accommodate a major exhibition to be held in conjunction with the British Museum, which is due to open in May 1990.</P>
    <P>Planning is also in progress for the provision of improved Conservation Laboratories to serve all areas of the Museum's activities.  Work on this scheme is expected to commence at the beginning of next year.</P>
    <P>A number of galleries in the Museum remain closed at present.  Once the work <Col N="58" /> to the roof over the Central Court is completed it will be possible to re-open these areas to the public.  Some of the areas will require redecoration and the provision of special lighting, showcases and other modern display aids.  The remounting of the displays will also involve considerable work by Museum staff.  It is too soon yet to say when particular rooms will be re-opened but it will be as early as possible.</P>
    <P>Premises at the former Military Barracks, Beggars Bush have been allocated to provide alternative storage for the Museum's Geological and Spirit based collections.  Works which are necessary to improve the security of the building will commence shortly.</P>
    <P>Contract documents have been prepared for the renewal of the existing heating system in the National Museum which is nearing the end of its useful life.  Also the stone facade of the building is deteriorating and in need of attention.  These works will be undertaken as soon as the necessary funds can be made available. The Natural History Museum has been completely rewired, and redecoration of the building which is currently in progress is nearing completion.  I understand the building is expected to be ready for re-opening about the end of November 1989.</P>
    <P>The total cost of works undertaken to date and at present in progress in the National Museum is in the region of £2 million.  An estimate is not available at this stage for the cost of works remaining to be done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will clarify the present uncertainty concerning the refund of VAT and excise duty payments on cars for disabled drivers with specific reference to whether an approved person will automatically get one refund if they are approved for the other; in cases where an applicant has use of one leg only whether he or she would be eligible for relief; if his attention has been drawn to a number of applicants who were <Col N="59" /> approved in previous years who have this year been refused for the first time and who have bank loans on cars for which they thought approval would have been issued; and when the full regulation will be published.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>Provision for a new scheme of indirect tax rebates to disabled drivers and passengers was made in this year's Finance Act.  The necessary detailed regulations to give effect to the new scheme are at an advanced stage of preparation. I indicated in the course of the Finance Bill debate that I would be consulting the Opposition spokesmen on Finance before finalising these regulations. I expect, therefore, to be in a position very shortly to pass copies of the draft regulations to them with a view to the draft being finalised and brought into force at the earliest possible date.</P>
      <P>In the meantime the existing schemes continue in operation.  Under the present schemes, to be eligible for relief of excise duty a person must satisfy the Revenue Commissioners that he is &ldquo;wholly or almost wholly without the use of each of his legs&rdquo;, whereas to be eligible for a repayment of VAT they must show that they were granted remission of road tax by their local vehicle licensing authority. It is fair to say that the schemes have not operated in a uniform way, because of the different procedures and requirements that apply.  A number of applicants have been granted repayments of VAT and refused a repayment of excise duty. It is my intention that under the new scheme a person who qualifies for one will automatically qualify for the other, and that the medical criteria will be more liberal than those applied under the present scheme.</P>
      <P>I am aware that a number of applicants for repayment of excise duty were refused in the last two years despite having been granted repayment in earlier years. When granting repayment in the past, the Revenue Commissioners were unaware that the people involved did not meet the relevant medical criteria.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="60" /> I trust that the new scheme will eliminate many of the problems that have been encountered with the existing schemes.</P>
    <P>People who are already entitled to a remission or refund of tax under the existing scheme will not have to undergo any further process of medical certification to retain eligibility for the particular form of tax refund they have at present.  It will of course be open to those not considered eligible up to now to apply again under the new scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would support the principle of a budget equalisation system to improve the fiscal base of weaker member states of the EC in the context of economic and monetary union.  The system in Germany, to which the Deputy's question refers, is, however a very complex one which is geared specifically to the administrative structure in existence there and which, I understand, can give rise to protracted legal disputes between the Laender and Federal Government.  That system might not, therefore, be the correct model for the EC assuming a budget equalisation system is agreed for the EC.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 33 and 43 together.</P>
      <P>The Government have decided on allocations totalling £65.809 million for 1989, of which £17.3 million represents a carry-forward of amounts allocated in 1987 and 1988 but not spent.  The table which is being circulated with this reply lists for the Government Departments concerned the broad purposes for which these allocations have been made.  I am arranging at present for the preparation of a statement giving additional detail on these allocations which, when completed, I will lay before the House.  The total amount of lottery funds issued to spending Departments in 1989 to date is £29.688 million.  As Deputies are aware, however, spending Ministers are responsible for the detail of spending on individual projects within their own areas. Questions about the issue of grants, including their geographic distribution, should therefore be addressed to the Ministers concerned.</P>
      <P>Of the funds administered by my Department, and by the Office of Public Works, which is within my area of responsibility, £70,000 has been paid by the National Heritage Council for post-excavation works following the Viking excavations in Waterford City.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions <Col N="65" /> Nos. 36 and 91 together.  The Government Supplies Agency of the Office of Public Works is investigating, on behalf of the Taoiseach's Office, the possibilities of using recycled papers, in the context of normal cost-effective tendering arrangements, in order to reduce the threat to the environment.  The Government Supplies Agency has provided the Department of the Environment with recycled paper for use in its newsletter on a trial basis.  It was found, however, that the recycled paper was over 40 per cent more expensive than the paper ordinarily used.  The question of purchasing further quantities of recycled paper for the requirements of the Department of the Environment, and the general question of continuing and extending this service to other Departments is under consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the National Development Plan, which forms the basis of Ireland's claim for assistance from the EC Structural Funds, support for the development of small businesses will be made available through a series of sectoral operational programmes covering the following sectors: Agriculture and Rural Development; Energy; Human Resources; Education, Training and Employment; Industrial Development; Roads; Sanitary and Local Services; Telecommunications and Postal Services; Tourism; and Access Transport.</P>
      <P>The sectoral operational programmes are primarily the responsibility of the Ministers dealing with the sectors concerned.</P>
      <P>In drawing up the plan and programmes, the Government recognised the importance of encouraging local development initiatives.  Careful consideration was given to the merits of seeking a specific allocation from the EC Structural Funds to support such initiatives. The Government consider however that local development needs can be met most effectively through the sectoral programmes.</P>
      <P>There are already in existence a large number of State agencies such as the IDA, SFADCo, Údarás na Gaeltachta and FÁS which provide a comprehensive range of services to support small business and development initiatives by local community groups.  The increased allocation from the EC Structural Funds will greatly enhance the capacity of these agencies to contribute to local economic development.  In the circumstances, the provision of a further, separate source of funding would not result in the most efficient and effective use of resources.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if his attention has been drawn <Col N="67" /> to the widespread confusion which exists among the general public who are receiving preliminary tax claims, particularly when the amount sought in preliminary tax includes the total payment of PRSI, health contributions and employment and training levies, having regard to the fact that this is causing great distress among smallholders who have no income tax liability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of any widespread confusion among the general public regarding the elements to be included in the payment of preliminary tax.  The Revenue Commissioners mounted extensive campaigns in 1988 and 1989 to explain the nature of preliminary tax and other aspects of selfassessment to self-employed taxpayers and placed advertisements in the media to coincide with the due dates for the payment of preliminary tax in those years.  The Revenue Commissioners have informed me that the general feedback from the tax districts is that their efforts in this area have been largely successful and that there is no widespread confusion regarding the elements to be included in the payment of preliminary tax.</P>
      <P>Smallholders whose income is below the exemption limits for income tax are excluded from the system and are not issued with notices of preliminary tax. The exemption limits are £3,000 for widowed or single people and £6,000 for married persons with increased exemption limits for those over 65 and 75 years of age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Smallholders whose income is in excess of the exemption limit must make returns even though they may not have a liability to tax when allowances are deducted. Such persons are also liable to pay PRSI, health contributions and the employment and training levy.  Notices of preliminary tax, therefore, issue in such cases.  The Revenue Commissioners are not aware of any widespread distress among smallholders.  Special arrangements have been made to assist smallholders accounting for tax in that the Revenue <Col N="68" /> Commissioners will accept a farm profile form in place of returns and accounts. Any smallholder who has any queries in relation to the system is welcome to call to his local tax office to discuss the matter.</P>

      <P>The proximate cause was the US stock market crisis arising from the inability by management of certain companies to complete the buy-out of those companies by so-called &ldquo;junk&rdquo; bonds (high cost bonds).  The lead banks failed to raise the money they had hoped to get from Japanese banks.  As a consequence, shares of companies caught up in take-over activity first, and later virtually all shares dropped in price on Wall Street. The Dow Jones industrial average fell late on 13 October by 190 points.  This fall so adversely affected investor confidence that share prices on stock markets throughout the world fell back also. Nevertheless, share prices on the Irish Stock Exchange generally recovered within a day or two.</P>

      <P>To date in 1989 a sum of £4.403 million has been allocated to the Department of the Taoiseach, from the proceeds of the national lottery, for arts and culture projects.  The details are given in Appendix I.  As I indicated to the House on 29 November last, future lottery allocations for voluntary arts bodies will be distributed by the Arts Council.</P>
      <P>A sum of £2.634 million has been approved to date in the current year by Roinn na Gaeltachta for Bord na Gaeilge and certain Irish language organisations throughout the country.  The details are in Appendix II.</P>
      <P>The question of the availability of additional lottery funds in 1989 and their allocation is at present under consideration.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions No. 63 and 64 together.</P>
      <P>Dublin Corporation was put into possession of the site in question by virtue of a caretaker's agreement executed by the corporation on 14 July 1988.</P>
      <P>The State's title to the property is a fee farm grant which is a freehold title comparable to fee simple except that an annual rent is payable.  The property is vested in the Minister for Finance and the Office of Public Works has been endeavouring for some time to acquire the fee simple.  As it is not possible to say when the process of acquiring the fee simple will be completed, my Department proposed, on the advice of the Chief State Solicitor, to transfer the property to the corporation on the basis of the existing title.  The eventual acquisition of the fee simple would, of course, accrue to the benefit of the corporation.  The corporation were prepared to accept this proposal prior to the execution of the caretaker's agreement.  However, they have now indicated that they do not intend to complete the legal formalities for the transfer of the property until the fee simple interest has been acquired.  In view of this indication, I am having the sale of the property to the corporation re-considered in my Department.</P>

Of this amount £17.5 million relates to involvement in the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) since May 1978.  The remaining shortfall of £0.7 million arises out of participation in the United Nations Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP), which commenced in April 1964.</P>

      <P>While at the United Nations last month, I raised the matter with the Foreign Ministers of Iran, Syria and Algeria as well as with the Secretary-General of the United Nations and the representative of the Palestine Liberation Organisation. I also discussed the subject of Mr. Keenan with the US Deputy Secretary of State when I was in Washington. I briefed them all and sought their assistance in obtaining information regarding Mr. Keenan's whereabouts and well being and in securing his release.  All assured me of their goodwill in the matter and promised to make inquiries.  I am awaiting the results of these inquiries.  I should add that, in my statement to the General Assembly of the United Nations, I made an appeal to Mr. Keenan's captors, calling for his release.</P>
      <P>Earlier this month our Ambassador to the Lebanon, acting on my instructions, visited Beirut.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners have advised me that the provisions of section 3 of the Finance Act, 1983, apply to payments under maintenance arrangements made on or after 8 June 1983. Under such an arrangement a husband pays maintenance to his wife in full without deduction of tax.  He is allowed a deduction for this amount in computing his total income for tax purposes so that in effect the maintenance payments are no longer his income for tax purposes. The corollary of this is that they become the wife's income for tax purposes and the tax allowances of the wife may be set against them.</P>
      <P>The maintenance arrangement in the taxpayer's case comes within the terms of section 3 and accordingly she is properly chargeable to tax in respect of such maintenance payments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance the present position regarding the tax-free allowance of a person (details supplied) in County Cork; and the reason this person had to pay tax of £1,900 on his lump sum redundancy payment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners have advised me that no tax was deducted from the taxpayer's lump sum redundancy payment.  The £1,900 referred to was deducted by his employer in respect of contributions to the widows and orphans scheme.  He is entitled to a tax deduction in respect of these contributions over a five year period.</P>
      <P>The taxpayer's wife died on 24 August 1983.  He remarried in January 1989 but was separated from his wife on 17 April 1989.  As he did not notify the tax office of his first wife's death he continued to receive the married personal allowance to which he was not entitled for the period from August 1983 to January 1989.  His entitlement to the married allowance again ceased in April 1989 but he continued to have the benefit of this allowance until September 1989 when his tax-free allowances were amended.  When account is taken of the extra tax-free allowance due in respect of the contributions to the widows and orphans scheme the net effect of the granting of allowances to which the taxpayer was not entitled is an undercharge of £1,845.18 to April 1989.  Further undercharges will arise on review of the taxpayer's position for the current year.</P>
      <P>In view of the taxpayer's circumstances it has been decided not to collect the undercharges at present.  For this reason a revised tax-free allowance certificate on a non-cumulative basis issued to the taxpayer on 4 September 1989.  This certificate gives the taxpayer the benefit of a personal allowance of £2,050 and the PAYE allowance of £800 i.e. the only allowances to which the taxpayer is now entitled.</P>

Shortly after the Department of Forestry (now Coillte Teo.) acquired the site in 1958 they agreed on a planting scheme with the Commissioners to avoid interference with the archaeological remains.  It is the general policy of the Commissioners to preserve such sites intact for future generations. An archaeological excavation would only be considered if it were proposed as a research project under the auspices of the Royal Irish Academy. Thus they do not propose to initiate discussions on controlled exploration at Mooghaun in 1990.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 109 and 121 together.</P>
      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the fishing fleet.  The process of re-registering the Irish fishing fleet in order to establish the precise capacity of the fleet is progressing satisfactorily.  I expect this exercise to be completed within the next two months.  At this stage, on the basis of work carried out to date, it would not be prudent to attempt to anticipate what the final capacity might be.  My Department are continuing their ongoing discussions with the Commission on this matter.  Completion of these discussions and the making of any adjustments in EC requirements for the fleet are partly contingent on the results of the re-registration exercise.</P>

      <P>The overall total allowable catch and consequently Ireland's quota for sole is expected to be fixed at the December meeting of the Council of Fisheries Ministers. I would, of course be willing to take account of any representations made by the Howth Fishermen's Association or any other fishermen's body.  In this regard, I suggest that the association write to me or to my Department.</P>
      <P>The management plan for this fishery for next year has not, as yet, been finalised but I would envisage that a by-catch for all Irish fishermen fishing in the Irish Sea would be part of such a plan.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 115, 117 and 118 together.</P>
      <P>I should like to point out that a major package of incentives designed to promote investment in the expansion and renewal of the Irish merchant fleet was introduced in 1987.</P>
      <P>The Shipping Investment Grants Act, 1987, provided that grants of up to 25 per cent may be made to Irish shipowners towards capital expenditure incurred in the purchase of new or second hand vessels of less than seven years old.  The response of the industry to the package has been generally positive.  To date grant-aid of £2.06 million has been paid in respect of the purchase of four new ships of 1,750 DWT (deadweight tonnes) each.  In addition grant-aid of up to £1.1 million has been committed towards the purchase of two refrigerated (&ldquo;reefer&rdquo;) vessels &mdash; the first such vessels to form part of the Irish registered fleet.</P>
      <P>Additionally, a number of fiscal incentives have been introduced under the 1987 Finance Act.  These include a reduction in the level of corporation profit tax payable by Irish shipping companies from 50 per cent to 10 per cent in recognition of the importance of shipping to the economy.  Shipping companies, moreover, are now eligible to avail of the investment potential of the Business Expansion Scheme (BES).  Two vessels have recently been acquired with BES funding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The National Development Corporation (NADCORP), in addition, can now invest in shipping projects provided <Col N="116" /> they are likely to be viable and yield a satisfactory return.  Furthermore, the Industrial Development Authority may also assist shipping related service projects (e.g. ship management-consultancy services).</P>
    <P>These measures are an indication of the importance which the Government attaches to the Irish shipping industry in the context of the challenges which it is likely to face with the imminent completion of the single market.</P>
    <P>The numbers employed in the Irish merchant fleet follow.  Figures are available in respect of the years 1980-87 only, while that in relation to 1987 is an estimate:</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Marine the reason Irish fishing vessels, if arrested, are required to enter into a bond before they are released; his views on whether such Irish vessels will leave the jurisdiction prior to a court hearing; whether this bonding is a further penalty on Irish fishermen; and the basis on which this bonding is justified by his Department.</P>

      <P>Section 235 (inserted by section 14 of the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1978) of the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act, 1959, provides that, where a District Justice is sending a skipper for trial at a later date, he may, at his discretion, release a vessel from detention if sufficient security is <Col N="118" /> lodged to cover: possible fines; possible costs; and possible value of forfeitures which may be imposed if the skipper is found guilty.  The bonding procedure does not relate to whether a vessel might or not leave the jurisdiction.  The rationale for this procedure is that it allows, at the discretion of the Courts, fishermen accused of offences to redeem their catch and gear and resume fishing pending the outcome of Court proceedings rather than being detained during that period. This process is, therefore, in the interests of the fishermen.</P>

      <P>My Department are unable to trace any application for grants under the 1989 cattle and equines headage or the EC special beef premium, calf premium or suckler cow schemes from the person named.  It is too late for him to apply now under the first three schemes mentioned as the closing date for them fell in July 1989 but he may, however, apply under the EC suckler cow premium scheme as applications under that scheme may be accepted up until 31 January 1990.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 128 and 132 together.</P>
      <P>There have been no serious delays this year relative to previous years in processing sheep headage and ewe premium applications to the payment stage.  Sheep headage payments which commenced in 1988 on 21 October and this year on 23 October, are on schedule while ewe premium payments totalling 44,781 have been made so far compared to 41,429 at the same time last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In County Wexford 2,484 premium payments have been made to date and this number is almost identical to the 2,490 payments at the same time last <Col N="125" /> year.  The remaining 300 cases in that county will be paid as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Food in relation to ewe subsidy payments if he will issue a clear directive regarding the maximum and minimum numbers which an eligible farmer can have at the inspection stage relative to the numbers applied for; and if he will simplify the application forms next year for this scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy) Michael O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The EC Regulations governing the ewe premium schemes provide that the minimum number of ewes on which the premium may be claimed is ten.  There is no upper limit under existing arrangements.  However, the premium from the 1990 marketing year will be payable at 50 per cent of the full amount for ewes in excess of 1,000 in disadvantaged areas and 500 in lowland areas.</P>
      <P>Each applicant has to undertake to keep on his holding for 100 days from the closing date for receiving applications the number of eligible ewes on which he is claiming the premium.  The EC Regulations also provide that any shortfall between the number of ewes applied for and the number presented at inspection that does not occur as a result of force majeure or natural circumstances relating to the life of the flock will result in the loss of premium on all ewes.</P>
      <P>The application form for this scheme is reviewed each year and the Deputy's request for simplification will be considered in the context of that review.</P>

      <P>Applicants for sheep support payments in County Mayo will qualify for payment provided the relevant terms and conditions, including dipping within the period mentioned, are met.</P>

    <P>The report deals individually with each proposal in the agriculture and food sector relating to the completion of the internal market setting out, among other things, the aim of the measure, main provisions and current position.  One proposal has been adopted since compilation <Col N="128" /> of the progress report i.e. Item A 2/12 &mdash; (`Council Directive on animal health conditions governing intra-community trade in and importation from third countries of embryos of domestic animals of the bovine species').</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that the Employment Regulation Order (ERO) made by the Hotels Joint Labour Committee under the Industrial Relations Act, 1946, fixes statutory minimum rates of pay and regulates statutory conditions of employment of workers employed in hotels anywhere throughout the State, except the county boroughs of Dublin and Cork and the borough of Dún Laoghaire.  In the areas not covered by the ERO, pay levels are determined by collective bargaining.</P>
      <P>Routine inspections are carried out by inspectors of my Department to ensure that the terms of the ERO are being observed by employers.  Any corrective action considered necessary to ensure compliance with the terms of the ERO is taken in cases where breaches are discovered. Where under-payments are discovered arrears of wages due to employees are collected.</P>
      <P>During 1988, 379 inspections were carried out in hotels which resulted in the collection of arrears of £21,707.10.  The corresponding figures for the first eight months of 1989 are 341 inspections and £9,205.06 collected in arrears of wages.</P>
      <P>My attention has not been drawn to any widespread abuse by employers in the hotel trade.  However, as is normal in most industries covered by EROs, my Department have received complaints in individual cases.  These cases are followed up and, where necessary, referred for consideration as to the institution of legal proceedings.</P>

      <P>The ESB has installed hydro-electric capacity of 512 MW (including 292 MW pumped storage) which represents 13 per cent of total installed capacity.  They estimate that this represents 73 per cent of total technically feasible hydro capacity.  The best sites are already developed and prospects for the development of the remaining 27 per cent depend on changing economic criteria and environmental consideration.  A survey carried out on <Col N="149" /> behalf of the Department of Energy and published in 1985 identified over 500 sites technically capable of generating hydro electricity.  Under the EC Valoren programme, the ESB planned to develop a number of small scale hydro plants. Representations by persons and organisations concerned with environmental issues and refusal of planning permission has prevented some of these being developed but one plant in west Cork is under construction.  The ESB are now looking at alternative sites.</P>
      <P>A small number of private sector hydro plants also generate electricity for sale to the ESB and proposals for similar new projects arise from time to time.  The ESB provide a free preliminary evaluation and advisory service to private site owners and operate a special tariff for purchases of hydro electricity.  The cost of purchasing hydro electricity is higher than the cost of generating additional supplies from existing ESB plant fuelled by coal, gas or oil.</P>
      <P>The ex-works cost per unit of ESB electricity by fuel source in 1988 was hydro (excluding pumped storage) 0.78p, coal 1.97p, gas and oil 2.34p and peat 4.22p.  The purchase price of bought in hydro was 2.9p.</P>

      <P>Since the beginning of 1987, 29 prospecting licences in County Mayo have been granted to seven exploration companies as detailed hereunder.</P>
      <P>Because of the considerable number of townlands involved and the extent of the staff resources required for the task, it would not be practicable in this reply to furnish the Deputy with a list of the townlands in each licence area.  However, the press advertisements inserted prior to the grant of the licences included a list of the townlands in question in each instance and I have arranged for the forwarding of copies of those advertisements to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The prospecting licences have been issued for the generality of minerals except in the case of three licences where, as indicated, certain minerals have been excluded.</P>

      <P>Bord Gáis Éireann is a State body which is statutorily charged with developing and maintaining a system for the supply of natural gas on a commercial basis.  Any proposal for the extension of the natural gas grid would, therefore, have to be assessed in this light by the board.</P>
      <P>It is the board's policy at present to target new housing developments and areas which are already served by gas mains and which have potential for significant extra gas sales.  The capital cost of extending the gas grid to areas which are not already served by gas mains but which are already built up is extremely high.  It is not my intention to require Bord Gáis Éireann to supply any new areas which it does not consider it economic to supply.</P>
      <P>The Government are currently assessing environmental matters in the Dublin area and the role of natural gas in combating the problems which exist.  All aspects including environmental and commercial considerations will be addressed in this assessment.</P>

      <P>Applications for State mining leases in County Kilkenny have been received in respect of coal reserves at four locations &mdash; Crutt, Croghtenclogh, Aghamucky/ Coolbawn and Gorteen.  In County Laois a proposal for the development of coal reserves at Turra/Drumagh and an application for mining lease at Slatt Upper are also under consideration.</P>
      <P>Whilst a number of these potential developments are at an advanced stage of consideration it is not possible at this juncture to say when mining operations will commence at any of the locations.</P>

      <P>PRSI contributions in respect of self-employed persons are payable on income (subject to certain exceptions and deductions) from all sources as estimated in accordance with the provisions of the Income Tax Acts provided the income is in excess of £2,500 a year.  PRSI contributions establish a personal entitlement to contributory old age, and widows' and orphans' pensions.</P>
      <P>The person concerned is in receipt of maintenance payments from her husband. These payments are reckonable for PRSI contributions.  To exempt them from liability for contributions would involve excluding many persons in this situation from needed social insurance cover and possible entitlement to social insurance pensions.</P>

      <P>In the case of widows, deserted wives, prisoners' wives and unmarried mothers, who are receiving a social welfare pension or allowance, increases are awarded in respect of children up to the age of 21 years provided that they are in full time education at either second or third level.  This arrangement also applies to widows who are claiming invalidity, retirement or old age contributory pension and to the new social assistance schemes for widowers and deserted husbands with dependent children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Up to this year, increases in other social welfare payments were generally payable in respect of child dependants up to the age of 18 years only.  However, <Col N="158" /> from September this year I extended child dependant increases for long-term recipients to children aged up to 19 years where they continue in full-time education. This represents a first step towards extending child dependant increases in all such cases to age 21 where the child is in full-time education.</P>
    <P>Child benefit in all cases is paid in respect of a child aged less than 16 years or aged between 16 and 18 where the child is in full-time education.</P>

These funds have been allocated to 100 organisations throughout the country.  In six cases payment of the grant has not yet been made pending compliance with certain formalities.</P>
      <P>In addition an allocation of £50,000 was made available from national lottery funds for a special pilot scheme of assistance to voluntary organisations providing opportunities for unemployed people to become involved in their activities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if his attention has been drawn to the system operating in his Department in assessing applicants for old age non-contributory pensions, whereby interest on money invested is assessed at 10 per cent when in fact with the deduction of the DIRT tax it would not realise half of that amount; and if he will consider disregarding a sum not exceeding £5,000 which would act as an encouragement to old people to invest their money rather than keep it at home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>Applicants for old age pension who have capital are assessed with a notional income from that capital.  Under the formula for assessing income from capital which is set out in the legislation the first £200 of capital is disregarded, the next £375 is assessed at 5 per cent and the balance is assessed at 10 per cent.</P>
      <P>The pension paid to an applicant depends on the total amount of his means.  However the first £6 of a person's weekly means are disregarded.  This means that an old age pension couple with no other means can have capital of up to £5,975 and still qualify for the maximum rate of old age pension.  A couple can have joint capital of £55,895 and still qualify for the minimum pension. The equivalent amounts for a single old age pensioner are £2,987.50 and £27,947.50.  My Department have a special leaflet available which advises pensioners as to the amount of pensions which they can have and still qualify for pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision of a £5,000 disregard of capital for pensioners in addition to the existing disregards would have major <Col N="165" /> financial implications.  Any such changes would have to be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if a person (details supplied) in Dublin 3 can change from a pension from her husband's employer to an old age non-contributory pension, as financially there is little difference in the amounts paid, but this person is losing out on the State living alone allowance, free electricity allowance and free telephone allowance because she is not in receipt of a social welfare pension; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">

      <P>The person concerned applied for old age non-contributory pension in March 1989.  The claim was unsuccessful as the person's weekly means, derived from a pension from her late husband's employer, exceeded the statutory limit.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act, 1981, a person may not deprive herself of pay, income or property in order to qualify for old age non-contributory pension.  If it appears that a person has deprived herself of income or property in order to qualify for pension, the yearly value of that means or property is still taken to be part of the means of that person for the purposes of determining entitlement to old age non-contributory pension.</P>

      <P>The person concerned is in receipt of unemployment assistance at the maximum short term rate of £78.90 which includes an increase in receipt of a qualified adult dependant and one child dependant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>EC Regulations on social security provide for the transfer of unemployment benefit between member states in the <Col N="170" /> case of an unemployed person who moves to another member state to look for work.  The regulations do not provide for a transfer in relation to an unemployment assistance payment.  Prior to claiming unemployment assistance, the person concerned was residing in England where he was in receipt of income support which is an assistance payment and accordingly the provisions of the EC Regulations on social security do not apply to him.</P>
    <P>The legislative basis for the payment of the long term rate of unemployment assistance is contained in the Social Welfare (Variation of Rates of Unemployment Assistance) Regulations, 1983, Statutory Instrument No. 268 of 1983.</P>
    <P>These regulations specifically provide that the long term rate of unemployment assistance is payable in respect of a person who in any one continuous period of unemployment has been in receipt of unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance for at least 390 days, that is, 15 months.  The person concerned has been in receipt of unemployment assistance for less than 15 months and accordingly is only entitled to receive payment at the short term rate.</P>

    <P>She stated that she was unemployed during the period February 1988 to October 1988 and requested permission to sign retrospectively the unemployed register for the purpose of obtaining credited contributions for this period.

      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit from 18 July 1989.</P>
      <P>According to the records of my Department the person concerned has no contributions paid or credited during the period from 1959 to 1974, and has not had 26 contributions paid since then.  She is, therefore, not entitled to disability benefit or the award of credited contributions on her claim to disability benefit.</P>
      <P>She has indicated, however, that she was employed in Great Britain during this period and her insurance record has been requested from the British authorities. When this information comes to hand her entitlement to disability benefit will be reviewed.</P>

      <P>The person concerned is currently in receipt of a widow's non-contributory pension at the rate of £13 a week. This is the rate of pension payable to a widow under 66 years who has no qualified children and whose weekly means exceed £40 but do not exceed £42.  Her means, derived from a farm holding and capital, have been assessed at £40.52 per week, effective from 16 September 1988.</P>
      <P>If the claimant feels that her means have decreased since the last investigation, she should advise my Department to this effect and her case will be re-investigated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The person concerned is in receipt of disablement benefit under the occupational injuries scheme since 6 January 1989 in respect of an accident at work.</P>
      <P>He was first examined by a medical referee on 2 February 1989 and was found to be suffering from the effects of the accident and also from a relevant condition so that he was assessed at 100 per cent disabled pending stabilization of his condition.  Disablement benefit was paid accordingly in respect of the period to 1 June 1989.</P>
      <P>Following a medical referee review on 17 May which revealed his condition had stabilised in the meantime, his disablement was reassessed at 10 per cent and he was awarded disablement benefit accordingly from 2 June to 1 September 1989.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He appealed against the decision and his case was referred to an appeals officer for determination who requested a further examination by a different medical referee.  The further examination was carried out on 28 August when the <Col N="178" /> second medical referee also assessed the disablement at 10 per cent.</P>
    <P>The appeals officer proposes to hold an oral hearing of the case as soon as possible which is expected will be about the middle of next month.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he has any proposals to amend the 1965 regulations in relation to criminal free legal aid to impose a quota on the amount of earnings by any one solicitor under the scheme in any one year; and if his attention has been drawn to the fact that a number of solicitors are complaining that the scheme is being monopolised by a relatively small number of solicitors to the detriment of others who are seeking work under this scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke) Raphael P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The earnings of individual lawyers under the criminal legal aid scheme are determined by the number of cases to which they are assigned by the courts.  In deciding to assign solicitors to cases the courts are required, under the present regulations, to take account of the preference expressed by an accused person for a particular solicitor.  I would be reluctant to make a change that would deprive a defendant of the solicitor of his choice, without a good reason.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the bulk of legal aid cases in the Dublin courts are handled by a small group of solicitors due, I understand, to the increased tendency for legal aid applicants to nominate particular solicitors. I have not received any complaints from individual solicitors, or from any representative body on their behalf, about the way in which assignments are made to cases under the scheme.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East)</i> asked the Minister for Justice when the vacancy for Garda sergeant at Hospital, County Limerick will be filled; if he will give a commitment that at least two gardaí will be maintained in Hospital in <Col N="179" /> the foreseeable future; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke) Raphael P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The detailed allocation of manpower to individual stations is a matter for the Garda authorities who inform me that they are not in a position at present to assign a sergeant to Hospital station, but that the policing needs of the sub-district served by the station are being adequately met at present and are being kept under review. The service provided by the two gardaí assigned to the station is supplemented as necessary by mobile units operating from the district headquarters at Bruff and the divisional headquarters at Henry Street, Limerick.  The Garda authorities have no plans at present to alter the existing strength of two gardaí at Hospital.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East)</i> asked the Minister for Justice the arrangements he intends to make as a result of the introduction of rural policing in County Limerick; the number of <Col N="180" /> garda at each rank in the Limerick division and the stations to which they are attached; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke) Raphael P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it the Deputy is referring to the rural policing scheme which is in operation in the Claremorris, County Mayo and Thomastown, County Kilkenny Garda districts.  This scheme has not been extended to County Limerick and there are no proposals at present to do so.</P>
      <P>The following table gives details of Garda strength on 30 September 1989 at each station in Limerick Garda Division. It should be borne in mind that the precise allocation of manpower to individual stations varies from time to time in the light of changing needs and circumstances.</P>
      <P>The strengths assigned to Henry Street, which is the divisional headquarters for the Limerick division as well as being a district headquarters, and to Roxboro Road, Askeaton, Bruff and Newcastle West, which are also district headquarters stations, include specialist staff and units which provide a service on a divisional/district basis.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke) Raphael P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>As there is no control on entry to the State from Great Britain and Northern Ireland and as an illegal alien includes, by definition, a person who has failed to bring himself to notice as required by the aliens law, it follows that it is not practicable to obtain reliable information relating to the number of such persons in the State at any time.  In reply to a similar question in November 1988 it was mentioned that the Garda estimated that there could be 5,000 illegal aliens in the State.  That is still the best estimate that I have.</P>
      <P>The records of my Department are not kept in a way that would enable me readily to provide the information sought, under a number of headings, of the position which obtained at 30 September 1989.  The examination of records that would be required to compile the information would involve a commitment of staff resources which could not be justified in present circumstances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are 705 Garda stations in the State. Overall Garda strength as of 30 September 1989 was 10,518, of whom 3,774 were assigned to in the Dublin Metropolitan Area.</P>
      <P>Decisions in regard to the number of gardaí to be allocated to the Dublin Metropolitan Area are, as in the case of any other area, based upon a professional assessment by the Garda authorities of the relative policing needs of all areas throughout the State.  Garda personnel deployment strategies are constantly reviewed to ensure that resources are assigned to where they are most needed at any given time.</P>
      <P>I fully appreciate the need to keep Garda strength in the Dublin Metropolitan Area at a level at which it can effectively cope with the particular policing problems there.  The Garda Commissioner is aware of my concern in this regard.

      <P>I received a letter on 11 October from the Clonburris combined residents' group expressing concern about Garda manpower levels at Clondalkin station in the light of an increase in vandalism and crime in the area.  As the policing arrangements for individual stations are a matter for the Garda authorities I <Col N="191" /> referred the group's letter to them for consideration.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities inform me that, having regard to overall resources and the many other demands on Garda services in the Dublin Metropolitan Area, the current Garda strength of 53 at Clondalkin station is the maximum that can be provided there at present.  I am assured, however, that the strength of the station is being kept under continuing review by Garda management to take account of any changing needs and circumstances.</P>
      <P>I am also informed by the Garda authorities that there has been no appreciable increase in crime levels in the Clondalkin area in the current year.  In fact provisional figures for indictable crime reported in the Clondalkin Garda subdistrict in the first eight months of this year actually show a slight decrease on the figures for the corresponding period last year.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the property referred to in the question consists of two firearms &mdash; a rifle and a shotgun &mdash; an ammunition belt and ammunition, a large knife and a scabbard. The shotgun and the knife were used by their owner in the hijacking of a taxi on 25 May 1985 and the shotgun was discharged in the course of that incident. Following the arrest of the owner, the above-mentioned weapons were seized by the Garda.  He subsequently pleaded guilty to five separate counts in relation to this incident &mdash; hijacking of a motor car, possession of a shotgun with intent <Col N="192" /> to endanger life, false imprisonment of the taxi driver, possession of a shotgun for an unlawful purpose and malicious damage to a motor car.</P>
      <P>He has since been notified by the Garda authorities, pursuant to section 6 of the Firearms Act, 1925, as substituted by section 8 of the Firearms Act, 1964, that he is not considered a fit and proper person to hold a firearms certificate and that he must therefore arrange for the lawful disposal of the firearms.  If he does not do so within the prescribed period they may be sold or destroyed by the Garda.  In the meantime, as required by the legislation, custody of the firearms in question is being retained by the Garda. A sum of money which had been received by the Garda from the person concerned in respect of fees for firearms certificates for which he applied, has been returned to him.</P>
      <P>An application has been made by the Garda to the District Court for the disposal of the other items mentioned above under the Police (Property) Act, 1897.</P>

      <P>By virtue of section 7 (3) of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1982, and section 23 (1) of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1983, I am precluded from exercising any power or control in relation to any particular case with which a planning authority or An Bord Pleanála is or may be concerned.  Accordingly, neither myself nor my Department made any representations to members or officials of the planning authority or An Bord Pleanála.</P>
      <P>In view of the afore-mentioned legal provisions, it would be inappropriate for me to comment on the board's decision in the case and, in any event, I understand that the matter is <i>sub judice.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a matter for the board, in accordance with the provisions of the Planning Acts, to take all necessary steps to discharge their statutory duties and functions under the Acts, including where the board consider it appropriate, the <Col N="214" /> employment of consultants, experts or advisers in individual cases.</P>
    <P>The primary function of the board is to determine planning appeals and in so doing, to take all relevant factors into consideration.  As the decision-making body, it is a matter for the board to determine to what extent the inspector's report is adopted, whether wholly, in part, modified by conditions etc., in reaching their decision on an appeal. Since the inspector's report is only a part of the decision-making process, it is not the practice that such reports be made available to the public.</P>
    <P>In all cases An Bord Pleanála must include the reasons for their decision, including the reasons for any conditions attached to an appeal.</P>

Since it is the responsibility of the planning authority to enforce the terms of a planning permission, I would not be notified by a planning authority of progress or action <Col N="215" /> by them in relation to any particular housing estate.  However, from inquiries made, I understand that the planning authority are continuing their efforts in relation to the estate referred to in the question.</P>

      <P>There has been no significant delay in the planning of the hospital.  Some delays are inevitable because of the complex nature of the development and the high degree of consultation required.  Unlike many other building projects, a hospital is a highly complex fusion of specialised departments.  If the planning of those departments is not completed in a thorough manner or if their relationships to one another are not satisfactorily resolved at the design stage, problems will arise when the hospital is commissioned. These can seriously affect the efficient operation of the hospital.  Any dates given for the commencement of construction of a major hospital are, of necessity, targets until the planning and design stages are complete.  As this work progresses it is possible to be more accurate about dates for the commencement of construction.  For these reasons I do not accept that there has been any deferral of the starting date and I regard the Tallaght Hospital project as being on target.</P>

The Department of Health quickly made alternative arrangements with another supplier of the vaccine, who has supplied a total of 40,000 doses since August 1989 and is making arrangements to supply a further 20,000 doses shortly. This supplier has also a further 30,000 doses available, if required.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions 307 and 308 together.</P>
      <P>The number of Fit Person Orders granted to the Eastern Health Board in recent years is as follows:&mdash; 1985, 51; 1986, 112; 1987, 96; 1988, 81.</P>
      <P>Details in respect of 1989 are not yet available.</P>
      <P>During the period in question, one case was challenged by the parents to the Supreme Court and, as a result, three children were returned home.  Apart from this case, there were no successful challenges against Fit Person Orders granted to the Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Information on the number of applications for Orders made by the Board and a breakdown between sexual and other forms of abuse is not available and could not be obtained without a detailed search through hundreds of files maintained by social workers in the ten community care areas of the board.  In view of the severe pressure of work on social workers in these areas, this could not be justified as it would serve only to divert them from <Col N="248" /> more urgent work, in particular the ongoing investigation and management of child abuse cases.</P>
    <P>In dealing with alleged cases of child abuse, whether physical, sexual or otherwise, the Eastern Health Board, in common with the other health boards, acts in accordance with the standard guidelines issued by my Department on the investigation and management of child abuse.  I am arranging to have a copy of the guidelines sent to the Deputy. In addition, the board has available to it professional advice of medical and social work personnel and of its legal advisers.</P>
    <P>In the light of a judgment of the Supreme Court in July, 1989 in a case involving the Midland Health Board The State (D) v Groarke and Ors, all of the health boards have been advised to review their procedures for dealing with cases of alleged child abuse.  I understand that the Eastern Health Board is in consultation with its legal advisers and that there are likely to be some changes in the manner in which evidence is prepared and presented in future court proceedings.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon) Rory O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the judgment referred to by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the benefit of the House, I might explain briefly that the judgment arose out of a case in which a child was placed in the care of the Midland Health Board under a Fit Person Order made by the District Court following allegations that <Col N="249" /> she had been sexually abused by her father.</P>
    <P>The parents took <i>habeas corpus</i> proceedings and in the Supreme Court it was held that the Fit Person Order was not safe because the pre-trial procedures and the trial itself had not been carried out in accordance with the required standards of natural justice.  In particular, it was held that the District Court should have seen a video recording which had been made of an interview with the child and should have been given a demonstration of the use of anatomical dolls and an expert interpretation of the way they had been used by the child.  In addition, the court held that the solicitor acting on behalf of the parents should have had in good time before the trial reports or summaries of the evidence to be given and an opportunity for him and for any medical witnesses he proposed to call to see the video recording.</P>
    <P>I should emphasise that the judgment has terminated the operation of the Fit Person Order in this case only.  It is not possible to say how many other Fit Person Orders, if any, might be similarly affected unless and until the Orders are appealed or otherwise challenged through the courts.  I would have to say, however, that I do not accept suggestions that there is likely to be a flood of such cases.</P>
    <P>In view of the implications of the judgment for other cases involving sexual abuse and for the conduct of child care proceedings generally, copies of the judgment have been circulated to each health board and the boards have been requested to consider, in consultation with their legal advisers, the need for changes in the way such proceedings are handled in the future.</P>

      <P>The staffing of national schools is determined by the enrolment in the schools on 30 September of the previous year.  This is in accordance with the agreement reached between the Government and the INTO under the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>.  In the case of Scoil Mhichil Naofa there were 631 pupils enrolled on 30 September 1988 which warrants a staff of principal plus 18 assistants for the 1989-90 school year. The school also has the services of two remedial teachers, one special assistant and one special assistant for itinerant classes.</P>
      <P>The enrolment and staffing position in Scoil Mhichil Naofa, Athy, has been examined recently and the pupil-teacher ratio in the school is comparable with many national schools.  My Department are satisfied that the guidelines on maximum class sizes have not been breached.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East)</i> asked the Minister for Education if her attention has been drawn to the admission procedure to CoACT courses which <Col N="273" /> discriminates against students who have spent some time in third level education, in that such persons will not be considered for entry on the first or second round of offers even when they were not in receipt of European Social Fund payments; that this inhibits students from transferring from other third level colleges to CoACT and from transferring from one CoACT course to another; and if she will make a statement on that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke) Mary O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The City of Limerick VEC is the statutory body entrusted with the management of Limerick CoACT including matters relating to admission procedures. I have made inquiries in the matter, however, and I understand from the VEC that the college procedure, which is printed on the application from, states that &ldquo;preference is given to students who have not had previous third level education&rdquo;. The admissions office gives such preference by confining the first and second round offers to those who have not had previous third level education. The view is that those who have never had a third level education opportunity previously should have a level of preferential treatment over those who have.</P>
      <P>The issue of European Social Funding is not relevant to the above consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This question of the preferential treatment of persons without previous third level education does not, in fact, inhibit students transferring from other third level colleges to CoACT.  In this connection I believe that CoACT has one of the highest levels of transfers into its courses from other third level colleges.  It does, however, give some level of preferential treatment to students who have not had previous third level education as against those who have had previous third level education and who failed or abandoned their course or decided to change from their original course choice.  Transferring into a course in CoACT would normally be done after the student had completed a significant period of study on a similar course in another college and could <Col N="274" /> satisfy the admissions office that he/she had reached a standard equivalent to the appropriate course entry point in CoACT.  A person who had completed a part of a course in CoACT or another college and who sought to gain admission to the first year of a different course would not be considered a transfer but would be considered as an application for a first year place from someone who had previous third level education.</P>
    <P>I understand that there is also an Admissions Appeals Board which look at cases where the student feels that he or she can produce evidence or other material worthy of consideration in their personal case, i.e. certificate of serious illness.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education if her attention has been drawn to the fact that research carried out in Austria (details supplied) indicates that 10 per cent of primary school children do not master reading and writing by the end of primary education and are sometimes incorrectly labelled as dyslexic and that three factors were responsible for this, namely lack of ability, problems at home and poor teaching; if similar research has been carried out in Ireland; if so, the results therefrom; and, if not, the reason such research has not been carried out here.</P>

      <P>The results of the Austrian research quoted by the Deputy which indicate that up to 10 per cent of primary school children fail adequately to master reading and writing skills before the end of first level are in line with indicators here and elsewhere.  The causes of reading failure are complex and include the factors mentioned in the study quoted. However, it has not been possible in any known studies here to quantify precisely the contribution of any one factor or group of factors.  Dyslexia or perceptual difficulties alone appear to be significant causes only in a very small minority of cases.</P>
      <P>Research has shown, here and elsewhere, that good well-structured developmental programmes in all aspects of language learning are the best means of reducing the prevalence of reading failure. In that connection the publishers are at present revising reading schemes with advice from my Department.  Undoubtedly the Review Body on the Primary School Curriculum will make recommendations in the area which I will study carefully.</P>

I am sure this committee will bear the position in other countries in mind in their deliberations.</P>
